    "Cannabis cultivation is gaining prominence globally, and Sri Lanka has the potential to become a leader in this industry, State Minister of Tourism Diana Gamage said.",
    "She said there are 22 varieties of cannabis in Sri Lanka and numerous numbers of medicinal products that can be derived from hemp, presenting a significant opportunity for Sri Lanka to capitalize on its cultivation and exports.",
    "The Minister said this during a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today under the theme 'Collective Path to a Stable Country.'",
    "\u201cIt is essential to clarify that when discussing the cultivation of hemp (Cannabis), the focus is not on its use as an intoxicant. Cannabis, indeed, is classified as a drug, but it also has significant potential for medical and industrial purposes.",
    "\"There are lucrative investment prospects in producing medicines from hemp, which can yield substantial economic benefits for the country. A ten-acre hemp plantation alone has the potential to generate around US$ 200 million,\u201d she said.",
    "She said by promoting responsible and informed discussions about cannabis, focusing on its various uses beyond intoxication, and implementing appropriate regulations, Sri Lanka can tap into the enormous economic opportunities offered by this multi-billion dollar industry."
