    "The digitalisation of customs, IRD port net, maritime single window and national single window, etc. must be carefully developed",
    "Modernising customs, ports and supply chains needs future proofed technology to meet current and anticipated future international standards that fit a domestic framework, including the much talked of \u2018single window\u2019. The national single window of India and Pakistan were developed within the local talent with international expertise at some point coming and contributing at professional consultancy services.",
    "Custom designed for Sri Lankan ports (air and sea) border protection agencies such as Customs and other agencies and general digitalisation is very important rather than having to \u2018fit\u2019 software developed by a competing nation. Sri Lanka needs fast digitalisation in its services sector but if local talent and companies are restricted by means of process to enter competitive bidding to develop such products and install locally, it is a major concern. These prohibitive processes restrict local companies\u2019 ability to develop and sell software not only to Sri Lanka but to other countries, ports and to be part of global supply chain solutions providers as they will lack experience. This restricts expansion and growth of Sri Lanka information technology developments and earning foreign exchange becomes a challenge.",
    "Government tenders for digitalisation seem to favour international companies over Lankan talent as most border agency tenders request international experience of up to five years when bidding. How can local companies go global without having a fair chance to bid domestically? It is pragmatic to call to request international consultancy to support in the development of domestic products but certainly not fair to call for five years\u2019 experience in another country. It kills creativity and innovation at the outset. Sri Lankan information technology developers must be encouraged to develop software within Sri Lanka just as the way our neighbours have done.",
    "The digitalisation of customs, IRD port net, maritime single window and national single window, etc. must be carefully developed by limiting interested parties\u2019 data mining and controlling information and having a say on domestic systems and the economy via software. If domestic expertise is used, it will allow the Sri Lankan Government to respond faster and more effectively with less cost to face changing economic demands, as well as helping drive the economic growth. There should be a simple mechanism to bring in consultants but hesitancy in allowing developed foreign software access to operations and data management, which should be a concern.",
    "Utilising Sri Lankan talent and the software to improve Sri Lankan digital efficiency and assisting them to develop international packages as we have proven in the London stock exchange is the way forward \u2013 and the responsibility of the Government. In modern day competition, data is knowledge and as always known, knowledge is power.",
