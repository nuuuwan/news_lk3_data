    "The Supreme Court today (24) issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP.",

    "The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon.",
