    "It was reported in the newspapers that Sri Lanka Customs destroyed more than 200 million sticks of cigarettes that had come in 21 containers in 2021. This consignment worth Rs. 9.7 billion is supposed to be the largest quantity of cigarettes detected in the country\u2019s history.",
    "1. Why was this consignment kept for two years in their custody?",
    "2. Why was the importer not identified and fine not imposed?",
    "3. What about the cost of storing these containers in the warehouse? Here I mean who bears the cost of demurrage?",
    "5. Shouldn\u2019t this contraband have been auctioned in 2021 and thus earning revenue very badly required by the Customs?",
    "6. What a waste of money in destroying this contraband after letting it get expired?",
    "7. Why does this sort of thing recur from time to time without urgent and suitable action being taken?",
    "Hope the Director General of Customs will respond after perusal of this article."
