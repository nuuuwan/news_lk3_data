    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Christmas cake is a fruit cake acclaimed by international foodies who have tried out the confection to be perhaps the World\u2019s Best\u2019.",
    "\u201cFor years I firmly believed that I had tried every single variation of the Christmas cake possible. Light, dark, moist, dry, British, Scottish, Italian, Serbian\u2026 That was, until I met my Sri Lankan husband,\u201d writes author Queensashay at Food52, a foodie portal.",
