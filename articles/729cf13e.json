    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) was named the Electoral Commission of the Year at 2025 International Electoral Awards Ceremony held in Gaborone, Botswana on Friday (3). The Award was received by the Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake.",
    "When selecting the recipient, the awards committee takes into consideration the effort taken to foster a community of good citizens among election practitioners and the search for best practice, evidence based research and policy in the field of elections of Electoral Commissions worldwide.",
    "Electoral Commissions worldwide are the independent watchdogs of democratic process checking and balancing the use of democratic means by the governing political elite. Their duties are manifold and so are their Electoral challenges. Every Electoral Commission depending on their country\u2019s Electoral system, demographic and geographic constitution has to approach its task in a fundamentally different way. Even the organisational composition and structures of Electoral Commissions differs vastly.",
    "The award for the Electoral Commission of the Year will honour a commission taking into consideration the above described diversity of challenges, duties and organisational structures."
