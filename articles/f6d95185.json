    "Under deflationary policy a pegged central bank can fix, appreciate or depreciate a currency at will.",
    "But a central bank that deploys inflationary open market operations to push down interbank rates, especially a single policy rate or mid-corridor rate, which tend to require a build-up of excess liquidity, will lose control of reserve money and eventually the exchange rate.",
    "The central bank\u2019s deflationary policy started to show up in the balance of payments from around the fourth quarter of 2022.",

    "Sri Lanka and several African countries which operated flexible inflation targeting, where interest rates were cut claiming historical 12-month inflation was low, without regard to domestic credit and the balance of payments, eventually defaulted on their foreign debt.  (Colombo/Jan05/2025)"
