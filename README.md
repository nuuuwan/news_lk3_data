Sri Lanka, with its high literacy rate and skilled youth population, is well-positioned to meet this global demand.

### Sir John Kotelawela (1953 — 1956), as seen by his Assistant Secretary

The strongest man is never strong enough to be always master, unless lie transforms his power into right, and obedience to duty.

At the time my story begins, a routine civil service transfer had me moved as Assistant Secretary in the prime minister’s office which was without doubt the most exalted and powerful institution in Sri Lanka. For the first 30 years of the new state’s existence, its place in the political structure remained unchallenged and unchanged. The role of the prime minister as the keystone of the arch in a Westminster-style government was paramount. It was only much later, after the second Republican Constitution in 1978 and the creation of the Executive Presidency with its enormous concentration of power, that the position of the prime minister became as it now is, devoid of constitutional authority, largely decorative’ and what its holder is able to make of it.

### Unique Contributions to Hospitality Leadership Development in Sri Lanka

*2024-09-29 01:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/unique-contributions-to-hospitality-leadership-development-in-sri-lanka/) · `en`

As the founding Managing Director of the International Hotel School (IHS), I placed hotel management development at the forefront of Mount Lavinia Hotel’s (MLH) operations in the early 1990s. Several key members of our leadership team became both coaches to their respective departments; and students attending the IHS management seminars. This “Teaching and Learning Culture,” which I implemented helped me in my role as General Manager of MLH. Around this time, I also once again became a student. I pursued the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Diploma in Marketing in England, graduating in 1992 and becoming a CIM member in 1993.

### Welcome, Comrade Anura!

*2024-09-29 01:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/welcome-comrade-anura/) · `en`

It’s official – Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the ninth Executive President of Sri Lanka.

For those who don’t know, between 1948 – when we obtained independence from the British Empire – and 1977, the highest elected political official in Sri Lanka was the Prime Minister. He or she – Sri Lanka has the distinction of electing the world’s first woman Prime Minister – was invested with a tremendous array of powers, while the President served a ceremonial role.

In 1978, the government of J. R. Jayewardene enacted a new Constitution which transformed the office of the Prime Minister into that of an all-powerful, almost omniscient Executive President who was both head of state and head of government. The then Prime Minister’s rationale was that the parliamentary system which had prevailed until then had become a hindrance and that the country required a new political arrangement which would shield its leaders from the vagaries of parliamentary politics.

### Sri Lanka Provides Hope for Democracy in the West

*2024-09-29 01:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-provides-hope-for-democracy-in-the-west/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s Presidential election saw a genuine left-winger, from a Marxist party, record a victory that upended the country’s political establishment. But the NPP’s win was more than just historic for this country. A man whose ideology with regard to the fundamental questions of policy differs from all predecessors was elected. This is something presently unimaginable in the West. While it may have been different 100 years ago, today in most major Western countries, there is increasingly no way for the public to vote away the two sacred cows of the establishment: neoliberal capitalism and neo-con foreign policy. Here, Sri Lanka can provide hope.

### Western Plot to Encircle China and the Risk of Global Conflict:

*2024-09-29 01:36:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/western-plot-to-encircle-china-and-the-risk-of-global-conflict/) · `en`

In this second part of my interview with Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka (part one appeared last week) we ventured into the philosophical underpinnings of contemporary geopolitics. Dr. Jayatilleka contends that the war in Ukraine represents a critical inflection point, suggesting that the West may soon confront a more profound reality: Vladimir Putin is merely a symptom of a deeper, more complex Russian psyche. This perspective challenges the prevailing discourse and calls for a reconsideration of how power, fear, and resistance are constructed on the global stage. We also explored India’s nuanced role within its regional dynamics, the enduring struggles in Palestine, the evolving tensions in West Asia, NATO’s expansion, and the relentless rise of China.

### Is Sri Lanka Prospecting For Oil In The Mannar Basin Or Not?

*2024-09-28 12:23:43* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/is-sri-lanka-prospecting-for-oil-in-the-mannar-basin-or-not/) · `en`

The Government called for International tenders to prospect for oil and gas in Mannar basin in 2019 . An award was made as per the tender specs, and lo and behold the usual games began. Before long the successful bidder was assailed with the usual wishy-washy delaying tactics which led to the tender being cancelled. Reminiscent of many such tenders. The successful tenderer who had spent considerable sums naturally sought legal redress obtaining an interim order against the cancellation.

Mark you, the Government of Sri Lanka nor the people have to spend a penny to prospect. If oil or gas is found the agreed terms must be met. If there is discovery ( mind you these people are pros in the business) Sri Lanka will benefit big time in the interim period before the Carbon zero system ( if ever ) comes into play, perhaps in 2030. Therefore timing is of the essence. If there is no discovery, the bidder loses but not Sri Lanka. Get it?
