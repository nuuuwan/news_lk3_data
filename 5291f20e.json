    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Speaker and government MPs have raised concerns over Sri Lanka opposition leader Sajith Premadasa allegedly taking up parliament\u2019s time during a budget debate using a special privilege afforded to him.",
    "Government members including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe on Friday December 01 took issue with Premadasa purportedly abusing a special privillege afforded to him under 27/2 of parliament\u2019s standing orders to raise questions.",
    "The opposition leader\u2019s questions concerned an ongoing controversy surrounding Sri Lanka Cricket, with Friday\u2019s questions specifically focused on a matter pertaining to LED screens that he claimed had been under-invoiced.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d like to reveal a serious tragedy unfolding at this instance. At three cricket grounds \u2013 Pallekele, Dambulla and R Premadasa in Colombo \u2013 had ordered three 60 ft by 3 LED screens. The tender for these screens was opened on July 14, 2023. But before the tender was opened on July 14, part of the money had already been sent the 13th: 29,000 US dollars.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka Customs officials are at \u201cthis very moment\u201d engaged in a raid, he said. The opposition leader said only 6.5 million rupees had been levied as tax for these screens, \u201ccentred around the 29,000 dollars and under-invoiced\u201d. He claimed that the three screens should cost at least 150,000 dollars.",
    "State Minister of Finance Semasinghe said Sri Lanka Customs was already investigating the matter and they will reach a conclusion at the end of the inquiry.",
    "Premadasa said the companies that brought the allegedly under-invoiced LED screens were now attempting to remove them. He acknowledged, however, that Customs was indeed engaged in a raid.",
    "Semasinghe said that a new precedent has been created in parliament that Standing Order 27/2 is being used to raise a host of questions that require a response.",
    "The opposition leader then raised a second question about postponing elections, asking when the long-postponed local government elections are due to be held.",
    "Prime Minister Gunawardena said that under Standing Order 27/2, the opposition leader and other party leaders have a certain privilege.",
    "The clause reads: \u201cThe Secretary-General shall, upon receipt of any notice in respect of any question, unless the Speaker rules any question out of order, include in the Order Book for answer on a day not earlier than seven clear days from the day on which the notice was given:",
    "Provided that, any question relating to a matter of urgent public importance may be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or a leader of a recognised political party at the conclusion of questions after due notice has been given to the Minister concerned.\u201d",
    "\u201cHave you made a new standing order?\u201d the premier asked Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.",
    "\u201cParliament cannot function this way. The opposition leader can ask questions about a fire or some other emergency anytime without going on and on,\u201d said Gunawardena.",
    "Premadasa responded that, according to Erskine May\u2019s \u2018A treatise on the law, privileges, proceedings and usage of Parliament\u2019, the opposition leader is traditionally afforded this privilege.",
    "\u201cI asked two bad questions. One was about corruption in cricket. The other was about postponing the election,\u201d he said.",
    "State Minister Semasinghe complained that parliament\u2019s time has been taken up by other matters during a budget debate.",
    "\u201cWe have been ready for a debate on the budget for over two weeks. But every day, instead of discussing the budget, without talking about this complex economic issue, we talk about everything else,\u201d he said, adding that 606 minutes have been taken up for these discussions.",
    "\u201cI also feel the opposition leader has abused the special privilege afforded to him. Let\u2019s try to prevent that. We will start the process to make necessary amendments to standing orders for that soon,\u201d he said.",
    "Premadasa, however, defended his questions, claiming that the cricket question was to do with state revenue and was therefore very relevant to the budget.",
    "\u201cThere are three major avenues for government revenue: the Inland Revenue Department, the Excise Department and Customs. I presented this issue with Sri Lanka Cricket about under-invoicing and the resultant impact on revenue that should\u2019ve come in. When I\u2019m showing a corrupt irregularity (horayak) with SLC through this, I don\u2019t understand why these people get excited. I was talking about government revenue,\u201d he said.",
    "Semasinghe responded: \u201cWe\u2019re agreeable to discussing increasing state revenue. But the problem is, when Customs itself is investigating this\u2026. We must discuss things that are not being investigated. There is no need to come here and discuss an investigation that officials there have already commenced. It\u2019s fine if that investigation is not being conducted properly, but we as ministers have to decide whether we respond if the discussion is being dragged out.\u201d (Colombo/Dec01/2023)"
