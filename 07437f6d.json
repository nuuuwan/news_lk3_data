    "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena speaking at the National Integration Participatory Development Program, \u2018Aluth Gamak- Aluth Ratak\u2019 held at the Monaragala District Secretariat on Thursday said that the Government continued to maintain the public service in spite of suggestions casted to make a reduction in the number.",
    "The Prime Minister further stated that Sri Lanka faced a crisis in currency and a dilemma internationally. \u201cInternational support and friendship is needed to overcome the crisis. Countries that have faced the same crises have not come out of it so quickly. I met the leaders and envoys of other countries and all of them said that they are proud of Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are proud of the farmers of our country. When the whole world was facing the food crisis, our farmers could yield a good harvest. It is essential to overcome the shortcomings in the field of agriculture and make it more productive.\u201d",
    "He emphasised that today, Sri Lanka has managed to win international trust despite the conditions that were in the middle of the financial crisis. The economy started to grow based on that trust. There was a time that we should not forget when banking transactions of the country were barred internationally. The authority including Government agents, provincial council officials, local council officials and the entire public service should understand that situation.",
    "\u201cWellassa is the symbol of our country\u2019s freedom. Every Government of our country is indebted to this land. This is a journey starting from the village through the Divisional Secretariats towards food security and many related fields.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf we become self-sufficient in food, it is not necessary for us to spend Dollars for food. That means we incur only Rupees but not Dollars on food.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t need any more arithmetic. There are many problems to solve. Allotment of land to those doing cultivation in these areas should be completed soon,\u201d said the Prime Minister",
    "\u201cWe did not maintain deeds regarding cultivations in the past. It was the British Government that imposed various land laws along with deeds. A large number of people living in Wellassa today have faced inconveniences due to those laws. We discussed with the Surveyor General regarding the measures that can be taken to change these laws and provide relief to farmers. If the basic measurement plans are done through the Divisional Secretary, it will be possible to fulfil the hopes of these people,\u201d he added.",
    "He reiterated that the relief given to the lowest income earners of this country cannot be stopped. There is no need to create a conflict out of it. It should be taken on humane grounds. This is an effort to provide relief to the lowest income group of the country and to increase the amount. The Prime Minister invited the public service to fulfil their responsibility as Government officials to make this program successful by solving the existing problems.",
    "\u201cThere were various proposals to reduce the number of public servants. But we didn\u2019t do that. We need to get the country out of this difficult situation. If we all join hands and move towards a specific goal, we can become self-sufficient in food,\u201d the Premier added.",

Muzammil, State Ministers Shashindra Rajapaksa, Ashoka Priyantha, Janaka Wakkambura, Vijitha Berugoda, Members of Parliament Kumarasiri Ratnayake, Yadamini Gunawardena, Dharmasena Wijesinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration Ranjith Ashoka, Monaragala District Secretary S.B.
