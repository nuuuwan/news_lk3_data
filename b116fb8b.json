    "The Department of Wildlife has given an undertaking to the Court of Appeal that steps will not be taken to export Toque Macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to China, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "The undertaking was given when a petition filed by environmental organisations against the alleged proposal to export 100,000 Toque Macaque monkeys to China was taken up before the court today (June 26).",
    "The petition had been filed by a total of 27 parties, including the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, Otara Gunawardena, Ven. Ananda Sagara Thero and Rukshan Jayawardena, claiming that reports have revealed that the monkeys are being exported to China for lab-testing purposes.",
    "Citing that such a move would constitute an act of animal cruelty while also defying the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, the petitioners therefore sought an order preventing the exportation of the monkeys, while also seeking an order against the Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, preventing him from issuing licenses for such exports.",
    "30 Petitioners, including the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, Rescue Animals Sri Lanka, RARE Sri Lanka, Justice for Animals and others, had filed action in the Court of Appeal pursuant to the statement made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera that there were plans being made to export toque macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to China.",
    "The case was filed before the Court of Appeal seeking a court order to prevent the proposed export of toque macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to China.",
    "When the case was taken up today, the Attorney General appeared and stated in open court that they have received instructions from the Department of Wildlife and Conservation that they will not be taking steps to export monkeys to China.",
    "The case will be taken up before the Court of Appeal on 6th July to record the above undertaking given to the Court by the State.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena with counsels Prashanthi Mahindaratne, Dilumi De Alwis, Lakmini Warusevitane and Rukshan Senadira instructed by attorney-at- law Amila Kumar had appeared for the Petitioners."
