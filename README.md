### World beyond island borders

*2024-11-04 23:49:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/World-beyond-island-borders/4-768834) · `en`

Sri Lanka is an island. Such a geographical feature comes with good and bad. Physical isolation or not having a boundary shared with a neighbouring country gave us peace of mind on border conflicts. However, it did not prevent us from getting invaded by the nations with naval powers. Further, it allowed us to create unique cultural habits blended with the natural environment. We have our own Lepidoptera, birds, and flora and fauna. Free flow of people across the borders would have challenged our ethnic identities. In such a connected country, the competition among migrants for limited resources would have been high, causing tensions among people to win their fair share.

Yes, singer Suzi Croner (Flückiger) became a darling to all her Sri Lankan fans in Melbourne, Australia, when she arrived, in that part of the world, last month, for her big event, ‘Country Night.’

Everyone, whom she met, hugged and greeted her, saying “Oh, Suzi darling, so happy to see you again!” And, Suzi says her mind went back to the days of the hit song, ‘Oh, Suzie Darling’ sung by Robin Luke.

“Believe me, I was so happy to see all my old friends again…from the Bambalapitiya Flats, Dehiwela, schoolmates, etc., and I enjoyed every minute of my stay in Melbourne,” said Suzi.

“On the last occasion I was in Australia, I fell ill and was not 100 percent fit. This time it was a different scene altogether.

“I was invited to several places – for lunch, dinner, tea, and the usual exciting outings.”

Referring to the ‘Country Night’ concert, held on Saturday, 26th October, at The Grand On Princess, Suzi said it was a huge success.

### President Anura - Nimal Lansa

Former MP Nimal Lansa accuses President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of deception, claiming he's not fulfilling campaign promises. He criticizes the current government's handling of corruption scandals and implementation of IMF programs.

🟩

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is deceiving people. Former parliamentarian Nimal Lansa said he was one of the speaking of the election platforms and a man who was sitting in the presidential seat.

He further stated at a public meeting held on Monday (4) in Katana area.

We are working to build a strong opposition party. It is unconventional that the winner has visited the Katana area for the failed party, not to Anuragumara Dissanayake.. Those who win the election should not think that they will win the next election. Success in the parliamentary election cannot be expected without fulfilling the promises made to the people.

The curse of seventy -five years, the people believed that the ministers had stolen, defrauded and corrupted.. But currently that hope has been lost. President Anura knows that the promises made on the election platform cannot be fulfilled.

### No change has been made by the government. False promises, people should not be fooled by false disguises

*2024-11-04 23:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197904) · `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



David Navaratnaraj warns against false promises. No real changes by government. Ranil Wickremesinghe supported, economy improved under him. Current campaign borrowing heavily. Police capable of handling crimes, no need for president intervention.

🟩

No change has been made by the government. David Navaratnaraj, who is contesting as the primary candidate in the UNP's elephant symbol in the Jaffna electoral district, said that the people should not be fooled by false promises and false disguises.

Yall. He said this during a media briefing held at the Media Center on Monday (4).

If he became president in 2005, he voted for Ranil Wickremesinghe and would not have been destroyed. Many people think he is furious. We do not think that politics is an error. It was because of the furious character that the country was restored from the economic downturn.

Today, many who have stood with Ranil Wickremesinghe have split for their own selfishness.Even the JVP continues to carry out the programs launched by Ranil Wickremesinghe. They were unable to carry out new jobs.

Egg prices, rice prices and coconut prices are high today. Ranil Wickremesinghe has now begun to rise again. The regime will go and topple within six months.

Reveals poverty, education, housing and floods still need more attention to develop Colombo

I do not believe that there should always be experienced politicians in the parliament. There are two sides of the experienced politicians as some of them are capable of genuinely serving to fulfil people’s aspirations but others are capable of stealing public money. I think there should be a combination where experienced and budding politicians represent people at the parliament. Remember, we can’t rule a country with inexperienced parliamentarians

### “Cocoon” around heads of state: Is there one around President Anura Dissanayake already?

*2024-11-04 22:33:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Cocoon-around-heads-of-state-Is-there-one-around-President-Anura-Dissanayake-already/14-768828) · `en`

It is necessary to break this cocoon by appointing a council of economic advisers. The council must listen to the alternative perspectives specially based on research, empirical analysis and data. Then council members are required to submit an individual report in writing to the President based on which the President would have an enlightened discourse on the subject. The same principle of Continuous Improvement Process can be applied here by stopping the prevention of the flow of information to the top

The “cocoon” around heads of state refers to the insulating layer of advisors, staff, and bureaucrats who control access to the leader, sometimes filtering or distorting the flow of information. This phenomenon can prevent heads of state from receiving accurate, unfiltered information and limit their exposure to diverse perspectives. This is especially true when it comes to economic governance, the most crucial part of governance.
