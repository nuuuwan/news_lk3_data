    "Given the current economic crisis of the country, the SLEA, in its annual conferences this year and in the coming years, is expected to focus on the agriculture, industry, and services sectors, providing research-based, in-depth analysis on their contribution to economic recovery and growth. While achieving macroeconomic stability is important, that stability needs to be managed, and progress towards a prosperous future for the nation needs to be ensured only with economic growth emanating from production sectors. Accordingly, this year\u2019s conference is expected to shed light on the agriculture sector in order to bring out a research publication that is important for academics, policymakers, and students engaging in various dimensions of agricultural development.",
