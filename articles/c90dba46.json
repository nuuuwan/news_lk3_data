    "Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror) - The current Transport Minister is not efficient with his work and is only limited to his talks, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) president Gemunu Wijerathne claimed today.",
    "Addressing the media, he said that even though the government had not reduced the price of Super Diesel, the bus operators will continue with their services.",
    "\"It had been two years since Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva assumed duties as Transport Minister, but nothing has been done for the private bus service. He continuously use to say that while operating 3,000 buses, the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) incurs a loss of Rs. 10 million per day. If the SLTB incurs such a loss, the Minister should be able to imagine how much of losses the private bus operators incur while operating 14,000 buses per day,\" Wijerathne said.",
    "\"That is why we have been proposing a prepaid card system for the last ten years, but the programme has still not been implemented, and there is no concern from the then and now Transport Ministers,\" Wijerathne said."
