### Airline accused of killing ‘strict vegetarian’ Sri Lankan passenger with meat-based meal: Report

A Southern California cardiologist flying Qatar Airways from Los Angeles to Sri Lanka was denied the vegetarian meal he had ordered, then died after choking on a piece of food while attempting to “eat around” the meat in meal he was given instead, according to his grieving family.

The pilot couldn’t make an emergency landing to get 85-year-old Asoka Jayaweera to a doctor because the plane was “traveling over the Arctic Circle/Ocean,” alleges a newly filed wrongful death lawsuit obtained by The Independent.

However, Jayaweera’s son Surya contends the aircraft was actually over the Midwest at the time and could have easily diverted, their complaint states.

When the flight eventually touched down in Edinburgh, Scotland, Jayaweera, a “strict vegetarian,” had been unconscious for some three-and-a-half hours, according to the complaint. It says he was taken to the hospital – but that it was already too late.

Despite Sri Lanka’s strong economic performance in recent times, the recovery remains incomplete, with growth still below pre-crisis levels and poverty significantly elevated, the World Bank said.

The World Bank noted that strengthening the recovery will require continued macroeconomic stability, urgent structural reforms and more efficient, better-targeted public spending.

The latest Sri Lanka Development Update, ‘Better Spending for All’ released by the World Bank today (07), projects Sri Lanka’s economy to grow by 4.6 percent in 2025 — supported by a modest rebound in industry and steady growth in services — before slowing to 3.5 percent in 2026. This outlook is subject to heightened risks, including from elevated global uncertainty.

“While Sri Lanka’s recent economic progress is encouraging, the recovery is uneven and incomplete,” said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

In this context, the company's dismissal of the employee who refused to work on the weekend on the weekend, considering the urgent medical needs of his family member in Hyderabad, has caused great shock.

Inhumane act in medical emergency. In it, the company's manager has insisted that he continues to work on weekends and after office hours. Meanwhile, the employee told the manager that his grandmother had to go to the city immediately because he was diagnosed with cancer.

But, the manager has no humanitarianism for the employee's request. Thus, the depressed employee has informed the company through e-mail about his condition and the harassment he faces. But shockingly, the administration, which was mistakenly regarded by the email, has fired him the next day without any prior notice.

### Gold set to become Australia’s second-biggest resource earner

Australia said on Tuesday it expected gold to become its second most valuable resource export after iron ore this financial year, dislodging liquefied natural gas, as concerns over geopolitical instability fuel demand for the safe-haven metal.

Australia’s gold exports are expected to rise by A$12 billion ($7.9 billion) to A$60 billion in the current financial year ending in June 2026, as the country exports more gold at higher prices, the department of industry said in its September quarterly report.

That would eclipse Australia’s export earnings for LNG, which are expected to fall to A$54 billion this financial year, and to A$48 billion the following year, tracking lower oil prices.

A lower interest rate environment in the United States is also expected to support gold prices above $3,200 a troy ounce over the next two years, the report said. Gold prices hit a record high on Monday and are trading close to $4,000 an ounce.

### US government shutdown enters second week after funding measures fail again in Senate

The US government shutdown entered its second week on Monday (Oct 6), with no sign of a deal between President Donald Trump’s Republicans and Democrats to end the crisis.

Democrats are refusing to provide the handful of votes the ruling Republicans need to reopen federal departments, unless an agreement is reached on extending expiring “Obamacare” healthcare subsidies and reversing some cuts to health programmes passed as part of Trump’s signature “One Big Beautiful Bill”.
