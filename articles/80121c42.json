    "December to me is the month to celebrate women. I presume the reason is that I revere Sanghamitta Theri, daughter of Emperor Asoka, who on request of King Devanampiya Tissa (250 \u2013 210 BC) on behalf of the women in his court, came to Lanka. She brought a sapling from the Gaya Bo Tree under which Siddhartha Gautama solved the riddle of samsaric existence and found a solution. She also started the Bhikkhuni Order in this country; the request being made by Queen Anula, sister-in-law of King Devanampiya Tissa.",
    "Theri Sanghamitta\u2019s arrival in a then port in the Jaffna Peninsula now known as Jambakolapatuna and her being conducted in procession to Anuradhapura occurred in the month of December, hence our observance of Unduvap Poya this month along with Sanghamitta Day.",
    "Sanghamitta Bhikkhuni (282-203 BC) also bearing the nun\u2019s name Ayapali, is believed to be the eldest daughter of Emperor Ashoka (304 \u2013 232 BC) from his first wife Queen Devi. She was given in marriage at age 14 to Agribrahma, a nephew of Emperor Ashoka. Her son Sumana followed his maternal uncle to the priesthood and also accompanied him to Lanka, thus he being the samanera (novice monk) of the small group that met the Lankan king in Mihintale.",
    "Like her brother Mahinda ordained himself as a Bhikkhu, she too joined the Order of Bhikkhunis founded in India by the Buddha\u2019s foster mother, Prajapathi Gotami. Her father, the Emperor, was reluctant to let his daughter follow his son to Lanka but she insisted. Thus her arrival in the island and settling down to live in Anuradhapura; the Bo sapling she brought, being planted in the Mahamevuna Uyana. Unlike her brother who came with two monks, Samanera Sumana and a lay devotee, she is said to have arrived with a large number of bhikkhunis. She led a life devoted to Theravada Buddhism and tending the growing number if bhikkhunis in Lanka, and died at age 79, the then king Uttiya seeing to the last rites accorded her.",
    "Thus it is to Ven Sanghamitta Theri that we owe the gift of the sacred Bo tree which is now the oldest recorded historical tree in the world and the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order or Mehenisasna which within the last one and half decades has been re-established in Sri Lanka. Our nuns could only take the vow of upholding ten precepts and were known as Dasasil Mathas.",
    "The objection to ordination as Bhikkunis was made by our monks holding high positions, on the grounds that the order had been broken during Portuguese colonization of the island. Ordination had to be by a nun of an unbroken order, meaning from the time of the Buddha. Very fortuitously, certain monks came forward in Los Angeles, California, and ordained nuns, including Ayya Khema who was then resident at Parappuduwa, Dodanduwa in southern Sri Lanka. Later our own ten preceptors led by Kusuma Devendra in dasasil robes obtained full ordination in India. Ajahn Brahmavamso ordained nuns in Perth Australia, assisted by Ven Thathaloka Theri from California.",
    "I introduce this person with an anecdote connected to sacred Anuradhapura, blessed by the pair of siblings: Mahinda Thera and Sanghmitta Theri. First her background story and then the anecdote.",
    "An Australian lay visitor to Parappuduwa when Ayya Khema held three month retreats for foreign women from around the 1970s, on her third visit received ordination from Ayya Khema as a ten preceptor. Ratna Dias kept close in touch with Ayya Khema and I was drawn in. I revered particularly this great helper in Parappuduwa \u2013 Australian Ayya Vayama \u2013 who was young, rather vulnerable, yet ever so saintly. As she developed in her religious devotion she actually emanated an aura of goodness and metta which was palpable; acknowledged by even those who failed to acknowledge anything extra-ordinary.",
    "After Bhikkuni Khema decided to return to Germany, not able to take living within barbed wired Parappuduwa Nun\u2019s Island during the 1989 JVP uprising, Ayya Vayama stayed on for a couple of years, but decided she too needed further encouragement and training. She left for Britain to take residence in Amaravati Monastery, and then on request by Ajahn Brahmavamso, started a monastery for nuns \u2013 Dhammasara \u2013 45 kms from the city centre of Perth. Ajahn Vayama lived alone for a couple of months in a caravan in the forest. She kept in touch with me via aerograms.",
    "Ayya Vayama used to stay with me when she needed to be in Colombo like for renewal of visa etc Just before she left the island for good, she stayed again with me and invited Ratna, another friend from Kandy and me to stay over in Anuradhapura for a couple of days and visit Polonnaruwa. The anecdote lies here. We would rise early and go sit in the premises of the Ruwanveliseya at dawn. We sat away from each other in meditation. Once morning I distinctly heard two groups of pilgrims mention with surprise a new statue being added to the \u2018maluwa\u2019 of the dagoba. \u201cAney, lassana thawa rupayak.\u201d They were thus exclaiming at Ayya Vayama, tall and sitting erect, motionless in deep concentration.",
    "Never forgotten or even lessened in memory is the calm, religiousness and peace that enveloped me as we four, again in the early morning, sat on the rock in front of the Gal Vihara, revering the statues in their magnificence, enveloped in an ambience of tranquility and peace and joy within. We stayed thus for more than an hour.",
    "Ayya Vayama\u2019s adherence to vinaya rules was so strong that she refused even clear soup at night, and never carried money. She was ordained a bhikkhuni by Ajahn Brahm. Sadly she died prematurely of a nerve ailment which made her wheel chair bound. She visited Sri Lanka desirous of seeing those who had supported her and to express gratitude to them all, when she was well and even though incapacitated. A busload from Dodanduwa and Ambalangoda visited her when a Japanese devotee accompanied Ajahn Vayama and Ajahn Seri who cared for her at the Hilton Hotel.",
    "Ajahn Vayama became a good teacher and expounder of the Suttas but her illness curtailed her. Her beliefs and emotions I respectfully discern as unshaken faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, and absolute devoutness. Her kindness and concern were all encompassing and she was full of the four Brahma Viharas. Ajahn Seri sent me details so I watched the funeral of this great good bhikkhuni on zoom, admittedly with sadness but heartfelt thanksgiving for a life well spent and example given me.",
