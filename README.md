இந்தியா - அமெரிக்கா இடையே வர்த்தகரீதியாக மோதல் போக்கு நிலவி வரும் நிலையில், பிரதமர் நரேந்திர மோடியை டொனால்டு டிரம்ப் திடீரென 'நண்பன்' என அழைத்து அனைவரையும் ஆச்சரியத்தில் ஆழ்த்தியுள்ளார்.

உலக அளவில் நெருங்கிய கூட்டாளிகளாக இருந்து வந்த அமெரிக்காவும், இந்தியாவும் கடந்த சில மாதங்களாக எதிரெதிர் துருவங்களாக மாறின. தனது எச்சரிக்கையையும் மீறி, ரஷ்யாவிடம் இருந்து கச்சா எண்ணெய்யை இந்தியா வாங்குவதை அமெரிக்காவால் ஏற்றுக் கொள்ள முடியவில்லை. மேலும், ரஷ்யாவுடன் இந்தியா நெருங்கி செல்வதையும் அந்நாடு விரும்பவில்லை.

இதனால் இந்தியா மீது தொடர்ந்து அதிருப்தியில் இருந்து வந்த அமெரிக்க ஜனாதிபதி டொனால்டு டிரம்ப், அண்மையில் இந்தியாவின் ஏற்றுமதி பொருட்கள் மீது 50 சதவீத வரியை விதித்து மிகப் பெரிய அதிர்ச்சியை கொடுத்தார். இந்த அதிகபட்ச வரி விதிப்பால் இந்தியாவின் தொழில்துறை ஆட்டம் காண தொடங்கியது.

இதற்கு பதிலளிக்கும் விதமாக நடிகை அம்பிகா தனது சமூக வலைத்தளப் பக்கத்தில், "அனுமதியின்றி உடலுறவு கொள்ள முயலும் பாலியல் குற்றங்கள், அது உடல் ரீதியாக இருந்தாலும் சரி, மன ரீதியாக இருந்தாலும் சரி, குற்றவாளிகள் எந்த வயசாக இருந்தாலும் உடனடியாக தண்டிக்கப்பட வேண்டும்.

சிறாராக இருந்தாலும் சரி, 100 வயது உடையவராக இருந்தாலும் சரி, குற்றம் குற்றமே," என்று கருத்து தெரிவித்திருந்தார்.

ஒரு குடிசைவீட்டில் குரங்குகள் புகுந்து இரண்டு மாத ஆண் குழந்தையை தூக்கிச் சென்று, நீர் நிரம்பியப் பீப்பாயில் போட்டுள்ளன. இந்த சம்பவம், உத்தர பிரதேச மாநிலம் சீதாபூரை அடுத்த சூரஜ்பூர் கிராமத்தில் இடம்பெற்றுள்ளது.

குரங்குகளின் சத்தம் கேட்டு குடிசைக்கு ஓடிச்சென்ற பெற் றோர் அங்கு குழந்தையைக் காணாததால் சுற்றியுள்ள பகுதி முழுவதும் தேடி உள்ளனர். இறுதியில் அக்குழந்தை தண்ணீர் நிரப்பப்பட்ட பீப்பாயில் மூழ்கிய நிலையில் இருப்பது தெரியவந்தது.

உடனடியாக குழந்தையை அரு கிலுள்ள சீதாபூர் அரசு மருத்துவமனைக்கு கொண்டு சென்றனர். பரிசோதித்த மருத்துவர்கள், குழந்தை மூச்சுத் திணறி இறந்து விட்டதாக கூறியுள்ளனர். இதைக் கேட்ட பெற்றோர் அதிர்ச்சி அடைந்தனர். இது அக்குடும்பத்தினரை மிகவும் சோகத்தில் ஆழ்த்தியுள் ளது. குறிப்பாக ஒரு வருடத்துக்கு முன்பு மணமான தம்பதியருக்கு பிறந்த முதல் குழந்தை இது.

### இன்றுசந்திர கிரகணம் :  நிகழவுள்ள அதிசயத்தை பாருங்கள்

2022ஆம் ஆண்டுக்குப் பிறகு நிகழும் மிக நீண்ட முழுச் சந்திர கிரகணம் (Lunar Eclipse 2025) இன்றிரவு நிகழ்கிறது.

இந்தப் பிரபஞ்சம் பல வானியல் அதிசயங்களைக் கொண்டதாகும். இங்கு நிகழும் பல விஷயங்கள் நம்மை வியப்பின் உச்சத்திற்கே போய்விடும். இப்படிக் கூட நடக்குமா என நாம் யோசிக்கும் பல வினோத நிகழ்வுகள் கூட நடக்கும்.

அப்படித் தான் இன்றைய தினம் மிக நீண்ட முழுச் சந்திர கிரகணம் நிகழ்கிறது. கடந்த 2022க்கு பிறகு மிக நீண்ட ஒரு சந்திர கிரகணமாக இது இருக்கும்.

இதுபோல அடுத்த முழு சந்திர கிரகணத்தைப் பார்க்க, நாம் 2028 டிசம்பர் 31 வரை காத்திருக்க வேண்டும் என்கிறார் புனேவில் உள்ள தேசிய வானொலி வானியற்பியல் மையத்தின் (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics) இணைப் பேராசிரியருமான திவ்யா ஓபரோய்.

கிரகணங்கள் அரிதானவை என்றும், ஒவ்வொரு பௌர்ணமி அல்லது அமாவாசையிலும் நிகழாது என்றும் ஓபரோய் விளக்கினார். சந்திரன் பூமியைச் சுற்றிவரும் பாதை, சூரியனைப் பூமி சுற்றி வரும் பாதையிலிருந்து சுமார் 5 டிகிரி சாய்ந்துள்ளது என்பதே இதற்குக் காரணமாகும்.

### 88 postal operators suspend services to US over tariffs: UN

*2025-09-07 07:23:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112241/88-postal-operators-suspend-services-to-us-over-tariffs-un) · `en`

Postal traffic to the United States plunged more than 80 per cent following Washington’s imposition of new tariffs, with 88 operators worldwide fully or partially suspending services, the Universal Postal Union said on Saturday (Sep 6).

The UPU, the United Nations’ postal cooperation agency, is working on “the rapid development of a new technical solution that will help get mail moving to the United States again”, its director general Masahiko Metoki said in a statement.

US President Donald Trump’s administration announced in late July that it was abolishing a tax exemption on small packages entering the United States from Aug 29.

The move sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in Australia, Britain, France, Germany, India, Italy and Japan, that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.

The UPU said data exchanged between postal operators via its systems showed that traffic to the United States was down 81 per cent on Aug 29, compared to a week earlier.

### Rare total lunar eclipse ‘blood moon’ to be visible from Sri Lanka tonight

Sri Lankans will have a rare opportunity to witness the phenomenon known as “blood moon” later today (07), said Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, the Head of the Department of Physics and Director, Astronomy and Space Science Unit of the University of Colombo and the Chairman of the Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies.

The spectacular celestial event is set to light up the skies tonight, as the Moon undergoes a total lunar eclipse, turning an eerie, deep red for 82 minutes.

Known as a Blood Moon, this will be the last total lunar eclipse of the year and is expected to be visible to nearly 85% of the global population. Unlike many eclipses confined to specific regions, this phenomenon will be observable across much of Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa, with Sri Lanka offering some of the clearest views.

### UK police arrest about 425 at protest for banned Palestine Action

*2025-09-07 05:45:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112236/uk-police-arrest-about-425-at-protest-for-banned-palestine-action) · `en`

British police arrested around 425 people on Saturday (Sep 6) at a demonstration backing Palestine Action, the pro-Palestinian group banned by the government as a terrorist organisation.

Britain outlawed Palestine Action in July after some of its members broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged military planes. The group has also targeted defence firms with links to Israel, accusing the government of complicity in alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near parliament in London to oppose the ban, holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”

Police said those detained were arrested for offences including assaulting officers and supporting a proscribed organisation. “Officers ... have been subjected to an exceptional level of abuse including punches, kicks, spitting and objects being thrown, in addition to verbal abuse,” London’s Metropolitan Police wrote on X.

### A Passage North

*2025-09-07 01:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-passage-north/) · `en`

Soon after I read Brotherless Night, I found another book about the conflict, which was also a sort of pendent to the Booker Prize winning Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, and had indeed been shortlisted for the book the year before Shehan Karunatilleka won it.

Unlike those two, which were a retelling of history, this was an introspective novel that explores something of the suffering caused by the war – though it did have set pieces within that were in fact retellings of actual episodes during the war.

### The guardians of the world

*2025-09-07 00:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-guardians-of-the-world/) · `en`

By cultivating within ourselves the qualities of moral shame and fear of wrongdoing we not only accelerate our own progress along the path to deliverance, but also contribute our share towards the protection of the world. Given the intricate interconnections that hold between all living forms, to make the sense of shame and fear of wrong the guardians of our own minds is to make ourselves guardians of the world. As the roots of morality, these two qualities sustain the entire efficacy of the Buddha’s liberating path; as the safeguards of personal decency, they at the same time preserve the dignity of the human race.

### POWER POLITICS

*2025-09-06 23:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/power-politics-2/) · `en`

It is said that Kotelawala made an application to the Central Bank for the transfer of a large sum of money to Britain for the purchase of property. NU mentioned that the application was made during the first premiership of Dudley Senanayake, “as financial protection from unsettling forces which he [Kotelawala] felt would overtake the country” (N.U. Jayawardena, c.1985, p.62). According to the Central Bank and Exchange Control regulations at that time, the transfer of such a large sum was not permissible, and would have violated existing regulations. As such, NU recommended the refusal of Kotelawala’s application to the Finance Minister J.R. Jayewardene and Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. This action would have serious repercussions in the future. NU’s daughter describes this episode:

### Arundhati Roy’s international splash with her 2025 non-fiction book

*2025-09-06 23:50:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/arundhati-roys-international-splash-with-her-2025-non-fiction-book/) · `en`

She writes autobiographically on her life with her mother and brother and titles her book Mother Mary Comes To Me, mother Mary being her own mother – Mary Roy, a Malayali Jacobite Syrian Christian who was educator and women’s rights activist known for winning a Supreme Court lawsuit in 1986 awarding equal rights to women to inherit family property. The book is published by Hamish Hamilton. I was sent a Guardian article which was an edited extract from the book.

It carries the long title: Arundhati Roy on her fugitive childhood: ‘My knees were full of scars and cuts – a sign of my wild, imperfect, fatherless life.’ The book appears to be starkly telling, cruelties and all, with a mother who was ill with asthma and on steroids and very very short tempered, who vented her wrath on her two small children. It seems to be brutally honest and thus the sympathy the reader feels will be for the two children; the mother too.

As planned the Speaker addressed a letter to the President stating that he had accepted a motion of impeachment presented to him by more than half the number of MPs and therefore section 38 of the constitution was now brought into play. This letter was brought by the President to the Cabinet which proceeded unanimously to declare their confidence in Premadasa. At this meeting Lalith and Premachandra who were Cabinet ministers at that time had also voted in favour of a confidence vote in the President though by this time they had affixed their signatures to the motion referred to by the Speaker.

### China’s Xi Jinping hosts a Summit of leaders of half the world, with a spectacular display of military force

On September 1, The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) based in The Hague, Netherlands, passed a resolution that “legal criteria have been met to establish Israel is committing genocide in Gaza”.

Israel’s conduct also meets the legal definition as laid out in the 1948 United Nations convention on genocide, which was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany. The convention defines genocide as “crimes committed with intent to destroy, in whole or part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.

The IAGS recognize that while the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage, was itself a war crime, “Israel’s response has not only been directed towards Hamas but has targeted Gaza’s entire (Palestinian) population”.

### Is the  JVP-led NPP Govt Weaponising the Law to Target Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe?Over his UK trip ?

United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has been in politics for more than five decades. Wickremesinghe who has served as Member of Parliament, Deputy Minister, Cabinet Minister, leader of the Opposition, Prime Minister and President has often been described as a “spent force” in politics. The resilient Ranil has always proved his detractors wrong by bouncing back into the ring spiritedly. Recent events seem to indicate that the irrepressible Ranil Wickremesinghe may yet again demonstrate that he is a person who cannot be written off easily.

Putin’s comments came hours after European leaders repledged their commitment to a potential peacekeeping force, a prospect that Moscow has repeatedly described as “unacceptable.”

“If any troops appear there, especially now while fighting is ongoing, we assume that they will be legitimate targets,” he said during a panel at the Eastern Economic Forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.

Putin also dismissed the idea of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine after a final peace deal, saying “no one should doubt” that Moscow would comply with a treaty to halt its 3½-year full-scale invasion of its neighbor.

He said that security guarantees would be needed for both Russia and Ukraine.

The Israeli military on Saturday said Palestinians in Gaza City should leave for the south, as its forces advance deeper into the enclave’s largest urban area.

Israeli forces have been carrying out an offensive on the suburbs of the northern city for weeks after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to capture it.

Netanyahu says Gaza City is a Hamas stronghold and capturing it is necessary to defeat the Palestinian Islamist militants, whose October 2023 attack on Israel sparked the war.

The assault threatens to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering there from nearly two years of fighting. Before the war, around a million people, nearly half of Gaza’s population, lived in the city.

Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X that residents should leave the city for a designated coastal area of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, assuring those fleeing that they would be able to receive food, medical care and shelter there.
