The Supreme Court on Monday ordered the petitioners in a Fundamental Rights petition, filed by the Sri Lanka Islamic Students Movement (SLISM), to name former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the first respondent. The case, filed in response to a 2021 Gazette notification issued under Rajapaksa’s presidency, challenges its validity and alleges infringement of the petitioner’s constitutional rights.

President’s Counsel M.N.M. Zuhair, representing SLISM, argued that Gazette notification No. 2223/3, dated April 13, 2021, signed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was “ultra vires” (beyond legal authority), invalid, and unlawful. He contended that the notification had no force or effect in law and should be declared null and void by the court.

The manner in which the thinking about development banking has evolved, clearly shows that more thought must be given to setting up an entirely new development bank. This is not to say that development banking is not required. What we need to think about is, can we not look at the existing banks with development banking competence before looking at reinventing the wheel?

The economic challenges, the debt restructuring, etc. are a perfect storm. If the promise of the constitution is to protect and promote the development of the lives of citizens, I suggest the centre and nine provinces must synergies and seamlessly harmonise government

This piece was prompted by the scaling back of ministries at the centre post the recent elections. The focus has been on cutting back on waste at the centre. Governance is carried out by layered structures; i.e. national, provincial and local. There are nine second-tier provinces and 341 third-level local government: 24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils and 276 Pradeshiya sabhas (village councils). All staffed by Government employees.

### Foreign observers at polls: Evolution of the concept and practice of election observation

Ideals and values of the organisation as well as the duty of transparency and communication appears to bear upon how elections are observed – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The question then arises as to whether all this makes them independent observers or observers who are partial to the sending organisation. The answer is of a binary nature. They are independent in so far as their functioning in the receiving country is concerned. They are required to not take sides in a contest, but to diligently observe whether the conduct of the election was free and fair. The agreement or understanding reached with the national agency and the mandate or the terms of reference under which the organisation concerned nominates the election observers are applicable here. This notwithstanding, there is no denying the fact that the observers bear partiality towards the sending organisation, which means that they uphold the ideals and values of that organisation at all times during their mission

### Greece as a lens to understand present political changes

The Government of Greece, like its counterpart in Sri Lanka, spent more than the revenue it generated year after year, piling up debt. Unlike in Sri Lanka, Greece lacked the ability to reset the economy by letting the currency float. In both countries the post-crisis focus was on the primary balance. In Sri Lanka this was to be achieved from the revenue side with no overt cuts in expenditure; in Greece by cutting Government expenditures including salaries and pensions, by downsizing Government, and by raising taxes. Syriza did it and now Greece is back to normalcy

Inflation in August 2024 was 0.5%, the lowest since 2000. There are no shortages. No bank collapsed. Reserves are up. Agreement is close on the commercial debt, the last piece of the restructuring.

Sri Lanka’s new government said it will review a wind power deal with the Adani Group, throwing a fresh hurdle for the Indian conglomerate as it seeks to expand abroad.

The previous administration’s approval of electricity prices for Adani Green Energy Ltd.’s projects “was a problem,” Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet ministers on Tuesday. The new government would give the deal a fresh look after parliamentary elections are held Nov. 14, he said.

The move to reassess the Adani Green deal follows through on a campaign pledge by newly elected president Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was swept into office last month after a closely contested three-way race. Dissanayake had called the project a threat to Sri Lanka’s energy sovereignty and vowed to cancel it.

ECONOMYNEXT – Representation of minority groups in Sri Lanka’s Parliament is in danger of weakening in the upcoming November 14 elections, which could affect their rights, an European Commission funded study has revealed.

Research by Oxford Brookes University as part of the Minority empowerment for democracy and pluralism programme revealed that major national parties have successively reduced the space within their parties for minorities to participate and raise their issues.

Minority ethnic parties are also divided and their campaigning is shaped by the majority agenda rather than the needs and rights of their communities.

“The main national parties in Sri Lanka have had a history of nominating representatives from minority communities who have gone on to take leadership positions. This is changing now with minority politicians in these parties often feeling isolated and finding fewer opportunities to raise minority rights issues,” lead researcher Dr Farah Mihlar said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Mariam Riza, who is running for Lord Mayor of Melbourne as the Liberal Party candidate wants to make the city hum with life by driving policies to fill empty buildings, boost small businesses and bring people back to the central business district.

Riza, a long time resident of Melbourne, says the city hummed with life before Covid. But parts of the business district started to lose their bustle and vacancies are now growing in buildings.

“It was a thriving city,” Riza told EconomyNext during a visit to Colombo. “And during COVID, it was the start of the decline of the city. Shopfronts started getting empty.

“Office complexes had less people coming in. That created empty or hot spots and then safety became a significant issue in the city as well.”

“It was sad to see a city go downhill, basically. And Melbourne is such a successful city. If we don’t nip these things in the bud and make course-corrective actions, you then set a city on a path of decline.
