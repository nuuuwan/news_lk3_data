    "The Election Commission (EC) has issued a media statement, reminding political parties and politicians that although the Local Government (LG) polls have been postponed, election laws governing them are in effect. Therefore, the EC has warned that at present nobody must promote any specific candidate, political party, or independent group. It has also informed all heads of public institutions, through a circular and a gazette extraordinary, that no state property must be utilised for this purpose. The EC\u2019s actions and warning are timely; complaints abound that the politicians who have submitted nominations for the LG polls are involved in the presidential election campaigns of their political parties. The government stands accused of involving its LG polls candidates in state-funded development activities at the grassroots level so that they can gain political mileage while carrying out its presidential election campaign.",
    "Some political parties, such as the UNP, the SJB and the NPP, are busy promoting themselves as well as their prospective presidential candidates in view of the next presidential election, which has not yet been called officially. These political parties have submitted nominations for the deferred LG polls, and therefore it can be argued that they are violating the election laws. Aren\u2019t there sufficient grounds for legal action to be taken against them?",
    "Interestingly, the laws governing the LG and presidential polls will overlap soon when the EC declares the next presidential election. This unprecedented situation could raise a legal dilemma. Will the presidential election laws take precedence over those governing the LG polls, or will the LG election laws apply only to the LG candidates, excluding the political parties and independent groups they represent, in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election? The resulting confusion among the public could undermine the integrity of the election laws and the electoral process besides eroding public trust therein. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a clarification.",
    "All election laws prohibit the misuse or abuse of public property for electioneering, but some questionable practices are prevalent, and, worse, they have been taken for granted. The President, the Prime Minister and ministers use government vehicles and even the SLAF aircraft for campaign related activities which are craftily made to look like official engagements. Needless to say, they do so at the expense of the public amidst a crippling economic crisis. These practices that amount to a blatant violation of election laws must be brought to an end; government politicians who misuse the state machinery, the publicly-owned aircraft and vehicles can carry out their election campaigns much more efficiently than their Opposition counterparts at lower costs, leaving the public to foot the bill. Extraordinary security arrangements for government bigwigs\u2019 travel throughout the country also cost the public an arm and a leg. If the existing laws do not provide for banning such practices, new ones must be brought in to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Curiously, this issue has not been taken up in Parliament. Maybe the Opposition has chosen to remain silent because it is hoping to do likewise in the event of being voted into power.",
    "It defies comprehension why the President, the Prime Minister, ministers and the Opposition Leader should be allowed to use their official vehicles, etc., for political work even during non-election times. They must be prevented from misusing state assets and public funds for their political work. They have a right to engage in politics but at their own expense, and the public, already crushed under multiple burdens including unconscionably high taxes, must not be made to pay through the nose to meet unnecessary expenses. The people\u2019s predicament, which in fact is a double whammy caused by spendthrift, inefficient politicians, is like Saturn, the evildoer, landing in a beggar\u2019s bowl, as a local saying goes.",
