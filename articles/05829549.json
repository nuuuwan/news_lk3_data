    "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Booms and air raid sirens sounded across Israel early Sunday after Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in an unprecedented revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. In Washington, President Joe Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down \u201cnearly all\u201d the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response.",
    "The attack, less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in Syria that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building, marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
    "Condemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France saying Iran \u201cis risking a potential military escalation,\u201d Britain calling the attack \u201creckless\u201d and Germany saying Iran and its proxies \u201cmust stop it immediately.\u201d",
    "The Israeli military\u2019s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Iran fired scores of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles \u2014 with the vast majority intercepted outside Israel\u2019s borders. He said warplanes intercepted over 10 cruise missiles alone, also outside Israeli airspace.",
    "Hagari said a handful of missiles landed in Israel. Rescuers said a 7-year-old girl in a Bedouin Arab town was seriously wounded in southern Israel, apparently in a missile strike, though they said police were still investigating the circumstances of her injuries. Hagari said a missile struck an army base, causing light damage but no injuries.",
    "\u201cA wide-scale attack by Iran is a major escalation,\u201d he said. Asked whether Israel would respond, Hagari said only that the army \u201cdoes and will do whatever is required to protect the security of the state of Israel.\u201d He said the incident was not over, and dozens of Israeli warplanes remained in the skies.",
    "Israel\u2019s military said its Arrow system, which shoots down ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, handled most interceptions and noted that \u201cstrategic partners\u201d were involved.",
    "\u201cAt my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cThanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our service members, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.\u201d",
    "Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke early Sunday, Israeli time, their governments said. Biden said in his statement that he reaffirmed \u201cAmerica\u2019s ironclad commitment\u201d to Israel\u2019s security \u2014 a departure from his growing criticism of Israel\u2019s conduct in its war on Hamas in Gaza.",
    "Iran had vowed revenge since the April 1 airstrike in Syria, which Tehran accused Israel of being responsible for. Israel hasn\u2019t commented on it.",
    "Israel and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel\u2019s six-month war against Hamas militants in Gaza. The war erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials.",
    "Almost immediately after the war erupted, Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group in Lebanon, began attacking Israel\u2019s northern border. The two sides have been involved in daily exchanges of fire, while Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have launched rockets and missiles toward Israel.",
    "In a statement carried late Saturday by Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency, the country\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard acknowledged launching \u201cdozens of drones and missiles towards the occupied territories and positions of the Zionist regime.\u201d",
    "In a later statement, the Revolutionary Guard issued a direct warning to the U.S.: \u201cThe terrorist U.S. government is warned any support or participation in harming Iran\u2019s interests will be followed by decisive and regretting response by Iran\u2019s armed forces.\u201d",
    "IRNA also quoted an anonymous official saying ballistic missiles were part of the attack. A ballistic missile moves on an arch trajectory, heading up into space before gravity brings the weapon down at a speed several times faster than the speed of sound.",
    "Israel has a multilayered air-defense network that includes systems capable of intercepting a variety of threats including long-range missiles, cruise missiles, drones and short-range rockets. However, in a massive attack involving multiple drones and missiles, the likelihood of a strike making it through is higher.",
    "Iran has a vast arsenal of drones and missiles. Online videos shared by Iranian state television purported to show delta-wing-style drones resembling the Iranian Shahed-136s long used by Russia in its war on Ukraine. The slow-flying drones carry bombs. Ukraine has successfully used both surface-to-air missiles and ground fire to target them.",
    "Some Israelis watched the interceptions light up the night sky.",
    "Air raid sirens were reported in numerous places including northern Israel, southern Israel, the northern West Bank and the Dead Sea near the Jordanian border.",
    "Israel\u2019s army ordered residents in the Golan Heights \u2014 near the Syrian and Lebanese borders \u2014 as well as the southern towns of Nevatim and Dimona and the Red Sea resort of Eilat into protective spaces. Dimona is home to Israel\u2019s main nuclear facility, and Nevatim has a major air base. Loud booms were heard in Jerusalem and northern and southern Israel.",
    "The army\u2019s Home Front Command canceled school Sunday and limited public gatherings to no more than 1,000 people. Israel and some other countries in the region closed their airspace.",
    "Earlier, Netanyahu warned: \u201cWhoever harms us, we will harm them.\u201d",
    "In Washington, Biden convened a principals meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the attack.",
    "Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, was in Israel over the weekend consulting with Israeli defense officials. The Central Command oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.",
    "Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a warning to both Israel and the U.S. \u201cShould the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran\u2019s response will be considerably more severe,\u201d it wrote online. \u201cIt is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!\u201d",
    "For days, Iranian officials including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had threatened to \u201cslap\u201d Israel for the Syria strike.",
    "In Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, witnesses saw long lines at gas stations early Sunday as people appeared worried about what may come next. Dozens of hard-liners demonstrated in support of the attack at Palestine Square.",
    "Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported heavy Israeli airstrikes and shelling on multiple locations in south Lebanon following Iran\u2019s launch of drones. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched \u201cdozens\u201d of Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military site in the Golan Heights early Sunday. It was not immediately clear if there was any damage.",
    "Iranian missiles or drones were intercepted in the sky above the Jordanian capital, Amman. In Lebanon\u2019s capital, Beirut, and elsewhere in the country, residents reported seeing missiles in the sky and hearing explosions, likely from interceptions. In Syria, explosions were heard in the capital, Damascus, and elsewhere. Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian air defenses tried to shoot down Israeli attempts to intercept Iranian missiles."
