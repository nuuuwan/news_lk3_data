    "Persons with political connections are the biggest problem for the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) in its efforts at controlling illegal activities in elephant corridors, environmental scientist Hemantha Withanage said.",
    "Speaking at a \u2018Stakeholder Consultation on Presenting Draft Proposals to Mitigate the Human- Elephant Conflict in Sri Lanka\u2019 at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Research and Training Institute recently, Withanage said that they have received 24 project proposals, apart from inputs from more than 5,000 individuals, on issues related to the human-elephant conflict.",
    "Withanage added: \u2018Neither multinationals nor local institutions have come forward to commence crop insurance schemes in Sri Lanka, despite the Asian Development Bank strongly recommending such measures.",
    "\u2018The sole aim of the proposals should be to protect the elephants while making sure no injustice was caused to farmers.",
    "\u2018Studies indicate that the government pays more than Rs. 100 million as compensation annually for victim families.",
    "\u2018The DWC currently administers a compensation scheme for death, injury and property damage caused by elephants, providing Rs. 100,000 in the case of deaths.\u2019",
    "Meanwhile, a DWC official said: \u2018Although there was an initiative to implement compensation and insurance for crop losses, these initiatives have not proved highly successful thus far.",
    "\u2018Between 2011 and 2018, USD 0.76 million was paid as compensation for human deaths and USD 1.7 million for property damage.",
    "\u2018According to records, USD 0.05 million was paid for injuries in 2017 and 2018. Further, it has been estimated that a typical farmer in elephant-affected areas of Sri Lanka loses over USD 200 annually due to crop damage.\u2019",
    "Elaborating further on these issues Withanage said: \u2018Average crop damage due to the human-elephant conflict was calculated as Rs. 230,000 per person during the past five years.",
    "\u2018Average damage to properties was estimated at Rs. 145000 per person. This is a significant loss to be borne by an individual.",
    "\u2018Introducing the farmers\u2019 insurance schemes would be of paramount importance while also promoting sustainable agriculture.\u2019",
