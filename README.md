### World Athletics introduces $50,000 prize money for Olympic gold medallists

*2024-04-10 20:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/World-Athletics-introduces-50-000-prize-money-for-Olympic-gold-medallists/107-280573) · `en`

Paris, April 10 (The Guardian) - Sebastian Coe has defended World Athletics’ decision to break with 128 years of Olympic tradition by becoming the first sport to give athletes prize money if they are victorious in Paris this summer.

Coe said the surprise move, under which gold medal-winning athletes in each of the sport’s 48 events will walk away with $50,000 (£39,360), was merely a reflection that the world has changed and said it was time his sport gave more to its stars.

However the decision clearly blindsided the International Olympic Committee, which has never awarded money for participating or winning a medal, as it believes that to compete at a Games is reward enough.

Asked whether the announcement would violate the Olympic spirit, Coe was clear. “I don’t think it does,” he replied.

Currently cargo ships arriving in Sri Lanka must declare the cargo upon their arrival in territorial waters.

“We plan on getting cargo information 48 hours before the departure of the ship from the foreign port,” Silva said. “That way it is faster for us to do our homework.”

“This way we can do the risk assessment and see if it’s low risk, medium risk or high risk.”

Sri Lanka Customs can then start the process of authorization and documentation before the ship arrives in Sri Lankan territorial waters.

Prior cargo declaration begins from April, and piloting of pre-arrival processing is set to start on May 1.

“The 2nd meeting of the Plantation Workers' Salary Standards Board will be held on the 24th of this month.. All the trade unions should stand up to the labor and use their vote. ”

He said this during a media briefing held at the Colombo Ministry on Wednesday (10).

'Salary Standards Council met today. Nine union representatives participated in 10 unions. Plantation Service Association representatives did not participate. Plantation companies do not come.

On the first day we announced that the salary council would be convened on the 10th. However, the company had announced yesterday (09) that they could not come.

We have been holding talks since last August. Therefore, the reasons that the companies claim to have no timely time are not acceptable.

We have consulted with the Attorney General that there is no legislation on the issue of joint agreement. But companies refuse to come to the joint venture as a legal issue.

### Tamils in the presidential election must prove democratic strength - Sabah Kukadas

*2024-04-10 15:50:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180868) · `ta`

Sabah Kukadas emphasizes the need for Tamils to demonstrate democratic strength in the presidential election, highlighting the importance of unity and strategic decision-making to avoid chauvinism leading to racism.

🟩

Relo's leadership committee member Saba Kukadas said that after the war silence, the people's basic aspirations were not revealed for 15 years after the war.

It is not easy to make a conclusion in other elections.

In the past, the presidential elections have not been racially advantageous but they must unite in the aftermath of the war, but it is imperative that all political parties and civil organizations in the Tamil homeland must unite in the same site to implement this.

The decisions of Tamils must be tactically beyond criticism that chauvinism can turn communalism into racism.

Whatever the decisions of the Tamils in the past, the South has turned it into communalism, for example, the separatism is the reality of separatism.

It is therefore stated that the aspirations of the ethnicity will be made in the international arena and the political liberation of the Tamil people in the international arena and the global regional conversation of the global regional countries.

### Nobel-winning ‘God particle’ physicist Peter Higgs dies aged 94

British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle – the so-called Higgs boson – jointly earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday.

“He passed away peacefully at home on Monday 8 April following a short illness,” the Scottish university, where he had been a professor for nearly five decades, said in a statement.

It called him “a great teacher and mentor, inspiring generations of young scientists”.

“His family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time,” the university added.

Higgs used ground-breaking theoretical work to help explain how the Universe has mass, thus resolving one of the greatest puzzles in physics and earning him a place alongside Albert Einstein and Max Planck in textbooks.

His 1964 theory of a mass-giving particle, which became known as the Higgs boson or the “God particle”, won him and Belgian physicist Francois Englert the 2013 physics Nobel Prize.
