    "I have worked with all the Executive Presidents, except President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in different capacities during my tenure in the public service and even afterwards. The way they managed or rather mis-managed the economy was different from one to the other. The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s management style was unique, flawless and foolproof. He monitored and followed up each and every decision he made.",
    "We used to keep notepads and pens beside our land phones. Mobile phones were not freely available at the time. The phone could ring any time after 4.00 am. The President would direct us to attend to a particular matter. By 10.00 am a second call would come from him, inquiring about progress.",
    "With this system of monitoring and follow up he was able to establish 200 garment factories in the rural countryside, implement the first-ever government sponsored poverty alleviation programme, Janasaviya, one million Housing Programme, Gam Udawa Programme and the Rural Road Rehabilitation Programme within a period as short as four years.",
    "The aforesaid anecdote will serve to show the importance of monitoring and follow-up.",
    "During the past six weeks or so, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) has held meetings with all key Ministries and several other organizations and outlined his government\u2019s plans and expectations. He gave directives related to Agriculture, Education, Power and Energy, Rural Development, Public Service, Exports, Tourism, Industry, Business and Enterprises. the President has underscored the urgency of accelerating and swift implementation of development projects. My intention is to examine how much these decisions have been followed up and translated into action. Considering the limitation of space, I decided to select one area to illustrate this i.e. the devastating flood and the havoc it brought a few days back.",
    "On 14 Oct., the President held a meeting with officials to discuss the flood situation and the measures to be taken. The meeting was attended by the Secretaries to the President and Ministries of Finance, Defence and Disaster Management, Director General of Disaster Management Division, Disaster Management Centre National Building Research Organization and Meteorological Department and Senior Assistant Secretary of the National Disaster Relief Service Centre.",
    "The President has emphasized, at this meeting, the need for a\u00a0specific and sustainable programme to address the recurring flood situation\u00a0in the country. He noted that frequent flooding requires long-term solutions for effective control.",
    "Since then three weeks have elapsed; Rain has ceased; Flood victims are returning to their homes; No news on the emphasis on\u00a0specific and sustainable programmes.\u00a0Maybe it has to be reemphasized when the next disaster strikes. Until then there is no urgency.",
    "Sri Lanka is a blessed island surrounded by Indian Ocean water but, is punished by water \u2013 lack of it, as well as abundance of it. \u201cWater is a gift of nature and its management is man\u2019s (of course woman\u2019s as well) responsibility\u201d.",
    "The recent floods, landslides and the inclement weather brought havoc.\u00a0Occurrence of heavy rainfall, floods and long droughts increased significantly over the recent years. Sri Lanka is being positioned among the top 10 countries at risk of extreme weather events\u00a0by the Global Climate Risk Index.\u00a0Floods are common and widespread among the most frequent weather-related disasters in Sri Lanka.\u00a0Popular and common belief that disasters are natural is misleading.\u00a0 Change of the weather is natural. But the disaster occurs when the weather changes intersects with human activities.",
    "The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) emphasizes that human actions, such as deforestation, urbanization and inadequate infrastructure, worsen the impacts of events like floods, earthquakes and storms. Building in flood-prone areas and settling communities close to rivers and on mountain slopes increases the vulnerability to floods, transforming into a devastating disaster.\u00a0Inadequate building norms,\u00a0marginalisation\u00a0of people and poor choices on\u00a0land-use planning\u00a0make natural disasters worse.\u00a0Change of weather is a given but the disaster that follows can be avoided.",
    "\u2018Climate Change\u2019 has come to the top of the Agenda on international platforms. Human Activity is the Cause of Increased Greenhouse Gas Concentrations. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels, like coal and oil (Sri Lanka is notorious for this), has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0Taken together, these miserable and sometimes deadly effects are what have come to be known as\u00a0climate change. Human activity is the primary driver.",
    "World Bank 2018, South Asia\u2019s Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living Standards. South Asia Development Matters has estimated that 87 % of Sri Lanka\u2019s population lives in moderate or severe hotspots for disasters. Nearly half of Sri Lanka\u2019s population lacks disaster preparedness, a key vulnerability factor aggravated by accelerating climate risks.",
    "All the above findings point to the fact that disasters are not free from human intervention. Then disaster management arguably requires human intervention, too. We human beings, that include the agencies responsible for disaster handling, need to prepare a\u00a0specific and sustainable programme to address the recurring disasters and to minimize the damage caused by them.",
    "It was not reported that any of the agencies present at the meeting with the President held on the 14th\u00a0has commented or qualified the President\u2019s emphasis for a specific sustainable programme. This does not mean that nothing has happened in the past or no institutional and regulatory arrangements are in place.\u00a0Sri Lanka is abundant in the solutions and technologies and legal and institutional network required addressing disaster management.",
    "The government introduced the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act in 2005. The Act provides the legal foundation and strategic directions and proposes an institutional structure and coordination mechanism from national to local levels. A National Council for Disaster Management (NCDM), a high-level inter-ministerial body chaired by the President and a Disaster Management Centre (DMC), was established. Subsequently a separate Ministry for Disaster Management was established.",
    "The National Disaster Management Policy 2013, National Disaster Management Plan (NDMC) 2013- 2017, and National Emergency Operation Plan (NEOP) 2017 have been developed in accordance with the SLDM Act. Several other policies and plans, such as National Climate Change Adaptation Policy and the Plan, Water Conservation policy, Local Government Policy, Flood Protection Ordinance, National Land Use Policy, National Physical Plan and Policy and several sector-specific policies also contribute to Disaster Risk Management (DRM) in the country.",
    "Integrated Water Resources Development: The Way Forward for Sri Lanka to tackle the Climate Crisis-UNDP\u00a0 04 October 2023 suggests \u201cIn moving forward, Sri Lanka requires a two-track approach. First is to invest in our infrastructure. As this requires more funding and time, in parallel, integrated water resource management should be promoted, tapping into Sri Lanka\u2019s 4,000-year-old cascade systems.\u201d",
    "The question is how, when and who would prepare the programme envisaged by the President, follow it up and monitor the progress?",
    "There is already a\u00a0National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP)\u00a0for 2022-2030 prepared in 2022 running into over 200 pages with 8 Chapters, 17 Annexures and 13 Figures. This plan guides all Ministries, Departments, Statutory bodies, officials of sub-national administrations (provincial Ministries and district divisional and local government); relevant officers and personnel from Governmental and UN Agencies, INGOs Non-Governmental organizations; civil-society organizations, private sector, and professional organizations in Sri Lanka.",
    "NDMP would throw a lot of lights in preparation of the programme envisaged by the President. Only drawback is \u201cThe NDMP aims to set the 2030 strategic direction for Disaster Risk Management in the country, in line with the national development vision of the Government,\u00a0\u201cVistas of Prosperity and Splendor\u201d.",
    "A senior officer once told me \u201cChandre, when you prepare a report don\u2019t worry too much about the content. But, make sure you have the picture of the President or the Minister on the front cover\u201d. Following that saner advice one can replace\u00a0\u201cVistas of Prosperity and Splendor\u201d\u00a0with \u201cA Rich Country-A Beautiful Life\u201d.",
    "There are two other plans (perhaps more) already prepared. One is the \u2018National Drought Plan for Sri Lanka\u2019 by the Ministry of Environment in September 2020; the other is the National Emergency Operation Plan (NEOP) formulated by the Disaster Management Centre in 2017.",
    "The President has made decisions; issued directives; plans, policies, agencies, legal and administrative arrangements are in place. I believe that someone with command, clout and the will to organize an inter/multi-disciplinary/agency committee a). To peruse all relevant documents, reports and plans already in place; b). To set a time target and c). To assign the responsibilities to identified agencies/personnel. The Committee would meet from time to time and monitor the progress and provide assistance and instructions to resolve issues that arise during the implementation stage and follow up.",
    "Sri Lanka has rich experience in such arrangements. I remember Secretaries such as Mr. Paskaralingam, Dr. Wickarma Weerasooria, who were known as super secretaries, have revived \u201cSecretaries Committee\u2019 to monitor the progress of directives and decisions made and follow up by resolving issues that arose in implementation. Dr. Lloyd Fernando, as the DG National Planning, facilitated and serviced the Committee. Mr. Dharmasiri Peiris a luminary in the public service, as the Secretary Ministry of Agriculture established a Committee consisting of players at both the centre and the Provincial level to ensure the Agriculture value chain is working smoothly. H. M. G. S. Palihakkara, the most illustrious Foreign Affairs Secretary, established an inter-ministerial Committee to follow up the developments in all the Ministries for the benefit of Sri Lankan Missions abroad as well as the respective Ministries.",
    "This kind of hands-on experience and the experiments would be useful in establishing a mechanism for monitoring and follow up of directives and decisions made by the President.",
