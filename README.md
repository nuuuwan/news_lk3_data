### 2024-11-08 (Friday)

### Does it matter to the world who the next President of the USA is?

*2024-11-08 23:48:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Does-it-matter-to-the-world-who-the-next-President-of-the-USA-is/4-769020) · `en`

While it is unlikely that any well-meaning President would have exercised such powers indiscriminately and without good reason, the overall global situation today of a world near chaos, and the instances of US involvement in numerous countries and in conflicts and their failure to exercise their powers to prevent conflict or at least to minimise them and take the leadership in finding solutions through discussion and negotiation, have left open the question on the effectiveness of the US President when it comes to world affairs

Paradox of Power: Militarily it is a unipolar world of U.S. hegemony; economically it is a multipolar world with U.S. leadership; but on many transnational issues – such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the migration of people, epidemic disease, drugs, and environmental degradation – we live in a world only a step or two short of chaos (https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/american-power-the-world)

### “No criss-crossing between political parties for MPs under AKD’s Govt.” – Sunil Watagala

Putting a halt to crossovers is one of the key promises that the NPP made to people during our election campaigns. Now we are ready to fulfil these pledges through the right process. All our promises to the people have been spelt out in the NPP’s manifesto. When the law is implemented, the Parliamentarians can cross over to any political party that they wish but they will lose their seats at the Parliament. This will be a common law for all political parties

Reiterates that MPs who crossed over will lose their seats under new laws

Confirms NPP has fielded fresh set of politicians who have no corruption charges

Says salaries of NPP parliamentarians will be credited to a public bank

Requests people to vote more for NPP to get majority power in the Parliament

### A new hope to sweep a House clean?

*2024-11-08 23:39:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-new-hope-to-sweep-a-House-clean/4-769018) · `en`

The citizenry vote for political leaders in the hope that ‘this time’ there will be change for the better; and the electorate is disappointed time and again

Ah – yes, the old lie: that the hope of a nation resides in the chamber where chairs are thrown at critics and chillies are employed to evict policemen keen on restoring law and order.

And a major reason for the electorate in general and political pundits in particular being so cynical about the assembly we unmindfully describe as being august is in both the character and performance of the legislators we elected – lest we forget, let us remember and chide ourselves!

As a senior journalist observed in these columns not many moons ago: “Sri Lanka has chronically elected crooks, charlatans, the incompetent, the corrupt, and the utterly unrepentant of their litany of crimes.”

### Muslim Personal Law Reform Action Group has its say over new Govt.’s stance on MMDA

Says Minister Vijitha Herath’s comments that MMDA reforms are not on agenda fails to recognise longstanding demands for change

Muslim Personal Law Reform Action Group yesterday in a statement said that Minister Vijitha Herath’s comments that Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) reforms are not on the agenda fails to recognise longstanding demands for change.

We are deeply concerned about the recent remarks made by Minister Vijitha Herath that no need has arisen to change the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) at this juncture. The comments fail to recognise the long journey towards MMDA reforms in Sri Lanka. For decades, Muslim women and groups have raised concerns about the serious discrimination and harm experienced by Muslim women, girls and families as a consequence of this law. The comments dismiss the grave impacts that Muslim women and girls continue to face on a daily basis due to discrimination under the current MMDA and Quazi system.

There is a regime change in the country. The president, who had carried out racist activities, had to go home.

The Rajapaksa family, who joined him as a group, has to go home.

In that way, the newly elected president in the country has clearly stated that he will not connect with the government, such as corrupt, robbers, rape, and comic recipients.

In that way, when we look at the other parties in the district, there is no such thing as any party to work with the president.
