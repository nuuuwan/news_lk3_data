    "Colombo, Dec 23 (Daily Mirror) - Prisons across the country are facing a serious problem of too many people crammed into limited space. The situation has gotten worse due to increased police operations, with over 10,000 suspects nabbed in a recent crackdown on drugs and underworld activities.",
    "Recent data from the Prisons Department shows that there are a whopping 30,000 inmates detained in 30 prisons across the country, even though these facilities are meant to hold only around 13,000 inmates.",
    "It was reported that more than half of the inmates in prison are awaiting trial, stuck behind bars for a long time because of delays in the legal process.",
    "The Police last week launched an island-wide operation to curb drug-related and underworld activities, where more than 10,000 suspects have been arrested.",
    "Public Security Ministry sources said that those arrested for serious crimes such as possession of drugs will be put in jail, while those accused of minor offences might be let out on police bail.",
    "The prisons were built to hold about 13,000 inmates, but they currently house double that number.",
    "Prisons spokesman Gamini Dissanayake said that to manage this overcrowding, officials are trying to find temporary space within the prisons for suspects who will be held for a short period.",
    "He said some inmates are also being moved to prison camps to ease the pressure on regular prisons.",
    "At the same time, authorities are working to speed up the release of people held for minor offences after their court hearings."
