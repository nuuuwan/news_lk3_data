    "(AP) \u2014 The U.S. military is considering putting armed personnel on commercial ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, in what would be an unheard of action aimed at stopping Iran from seizing and harassing civilian vessels, four American officials told The Associated Press on Thursday.",
    "Since 2019, Iran has seized a series of ships in the strait, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf, as part of its efforts to pressure the West over negotiations regarding its collapsed nuclear deal with world powers. Putting U.S. troops on commercial ships could further deter Iran from seizing vessels \u2014 or escalate tensions further.",
    "The contemplated move also would represent an extraordinary commitment in the Mideast by U.S. forces as the Pentagon tries to focus on Russia and China. America didn\u2019t even take the step during the so-called \u201cTanker War,\u201d which culminated with the U.S. Navy and Iran fighting a one-day naval battle in 1988 that was the Navy\u2019s largest since World War II.",
    "While officials offered few details of the plan, it comes as thousands of Marines and sailors on both the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan and the USS Carter Hall, a landing ship, are on their way to the Persian Gulf. Those Marines and sailors could provide the backbone for any armed guard mission in the strait, through which 20% of all the world\u2019s crude oil passes.",
    "Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP about the U.S. proposal.",
    "Four U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the proposal, acknowledged its broad details. The officials stressed no final decision had been made and that discussions continue between U.S. military officials and America\u2019s Gulf Arab allies in the region.",
    "Officials said the Marines and Navy sailors would provide the security only at the request of the ships involved.",
    "Earlier Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the Navy\u2019s Mideast-based 5th Fleet, met with the head of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The six-nation bloc includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
    "While a statement from the GCC about the meeting did not hint at the proposal, it did say that Cooper and officials discussed \u201cstrengthening GCC-U.S. cooperation and working with international and regional partners.\u201d",
    "The Bataan and Carter Hall left Norfolk, Virginia, on July 10 on a mission the Pentagon described as being \u201cin response to recent attempts by Iran to threaten the free flow of commerce in the Strait of Hormuz and its surrounding waters.\u201d The Bataan passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea last week on its way to the Mideast.",
    "Already, the U.S. has sent A-10 Thunderbolt II warplanes, F-16 and F-35 fighters, as well as the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner, to the region over Iran\u2019s actions at sea.",
    "The deployment has captured Iran\u2019s attention, with its chief diplomat telling neighboring nations that the region doesn\u2019t need \u201cforeigners\u201d providing security. On Wednesday, Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard launched a surprise military drill on disputed islands in the Persian Gulf, with swarms of small fast boats, paratroopers and missile units taking part.",
    "The renewed hostilities come as Iran now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal. International inspectors also believe it has enough enriched uranium for \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear bombs if it chose to build them. Iran maintains its program is for peaceful purposes, and U.S. intelligence agencies assess Tehran is not pursuing an atomic bomb.",
    "The U.S. also has pursued ships across the world believed to be carrying sanctioned Iranian oil. Oil industry worries over another seizure by Iran likely has left a ship allegedly carrying Iranian oil stranded off Texas as no company has yet to unload it."
