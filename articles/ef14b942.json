    "In celebration of World Children\u2019s Day on 1 October, SriLankan Airlines facilitated the flight experience for a special programme organised by Derana TV and Unilever, named \u2018Derana \u2013 Signal Ahasin Gamanak\u2019 for children selected through a creative competition from every province across Sri Lanka. Through this unique initiative, 250 youngsters aged 12 to 15 were gifted the opportunity to enjoy a nearly two-hour flight aboard a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A330-300, with breath-taking views of Sri Lanka\u2019s stunning landscapes from the sky. For many, it was their first flying experience.",
    "The children were warmly welcomed at Bandaranaike International Airport and taken on a guided tour by SriLankan Airlines\u2019 Ground Handling team and Airport and Aviation Services (AASL), where they experienced the full international travel process, from check-in to boarding, before taking off to the skies with SriLankan Airlines.",
    "The flight, which departed from Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), offered a bird\u2019s-eye view of some of Sri Lanka\u2019s most iconic landmarks, including the coastal belt of Colombo, Galle, Adam\u2019s Peak, Pidurutalagala, Sigiriya, Mullaitivu, Delft Island, Anuradhapura, and Negombo, before returning to the airport. The children\u2019s experience was captured and will be broadcast by Derana TV through a one-hour program on 6 October.",
