    "When inquired about the estimated electricity bill to settle the condition of providing a continuous electricity supply to the Esala Perahara, Sri Dalada Maligawa Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela said receiving such an estimated bill is a normal procedure that CEB does before every annual Esala Perahera.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that a discussion will be held soon with the relevant parties for the settlement of the estimated bill.",
    "\"During previous years, the estimated charge was settled by the cost of the CEB. This time the CEB informed that they are unable to settle the bill with their costs. Consequently, we have to come up with a solution to settle the bills,\" Diyawadana Nilame said.",
    "However, the CEB has informed the Sri Dalada Maligawa (The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) to deposit more than Rs. 13.2 million in order to provide continuous electricity supply for the Esala Perahara.",
    "A letter in this regard was sent to Sri Dalada Maligawa Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela on July 13 by the CEB Chief Engineer (Kandy City) A.H.M.H.S. Abeyrathne.",
    "According to the letter, Rs. 13,299,010.99 was assigned for the electricity charges of the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Rs. 3,412,479.29), Sri Natha Dewalaya (Rs. 1,122,145.69), Sri Vishnu Dewalaya (Rs.1,368,385,69), Sri Kataragama Dewalaya (Rs. 1,102,705.69), Sri Paththini Dewalaya (Rs. 1,102,705.69), and including the perahera street lights (Rs. 4,441,373,85). Also included are the charges for the expenses for electricity generators, which are Rs. 479,215.10.",
    "The historical annual Esala Perahera will be held from August 21 to August 31.",
    "According to a close source in the Maligawa, the discussion will be held tomorrow, and the President will announce the decision. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
