    "Economic and social policies based on Buddhist principles were the foundation of peace and prosperity in ancient Sri Lanka. A close examination of this Buddhist foundation would be of assistance to attain, once again, the cherished goal of peace and economic prosperity.",
    "Economic and political theories before Western influence were based on two famous ancient treatises, namely, Kautilya\u2019s Artha\u015b\u0101stra and Brihaspati\u2019s Artha\u015b\u0101stra. They had one common feature, in that, under the title of \u2018Artha\u015b\u0101tra\u2019 both writers had written on politics and economics, leaving out the most important ingredient for any development process, i.e. the mental and spiritual development of man.",
    "Generally speaking, the word attha as \u2018well-being\u2019 relates to the various aspects of man\u2019s socio-economic development \u2013 such as economic prosperity, good governance, education, healthy lifestyle, rule of law and morality. It refers to social progress due to the harmonious unification of all the above factors, contributing to the prosperity and peaceful co-existence of a people. A socio-economic system based on Buddhist principles and practices could easily be formulated to suit today\u2019s modern progressive society.",
    "Current economic thought is based primarily on the works of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, the fathers of the theories of free enterprise and socialism. Neither of these systems pays attention to, nor considers, the inner development of man as an important ingredient in the growth of society. Hence there has been a rapid deterioration in human values and standards of behaviour in societies following these systems. Thus, what the world requires today is a socially stable economic system which yields the highest place to man\u2019s moral development and cultivation of human values.",
    "The Buddha lived in a society entangled and confused by 62 divergent views. The Buddha realized the importance of the external environment created by the laws of a country etc, in assisting the endeavours of the populace in working towards their socio-economic well-being. Hence the Buddha delivered many discourses on how to achieve human well-being through peace and prosperity.",
    "One such is the K\u00fb\u1e6dadanta Sutta of the Digha Nikaya. Therein, the Buddha has explained the importance of equitable distribution of wealth amongst its people, and the satisfaction of the basic needs of the populace, if peace and prosperity, and freedom from crime were to be achieved in a country. More specifically the Sutta indicates how the State could assist the people in their different walks of life.",
    "To quote: \u201cAnd he (King Maha Vijita) had the Brahman Chaplain called and said, \u2018I am desirous, O Brahman, to offer a great sacrifice for my weal and my welfare for many days. Let the venerable one instruct me how.\u2019",
    "\u201cThereupon, the Brahman who was chaplain said to the King thus: \u2018The King\u2019s country, Sire, is harassed and harried. There are dacoits abroad who pillage the villages and town-ships, and who make the roads unsafe. Were the King, so long as that is so, to levy a fresh tax, verily His Majesty would be acting wrongly. But perchance His Majesty might think: \u2018I will soon put a stop to these scoundrels\u2019 game by degradation and banishment, and fines and bonds and death!\u2019 But their activities cannot be put to a stop satisfactorily. Those left unpunished would still go on harassing the realm.",
    "\u201cNow there is one method to adopt to put a thorough end to this disorder. Whosever there be in the King\u2019s realm who devote themselves to keeping cattle and the farm, to them let His Majesty the King give food and seed corn. Whosoever there be in the King\u2019s realm who devote themselves to trade, to them let His Majesty the King give capital. Whosoever there be in the King\u2019s realm who devote themselves to government service, to them let His Majesty the King give wages and food. Then those men, following each his own business, will no longer harass the realm; the King\u2019s revenue will go up, the country will be quiet and at peace; and the populace, pleased one with another and happy, dancing their children in their arms, will dwell with open doors.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen King Maha Vijita, O Brahman, accepted the word of his chaplain, and did as he said. And those men following each his business, harassed the realm no more And the King\u2019s revenue went up. And the country became quiet and at peace. And the populace, pleased with one another and happy, dancing their children in their arms, dwelt with open doors.",
    "\u201cSo, King Maha Vijita had his chaplain called and said, \u2018The disorder is at an end. The country is at peace.\u2019\u201d",
    "For economic stability and well-being, the Buddhist system stresses four factors:",
    "\u00b7 U\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e2na Sampad\u00e2 \u2013 production of wealth through skilled, earnest endeavour;",
    "The Buddha has encouraged the production of wealth by righteous means. There are five forbidden trades according to the Buddhist texts and ancient Kings of Sri Lanka eschewed them in their economic planning. The forbidden trades were trade in arms or weaponry, trade in living beings (slavery, prostitution), trade in meat or flesh, trade in intoxicating and addictive substances, and trade in poisons.",
    "The main economic pursuit was agriculture even during the time of the Buddha. Hence in the discourses many references were made to agriculture. For example, in the Sad\u00e2 Pu\u00f1\u00f1a Pava\u1e0d\u1e0dhana Sutta, it is mentioned that providing irrigation facilities yields increasing and continuous merit. In another discourse it is mentioned that the greatest asset for agriculture is cattle, from which man obtains milk, ghee, curd, butter and they are the best friends of a country. In developing countries, draught power that is provided by cattle and water were considered basic to agriculture. Dairy farming was encouraged to maintain the nutritional level of the people. Hence our ancient kings prohibited slaughter of cattle, under any circumstance.",
    "In the discourse pertaining to a layman\u2019s happiness, domestic and otherwise, (Gahapati Sutta), foremost is mentioned the satisfaction derived by a layman from the possession of wealth obtained through righteous means (atthi sukha). However, the Buddha warns society against the tendency of becoming slave to the accumulation of wealth for its own sake. This would lead to both physical and mental suffering. On the other hand, adequate means of livelihood to support oneself and family, to help relatives and friends, and to distribute among the needy and the deserving, would lead to contentment and inner satisfaction. The latter would form the basis for the moral and spiritual development of man, necessary for greater social good.",
    "What has been righteously obtained should be protected from burglary, fire, floods, forfeitures etc. This is \u00e2rakkha sampad\u00e2. The Buddha has extolled the virtue of personal savings. Hence this also forms a part of \u00e2rakkha or protection.",
    "Obtaining money on credit was prevalent even during the Buddha\u2019s time. Persons like An\u00e2thapin\u1e0dika were the bankers of the day. The Buddhist texts make reference to instances where he gave loans both to the State as well as to ordinary people. However, Buddhism does not approve excessive borrowing. The Buddha advocates a life free from debts (ana\u1e47a sukha) as being conducive to the happiness of a layman. This applies even to a country.",
    "In the discourses of the Buddha, there are details of the proper use of one\u2019s earnings. In the Sig\u00e2lovada Sutta He admonishes Sig\u00e2la to apportion his earnings into four and to spend one portion for his daily upkeep and that of his family, two portions for investment in his business, and to set aside the fourth for any emergency.",
    "The third of the four basic principles for economic stability and well-being is samaj\u00eevikat\u00e2 \u2013 living within one\u2019s means. A person should spend reasonably in proportion to his income, neither too much nor too little. In the discourse relating to the happiness of a household (Gahapati Sutta), enjoyment of one\u2019s income appropriately and wisely (bhoga sukha) is stated as one of the four factors conductive to lay happiness.",
    "The Buddha extols simple living as being most conducive to the development of one\u2019s mind. A society progresses to the extent the mind of the individual is developed. Administration of such a society becomes easy when law and order is well established. Knowing this, ancient kings of Sri Lanka gave much publicity to the contents of the Ariyava\u1e43sa Sutta. In this Sutta, preached by the Buddha for the benefit of bhikkhus, they are exhorted to be content with the robes, the alms-food, and the abodes they receive and to develop the mind through meditation.",
    "The last of the four principles for economic and social well-being is kaly\u00e2\u1e47a mittat\u00e2: companionship or association with the good and virtuous. Such a person or body of persons will always give good counsel and advice on matters of state business or personal life. What King Maha Vijita wanted was a tamasha, in today\u2019s parlance, to celebrate his victories and achievements. His chaplain directed him on the correct path and brought about true peace and happiness to the people of his land through economic prosperity. The King too was humble enough to heed good counsel when given.",
    "By advocating contentment along with increase in production and the equitable distribution of wealth, it is possible to reduce economic unease. At the same time, such action will help to inculcate the value and habit of simple living. With meditation the human mind will advance both morally and spiritually. This will result in reducing social disharmony and insurrection, which arise first in the minds of persons and then manifested externally. Peace and prosperity of a country will be assured. In this process, everyone from the highest in the land to the lowest will have a role to play and will become partners of peace and progress.",
    "(NOTE: This article \u2013 edited and shortened \u2013 is from one written in 2005 as a layman (Olcott Gunasekera), which appeared in Vesak Sirisara of 2549/2005. The contents are relevant today with the country poised for considerable change.)",
