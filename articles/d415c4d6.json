  "original_body_lines": [
    "US President Donald Trump insisted Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not strike Qatar again, after an attack on Hamas last week that infuriated Washington\u2019s Gulf ally.",
    "\u201cHe won\u2019t be hitting in Qatar,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, after Netanyahu failed to rule out further strikes during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem.",
    "The U.S. State Department says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will head to Qatar after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. The visit announced Monday comes as the region is still reeling from Israel\u2019s strike targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha.",
    "The U.S. has sought to ease tensions between Israel and Qatar, two close American allies. Netanyahu and Rubio stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jerusalem and downplayed the furor that had, at least for a short time, taken the Trump administration aback.",
    "There were no signs of U.S. frustration or annoyance with Israel\u2019s latest moves, although President Donald Trump had made clear his displeasure with Israel\u2019s unilateral strike on Hamas in Qatar.",
    "While speaking at a summit over Israel\u2019s attack last week, Qatar\u2019s ruling emir accused Israel of not caring about its hostages held in the Gaza Strip and instead only working to \u201censure Gaza is no longer livable.\u201d"
