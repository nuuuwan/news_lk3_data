    "Professor Mohan Munasinghe, an esteemed academic and Nobel laureate, highlighted the urgent need for a balanced, sustainable approach to development at the University of Colombo\u2019s Annual Research Symposium.",
    "Speaking to a diverse audience of policymakers, academics and students last week, Prof. Munasinghe stressed the importance of adopting \u201cBalanced Inclusive Green Growth\u201d (BIGG) to combat the interconnected challenges of climate change, poverty, and economic inequality.",
    "Munasinghe, known for pioneering the \u201cSustainomics\u201d framework, warned that unchecked climate change and overconsumption by wealthy nations could destabilize ecosystems and deepen global inequalities.",
    "Notably, he said that the world\u2019s wealthiest 1% emit greenhouse gases at 175 times the rate of the poorest 10%, revealing the stark imbalance in resource consumption and environmental impact.",
    "He also spotlighted the \u201cclimate debt\u201d owed by wealthier nations to poorer ones, a debt he estimates at nearly USD 40 trillion due to historical emissions.",
    "Reflecting on his extensive experience\u2014from working on Sri Lanka\u2019s hydroelectric projects to co-chairing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2014Munasinghe advocated immediate action toward sustainability.",
    "This includes transforming consumption habits, embedding ethical values in governance and fostering leadership at all societal levels. Through Sustainomics, Munasinghe proposes that developing countries, particularly in the Global South, could spearhead a shift towards sustainable growth that supports economic stability, environmental protection and social inclusion.",
