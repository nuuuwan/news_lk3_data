    "- Govt. to bring in stronger laws against criticizing religions",
    "- Are attempts afoot to sweep Jerome Fernando\u2019s case under carpet?",
    "In the wake of the recent derogatory and inflammatory statements made by certain individuals against Buddhism and other religions, the Government is mulling enacting stronger laws to ensure that religious harmony is properly safeguarded and upheld in the country.",
    "Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Buddhasasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs Minister said, \u201cThe existing laws in Sri Lanka are not adequate to prevent damage against religious harmony, and thus, new laws need to be enacted.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe as the Government must ensure that religious harmony and peace prevails in the country. In addition, we should also prevent any statement being made leading to communal conflicts or violence,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "He proceeded to say that despite the Constitution stipulating on the freedom of expression and adhering to any religion, no one can downgrade or insult any religion or religious leader.",
    "He also stated that certain fractions had been insinuating to break harmony even prior to the Easter Sunday attacks, which is an easy way to disturb the peace and order of the country.",
    "In that context, he emphasized that they have zero tolerance against individuals who disturb religious harmony and thus should take precautions to annihilate them in order to promote religious coexistence and maintaining peace.",
    "During the last couple of months, there have been incidents where several individuals were arrested over making hate statements against religions. Starting from Sepal Amarasinghe who had insulted the sacred tooth relic at Dalada Maligawa, was arrested.",
    "Then, Pastor Jerome Fernando, in a video insulted the Lord Buddha following which President Ranil Wickremesinghe had informed the CID Director to commence an immediate investigation against him. He is now facing a CID investigation over his hate comments against Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism.",
    "However, in the case of Jerome, serious questions have been raised as to how the Pastor was allowed to leave the country and why the CID acted late in obtaining a travel ban on him from court. By the time the CID had obtained the ban, Jerome, who is said to have strong political connections had already left the country and to this day remains overseas with no mentioned date of his return.",
    "After a few weeks, activist Natasha Edirisooriya, a stand-up comedian was arrested and remanded for making certain disrespectful remarks on Buddhism. On the heels of the incident, Venerable Rajangane Saddharathana Thero was also remanded for having made statements that could disrupt religious harmony.",
    "Meanwhile, Police Spokesman SSP Thalduwa said there are certain laws and acts under the Penal Code and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to deal with such incidents.",
    "\u201cAs such, the police will not tolerate such incidents and hence, will not hesitate to take strict action against them according to the existing laws,\u201d he said.",
    "The Police Spokesman also stated that certain remarks would have led to clashes and violence between religious groups resulting in chaos in the country.",
    "Therefore, the police has requested people not to misuse the freedom of expression by making such disrespectful remarks on any religion. (Darshana Sanjeewa Balasuriya and Sheain Fernandopulle)"
