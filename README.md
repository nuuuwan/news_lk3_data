### Mannar’s wind turbines: Greenwashing on a giant scale

Bad winds blowing around the opportunity cost of green energy

Mannar was a crucial trading post on the Maritime Silk Road, but more recently it was a place hardly on anyone’s radar. Except for birders, that is. Mannar island, to the east, just 30 kilometers in length, less so. But it is now in the crosshairs of major economic forces, with gigantic wind turbines planted in an area where its inhabitants’ lifestyle is being disrupted as they cultivate and go to church, and their children attend school. With this, the greenwashing brigade arrived, talking about ‘climate change mitigation’ and energy security. Converting wind into energy was a noble idea–with a large asterisk.

### MMDA reform is not repeal:  New Govt. must counter fearmongering and resistance to justice

Justice in the context of MMDA reforms will entail treating women and children with dignity, providing equal protection of Sri Lanka law to women and children, ensuring that the MMDA is a Shari’ah compliant Islamic law that strives for righteous living in the interest and wellbeing of Muslims, and realising constitutional guarantees for all Muslims of the country. Reform of the MMDA will represent all these progressive aspects: Islamic legal jurisprudence, constitutional protections, universal human rights and basic human compassion and fairness. Indeed the call for reform is one to strengthen and preserve the MMDA rather than repeal it

The new Government must recognise the current fearmongering campaign for what it is, and confidently advance MMDA reforms

### Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children

The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.

The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to “community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders” and will act as a deterrent.

But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.

The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.

The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the “rights of victims” ahead of “the rights of criminals”.
