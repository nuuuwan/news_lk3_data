    "COYLE inked important Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with two of the biggest business chambers in South Korea during the tour. One notable MoU was with the Chuncheon Chamber of Commerce, representing over 400 of Korea\u2019s top corporations. This partnership is expected to boost trade and investment in various sectors, bringing economic benefits to both countries. Additionally, COYLE partnered with the IMA Chamber of Commerce, which represents over 150 small and medium-sized Korean enterprises (SMEs) operating globally. This agreement will pave the way for Sri Lankan SMEs to access international markets, fostering innovation and sustainable growth.",

These discussions are expected to bring long-term benefits to Sri Lankan industries, particularly in technology and healthcare.",
    "Another key highlight was the delegation\u2019s meeting with the Mayor of Wonju City, where opportunities for business matching were discussed. The purpose of this meeting was to build connections between Sri Lankan and Korean firms across various industries. In total, 200 Korean companies were matched with 32 Sri Lankan representatives within a four day period.",
    "Ultimately, this pivotal trade mission represents COYLE\u2019s commitment to driving Sri Lankan entrepreneurship to the global stage. These partnerships initiated in South Korea are expected to foster innovation and growth and ensure enduring economic progress for both nations."
