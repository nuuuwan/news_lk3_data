    "Vietnam\u2019s VNExpress newspaper reported that 197 people have died and 128 are still missing, while more than 800 have been injured.",
    "In the capital, flood waters from the Red River receded slightly but many areas were still inundated.",
    "In Hanoi\u2019s Tay Ho district, people waded through muddy brown water above their knees to make their way along one street, some still wearing their bicycle and motorcycle helmets after abandoning their vehicles along the way.",
    "A few paddled along the road in small boats as empty water bottles, a stryofoam cooler and other flotsam drifted by; one man pushed his motorbike toward drier ground in an aluminum sloop.",
    "Pedestrians hiked up their shorts as high as possible to avoid being soaked by the wake caused by a delivery truck powering its way through the water.",
    "Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph (92 mph). Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued and rivers remain dangerously high.",
    "The flooding in Hanoi has been reportedly the worst in two decades, and has led to widespread evacuations.",

    "Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall."
