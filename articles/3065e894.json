    "SJB MP Nalin Bandara says all matters relating to holding of two debates will be discussed at meeting.",
    "Emphasises importance of holding a debate between economic councils at this juncture",
    "Assures both debates would take place in May, stating Premadasa is eager to participate",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara in a communique to the rival National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party yesterday has requested a meeting this week to decide on dates for two public debates between the party leaders and their economic councils.",
    "Bandara accordingly requested NPP Executive Council member, Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa to meet him in parliament on either 25 or 26 April to finalise the plans.",
    "The communique was in response to a letter sent by Jayatissa on Monday, requesting the SJB to choose either 7, 9, 13 or 14 May to hold a public debate between the respective party leaders.",
    "However speaking to the media, Bandara said Party Leader Sajith Premadasa is not prepared to take part in a public debate on dates arbitrarily decided on by the NPP. The MP said Premadasa already has many prior commitments on the said dates and will therefore not be available to take part in a debate.",
    "Bandara said during the meeting with Jayatissa he hopes to finalise the details of the public debate including determining if two debates between the leaders and economic councils will be held, dates, venue, broadcast medium, mediator, rules and other relevant aspects.",
    "He also noted that the NPP had failed to mention its stance on holding a public debate between the economic councils of both parties which was the SJB\u2019s initial challenge.",
    "\u201cThey have arbitrarily proposed a few dates for the debate between the leaders. However, there is no mention of the requested debate between the economic councils of both parties. This raises the question of whether Anura Kumara Dissanayake is their sole solution for addressing issues faced by all sectors,\u201d he said.",
    "Bandara emphasised the importance of holding the debate between the economic councils, stating that the primary concern in the country today is its economy.",
    "The SJB MP dismissed claims that the SJB was avoiding holding a debate and assured both debates would indeed take place in May. \u201cWe are prepared for both debates. SJB leader Sajith Premadasa is very keen to engage in such an event,\u201d he said.",
    "In early April SJB MPs Harsha de Silva and Nalin Bandara issued a challenge for a public debate to the economic council of the NPP, which includes members Sunil Handunnetti, Prof. Anil Jayasinghe, and Seetha Bandara.",
    "In response, Handunnetti accepted the challenge on behalf of the NPP and said however the party was keen to hold a debate between the leaders of both parties instead of between the economic councils. The parties have been exchanging letters and rhetoric since then without reaching an agreement on the dates and other related matters."
