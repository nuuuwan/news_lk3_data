### Digitalisation or dependency? Sri Lanka’s AI dilemma beyond AKD’s binary

*2025-09-22 23:54:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Digitalisation-or-dependency-Sri-Lanka-s-AI-dilemma-beyond-AKD-s-binary/4-782027) · `en`

A binary “digitalise or perish” narrative must give way to a measured path

President Anura Kumara Disanayake has cast digital transformation as a stark binary: either embrace artificial intelligence (AI) and modernise, or be “pushed to the margins” of the global economy. His appeal identifies inefficiency, stagnation, and weak public services as consequences of past inaction. This rhetoric mirrors global leaders who treat AI as a “pillar” of competitiveness and a survival imperative.

Yet such framing is both motivational and reductionist. It risks presenting digitalisation as a technological silver bullet, obscuring the deeper questions of sovereignty, governance, and inequality that must shape Sri Lanka’s pathway.

Adam Becker cautions against equating AI with an autonomous “brain” destined to rebel against humanity. The metaphor of AI as a computer like mind is flawed, he argues, and “existential risk” talk distracts from tangible, present day harms1.

### Nepal’s uprising and lessons for South Asia

The uprisings in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka all reveal the same underlying dynamic: a critical 5% of society—small but decisive—determines the trajectory of these crises

Nepal was recently engulfed in a wave of fierce public unrest that forced the Prime Minister to resign. The uprising left vast destruction in its wake: national assets worth millions were lost, and numerous five-star hotels in Kathmandu were set ablaze. Videos flooded social media, showing enraged crowds dragging politicians through the streets while setting their homes on fire.

Observers quickly drew parallels with Sri Lanka’s “Aragalaya” (Struggle) of 2022. Bangladesh too had experienced a similar upheaval, when its Prime Minister was driven to seek refuge in India.

The Doha summit stands as a potent act of collective diplomacy

When Qatar hosted the Arab-Islamic emergency summit on 15 September 2025—just days after an Israeli strike in Doha killed Hamas leaders and a Qatari officer—expectations were high. Could this gathering produce more than a chorus of protest speeches? Would it reshape regional alignments, force policy shifts, or deepen legal and military responses? As the dust settles, Doha emerges as a significant diplomatic moment that combined high symbolism with cautious substance.1

The letter, titled "Attn: The Alleged Victim", which is spreading with the signature of the Inspector General of Police on social media, is fake, police said.

The Inspector General of Police has alleged that the 'Child and Women's Investigation Bureau' has been ordered to arrest domestic and foreign citizens who are involved in viewing, keeping, spreading, distributing or preparing children's sexual abuse pictures and videos.

This is completely false and is a action that deliberately spreads false information. The police chief or any other official section has categorically stated that the letter has never been issued.

Spreading fake documents is legally punishable offense. For official information, the police have asked the public to rely on notifications and media reports directly issued by the Sri Lanka Police Media Unit.. Remble

The commotion agitated from various sects in Sri Lankan society targeted those who visited the State of Israel, including myself, labelling the delegation as those who are on the Mossad payroll, and it further questioned the moral reasoning of the Sri Lankan delegation, pushing them to the darkest corners of hell. While the critics’ right to condemn Israel or anything related to Israel as scum bug is respected, the attendees to the Israel tour should have their own stances, reasoning what impetus drove them to join the delegation, and their side should be heard , at least to emulate the principle of natural justice.

### On Reconciliation: Listening To India Is Always Good For Sri Lanka

*2025-09-22 21:58:21* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/on-reconciliation-listening-to-india-is-always-good-for-sri-lanka/) · `en`

As speculation swirls over whether Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) government will hold provincial council elections next year, a bigger question looms: Will the NPP genuinely move forward with these elections, or is it preparing to abolish the provincial council system altogether, despite repeated assurances? Against this backdrop, India has once again reaffirmed its long-standing position—insisting that the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution is crucial for the country’s unity and stability. India’s recent statement at the 60th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is not mere diplomatic routine, but part of a decades-long commitment to Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process.

### Empowering Rooftop Solar With Smart Battery Storage: An Economic Rescue With Grid Stability

*2025-09-22 21:52:39* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/empowering-rooftop-solar-with-smart-battery-storage-an-economic-rescue-with-grid-stability/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s rooftop solar program has reached 1,700 MW across nearly 100,000 households and buildings. However, due to economic challenges and reduced tariffs for home solar investors, the program has recently slowed. While there is a strong commitment to promoting solar energy, including the President’s recent launch of a 100 MW solar project, its benefits to the public can only be fully realised if surplus power is stored.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has warned that grid instability is a risk when integrating large volumes of solar. This makes storage of daytime generation crucial for evening use, ideally through affordable and scalable methods. Unfortunately, the CEB has prioritised large-scale battery tenders, such as a proposed 640 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which would be funded at public expense. Yet investor appetite remains weak, as financial returns are limited.
