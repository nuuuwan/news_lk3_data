    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has slammed the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP)\u2019s proposal of a \u2018debt audit\u2019 prior to the restructuring of Sri Lanka\u2019s international sovereign bonds (ISBs).",
    "Without naming names, SJB parliamentarian Harsha de Silva told reporters on Wednesday April 17 that \u201csome political parties\u201d have proposed a debt audit to ascertain what percentage of Sri Lanka\u2019s debt was misappropriated or hidden away, after which \u201cwe\u2019ll pay what we can\u201d.",
    "\u201cPlease understand that the global financial market does not work this way. If we took a loan, we have to pay it back. If the money has been stolen, those responsible must be found. That\u2019s a different matter. There is a mechanism to bring such thieves to book.",
    "\u201cBut understand that this issue and our agreement with ISB holders are two different matters. The proposals made by some politicians cannot be done. Restructuring this debt is essential,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "The NPP\u2019s Chief Economic Adviser Anil Jayantha was recently quoted in the media as saying that a future NPP-led government will conduct a debt audit in parallel to Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in conjunction with the island nation\u2019s debt restructuring efforts.",
    "Meanwhile, the NPP\u2019s Sunil Handunneththi, a former MP of the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which controls the NPP, recently intimated in a television discussion that Sri Lanka could casually reach an understanding with its creditors to write off some of the debt.",
    "\u201cBusinessmen who invest in ISBs do so by taking the risk involved. They calculate the interest with the risk included. They have already made that risk back through the interest. If we say we won\u2019t be able to pay off the ISB debt, they will say \u2018it\u2019s okay, machang\u2019, because the interest already contains that risk,\u201d said Handunneththi.",
    "\u201cStupid politicians who don\u2019t know this have paid off the total interest and now keep calculating it saying we\u2019re finished if we don\u2019t pay it. I say that\u2019s the way to negotiate. That\u2019s all we can say to the IMF too. If you\u2019re giving us a loan, go ahead. We\u2019ll pay it back, but give us a fair amount of time to do so. We don\u2019t want conditions,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr17/2024)"
