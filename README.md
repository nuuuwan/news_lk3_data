### Green Tea Scrub

*2024-10-02 23:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/green-tea-scrub/) · `en`

Lots of people talk about the benefits of green tea and, therefore, this week, I thought I should work on green tea for my beauty tips.

You will need 02 tablespoons of used green tea, 01 tablespoon of sugar and 01 tablespoon of honey. By the way, you need to make sure the used green tea is dry but still fresh.

Mix the ingredients thoroughly, in a bowl, until you achieve a paste-like consistency. You can adjust the sugar or honey to your desired texture.

Take a warm shower, or bath, to open up your pores, making your skin more receptive to exfoliation.

Now apply the scrub…gently massaging the scrub onto damp skin, using circular motions, focusing on rough areas, like elbows, knees, and feet.

After scrubbing for about 5-10 minutes, rinse off with warm water, making sure that all residue is removed.

Pat your skin dry and follow up with your favourite moisturizer to lock in hydration.

### Public hearings: A key to ensuring integrity in high-level public service appointments

Parliament in session: A transparent and democratic approach to public service appointments, highlighting the need for public hearings to ensure accountability and integrity

Public hearings are vital tools in administrative governance, providing a formal mechanism for the public to scrutinise the transparency and efficacy of appointments. According to John Rohr in To Run a Constitution: The Legitimacy of the Administrative State (1986), ‘public hearings in the context of administrative appointments serve to ensure that such appointments are not only made in the best interest of the public but also adhere to principles of meritocracy, fairness, and openness, reflecting the democratic ethos of society’

The National People’s Power (NPP) Government inherited an administrative appointment system steeped in nepotism, political loyalty, corruption, and social status markers like caste and race, which often prioritised feudal-like allegiance over expertise, honesty, and integrity.

### AKD needs presidency, not supermajority; Sajith as PM means win-win

*2024-10-02 22:24:10* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-needs-presidency-not-supermajority-Sajith-as-PM-means-win-win/4-767460) · `en`

For roughly two decades (1970-1989), Ceylon/Sri Lanka lived under two consecutive administrations, one centre-left, the other centre-right, led by Sirima Bandaranaike and JR Jayewardene respectively, which possessed a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Those nearly 20 years were the most bloodily nightmarish in our country’s modern history. Why would any rational person want President AKD and his NPP to win a two-thirds majority in Parliament when it inevitably leads to a bad end?

Sri Lanka has the best chance of a win/win scenario it has had since 2009 when we won the war.

In my columns (and sporadic TV and YouTube appearances) early this year on the elections, I made three points.

We should grasp the chance for a generational change of national leadership with Anura and Sajith.

We should end a long dark chapter in our contemporary history by electorally exorcising Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Navigating Sri Lanka’s complex political landscape will require a delicate balance of strategic alliances, visible achievements, and long-term reforms. AKD must manage the expectations of a hopeful electorate while remaining pragmatic about the realities of governance. In the coming months, his ability to lead effectively will determine whether Sri Lanka embarks on a new path of reform and prosperity, or if AKD becomes yet another leader shackled by the limitations of political office. The stakes are high—not just for AKD, but for the future of Sri Lanka

### Our busted bus service

*2024-10-02 21:56:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Our-busted-bus-service/4-767458) · `en`

What we commuters want is an economical, reliable, comfortable, safe public transport system

Bus service was nationalised in 1958 and during early 70s there was a very good bus service in the country when late Anil Moonasinghe was the Chairman of CTB. Most bus stands in towns had a time table, although there were delays, etc. CTB always assured the first and last bus. Then in 1977 the bus service was opened for private sector. That was under the premise competition would give the commuter a better service. Even after nearly four decades we are struggling to experience what can be considered a “transport service” which is reliable and convenient and economical. What we have is far from those basic qualities and in addition what we have is dangerous to all road users and even bystanders.

### Sri Lanka heads for spy shakeup

*2024-10-02 18:14:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-heads-for-spy-shakeup-182024/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s premier spy agency, the State Intelligence Service (SIS), is set for a shake-up under the new government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, according to a source involved in the process.

The agency is to appoint a new head, a serving Deputy Inspector-General (DIG), to replace Suresh Sallay, a controversial retired major general. Sallay was appointed to the top post by Gotabaya Rajapaksa when he became president in November 2019.

With the appointment of a DIG, the SIS returns to the orbit of the police after being under military influence for nearly four years.

Gotabaya had blamed Sallay’s SIS for intelligence failures that led to his toppling in July 2022, following months of street protests against acute shortages of food, fuel, and medicines amid the country’s worst economic crisis.

Rajapaksa’s successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, not only retained Sallay but also granted him an extension after he retired from active service in the army.
