    "200 youth from across Sri Lanka have successfully completed the Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) \u2013 Nursing Care training program, marking a significant step towards better job opportunities both locally and abroad.",
    "The most recent cohort of 55 students received their certificates at a ceremony held in Kandy, with Ambassador of Japan Isomata Akio, as the chief guest, alongside the participation of Embassy of Japan Second Secretary Inoue Hiroki, ILO Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Director Joni Simpson, and officials from National Youth Services Council (NYSC).",
    "This milestone marks the successful completion of the training of several batches of students from Kandy, Matara, Kurunegala, and Pandura. This program, conducted by the National Youth Services Council, and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), empowers youth with critical skills for Japan\u2019s growing nursing care sector.",
    "The SSW program offers a unique opportunity for skilled foreign nationals, including Sri Lankans, to access decent work in one of Japan\u2019s most in-demand industries. At present, Sri Lankans can benefit from employment in 16 identified sectors, including nursing care. While Japan has a set ample quota for nursing care professional from Sri Lanka, only a small segment of the quota has been filled, leaving significant potential for further expansion. Ambassador Isomata Akio, remarked during the ceremony, \u201cJapan and Sri Lanka share a long and incredible history of strong cooperation between our two nations and peoples. The SSW program provides an exceptional opportunity for youth to contribute to both Sri Lanka and Japan, while advancing their own aspirations. To fully benefit from this opportunity, I encourage young people to continuously improve yourself, refine your skills, including your Japanese language proficiency, and strive for ongoing personal and professional growth.\u201d",
    "Migration has long been a key avenue of employment generation, and foreign remittances for Sri Lanka. However, many aspiring and those remigrating face challenges due to lack of awareness and failure to acquire skills and qualifications that would ensure decent employment opportunities overseas. Which often leaves them constrained to jobs in hazardous conditions, low-skilled or semi-skilled categories and low wages.",
    "With the rising demand for care professionals in Japan, ILO\u2019s UPLIFT project is increasing employability and access to labour markets through skills enhancement and work-based learning in the care sector. The project strategy of empowerment through upskilling of aspirant and returnee migrant including vulnerable communities at risk on irregular migration focuses on dual outcomes of securing dignified employment, and safe and regular migration.",
    "ILO Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Director said, \u201cIn the recent years, with the pandemic and the economic crisis, youth have faced numerous setbacks in finding employment opportunities. The Nursing Care Specified Skilled Worker program establishes a critical pathway to securing decent work in the global care workforce. This training program is timely and critical, not only in terms of much needed jobs, skills, and safe migration for Sri Lankan youth, but also for addressing the global demand for paid care services and contributing to gender equality at work.\u201d",
    "NYSC Chairman added, \u201cThis training program marks an important step for NYSC and is a continuation of our efforts in equipping the youth of Sri Lanka with valuable skills and preparing them for global opportunities. Through such strategic collaborations we are empowering young individuals with the tools, knowledge, and opportunities they need to fulfil their aspirations.\u201d",
    "The UPLIFT project is implemented by ILO and IOM and financed by the Government of Japan. The project is among Japan\u2019s key development cooperation partnerships with Sri Lanka in promoting human security. UPLIFT enables Sri Lanka to better respond to the rapidly changing migration landscape by enhancing the skills of aspirant and returnee migrant workers and improving their access to vital information. UPLIFT aims to ensure decent work opportunities and safe migration pathways for all Sri Lankans, aligning with national and global priorities of decent work and sustainable development."
