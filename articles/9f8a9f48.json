This marks a pivotal step towards equitable representation and streamlined decision-making.",

    "In addition to the above changes, the Election Committee for SLC for the year 2025, headed by retired Court of Appeal Judge Ms. Malanie Gunaratne and four other members, was also appointed during the Extraordinary General Meeting.",
    "The election committee will oversee the preparations and conduct the SLC\u2019s upcoming elections, scheduled to take place in 2025."
