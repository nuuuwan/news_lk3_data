    "The radical overhaul and reform of the public service was also one of the priorities in Ranil\u2019s plan of action for the economy and good governance. Its main problem was that it had grown too large -almost one third larger than it needed to be \u2013 and was in need of redefining its role in the face of the private sector coming into various areas of production, distribution and exchange. The public service was sluggish, impervious largely to people\u2019s needs, badly politicized and, as many alleged, often corrupt.",
    "Ranil had me appointed at the beginning of 2002 as chairman of the Administrative Reforms Committee (ARC) with a challenging set of problems to be sorted out. When we in the ARC began closely examining its structure and the manner in which it functioned, we found that Sri Lanka could probably do with a public service of three-fourths of its present size. A third mainly consisting of clerical and support level staff could well be hived out and put into more productive occupations.",
    "The cost of the public service had increased enormously and the pension bill had reached very high levels. In fact, it was being said that each year about a quarter of the entire budget of the country was spent on maintaining a largely inefficient and unproductive public service. The frustration of the political authorities at their inability to get things done effectively and speedily was palpable.",
    "The ARC needed to report to the prime minister and Ranil was very quick in giving our recommendations early approval.",
    "He was quick in realizing the salient points in the recommendations and would substantially contribute to the formulation of the final document. I know that he spent much time and energy interpolating in hand (his hand-writing was difficult to read and often Sandra Perera, who was his confidential secretary, had to be called in to decipher the scrawls and wriggles) various ideas into the body of the text, which were very helpful.",
    "Ranil\u2019s Physical Infrastructure Development Plan containing 64 large-scale development projects from roads, ports, to power was also part of the Regaining Sri Lanka initiative. These included some really futuristic ideas and gave a vivid clue to his thoughts for a refashioned Sri Lanka. Ranil was a modernist in every sense of the word. While many of us of the older generation looked at development and saw its realization in the development of land, irrigation, agriculture and so on, Ranil saw it in different terms. To him, real development and the future of Sri Lanka lay essentially in the service sector \u2013 in banking, finance, tourism, IT, `call centres\u2019 and so on.",
    "He saw Sri Lanka as the \u2018hub\u2019, providing services to the world and the huge Indian middle-class market in particular. He believed implicitly, and his readings in history supported this, that the country\u2019s future was in trade. We had been an important entrepot point for east-west trade in the past. Our strategic geographical location on the tip of India and on the main east-west shipping route made this our natural business. The success of the port of Colombo in providing transshipment facilities for thousands of containers from India for cargo bound to Europe and Japan appeared to support his vision.",
    "He had plans for the expansion of the capacity of the Colombo port. He spent a great deal of time on restarting the integrated development plan for Hambantota in the south of the country combining port development with a coal-fired power project and oil refinery. This would not only \u2018capture\u2019 the merchant shipping, literally in the hundreds, which passed within ten miles of the southern coast of Sri Lanka but would also help kick-start the economic regeneration of the extremely poor, underdeveloped and ill-resourced southern districts.",
    "While the earlier Sri Lankan leaders would have thought of employment generation in rural development, Ranil Wickremesinghe saw it in urban development in the growing towns and cities. His megapolis concept was far out in the future with satellite towns, inner and outer necklace roads around Colombo and a network of expressways to the far corners of the island connecting with these. He was most enthusiastic when discussing such plans. The Land Bridge with India, across the submerged islands of the Palk Straits was one of his pet projects and he made it sound extremely attractive both in concept and in the ease of its execution. He was wont to expatiate on the Land Bridge project extensively in his conversations on Sri Lanka\u2019s long term future with foreign leaders, especially those from the donor community.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign relations took an important dimension during this short period. As the peace process moved on, it became necessary to change the mindset of officials in the foreign capitals of the countries we associated with, in order that they would fall in line with the policy that was being followed at home. In short from fighting terrorism, we had now embarked on a partnership with the LTTE exploring ways in which we could normalize life in the country, and move towards a political negotiation which could lead to durable peace and the restoration of the economy.",
    "This change of ingrained attitudes proved an extremely difficult one to handle. Ranil found that our missions abroad, too, had been strongly motivated in the direction of \u2018wiping out terrorism\u2019. Our missions had been pushing this line with the governments to which they had been accredited.",
    "Making our own diplomats see that there was an alternative approach which was now being pursued at home, meant in fact shifting from \u2018fast forward gear\u2019 to virtually `reverse\u2019. To many in the foreign service who had been strongly influenced to move in the direction of banning the LTTE, moving into reverse proved to be exceedingly difficult. There were always some who did not either catch on fast enough, or preferred not to align, with the changed policy line. This necessitated a great deal of travel by Ranil himself with G L Peiris and Milinda Moragoda, spearheading the new approach.",
    "All the major capitals \u2013 London, Washington, Brussels, New Delhi and Tokyo \u2013 were visited more than once and long and detailed discussions entered into with the prime ministers or presidents. The presentation of the Sri Lankan position at these meetings with the top leaders, as in Washington with George Bush, took the following form. After the usual greetings and photography, Rapil would begin with a short resume of how far we had come and the road blocks to be faced. G L would then take over and in masterly fashion elaborate on the issues up for resolution following the last meeting between the two sides in Sattahip, Oslo, Berlin, Hakone or wherever.",
    "Then Milinda would come in with an \u2018economic needs\u2019 overview and the urgency of resource support. The other side was usually well briefed, with the local ambassador Ashley Wills (US), Stephen Evans (Britain) or \u2018lchi\u2019 Otsuko (Japan) as the case may be, who had flown ahead to his capital adding up-to-the-minute assessments. The questions put to us would be polite, pointed and precise. Ours was usually a well orchestrated, polished performance and well received. An informal, standing, \u2018meet the press\u2019 would follow outside with Ranil exultant, expertly ducking the tough rapid-fire questions amidst the flash of cameras, from half the world\u2019s media.",
    "Quite unexpectedly, although the battle against terrorism worldwide had heightened after 9/11 the terrible Al-Qaeda attack on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington the response of the world leaders in the capitals Ranil visited was not as difficult as he anticipated. Those of us who accompanied him were very relieved that most of the leaders we met such as President Bush in Washington, Tony Blair in London, Atal Behari Vajpayee in New Delhi and the foreign ministers of Canada, Norway, Japan and Australia among others were most encouraging in urging Ranil to move forward in the path he had chosen of negotiation rather than keep pursuing as in the past, the military option.",
    "President Bush\u2019s response, for example, was quite surprising since he had just come through 9/11 and was strongly advocating a global war against terrorism. Tony Blair, however, had the experience of the negotiated settlement in Northern Ireland and was much more positively inclined. What came out of these discussions was not only the strong endorsement of the government\u2019s policy but of the reiteration that Sri Lanka deserved a change to move away from militarization and war and should take its rightful place in the world as a forward looking modern nation ready to engage itself in the emerging economic order of the 20th century. I believe all this struck a resonant note in Ranil\u2019s mind as to the future he envisaged.",
