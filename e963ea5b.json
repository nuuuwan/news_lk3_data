  "original_body_lines": [
    "Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said that laws pertaining to divorce will be amended to meet the needs of modern society.",
    "The Minister divulged this information when the subject of demanding sexual bribes in the state sector was raised during the debate on the Anti-Corruption Bill in Parliament.",
    "\u201cThe new Anti-Corruption Bill comprises provisions to deal with demanding and providing sexual bribes in the state sector. There have been instances where senior male officers have demanded sexual bribes from junior female officers in exchange for transfers and promotions. We have also heard of instances where female officers have harassed other females sexually and have even harassed male officers,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Talatha Athukorala objected to the remark made by Minister Rajapakshe. The Minister at this point related to the story of the husband of an education officer filing legal action against her and demanding a divorce after finding out that his wife had been attempting to have a sexual relationship with another female officer but had been unsuccessful. \u201cUnfortunately Sri Lankan laws do not have provisions for a person to call for a divorce when a person finds out that his or her spouse has been in a homosexual relationship with others. Therefore we have planned to change laws pertaining to divorce,\" the Minister said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
