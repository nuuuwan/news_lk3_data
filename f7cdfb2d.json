    "Allianz Lanka, a member of the Munich-based global insurance powerhouse, Allianz SE, has taken another significant step towards promoting sustainable development and ensuring access to clean water in Sri Lanka. This has been accomplished through the installation and donation of a state-of-the-art clean drinking water system at Ra/Higgaswatta Primary School in Kuruwita in Sabaragamuwa Province. This initiative is in line with Allianz Lanka\u2019s commitment to fulfilling UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 06 \u2013 clean water and sanitation for all.",
    "Ra/Higgaswatta Primary School, which caters to over 1,000 rural students, faced severe challenges with regard to clean water and sanitation. Recognizing the importance of clean drinking water for a healthy learning environment, Allianz Lanka collaborated with the school authorities to address this issue through a new, functional, high-quality drinking water system. The comprehensive system includes a 150ft-deep tube well and a water purifier unit, completed with a modern plumbing system and electric water pump. The initiative was completed and officially handed over to the school on the 10th of May 2023.",

By installing this clean drinking water system at Ra/ Higgaswatta Primary School, we aim to provide the students with a safe and sustainable source of water, enabling them to thrive and fully immerse themselves in their educational journeys.\u201d",
