    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) has announced that candidates who contested in the recently concluded Parliamentary Elections, along with party secretaries and independent group leaders, must submit their income and expenditure reports by midnight on 6 December.",
    "The Commission specified that these reports should be prepared separately and submitted to the Returning Officers in the districts where the candidates contested. National List candidates are required to submit their reports directly to the ECSL. To facilitate the process, special units for receiving election income and expenditure reports have been established in all districts.",
    "These units will remain open until 6 p.m. on normal working days and extend their hours until midnight on the final day to accommodate submissions.",
    "The ECSL has warned that failing to submit the required reports by the deadline constitutes an offence under the Election Commission Regulation Act, and legal action will be taken against violators."
