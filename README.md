### The solution to national issues is essential for a joint operation between the government and other political parties

*2024-11-08 03:35:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198148) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



National issues require joint government-party efforts. Corruption eradication is crucial. New government addresses corruption concerns, arresting former officials. Opposition criticism faces voter skepticism due to slow progress on promised reforms. Minority communities' support uncertain. Constitutional amendments depend on cooperation with opposition parties.

üü©

One of the most important promises of the national people's power was to end the corruption of corruption that has enslaved the country. It was the main reason for the party to have a great glamor on the party. Following the introduction of the open economy in the late 1970s, the government and the private sector have been embraced by the government and the private sector.

Massive development projects and foreign aid gave people the opportunity to engage in corruption. The economic downturn and the risk of people to experience as a result, tightened the commitment to eradicate corruption and eliminate those involved in it.. As a party that never had political power, the national people's power (among the leading parties) was free from corruption.

Recently during the election campaign in Jaffna, president Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that he will settle the Tamil aspirations for autonomy through development. Whether this is an empty rhetoric or serious intent, will have to be seen in times to come. Probably he may be thinking of counterbalancing Tamil nationalism with economic prosperity, similar to that of Scotland and Quebec scenario and present position in Tamil Nadu. Idealistically northern province has to be developed on par with southern province, which has seen in recent years mega projects such as deep sea port, international airport, expressway, extension of railway and cricket stadium and several minor ones. Realistically this may not happen as firstly there are no resources, and secondly no willingness as focus is on southern electorate.
