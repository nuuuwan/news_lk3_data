    "Last summer, a woman was arrested at Gatwick Airport after she arrived from Nigeria with a very young baby girl.",
    "The woman had been living in West Yorkshire with her husband and children, and before leaving the UK for Africa had told her GP she was pregnant.\u00a0 That was not true.",
    "When the woman returned about a month later with the baby, she was arrested on suspicion of trafficking.",
    "The case, the second the BBC has followed through the Family Court in recent months, reveals what experts say is a worrying trend of babies possibly being brought to the UK unlawfully \u2013 some from so-called \u201cbaby factories\u201d in Nigeria.",
    "The woman, who we are calling Susan, is Nigerian, but had been living in England since June 2023, with her husband and children.",
    "A careworker with leave to remain in Britain, Susan claimed she was pregnant. But scans and blood tests showed that wasn\u2019t true. Instead, they revealed Susan had a tumour, which doctors feared could be cancerous. But she refused treatment.",
    "Susan insisted her previous pregnancies had been invisible on scans, telling her employer, \u201cmy babies are always hidden\u201d. She also claimed she\u2019d been pregnant for up to 30 months with her other children.",
    "Susan had travelled to Nigeria in early June 2024, saying she wanted to have her baby there, and then contacted her local hospital in Britain, to say she had given birth.\u00a0Doctors were concerned and contacted children\u2019s services.",
    "Arriving back in the UK with the baby girl \u2013 who we\u2019re calling Eleanor \u2013 Susan was stopped and arrested by Sussex Police.",
    "She was bailed and the lead police force on this confirmed there is no active investigation at the moment.\u00a0After her arrest, Susan, her husband, and Eleanor were given DNA tests. Eleanor was taken to foster carers.\u00a0\u201cWhen the results show that I am Eleanor\u2019s mother, I want her to be returned immediately,\u201d Susan said.",
    "But the tests showed the baby had no genetic link with Susan or her husband. Susan demanded a second test \u2013 which gave the same result, and then she changed her story.",
    "She\u2019d had IVF treatment before moving to Britain in 2023 with a donor egg and sperm, she said, and that\u2019s why the DNA tests were negative.",
    "Susan provided a letter from a Nigerian hospital, signed by the medical director, saying she\u2019d given birth there, as well as a document from another clinic about the IVF treatment to back up her claims.",
    "She also provided photos and videos which she said showed her in the Nigerian hospital\u2019s labour suite. No face is visible in the images and one showed a naked woman with a placenta between her legs, with an umbilical cord still attached to it.",
    "The Family Court in Leeds sent Henrietta Coker to investigate.",
    "Ms Coker, who provides expert reports to family courts in cases like this, has nearly 30 years experience as a social worker. She trained in Britain, and worked in front-line child protection in London, before moving to Africa.\u00a0 Ms Coker visited the medical centre where Susan claimed she\u2019d had IVF. There was no record of Susan having had treatment there \u2013 staff told her the letter was forged.",
    "She then visited the place Susan said she\u2019d given birth. It was a shabby, three bedroom flat, with \u201cstained\u201d walls and \u201cdirty\u201d carpets.",
    "There Ms Coker was met by \u201cthree young teenage girls sitting in the reception room with nurses\u2019 uniforms on\u201d.\u00a0 She asked to speak to the matron and was \u201cushered into the kitchen where a teenage girl was eating rice\u201d.",
    "Ms Coker then tracked down the doctor who\u2019d written a letter saying Susan had given birth there. He said, \u201cYes, someone had given birth\u201d.",
    "Ms Coker showed him a photograph of Susan, but it wasn\u2019t her, the doctor said.\u00a0 \u201cImpersonating people is common in this part of the world,\u201d he told Ms Coker, suggesting that Susan might have \u201cbought the baby\u201d.",
    "Henrietta Coker has decades of experience as a social worker [BBC]",
    "The practice of \u201cbaby farming\u201d is well known in West Africa, Ms Coker later told the court. At least 200 illegal \u201cbaby factories\u201d have been shut down by the Nigerian authorities in the last five years, she said.",
    "Some contained young girls who\u2019d been kidnapped, raped, and forced to give birth repeatedly.\u00a0 \u201cSometimes these girls are released,\u201d Ms Coker said, \u201cother times they die during childbirth, or are murdered and placed in the grounds of the organisation.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s not clear where baby Eleanor might have come from \u2013 though the doctor told Ms Coker he believed she would have been given up voluntarily.\u00a0 Ms Coker was unable to establish who Eleanor\u2019s real parents are.",
    "She gave evidence to the Family Court in Leeds in March this year, along with Susan, her husband, her employer and a senior obstetrician.",
    "At an earlier hearing the judge asked for Susan\u2019s phone to be examined. Investigators found messages which Susan had sent to someone saved in her address book as \u201cMum oft [sic] Lagos Baby\u201d.",
    "About four weeks before the alleged date of birth Susan wrote a text message which read:",
    "Assuming those sums to be Nigerian Naira, they would be in the region of \u00a31,700 and \u00a385 respectively, the Family Court judge, Recorder William Tyler KC said.",
    "The local authority pointed out the messages were set to \u201cautomatic self-destruct mode\u201d \u2013 and said they represented evidence of a deal to purchase a baby.",
    "Susan tried to explain the messages in court. The Recorder said her attempts were \u201cdifficult to follow and impossible to accept\u201d.",
    "Recorder Tyler, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, found Susan had \u201cstaged a scene\u201d which she falsely claimed showed her giving birth to Eleanor in Nigeria.",
    "He said Susan and her husband had put forward a \u201cfundamental lie\u201d to explain how Eleanor came to be in their care, and had tried to mislead authorities with false documents.",
    "They\u2019d both caused the little girl \u201csignificant emotional and psychological harm\u201d, he said.",
    "In early July, the BBC attended the final hearing in Eleanor\u2019s case, held remotely.",
    "In one little square of the Teams meeting we could see Susan and her husband, sitting upright, barely moving, focused closely on what the advocates said.",
    "They wanted Eleanor returned to them. Their barristers said their own children were thriving \u2013 they wanted to offer her the same love and care.",
    "Susan\u2019s husband saw Eleanor as \u201ca fundamental part of their family unit\u201d.",
    "Vikki Horspool, representing the child\u2019s guardian, a social worker from the Independent Children and Family Child Advisory Service challenged that. She said that the couple \u201ccontinued to be dishonest\u201d about Eleanor\u2019s real start in life and how she came to be in their care.",
    "The judge ordered that baby Eleanor be placed for adoption, and also made a \u201cdeclaration of non parentage\u201d. He said he was aware of the \u201cpain\u201d this would cause Susan and her husband.",
    "The barrister for the local authority told the court that the baby is \u201cvery settled\u201d with her foster carer, taking part in activities in her community and getting medical treatment.",
    "When Eleanor is adopted she will have a new identity and British nationality \u2013 but she may never know who her real parents are.",
    "Eleanor\u2019s story echoes the case of\u00a0 \u2018Lucy\u2019 \u2013 who was brought into Manchester Airport in 2023, by a man claiming to be her father.",
    "Ms Coker believes it is likely that more children have been brought unlawfully to the UK from West Africa. She told the BBC she has worked on around a dozen similar cases since the pandemic. In her experience, baby trafficking is commonplace.\u00a0 \u201cMoney is getting exchanged for children on a large scale\u201d she said \u2013 not just in Africa but \u201cacross the global south\u201d.",
    "Since 2021 the UK government has restricted adoptions from Nigeria, partly because of \u201cevidence of organised child trafficking\u201d within the country.\u00a0 British authorities have been aware of the problem for many years, and there have been several cases in the Family Courts over the last 20 years.",
    "Two hearings in 2011 and 2012 involved Nigerian couples who had fertility treatment that led to a miracle baby. These \u201ctreatments\u201d continue, as recently exposed by investigative journalists at BBC Africa Eye.",
    "In 2013, the UK High Commission in Lagos required DNA tests in certain circumstances before newborn babies could be taken from Nigeria to Britain.",
    "Among 12 couples investigated was a former Oxford academic, prosecuted for immigration offenses.\u00a0However this process has been stopped. In 2018 officials were advised that such DNA testing was unlawful.",
    "They were told they could not make people undergo DNA testing when they were asking for a visa or passport in support of an application relating to immigration status \u2013 and that had been the case since 2014.",
    "Ms Coker said some clinics offer \u201cpackages\u201d that include registering the baby\u2019s birth. It will cost anywhere between \u00a32,000 and \u00a38,000, excluding any airfare, she said.",
    "She thinks more people in Britain should be aware of this activity.",
    "It is hard to tackle, she said \u2013 perhaps DNA testing of newborn babies and purported parents would help.",
    "But she wasn\u2019t sure the British government can do much to stop it, she said, \u201cthe issues start in countries where the children are born\u201d.",
    "Patricia Durr, CEO of the anti-trafficking charity ECPAT said cases like this were particularly \u201cheinous\u201d because they denied a child right to their identity.",
    "She said: \u201cEvery effort must be made to prevent these egregious crimes occurring.\u201d",
    "A government spokesperson said: \u201cFalsely claiming to be the parent of a child to facilitate entry to the UK is illegal. Those found doing so will face the full force of the law.",
    "\u201cBorder Force is committed to protecting individuals who cross the border and where concerns are raised, officers will take action to safeguard individuals who could be at risk.\u201d",
    "The BBC contacted the Nigerian High Commission for comment but they did not respond.",
