    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s party has scored a historic victory in the Tamil-dominated northern province of Jaffna, paving the way for a significant majority in Parliament, where it previously held just three seats.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s National People\u2019s Power (NPP) emerged as the largest single party in the cultural capital of the minority Tamils, where traditional parties were deeply divided.",
    "Official results show that Thursday\u2019s election victory for the NPP in Jaffna marks the first win by a southern party in the region since the introduction of the new proportional representation system under the 1978 Constitution.",
    "Since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, no southern party has politically dominated the north.",
    "However, in the 1947 state council elections, the United National Party (UNP) won seats by fielding Tamil candidates.",
    "When President Dissanayake visited Jaffna at the weekend to address a rally, he was criticized for allegedly bussing in crowds from outside the peninsula.",
    "Nevertheless, the election results demonstrated his popularity, despite the nationalistic moves made by his JVP (Janatha Vimukti Peramuna) party in the past.",
    "Prior to Dissanayake taking leadership of the JVP, the party opposed a Norwegian-backed ceasefire with the Tamil Tiger guerrillas and supported the military campaign of their then ally, President Mahinda Rajapaksa who crushed the Tamil Tigers in May 2009.",
    "The JVP also petitioned the Supreme Court and successfully secured the de-linking of the eastern province from the north.",
    "This move resulted in the creation of two separate provincial councils for the northern and eastern provinces, rather than a single, larger North-East council. The decision was met with fierce opposition from Tamil political parties. (Colombo/Nov 15/2024)"
