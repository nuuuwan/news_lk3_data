    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Police Minister Tiran Alles denied allegations that he used shell companies to own properties in London in response to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\u2019 (ICIJ) Pandora Papers findings.",
    "An ICIJ analysis of the leaked records and the United Kingdom\u2019s public property register shows that Alles, a media tycoon and politician, owns two British Virgin Islands companies that hold properties in London.",
    "The\u00a0Pandora Papers\u00a0are findings of 11.9 million leaked documents obtained by\u00a0ICIJ that were at the core of a 2021 global investigation exposing the financial deals and hidden assets of politicians, celebrities, business people and criminals in more than 200 countries.",
    "The files came from 14 offshore service providers that specialized in setting up shell companies and trusts in tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions.",
    "Alles said the allegations had originated from local sources and said he did not respond to an ICIJ email on the allegation.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t even reply. Just because a journalist from Washington or somewhere writes to me, I\u2019m not there to reply any of those. Let them investigate, he told reporters on Thursday (21) when he was questioned over the ICIJ findings.",
    "\u201cI am not going to comment on all this crap. The only thing I am going to say is I\u2019m happy that I have been looking at all these posts what they put,\u201d he said referring to the local sources who he believes to have given false information about him.",
    "ICIJ\u2019s analysis has found that Alles\u2019 Brompton Properties Ltd. owns a flat in an affluent area of London that was purchased for about $960,000 in 2006.",
    "His second company, Banham Ventures Ltd., the ICIJ findings said, has owned a separate property near the city\u2019s posh Chelsea neighborhood since 2008. They said the U.K. records had not listed the purchase price.",
    "The funds used to finance the BVI companies came from Alles\u2019 work as a businessman, according to a declaration in the leaked files.",
    "Alles, 63, entered politics in 2010, after a stint as the head of the Civil Aviation Authority. He was appointed Sri Lanka\u2019s public security minister in charge of the police last year.",
    "When asked if he would like to respond to the ICIJ\u2019s findings, he said: \u201cWho are they? They\u2019re a bunch of journalists. Just because they are international journalists, they\u2019re like you all.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer anything on that. I can also say I am an investigative journalist and write something about someone. In their report did you see they have all those companies and they say they have not been able to get any details?\u201d (Colombo/Dec 27/2023)"
