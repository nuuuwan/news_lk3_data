    "The stock market got off to a positive start yesterday mainly due to banking sector counters performing well throughout the day. A Central Bank\u2019s recent analysis revealed that the local banking sector has a healthy outlook and need not require any capital infusion from the government to run and operate. This factor stimulated the market, analysts said.",
