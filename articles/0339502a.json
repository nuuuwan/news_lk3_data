  "original_body_lines": [
    "President-elect Donald Trump has said he will look at pardons for those involved in the 2021 US Capitol riot on his first day back in office next month.",
    "\u201cThese people are living in hell,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press in his first broadcast network interview since winning November\u2019s election.",
    "The Republican also vowed to end automatic citizenship for anyone born in the country, but offered to work with Democrats to help some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children.",
    "In the wide-ranging sit-down, which was recorded on Friday, Trump promised to issue \u201ca lot\u201d of executive orders, including on immigration, energy and the economy, after he is inaugurated on 20 January.",
    "While he suggested he would not seek a justice department investigation into Joe Biden, he said that some of his political adversaries, including lawmakers who investigated the Capitol riot, should be jailed.",
    "Trump was asked whether he would seek to pardon the hundreds of people convicted of involvement in that riot, when supporters of his stormed Congress three months after his defeat in the 2020 election.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at independent cases,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m going to be acting very quickly.\u201d",
    "Trump continued: \u201cYou know, by the way, they\u2019ve been in there for years, and they\u2019re in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to be open.\u201d",
    "The president-elect made other news in the NBC interview aired on Sunday:",
    "He offered a caveat on whether he would keep the US in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato): \u201cIf they\u2019re paying their bills, and if I think they\u2019re doing a fair - they\u2019re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely, I\u2019d stay with Nato.\u201d",
    "Trump said he would not seek to impose restrictions on abortion pills, though when asked to make a guarantee, he added: \u201cWell, I commit. I mean...things change.\u201d",
    "The Republican said Ukraine should \u201cprobably\u201d expect less aid when he returns to the White House.",
    "Trump said he thinks \u201csomebody has to find out\u201d if there is a link between autism and childhood vaccines - an idea that has been ruled out by multiple studies around the world. Trump suggested his nominee for health secretary, vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, would look into the matter.",
    "The president-elect repeated his promise that he will not seek to cut Social Security, nor raise its eligibility age, though he said he would make it \u201cmore efficient\u201d, without offering further details.",
    "Pressed on whether his plan to impose tariffs on imports from major US trading partners would raise consumer prices for Americans, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything. I can\u2019t guarantee tomorrow.\u201d",
    "On the subject of immigration, Trump told NBC he would seek through executive action to end so-called birthright citizenship, which entitles anyone born in the US to an American passport, even if their parents were born elsewhere.",
    "Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that \u201call persons born\u201d in the United States \u201care citizens of the United States\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get it changed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it.\u201d",
    "Trump also said he would follow through on his campaign pledge to deport undocumented immigrants, including those with family members who are US citizens.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be breaking up families,\u201d he said, \u201cso the only way you don\u2019t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\u201d",
    "Trump also said he wants to work with Congress to help so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were shielded under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Trump once attempted to scrap.",
    "\u201cI will work with the Democrats on a plan,\u201d he said, adding that some of these immigrants have found good jobs and started businesses.",
    "Trump seemed to offer mixed signals on whether he would follow through on his repeated vows to seek retribution against political adversaries.",
    "Outgoing US President Joe Biden this week issued a sweeping pardon to his criminally convicted son, Hunter. The Democrat is reported to be considering other blanket pardons for political allies before he leaves office next month.",
    "Trump seemed to indicate that he would not seek a special counsel investigation into Biden and his family, as he once vowed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success.\u201d",
    "But he also said that members of the now-defunct, Democratic-led House of Representatives committee that investigated him \u201cshould go to jail\u201d.",
    "One member of the panel, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, hit back at Trump on Sunday.",
    "She said his comment that members of the committee should be jailed was a \u201ccontinuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic\u201d.",
    "In his NBC interview Trump also said he would not direct the FBI to pursue investigations against his foes.",
    "But he also told the network: \u201cIf they were crooked, if they did something wrong, if they have broken the law, probably.",
    "\u201cThey went after me. You know, they went after me, and I did nothing wrong.\u201d"
