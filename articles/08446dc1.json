    "He hopes that National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) makes positive statements regarding his visit to India and understands the need of investors in Sri Lanka, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said that whoever had invited AKD to India, had done a good thing.",
    "\"AKD might have gained a vast amount of experience over the need for investors in our country from any country in the world, including India. After experiencing the development of India's energy sectors, I don't think that AKD would get a chance to chase away the investors who are coming to the country.",
    "\"AKD dressed according to the European dress code, ignoring his traditional dress. I don't think his trade unions understand how he behaves,\" he said.",
    "It is very common to see political parties visit India every month, but this is the first time that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is in India, he said.",
    "\"It is good to hear of AKD's visit to India. But it is hard to figure out whether AKD represents the NPP or the JVP on his visit to India, he added.",
    "\"However, it is very good to see AKD's visit to India. I'm waiting to hear a positive response about his tour and about the Indian investors coming to Sri Lanka,\" Minister Wijesekera added."
