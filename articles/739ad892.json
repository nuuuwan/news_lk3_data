    "The direction being taken now by Israel is to totally disregard the status, wishes and above all the dignity and self-respect of the Palestinians, and usher a one-sided \u201cJewish\u201d solution",
    "On 21 November 1938, Hitler met with the South African defence minister Oswald Pirow and told him that the Jews would be killed if war broke out. The same month, an official of Hitler\u2019s chancellery told a British diplomat of German plans \u201cto get rid of [German] Jews, either by emigration or if necessary, by starving or killing them\u201d to avoid \u201chaving such a hostile minority in the country in the event of war\u201d \u2013 Wikipedia",
    "\u201cWe can\u2019t finish the war without eliminating Hamas leadership\u201d \u2013 Prime Minister Netanyahu (https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/ politics/ 1707129128-gantz-denies-plan-to-replace-netanyahu-through-likud-report)",
    "One wonders how many ordinary Palestinians have to be killed and starved to death to eliminate the Hamas leadership. So far, more than 60,000 Palestinians including some 17,000 children have been killed by Israel, leaving the world wondering how many more have to be killed, either by shooting them or starving them to death to \u201celiminate the Hamas leadership\u201d. It is ironical that Hamas, a group that Israel provided behind the scenes support to pursue their mutual common objective of opposing a two-State solution, is now hounded by the one-time supporter. Information relating to this unholy alliance is noted later in this article along with several references relating to how Israel supported, and in a way, nurtured Hamas.",
    "Israel\u2019s strategy now is clearly the total annihilation of Gaza without any concern for human life there in the guise of \u201celiminating the Hamas leadership\u201d. The total destruction of Gaza and the starvation of the Palestinians still living there, barely, as evident from the many images the world is seeing daily, does not leave any doubt as to the objectives of the leadership of Israel. The plight of Palestinians in Gaza has no parallel.",
    "It appears that the leadership of Israel has learnt some diabolical lessons from their one-time enemy number one, Adolf Hitler, and today, are killing and starving Palestinians \u201cto avoid having a hostile minority\u201d that is a threat to Israel.",
    "The people of Israel have dug their own reputation to the ground by allowing a minority of hardline extremists to tarnish the reputation of the entire country. Quite possibly, because of the horrific annihilation of the entirety of Gaza, the number of civilians massacred, including 17,000 children, there may be some who could be wondering whether Hitler was right about the Jews. God forbid; one hopes that kind of thinking never happens as there is no comparison with the mentality and actions of Hitler. However, the absolute misery caused to Palestinians by Israel and which continues unabated, the deliberate starvation caused and Israel\u2019s denial of it although the entire world can see it happening live on virtually all TV channels of the world, makes one wonder whether there is a difference in effect as to what happened to the Jews during the second world war and what is now happening to the Palestinians in Gaza.",
    "The Israeli/Palestine conflict is far too steeped in history, ancient as well as more contemporary history, and they are seeking a solution based on history, rather than the future. An account of the ancient history was mentioned by the writer in an article tiled Israel-Palestine conflict: Looking to future rather than past (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Israel-Palestine-conflict--Looking-to-future-rather-than-past/4-779177, https://slguardian.org/israel-palestine-conflict-a-federal-political-model-as-a-solution/). In this article, a federal solution rather than a two-State solution, as a way forward rather than a way to go backwards to the past was discussed.",
    "In relation to the more contemporary history, a previous article titled Israel and Hamas; Strange bed fellows fallen out with each other? (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Israel-and-Hamas-Strange-bed-fellows-fallen-out-with-each-other/4-756400) highlighted the initial unofficial, mutually symbiotic relationship between Israel and Hamas. Both parties opposed a two-State solution, and that concept became the common enemy of both Israel and Hamas, and it had given rise to the relationship between the two parties.",
    "In several articles which are quoted here again (see below), the history of that understanding and even support, including financial support given to Hamas by Israel is noted. Israel\u2019s policy of divide and rule, an ancient, time tested strategy was used to divide Palestinians into two camps, the Palestinian Authority (which had agreed through US sponsored talks, to accept Israel\u2019s right to exist in exchange for a two-State solution), and Hamas which opposed both, to serve Israel\u2019s behind the scenes position of opposition to a two-State solution and instead, the complete subjugation of Palestinian territory to Israel control.",
    "Hamas has roots watered by Israeli funding, former military governor of Gaza admits",
    "\u201cDivide and Rule\u201d: How Israel Helped Start Hamas to Weaken Palestinian Hopes for Statehood",
    "Why a two-State solution will not be a long-lasting, sustainable solution",
    "Based on ancient history, as that appears to be the justification for Israel to have total control of all of Palestine, a two-State solution will not be a long-term sustainable solution. The biggest military, political and financial backer of Israel is the USA (The Council on Foreign Relations says Israel has been the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since its founding, receiving about $ 310 billion (adjusted for inflation) in total economic and military assistance (https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts), and it is certain that this situation will continue, and this relationship will become stronger.",
    "It is not conceivable that an Independent Palestinian State will receive the degree of military, political and financial support they need from other countries including China, Russia and India, the other major powers, to survive as an independent State able to defend itself against Israel. Whilst it is unlikely, they may provide that support if it\u2019s to their benefit. But, faced with the reality that the USA is the superpower of the world, and will remain for the foreseeable future as the closest ally of Israel, it seems unlikely they would wish to engage in a very long-term plan to build Palestine from virtual scratch to a power which could defend itself against a US-backed Israel. Countries agitating for a two-State solution as the way out of the current morass should give serious thought to the plight of a relatively helpless Palestine State.",
    "A two-State solution will work if the State of Palestine functions as a vassal state of Israel, subordinate to the more powerful Israel. This of course is pure fantasy if one were to consider the actions of Hamas against Israel. A solution should not give rise to another problem, and a two-State solution, without the necessary real guarantees of support to Palestine, will not be a solution.",
    "Currently, the State of Palestine is recognised as a sovereign nation by 147 of the 193 UN member states, representing 75% of the international community. It is also recognised by the Holy See, the governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, which holds UN observer status.",
    "Despite this recognition, no country or a group of countries amongst those who have recognised it as an independent State, have managed to stop or at least deter and minimise the total annihilation of Gaza by Israel. They have not managed to stop Israeli settlement spread in official Palestinian territory, including in areas supposedly under the control of the Palestinian Authority. The expansion of effective Israel control of Palestinian territory is evident from the given illustration. Unless the USA recognises an independent Palestinian State, or other emerging and regional powers are able to exert enough influence as rival power groups, to dilute the support the USA gives Israel, having an independent Palestinian State will be an ineffectual, short-lived solution.",
    "The power of Israel, thanks mainly to the rich and influential Jews who wield enormous power in the US and who keep the US as its main ally, politically, economically and militarily, gives Israel a near cart blanche support to further their claim that the entire Palestinian region is Jewish territory. Virtually all countries who have recognised the State of Palestine have traded with Israel, with some of them providing various components for their military equipment which has been used to decimate Gaza. The impotency of the Arab nations, rich and powerful in their own right, in not being able to support their fellow Arab brethren in Palestine has led to the strengthening of the Israeli strategy of annihilation of Palestine. This makes the task easier for Israel as they can and as the world has witnessed, to proceed with their final solution which is to \u201cconquer\u201d the only bit of resistance that Palestinians have been able to muster to at least slow the Israeli violence.",
    "The direction being taken now by Israel is to totally disregard the status, wishes and above all the dignity and self-respect of the Palestinians, and usher a one-sided \u201cJewish\u201d solution. So far, the rest of the world has shown their impotence in not exerting any action to deter the violence perpetrated by Israel, except paying lip service, and not doing anything material to deter Israel and its genocidal campaign.",
    "It is convenient for Israel and their supporters to blame Hamas for the violence that ensued after 7 October. It is not of any concern or consequence to them that 60,000 innocent Palestinians, including 17,000 children have paid a price with their lives, and their homes and livelihoods have been totally destroyed by Israel. It is not of any consequence to them that there is mass starvation of Palestinians, with many dying of it. It is despicable that other countries who are able to send ships and other transport with food and medicines for the Palestinians in Gaza have not done so and are asking Israel for permission to do so, when Israel has no right to deny the right of access to Gaza to any other country to move food, water and medicines for the starving and dying people in Gaza.",
    "What could be a longer-term, sustainable futuristic solution? A federal model as a solution?",
    "In the longer term, the expansionistic objective of Israel and the total subjugation of Palestine will not be a solution, as neither the long-term security of Israel nor the dignity and rights of the Palestinians will be addressed through a one-sided solution. A genuine long-term solution will require compromise from both sides and a look to the future as a solution and not an ever-festering, challenged version of history as a path towards a solution.",
    "Insecurity of Israel will not be just its insecurity, but that of the region as has been witnessed in Lebanon and very recently in Iran. Impermanence of everything, including a solution based on anger and vengeance will not last as the status quo that resulted in a one-sided solution will change and the defeated Palestinians may rise from the ashes, so to speak, with support and assistance from those who may use Palestine as a medium to cause damage to the US. Such a situation will not be one to be welcomed as more insecurity for Israel and more suffering for Palestinians and their supporters will not be what the people of Israel or Palestine wish for or deserve.",
    "A possible futuristic conceptual solution might be to have a one-State, federal union model where, Israel and Palestine operate as semi-autonomous regions with a federal government comprising both Israeli and Palestinians in equal share being elected as members of a federal parliament and regions within the federal State having their own elected assemblies with Israeli and Palestinian members based on their populations.",
    "Defence, and foreign affairs in particular, and other ministry subjects that need to be coordinated and managed centrally, could be the responsibility of the federal government, while subjects such as education and health, etc., devolved to the regions. In terms of compromise, it may be necessary for Palestinians to accept some Israeli settlements as part of Israel and for Israel to withdraw from some settlements and restore the lands back to Palestine. The opening of new Israeli settlements in mutually agreed areas to house the inhabitants of settlements being handed back to the Palestinians may be a contentious but necessary arrangement for the long-term peace between both communities.",
    "Palestinians and Israelis share so much of their ancient history. That shared history could be the foundation to build a future that both communities could share together for the present generation and even more importantly, for generations to come. Spending more and more on defence will not assure peace, it will only enrich the defence industry as it has, and been reported, and resulting in making life a misery for the Palestinians. The Israel-Palestine conflict is such an instance. However, if people in Israel and Palestine take a step back and resolve to negotiate and come up with a political solution, consider options including the one proposed here, the longer-term benefit will be peace and security in their countries and in the region, and equality and equity for both communities."
