### No electricity tariff revisions this year: PUCSL

*2024-11-24 13:05:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103723/no-electricity-tariff-revisions-this-year-pucsl-) · `en`

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) states that there will be no revision of electricity tariffs for 2024, citing delays in the submission of necessary proposals by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

The PUCSL Corporate Communications Director, Jayanath Herath pointed out that the CEB submitted an initial set of tariff revision proposals at the end of September. However, the PUCSL deemed the proposed reductions insufficient and requested a revised submission by November 8.

Despite the initial deadline, the CEB sought multiple extensions, most recently requesting an additional two weeks after failing to meet the extended deadline of November 22. Consequently, the PUCSL has planned to grant an extension until December 6.

Even if the CEB submits the revised proposals on December 6, the PUCSL clarified that it would take six to eight weeks to review and finalize the tariff adjustments. As a result, any potential revisions to electricity tariffs will be postponed to 2025.

Some delegates gave the deal a standing ovation in the COP29 plenary hall. Others lambasted wealthy nations for not doing more and criticised the Azerbaijan host for hurriedly gavelling through the contentious plan.

“I regret to say that this document is nothing more than an optical illusion,” Indian delegation representative Chandni Raina told the closing session of the summit, minutes after the deal was gavelled in. “This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document.”

### The Need to submit an electronic tax return and its challenges

*2024-11-24 04:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-need-to-submit-an-electronic-tax-return-and-its-challenges/) · `en`

The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has decided that compliant taxpayers who submit their Return of Income for 2023-24 (01 April 2023 to 31 March 2024) can only do so electronically by submitting an e-return.

Whilst it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, no consideration has been given to the fact that such a move should be made in a phased manner. In typically cavalier fashion, the department’s mandarins want to go from zero to a hundred, forgetting that many individual taxpayers have no experience submitting tax returns, let alone e-returns. I assume many new taxpayers who have not previously submitted tax returns annually have been inducted into the tax net.

### My Final Chapter in Sri Lanka

In 1994, I had the privilege of working at the Galle Face Hotel (GFH) as the Consultant to its Chairman, Cyril Gardiner. Over time, our professional relationship evolved into a warm camaraderie. Cyril had a sharp sense of humour. On one occasion, while discussing the maintenance challenges faced by historic seaside hotels like Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) and GFH, he quipped, “Chandana, GFH is only 130 years old!”

Cyril was a master of public relations, capable of crafting newsworthy stories and engaging with leading international journalists. He turned what might seem like eccentric behaviour into captivating narratives for the media. His knack for creating publicity was not accidental but meticulously orchestrated, a lesson I was fortunate to learn first-hand.

*2024-11-24 04:13:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/women-in-politics-local-and-two-from-uk-us/) · `en`

The 2024 Parliamentary elections have broken records and earned first evers for more than one reason. One very encouraging fact is that women’s representation has increased to over 10%. This trend, we are certain, will continue. 21 women MPs have been elected and 19 are from the NPP including Ambiga Selvam from Badulla who comes from the tea plantation worker sector. That is such good news. Two are from the SJB: Chamindrani, daughter of Lakshman Kiriella and Rohini Kaviratne, re-elected from Matale. Three more are expected from the NPP national list. This against only 13 women MPs in the previous government.

Much though they deserve writing about, I move overseas, since these women in Parliament will be known to all via local media and of course conversation, even gossip.

“As we all know, regionalism in South Asia has had a late beginning. One of the remarkable developments since the Second World War has been the spread of regionalism, manifested in the setting up of regional organizations which have to cover most of the globe. The fact that SAARC came to be formed so late has been explained by the disparities and imbalances within our region. Nevertheless, there is at the same time, an underlying homogeneity among South Asian countries, on which we hope to build an enduring regionalism for the common benefit of all of us.

At parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka last week, the centre-left National People’s Power (NPP) checked all lists and squared all circles, winning not just traditional seats but also polling divisions populated by minority communities.

Speaking to the media on Friday, November 15, hours after general election results were announced in Sri Lanka, Tilvin Silva, General Secretary of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the dominant member in the National People’s Power (NPP) alliance that governs the country, acknowledged that his party would commit to “developing the country, eradicating corruption, and enhancing democracy with accountability.”

Silva’s remarks came in the backdrop of one of the biggest electoral landslides in the island’s political history: the NPP, reduced to three seats at the 2020 general election, gained a two-thirds majority, obtaining 159 seats and 61 percent of the vote, last week.

Trump’s new Ambassador to Israel: “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian”

The re-election of Donald Trump to a second term of the presidency of the United States has changed the ideological trajectory of the future of the United States. At least for the foreseeable future.But it has sealed the fate of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Permanently.

To even consider the validity of the above statement, one must look into the constitutional, conventional and practical qualifications for the Presidency of the United States. Constitutionally, the President must be at least 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.

About 20 years ago, I used the same title, in a writing dealing with Mahinda Rajapaksa’s triumphant ascent to power, published in an issue of the Sunday Island. In that I expressed my deep apprehensions of a Rajapaksa dispensation. As the years unfolded, the grim realities of years of misrule, with the younger Rajapaksa outdoing the elder brother in criminality, corruption and incompetence, exceeded the worst fears of my imagination. In between, not to be forgotten, there was also the crushingly disappointing “yahapalanya” farce, perpetrated by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe collaboration.

### Happily, ever after?

*2024-11-24 03:37:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/happily-ever-after/) · `en`

2024 election season marked final act of the ‘Our Saviour II’ drama which premiered in November 2019. The NPP/JVP’s unprecedented victories would not have happened without Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s unprecedented presidential record, turning a lower-middle income country to a bankrupt one in less than three years.

On July 5, 2022, a 60-year-old man died in a petrol queue in Borella. And the Gota-go-gama protesters gave Gotabaya Rajapaksa three days to resign from the presidency.

On July 8, thousands of university students marched to the Galle Face Green in a massive procession, resisting barrages of tear gas and water cannon. People lined the streets cheering them on. “We are suffering a lot,” one woman cried. “These children should be protected by the gods. We are trying to correct a wrong we did… We are coming tomorrow.”
