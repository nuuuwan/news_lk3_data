Trinity's Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at Asgiriya Ground, Kandy, is heading towards an uninteresting decision. St. Anthony's team, after a strong start, faces challenges. Despite a promising opening, they struggle to maintain their lead, losing the match with 13 runs.

🟩

The first day of the Trinity - Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at the Asgiriya Ground in Kandy is moving towards the uninteresting decision.

Perhaps, if St. Anthony loses the Trinity team twice, it is possible to make the match.

St. Anthony's team, who played the entire day in the match, started the match on Friday (15) and scored 232 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in the first innings when the game was stopped due to inadequate lighting.

Often the St. Anthony's team is expected to hold their first innings and give the Trinity team a chance to bat on the second day (16).

St. Anthony's team faced a stumbling block as the opening player Dinura Kanegoda (0) was playing in the first over of Trinity team man Manula Gularatne.

However, team captain Dissanayake Kaushika Kumarasinghe, both of them, shared 66 runs in the 2nd wicket.

Subsequently, Ekanayake shared 36 runs each in the 3rd wicket with Januka Ratnayake and Janith Ratnasiri 4.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board is losing qualified engineers at an alarming rate, after a currency collapse and new progressive taxes slapped on the debased salary, and they are not coming back, union officials said.

Ceylon Electricity Board has a cadre of around 1,000 engineers but they have been usually managing with lower levels of around 900, they said.

Since 2022, about 150 have left the CEB for foreign countries, leading to serious gaps in some branches with engineering staff down to about 750, Dhanushka Parakramasinghe, President of the CEB Engineers Union told reporters in Colombo.

About 105 engineers have resigned and about 54 have taken leave, Parakramasinghe said.

Amendments to laws such as the Bail Act are also being considered to address this, he said.

A committee headed by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda had submitted a report on house arrest, after which cabinet approval was obtained for a draft bill which is now being formulated by the Legal Draftsman, according to Jayaratne.

“We plan to present this house arrest bill to parliament in 2024 and make it a law. Consequent to this law, people convicted of civil offences can serve their sentence in their home instead of being imprisoned,” he said.
