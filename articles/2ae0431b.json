    "The Railway Station Masters\u2019 Union states that their strike action, which was launched from Wednesday (10), will continue further.",
    "President of the union Sumedha Somaratne, speaking to reporters, said that this decision was reached during the executive council meeting of their trade union this evening (11).",
    "Earlier today, Somaratne also stressed that if the government tries to control the trade unions through oppression, the trade unions of the entire railway service will never hesitate to join together and fight.",

    "The General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways had warned that all Station Masters and Railway Controllers who fail to report to duty by 12.00 noon yesterday (10) would be considered as having vacated their positions.",
    "Accordingly, all the striking Railway Station Masters and Railway Controllers were instructed to report for duty at their respective railway stations or at least to the nearest railway station before that deadline.",
    "The Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters\u2019 Union had decided to launch a strike action from midnight on Tuesday (09) based on several demands including promotions. Railway Controllers had also later decided to join the strike action, which has severely impacted train services in the country and resulted in the cancellation of multiple train journeys.",

    "However, the railway trade unions in question had vowed to continue their strike action despite the warnings from railway authorities and the Transport Ministry."
