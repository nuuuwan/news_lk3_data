  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a corporate world often dominated by traditional career paths, the story of Captain Dr. Sir Sampath Abeysinghe stands out as a powerful testament to courage, discipline, and the entrepreneurial spirit. A retired Captain of the Sri Lanka Army, he traded his uniform for the challenges of the business battlefield, founding Never Back Security (Pvt) Ltd in 2013. His journey is a masterclass in how foundational values can build a formidable enterprise.",
    "For Captain Abeysinghe, the leap from military to corporate life was a calculated manoeuvre. \u201cYou have to start somewhere to become a businessman, and most people are afraid to do so,\u201d he reflects. His formula for success is deceptively simple yet rigorous: \u201cDiscipline, integrity, and commitment.\u201d These are not just buzzwords on a company website; they are the operational creed that has propelled Never Back Security to become a trusted provider of armed and unarmed guarding, VIP protection, and sophisticated CCTV surveillance services for a prestigious clientele, including Access Engineering and the Ministry of Health.",
    "The security industry demands structure, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to duty \u2013 qualities honed in the army.",
    "Under his leadership, Never Back Security recruits with a meticulous focus on these traits, preferring individuals with a background in military or police forces. However, recruitment is only the first step. A rigorous training regime and a culture of continuous supervision ensure that the company\u2019s personnel uphold the highest standards of professionalism and effectiveness.",
    "In today\u2019s complex corporate environment, security is no longer just about physical guards. Captain Abeysinghe recognised this early, integrating GPS tracking for patrol vehicles, biometric access systems, digital incident reporting, and remote CCTV monitoring into their service portfolio. This tech-forward approach allows Never Back to offer comprehensive, proactive solutions that protect not just assets but also data and reputation.",
    "The challenges in the industry are significant, from rising operational costs and intense competition to the constant need to retain skilled personnel. Yet, Captain Abeysinghe faces these with a soldier\u2019s resolve. His vision for the next five years is ambitious: to position Never Back among Sri Lanka\u2019s top-tier security firms, with an expanded workforce of 500-1,000 highly trained personnel and deeper integration of AI and drone technology.",
    "His advice for young entrepreneurs is practical and grounded: \u201cUnderstand the industry inside out. Recruitment and training are key. Leverage technology, and above all, build a reputation based on trust. Security is a trust-based business; even one mistake can damage your brand.\u201d",
    "Beyond security, Captain Abeysinghe\u2019s entrepreneurial drive is evident in the diverse Never Back Group, with ventures in spices, foreign employment, gems, and janitorial services, all underpinned by a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility through the Ceylon Charity Foundation.",
    "His story is more than a successful career change; it is proof that the principles of discipline and integrity are universal currencies for success. He is a serious businessman whose greatest qualification is not just his academic title but his demonstrated ability to lead, adapt, and never back down \u2013 a true impetus for the next generation of entrepreneurs.",
