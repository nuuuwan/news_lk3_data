    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s proposed new Broadcast Regulatory Commission Act requires broadcasters to renew their licence once a year which will hinder business and compel them to toe the government line, the main opposition said, though the media minister contested the claim.",
    "Former parliamentarian and chief executive of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ajith P Perera told reporters on Tuesday June 13 that the annual license renewal requirement will result in Sri Lanka\u2019s privately owned broadcast media being subservient to the government the way state-run media has been for years.",
    "\u201cMedia regulation is necessary. But this draft provides for an annual licence issuance. Every year, at the end of nine months, an application for renewal for the next year will have to be submitted.",
    "\u201cThis is not good for business because, if the licence for next year is not obtained, the business would have to be closed down,\u201d said Perera, adding that this would compel the media to keep the executive happy.",
    "However, this claim is contested by Media Minister Bandula Gunawardena who told reporters Tuesday morning that he would personally ensure that broadcasters were reissued their licence.",
    "\u201cNot only is there no provision in this bill to withhold an issued licence, as minister, I also pledge that the licence will be reissued even after the enactment of this bill,\u201d said Gunawardena.",
    "Perera, however, repeated opposition claims that the proposed commission will not be independent since all five of its members will be either directly or indirectly appointed by the president.",
    "According to a copy of the draft bill that has been circulating, the five ex-officio members of the Commission will be the secretary to the ministry, the Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), and three other members who shall possess a degree in law, science, business management, technology, communication, engineering, public administration or mass media from a recognised university, appointed by the president with the approval of the Constitutional Council.",
    "The objectives of the commission, according to the draft bill, include issuing and renewing license for broadcasting service providers, determining the conditions for issuing such license, determining the number of licenses that could be obtained by a single person or broadcasting entity, and suspending or cancelling any license issued for broadcasting service \u201cwith reasons\u201d.",
    "Formulating codes of practice applicable to the different types of license and advising the minister regarding plans, programmes and activities in order to regulate the broadcasting entities or persons will also be among the Commission\u2019s objectives.",
    "Perera said the makeup of the commission means it will not be fair by broadcasters and will not protect the rights of citizens.",
    "\u201cWhat this does is make private media as subservient and docile as state media is today,\u201d he said.",
    "However, Media Minister Bandula Gunawardena told reporters at the weekly cabinet press briefing on Tuesday that the government has no desire to suppress or \u201ctame\u201d the media",
    "\u201cAs the subject minister, I have no intention to suppress or tame the media. The president hasn\u2019t in his mature political conduct demonstrated any such intention either,\u201d said Gunawardena.",
    "It was in fact Wickremesinghe who had previously worked to amend laws that could be used to imprison journalists who were convicted of illegal invasions of people\u2019s privacy, the minister said.",
    "Gunawardena said the proposed act is still a mere draft and anyone can propose amendments, adding that a Sinhala translation of the draft \u2013 which legally supersedes the original English-language copy \u2013 has been distributed to media representatives.",
    "\u201cWithin the next two weeks, any proposals can be submitted and discussed,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTo instil an advanced media culture in a civilised society, regulation must be established upon discussion following international standards,\u201d the minister added. (Colombo/Jun13/2023)"
