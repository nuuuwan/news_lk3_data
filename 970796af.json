    "Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP Dayasiri Jayasekara expressed his interest in contesting as a common candidate in the upcoming Presidential election yesterday.",
    "The former General Secretary of the SLFP expressed the opinion that party leader Maithripala Sirisena would not achieve success in the polls if he chose to run for office.",
    "He also noted that given Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leader Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s ineligibility to run for President, there is a necessity for a common candidate to represent both the SLPP and SLFP.",
    "Jayasekara also refuted rumours that he will cross over to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and emphasised that he has no intention of joining the opposition party.",
    "Jayasekara\u2019s relationship with the SLFP has been frayed in recent times after he was removed from the post of General Secretary and suspended from party membership in September. However, Jayasekara continues to insist he continues to be a member of the party.",
    "At that time, it was reported that the removal was prompted by suspicions that Jayasekara was attempting to take over the leadership of the party.",
    "Meanwhile, the SLPP has already admitted that prominent businessman Dhammika Perera is among those being considered to be put forward as the party\u2019s Presidential candidate. Last week, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Sagara Kariyawasam said the party was considering three to four other nominations. However, he failed to name the others."
