### Brazil’s ex-president Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years after landmark coup plot conviction

*2025-09-12 06:37:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112415/brazils-ex-president-bolsonaro-sentenced-to-27-years-after-landmark-coup-plot-conviction) · `en`

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced on Thursday to 27 years and three months in prison hours after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, dealing a powerful rebuke to one of the world’s most prominent far-right populist leaders.

The conviction ruling by a panel of five justices on Brazil’s Supreme Court, who also agreed on the sentence, made the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in the country’s history to be convicted for attacking democracy, and drew disapproval from the Trump administration.

“This criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present and its future,” Justice Carmen Lucia said before her vote to convict Bolsonaro, referring to a history checkered with military coups and attempts to overthrow democracy.

There was ample evidence that Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, acted “with the purpose of eroding democracy and institutions,” she added.

### Can't accommodate women insulting women

*2025-09-12 06:34:37* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/பெண்களை-அவமதிக்க-இடமளிக்க-முடியாது/175-364452) · `ta`

Opposition MP Prasad Siriwardena has commented on insulting Lakmali Hemachandra, a woman from the ruling party.. This is an act of insulting the entire women.. Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya urged the Speaker to severely warn the concerned MP.

During the session held in Parliament on Wednesday (10), Lakmali Hemachandra commented on the MP to insult the MP.

In South Asian countries, the female representation was low in Sri Lanka. This time 22 female representatives were elected to parliament.   Opposition parties speak insulting women as they are taking action to increase the representation of female representation.

We are trying to defeat this improper culture. The entire women should be considered insulting Lakmali Hemachandra.. The talents of female representatives are challenged by male representatives. Therefore, the Opposition MPs are strongly warned of improper opinion.

The fact that the Sri Lankan navy is arresting only those fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters is covered up, glossed over, omitted or ignored

Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Disanayake (AKD) made history when he became the first Sri Lankan head of state to set foot on Katchatheevu (spelled as Kachchatheevu also) soil on 1 September 2025. Among those who accompanied the President on his maiden voyage to the northern off-shore islet in the naval speedboat P 211 were Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala and Northern Navy Commander Rear Admiral Buddhika Liyanagamage.

### WIPO’s GII for my breakfast: This year’s serving is on 16 Sept.

Feedback is the Breakfast of Champions is a popular phrase attributed to the author Ken Blanchard. His succinct writings using One Minute themes have a global following. The Deming cycle PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) has embedded the feedback loop into the top management governance cycle and is a gold standard in management practices. Our PDCA is more akin to Politics-Diatribe-Constituency-Attrition in practice. However, in our nation’s planning, feedback is not exactly visible. Our breakfast of short eats or loads of carbs with some sambol and curry has led to more NCD prevalence than progress.

### The points are the tigers that are not changed

United People's Power Parliamentarian Saminda Wijesiri said that those who have called for the burning of parliament during the Arakalai period are now shamelessly claiming that they should protect the dignity and law of Parliament and that they are now wearing tie and court.

He said this while addressing a debate on the National Audit Amendment Bill held in Parliament on Thursday (11).

Bimal Ratnayake, who is wearing a court, said in the morning of the House of Parliament and the law of Parliament. But they said that the Parliament should be completed in the Arakala period and the protesters should come.

Now we are wearing a court and talking about the law of Parliament. Not ashamed? Those who are said to be burned now say that the prestige of Parliament should be preserved. They talk like they are dead. But they are the tigers wearing the tie and the court.

### Strategic audits: Health check every strategy needs

*2025-09-12 06:06:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Strategic-audits-Health-check-every-strategy-needs/4-781558) · `en`

When we fall ill, symptoms like fever or fatigue warn us that something is wrong. Organisations too face symptoms when their strategy is not working – declining performance, disengaged employees, or dissatisfied customers. But unlike the human body, strategy rarely sends obvious signals until it is too late. Traditionally, businesses rely on annual or mid-year reviews. The question is: are these enough?

In today’s volatile environment, the answer is a clear no. A far more powerful tool exists: the strategic audit. Just as medical check-ups prevent illnesses from becoming critical, strategic audits diagnose weaknesses, test assumptions, and keep strategies relevant.

Before diving into strategic audits, we must first revisit strategy itself. Strategy has been defined in many ways:

### "Priests Math: Punishment if they are alive"

The priests get our justice for the people affected by the monastery. At the same time, state -of -the -art MP Basmin Sharif said that if the involvement of the incident is alive, they will be punished.

Speaking at a debate on the National Audit (Amendment) Bill held in Parliament on Thursday (11), he said.

A former minister accuses our Justice Minister over the murder of the priests. But the Minister of Justice has taken steps to investigate the case of the priests. He has visited the priests monastery directly. So the Muslims will definitely be justified in this issue. At the same time, all those who are involved in the killings will be punished.

### Man-made waterloo of Kinross Beach

*2025-09-12 05:58:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Man-made-waterloo-of-Kinross-Beach/4-781555) · `en`

For generations, Kinross Beach was more than just a stretch of sand; it was the vibrant heart of a community. It was the training ground for national athletes, the backdrop for countless family picnics, and the stage for sporting legends. It represented a shared public space where memory and community were forged, a testament to the simple, enduring joy of our coastal heritage. Yet, today, the ghosts of this arcadian past are swallowed by a desolate present, a mere rusting skeleton of what it once was. The once-vibrant shoreline is now a casualty of an unnatural disaster, a man-made waterloo that serves as a chilling indictment of civic neglect and corporate greed.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was seen leaving his official residence located at Wijerama Road in Colombo 7 yesterday

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday vacated his official residence in Colombo and moved back to his private home in Carlton, Tangalle, following the passage of new legislation that repeals longstanding perks for ex-Presidents.

On Wednesday, Parliament voted 151–1 in favour of the Presidents’ Entitlement (Repeal) Act, No. 18 of 2025, a flagship pre-election pledge of the ruling National People’s Power (NPP) Government. The law repeals the Presidents’ Entitlement Act, No. 4 of 1986, which provided former Presidents and their widows with official residences, staff, vehicles, and other privileges.

As he departed his Colombo residence, Rajapaksa made a brief statement to the media: “We were asked to leave, so we’re leaving.” When asked if he would exit politics, the former President replied that he had no intention of stepping away.

We were very shocked by the most sad events in Nepal. The series of sang events that have created such a tremendous rebellion in the land of the Buddha cannot be granted.

It is evident that some conspiracy to evolve South Asian countries is acting.

Clearly, the young people have a sense of their country, saying that the youth is addicted to the use of social media and to prohibit the history of the country.

Clearly, the youth who were taking the lead in the vicinity of Nepal would be clear that they would not destroy their country in this way.. Today, many people believe that the hatred of sowing the hatred of the soil sowing hatred is that the hatred of sowing.
