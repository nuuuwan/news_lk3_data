  "original_body_lines": [
    "Say bonuses should be paid to employees as CEB has returned to profitability and is not dependant on treasury for its expenses",
    "Calls for equal bonus amount to be provided to all employees across all levels",
    "Underlines importance of reducing electricity tariffs for people while ensuring fair treatment for CEB employees",
    "Says CEEU\u2019s approach is not adversarial but focused on ensuring Govt. fulfils its commitments",
    "The Ceylon Electricity Employees Union (CEEU) has formally requested Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairperson Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya to ensure that bonuses are paid to all employees by December 10. Citing the CEB\u2019s recent return to profitability, the CEEU has called for an equal bonus amount to be provided to all employees across all levels.",
    "CEEU General Secretary Ranjan Jayalal, has also called on the Government to ensure that CEB employees receive their bonuses before the set date. Jayalal, whose union is affiliated with the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), made these remarks at a media conference held in Colombo this week.",
    "\u201cThis is our Government, and we helped establish it,\u201d Jayalal said, referencing the NPP\u2019s victory in the recent elections. \u201cAs a trade union, we achieved our target on 21 September. We cannot approach the Government as outsiders because the Government is ours. Our role now is to remind the Government of its responsibilities, not to protest in the streets.\u201d he said.",
    "Jayalal highlighted the CEB\u2019s transformation from a loss-making entity in 2022 to a profit-generating institution. He attributed the financial turnaround to better management and emphasised the need for bonuses for employees.",
    "\u201cWith Christmas approaching, we urge the Government to grant bonuses before 10 December,\u201d he said, adding that the CEB operates without relying on Treasury funds and fully covers its expenses.",
    "Jayalal criticised past mismanagement, accusing some officials of inflating salaries to secure higher pensions and siphoning funds for personal gain. \u201cThose responsible for the CEB\u2019s past losses do not deserve bonuses or even pensions,\u201d he asserted.",
    "The union leader also underlined the importance of reducing electricity tariffs for the public while ensuring fair treatment for CEB employees, who have maintained an uninterrupted power supply.",
    "Jayalal warned against misinformation aimed at tarnishing the CEB\u2019s reputation. \u201cWe have files on those who mismanaged the institution, and we will expose them after 14 December,\u201d he said.",
    "As the sole CEB trade union representing the Government, Jayalal expressed confidence that their demands would be met. He reiterated that the union\u2019s approach was not adversarial but focused on ensuring the Government fulfils its commitments."
