Currently, Rajarata Tiles exports to the UK, which is its largest customer, India, Germany, Australia, UAE, Maldives and now Lebanon.",

    "The terracotta floor tiles produced by Samson Rajarata Tiles are made from 100% locally sourced materials and manufactured at their production plant located in Gnanikkulama, Anuradhapura. Rajarata Terracotta floor tiles are renowned for their unique feature of heat reduction and the natural cooling effect they provide.",
    "The demand for Rajarata Terracotta floor tiles has been high in recent times due to hot weather conditions and the increase in building constructions with rooftop areas.

    "Managing Director Chandula Rajapaksa stated, \u2018We are privileged to further extend our export market and consider it a vital milestone for Rajarata floor tiles. We have been in operation for two decades, and year after year, we have experienced growth. I count this as yet another significant step. It proves the unmatched quality of our terracotta floor tiles and has consistently rewarded us for adhering to stringent production standards. The production, research and development, and quality teams of Rajarata tiles are always committed to maintaining our product quality on par with the highest international standards. This is the reason why we have been able to expand our export market in recent years.\u201d",
    "Executive Director Dilshan Rajapaksa said: \u201cFollowing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent economic instability within Sri Lanka, our main strategy was to explore new markets outside of Sri Lanka. Our goal was to attract more foreign funds to the country, thereby contributing to the growth of the local economy. We believe that, as a responsible business conglomerate, it is our utmost duty to do so. Rajarata Tiles has always been at the forefront of the local market for natural roofing and floor tiles. The unique selling points of our products are that they are 100% Sri Lankan, natural, ecological, and healthful.\u201d",
    "He added, \u201cWe have observed a growing trend, particularly in the foreign market, towards the use of natural, ecological, and healthful materials in roofing and flooring construction. This insight has helped us make the right move to the right country at the right time. I believe that the same trend will continue to be embraced by our local customers who are choosing natural and healthful products for building their dream homes, considering it as a once-in-a-lifetime investment. Currently, we are experiencing this trend in various commercial properties such as hotels, villas, and holiday resorts, which is a fact that brings us great satisfaction.\u201d"
