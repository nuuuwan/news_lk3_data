  "original_body_lines": [
    "IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon has stated that the procedure does not entail the immediate arrest of individuals willing to provide information regarding the perpetrators of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks and instead the focus should be on investigating the information provided to apprehend the suspects.",
    "Tennakoon made these remarks while addressing the media concerning the recent controversial comments made by former President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "However, he emphasized that since a trial is already underway regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks in the courts, the police will inform the Attorney General and the courts once a statement is recorded from the former President, in order to proceed with further legal action.",
    "\u201cPublic Security Minister Tiran Alles instructed me yesterday to initiate an investigation regarding the statement made by Mr. Maithripala Sirisena. Accordingly, I informed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to launch an immediate investigation into the matter. The CID has already notified Mr. Maithripala to appear before the CID to make a statement.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe will appear before the CID within the next 48 hours accordingly. Further legal proceedings will be carried out based on the statement he makes.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, the IGP expressed that the requests made by several individuals to arrest the former President based on his statement, which are being circulated through the media are baseless.",
    "He also asserted that if such a situation arises after investigations are carried out regarding the information to be revealed by the former President, the police can then proceed with his arrest.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s look at this positively. If he has acquired any valuable information later on regarding the culprits, we have to investigate the matter, but not to arrest the person providing the information,\u201d Tennakoon added."
