    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s monetary policy is balanced but there was space to cut rates if there was an external shock, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said referring to a possible impact from Trump tariffs.",
    "Sri Lanka had a policy rate of 7.75 percent which indicated a real interest rate of 2.75 percent considering the 5 percent inflation target.",
    "The central bank is expecting inflation to reach a 5 percent target next year, and growth was above the 3 percent projected by the International Monetary Fund and close to 5 percent, which indicated a \u2018right balance\u2019 in monetary policy, he said.",
    "\u201cBut what\u2019s good about it is that if there\u2019s going to be any impact out of this external event, we have a space in the monetary policy for us to support the local economy,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe told a forum in Singapore organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission.",
    "\u201cBut without needing that support, pushing it through can create bubbles or burst cycles.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why I think we have good space for us to use going forward, depending on the outcome. Right now, we don\u2019t see a risk at this point.",
    "\u201cWe saw a risk in April when this was announced. That\u2019s why we were using very carefully the space we were having.\u201d",
    "Concerns have been raised, however, about the last rate cut; that it will push private credit too fast and the imports from investment credit (general imports) will reduce the ability to collect foreign reserves to repay debt.",
    "However, the central bank is confident of reaching the year-end IMF target of about 7 billion US dollars, he said.",
    "Since Sri Lanka has reduced the proposed Trump tariffs to 20 percent from the original 44 percent, the island\u2019s competitive position was not damaged, he said. (Colombo/Aug12/2025)"
