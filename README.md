Words that acquire new meaning in the public psyche are the loudest witnesses of unfolding history

“The future has many names: for the weak it means the unattainable; for the fearful, it means the unknown; for the courageous, it means opportunity.”

Victor Hugo the French writer provided this advice to France in the turbulent days of the end of the “ancien régime’ and the birth of the new republic.

Meaningful change occurs when a vision is combined with realism and pragmatism to turn it into something tangible, concrete. Clarity of ideas shape reality.

The NPP presented its party manifesto yesterday (26 August). I watched the finely choreographed presentation on YouTube. I listened to the candidate AKD. This is my take.

President Wickremesinghe’s case for being popularly elected for the first time, after two previous attempts, to the office he now holds by parliamentary selection, has 4 pillars:

1. There is no alternative to his economic policies, starting with his agreement with the IMF.

2. His IMF agreement cannot and should not be sought to be renegotiated.

3. There is nothing to be renegotiated as there is nothing amiss with his IMF agreement.

4. His continuity in office is thus the key to stability, which is the key to economic recovery.

### Best business practices from an Islamic standpoint

Many of the teachings embodied in both the Qur’an and Hadiths are actually followed by  multinationals in spirit - Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a very efficient leader. He had excellent XQ (Execution Quotient) i.e. ability to get things done. The secret of his efficiency was his sense of urgency. Once a task was decided he would formulate a plan with relevant parties and execute it as fast as possible. This was evident in his many actions from winning over tribal chiefs to the many campaigns he led to ensure Islam triumphed and a commonwealth based on the brotherhood of man finally emerged. That he was supremely successful in this nobody will deny. We know in our personal life that anything we decide to do later, rarely gets done. One delay leads to another, which is why procrastination is regarded almost as a sin in Islam

They bring with them the efficiencies of the private sector in construction and operations, enhancing the speed of development and the quality of infrastructure.

However, Rajapaksa’s successor Ranil Wickremesinghe has been widely acclaimed for ending the long queues with International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed economic reforms.

However, the latest queue outside the Department of Immigration and Emigration comes after the government has gone out of new passport books amid higher demand for the document that people needed to leave the country.

“There is a deficiency. I apologize on behalf of the government. It happened because. We have migrated to a new electronic passport system,” Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.
