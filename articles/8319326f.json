    "The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) initiated a constructive dialogue with the National Initiative for R&D Commercialisation (NIRDC) to explore avenues of support for strengthening the Sri Lankan pharmaceutical sector through Research and Development (R&D).",
    "The meeting took place on 7 July at the EDB premises, with the participation of private sector representatives from the pharmaceutical industry, NIRDC, and EDB.",
    "EDB Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe opened the discussion by outlining the measures taken to enhance export revenue, including the reactivation of the Export Development Council of Ministers (EDCM) after nearly three decades. He highlighted that the EDCM now provides a vital platform to address policy-level issues across sectors. He further emphasised the growing importance of developing the pharmaceutical industry through R&D and noted that the collaboration with the NIRDC is a timely and strategic step towards long-term export growth in the sector.",
    "Representing the private sector, Sri Lanka Pharmaceutical Manufacturers\u2019 Association (SLPMA) President Nalin Kannangara highlighted the significant capital investments pharmaceutical companies are making to upgrade production standards and venture into high-tech pharmaceutical manufacturing. He emphasised that, compared to many other industries, both capital and R&D investment requirements are substantially higher in pharmaceuticals. Therefore, Government support in R&D is essential for driving product innovation. He also stressed the need to enhance the knowledge base and technical capacity of university graduates to align with industry requirements and future growth.",
    "Adding further perspective, State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC)Chairman Professor Jayantha Wijayabandara explained that Sri Lanka\u2019s pharmaceutical industry remains largely a formulation-based sector, dependent on imports for key raw materials such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and excipients. He stressed the urgent need to develop local API manufacturing capabilities, both to reduce dependency and to explore export potential. He urged the NIRDC to prioritise R&D support for local API production as an initial step towards sector transformation.",
    "Senior Adviser to the President on Science and Technology Professor Gomika Udugamasooriya stated that the NIRDC is already engaged in strengthening linkages between industry and academia, advancing product standardisation, and promoting the commercialisation of research. He highlighted the Government\u2019s renewed focus on building a production-based economy through value-added innovations.",
    "In this context, he emphasised the importance of intellectual property (IP) protection for Sri Lankan goods and services in global markets. He further noted that steps are underway to establish a centralised administrative system for R&D management and coordination, which will enhance national efforts in innovation and commercialisation.",
    "The meeting created a valuable platform to foster collaboration between the Government and the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in identifying priority areas for R&D support. It marked a crucial step towards aligning policy, R&D, and industry efforts to unlock the sector\u2019s export potential and build a sustainable, R&D-driven pharmaceutical industry in Sri Lanka."
