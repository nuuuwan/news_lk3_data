### ගර්භිණී කාන්තාවන් සහ කුඩා දරුවන්ගේ සෞඛ්‍ය ගැන හෙළිදරව්වක්

*2024-07-19 07:59:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/198973) · `si`

පසුගිය වසර 10ක කාලය තුළ ගර්භිණී මව්වරුන් සහ කුඩා දරුවන් දියවැඩියාව සඳහා ගොදුරුවීම ඉහළ ගොස් ඇති බව සෞඛ්‍ය අංශ පෙන්වාදී තිබේ.

කොළඹ ජාතික රෝහලේ දියවැඩියාව සහ හෝමෝන පිළිබඳ විශේෂඥ වෛද්‍ය උදිත පුළුගහපිටිය මහතා සඳහන් කළේ මේ වනවිට නාගරික ප්‍රදේශ තුළ ජීවත්වන පුද්ගලයින්ගෙන් සියයට 20ක් පමණ දියවැඩියා රෝගයට ගොදුරුවී ඇති බවය.

දියවැඩියාව රෝගයේ, රෝග ලක්ෂණ සහ ඉන් මිදීමට ගතයුතු ක්‍රියාමාර්ග සම්බන්ධයෙන් ද විශේෂඥ වෛද්‍ය උදිත පුළුගහපිටිය මහතා වැඩිදුරටත් පැවසීය.

"අපි සෑම දෙනාම දියවැඩියාවට ගොදුරු නොවී ජීවත්වීමට උත්සාහ ගත යුතුයි. ඒ වෙනුවෙන් පැයක් හෝ පැය භාගයක් ව්‍යායාම කිරීම අත්‍යවශ්‍යයයි. අධික සීනි සහිත ආහාර අඩු කරලා වැඩි වශයෙන් එළවලු, මස්, මාළු සහිත ආහාර වෙලකට යොමු වීමෙන් සහ තමාගේ උසට සරිලන බර පවත්වා ගැනීමෙන් දියවැඩියාවෙන් තෙරව ප්‍රීතිමත් ජීවිතයක් ගත කිරීමට පුළුවන්."

The Government should impose a full moratorium on the PTA and work to repeal it

Sri Lankan authorities continue to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to target perceived opponents and minority communities without credible evidence to support the allegations despite repeated pledges to end the practice, Human Rights Watch said yesterday.

As per attachments sent by L.W.K. Silva, Senior Deputy Principal Royal College, there are 49 teachers who should have been transferred out soon after reaching 10 years at Royal College. As I understand, since 2017, the policy of the Ministry has been to transfer out every teacher who has served 10 years at one school. Why is Royal College an exception?

Please have a close look at the list; there are teachers who have completed 23 years to 11 years in this list. What action is being taken to ensure the Ministry follows its own rules in respect of these 49 teachers?

Appeal – STOP aiding Israeli government’s continued slaughter of Palestine people

I am a Sri Lankan by descent. I also consider myself a “citizen” of South Asia (SA) despite India keeping the SAARC, a defunct association. I am a keen observer of SA politics and of regional and global conflicts.

You do not have to be told I know, Israeli attacks on Palestine civilians begun on 7 October 2023 in retaliation to a Hamas terror attack that took Israel by surprise, continues unabated and the toll of Palestine civilians killed end-June, 2024 according to the Gaza Ministry of Health is 38,000 humans. Yet “Lancet”, a peer reviewed, internationally recognised medical journal says it could now be around 186,000 people, as the “official toll does not take into account thousands of dead buried under rubble and indirect deaths due to destruction of health facilities, food distribution systems and other public infrastructure”.

*2024-07-19 05:36:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Elections-voters-and-country-risk/4-764469) · `en`

The parties in contest are highly unlikely to get the required majority of votes due to the ‘societal polarisation’ that we witness today

Everybody is enthusiastic about the forthcoming elections in Sri Lanka, almost forgetting the priorities of the ongoing economic crisis, sustainability of businesses and livelihood of people. However, generally, people think that electing a new government may resolve all problems in order to achieve their aspirations. This article attempts to evaluate the risks in the contexts of ‘holding elections’, ‘continuing the present government at least for a brief period – allowing the economy to stabilise’ and the implications in the perspective of risk management.

### Tax appellate procedure – a deep dive

Taxpayer rights have been steadily curtailed in recent policy changes

A taxpayer is required to file, a return of income, VAT return or SSCL return as the case may be on or before the due date. If the Inland Revenue officers are not in agreement with the return filed, they have a statutory right to raise an appropriate assessment on or before the expiry of the relevant time bar provided in the relevant statute. Generally, within a 30-day period a taxpayer of receipt of assessment has to appeal/request for administrative review against such to CGIR, specifying the grounds of appeal. Taxpayers dissatisfied with an assessment have recourse through a four-tier appellate system.

The tax assessment process commences with an inquiry, which may involve interviews and requests for documents. Following this, the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the taxpayer’s file may issue an assessment if they determine that the declared tax liability is incorrect.

### NCE urges authorities to expedite Sri Lanka’s accession to Madrid Protocol

Sri Lanka exports a wide range of goods under various trademarks, contributing significantly to economic growth in international trade. As an exporters’ chamber, the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) actively encourages its members to export under their own brands. However, the cost of registering trademarks in multiple countries can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, registering in 10 countries means incurring tenfold the cost. The Madrid Protocol offers a solution to this issue.

The Madrid System, officially known as the Madrid Protocol, is an international treaty administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It provides a streamlined and cost-effective way for businesses to register their trademarks in multiple countries. Joining this system would offer significant benefits to Sri Lankan exporters.

Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has emphasised the duty of all stakeholders, including the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL), the Government led by the President, the Sri Lanka Police, and the entire Government mechanism, in ensuring a free and fair Presidential election without any violence, corruption, or acts of hate between communities.

Issuing a press release on Wednesday, former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya recalled that the 17th Amendment, championed by the country’s civil society, sought to establish a fair election culture in Sri Lanka. However, the unlimited executive powers granted by the 18th and 20th Amendments led to disappointment. “It is imperative for the current President and potential candidates of the upcoming election not to create a similar environment once more,” Jayasuriya said.

Last week, the Supreme Court directed the NPC to adhere to its order and take action against Senior DIG Nilantha Jayawardene.

அதன் பிரகாரம் இவ்வொப்பந்தம் நடைமுறைக்கும் வரும்போது ஏற்றுமதிகளுக்கான 50 சதவீத வரி விலக்களிப்பைப் பெறக்கூடிய சாத்தியம் உள்ள போதிலும், ஏற்றுமதிகளில் 15 சதவீதமான பொருட்களின் பெயர்கள் சேர்க்கப்படவில்லை.

அதேபோன்று இலங்கை - தாய்லாந்து சுதந்திர வர்த்தக ஒப்பந்தத்தின் பிரகாரம் 50 சதவீத வரி விலக்களிப்புக்கு அப்பால், எஞ்சிய 30 சதவீத வரி விலக்களிப்பானது அடுத்துவரும் 15 வருடகாலத்தில் ஒவ்வொரு பகுதியாக நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப்படும்.
