    "On Tuesday, December 5, the French Embassy screened  Vaishnavee at the National Film Corporation, the last in a series of cultural items commemorating the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between France and Sri Lanka. The finale was, to put it rather mildly, a fitting one. Peries epitomised Sri Lanka\u2019s French connection in ways few of her contemporaries did. A Francophone and a Francophile, she represented the country there in the late 1990s. As a student in the 1950s, she found herself stranded in Paris, before being whisked off to the French Legation, headed then by Vernon Mendis. It was there that she met Lester Peries and there that she saw her first real Sinhala film, Rekava.",
    "That French connection was revived on Tuesday evening. Yet though it was a fitting finale, it was also a sombre one. Peries\u2019s passing, to borrow an oft-quoted clich\u00e9, represents not the passing but an end of an era, an era that began its descent with the passing of her husband in 2018. It was in that year that Vaishnavee was first screened publicly in Sri Lanka.",
    "Based, as the titles inform us, on a story by Lester,  Vaishnavee represents Sumitra, if not at her finest, then at her most characteristic. Like Ray, Antonioni, and Kurosawa, Sumitra\u2019s last film is a celebration of innocence, not a mere reflection on serious themes. Watching it for the first time in 2017, I went back to Pauline Kael\u2019s review of Ghare Baire.",
    "The main characters talk, and the camera just stays on them and waits until they finish, yet these conversations develop a heart-swelling intensity. In a scene, the method is like that of amateur moviemakers who think that all they need to do is put actors in a room and photograph them reading their lines as if they were on a stage. The difference is that Satyajit Ray\u2026 didn\u2019t start with this simplicity \u2013 he achieved it.",
    "It would be anachronistic to apply this to Vaishnavee, a film which unfolds in a different world and universe, a different time. But like Satyajit Ray in 1984, Sumitra had by the time of her last film been making movies for 30 years, and another 10 years as an editor, mostly for her husband but for other directors as well. Vaishnavee is full of sequences that seemingly go nowhere: a kindly uncle talks about the future with his orphaned nephew; the nephew\u2019s fianc\u00e9e elopes with a man we never hear of again; the jilted lover is then taken to another prospective bride, who turns out to be a disappointment. These are of peripheral interest to the larger storyline. But they are intriguing enough to hold on their own.",
    "Reviewing Walt Whitman, Randall Jarrell wrote of a poem, that  \u201cthere are faults in this passage, and they do not matter.\u201d There are enough and more faults in Sumitra\u2019s film. These, however, do not really diminish the story: rather, they add to it. As I noted in my first review in 2017, the conclusion bothers me somewhat: it is trying to tell us something about the eternalness of love, about the fact that love should never be taken for granted.",
    "But the Pygmalionesque overtones (or undertones) of the narrative outweigh everything in the story. This is not to demean Yashodha Wimaladharma\u2019s performance. But the ending is full of ambiguity which cannot be reconciled with the rest of the film.",
    "The Sumitra Peries film that Vaishnavee evokes best in this regard is Sakman Maluwa. There too, love is expressed ambivalently, and feelings of jealousy crop up sporadically, until in the end the characters reach a catharsis when the wife tells the husband that only he can bridge the gap which has slowly sprung up between them. In Vaishnavee there is no bridge: the puppet, after her metamorphosis, turns the tables on the protagonist by making it clear that she will not be taken for granted, not even by the person who gave her life.",
    "When I went to its first screening in 2017, I was asked to bring my mother along. \u201cShe will appreciate it better, I think,\u201d Sumitra suggested. I saw her point at once: Vaishnavee recalls a tradition of filmmaking that has all but completely been lost. Yet the message in the story is relevant for all time, and I believe it resonates particularly sharply with the younger crowd as well: particularly the women, who would notice how deftly the director has subverted the traditional Pygmalionesque outlines of the story.",
    "In Shaw\u2019s play, the flower girl, taught to be a lady, laments that she can\u2019t be anyone other than a lady. She realises the limits of her new situation but can\u2019t do anything about it. In Vaishnavee on the other hand the puppet that is brought alive refuses to be confined this way. She turns the tables on her creator: instead of being grateful to him for giving her life, she haunts him and his family.",
    "This does not make the woman a neurotic Glenn Close type who will go to any length to have the man who happened to give her life. There are, to be sure, times when one feels that she is taking things too far, especially when she haunts the protagonist\u2019s cousin. But even when the likes of Rohana Beddage rally around and try to exorcise her spirit from their home, even when the protagonist \u2013 played, by the way, by an impeccable and pre-Koombiyo Thumindu Dodantanne \u2013 you understand where she is coming from and why she is acting as she is. She doesn\u2019t feel wronged, but slighted. Though we don\u2019t see everything from her point of view \u2013 unlike, say, Maleficent, which revisits the Sleeping Beauty story from the perspective of the \u201cwicked fairy\u201d \u2013 we understand her motives, especially in the conclusion, where she cautions the man against taking love for granted.",
    "To be sure, the fault isn\u2019t the man\u2019s. He clearly loves this woman, but he can\u2019t bring himself to do so, because his world is not hers. But in another film, the woman would have made the hard yards to prove herself worthy of the man. This is not that movie.",
    "Instead the woman makes it clear that she cannot be dismissed, that the man cannot call the shots over her. One can consider Vaishnavee a feminist work in that regard: the director, rather than sticking to the traditional girl-hankers-after-boy arc, chooses to subvert it.",
    "This is hardly surprising. Sumitra\u2019s films have always been about women refusing to be who they are defined as being by the rest of the world. From Vasanthi Chathurani in Gehenu Lamayi to Swarna Mallawarachchi in Sagara Jalaya, to Geetha Kumarasinghe in Loku Duwa, there is an incipient rebelliousness in her women. Sometimes they manage to rise above their situation, often they don\u2019t. What Sumitra does in Vaishnavee is to add a supernatural twist to this theme, and bring it up to date for newer, younger audiences.",
    "Much has been written about Vaishnavee\u2019s \u201cmagic realist\u201d qualities. Magical realism is defined as a mode of art which depicts a realistic picture of the world while adding or incorporating magical elements. There is here a near-complete erasure of the line between these two elements.",
    "To the extent that it incorporates realistic settings and magical aspects, Vaishnavee is, in that sense, magic realist. Moreover, in a story springing with special effects, the realist elements themselves occupy another world. The talking parrot, for instance, is very much \u201creal\u201d, but it is also somewhat otherworldly. Yashoda\u2019s character is another case in point: even after entering our world, she retains her supernatural elan.",
    "Other Sinhala films have tried, though not always successfully, to bridge the gap between magic and realism. One invariably recalls Udayakantha Warnasuriya\u2019s Ran Kevita and Ran Kevita 2. Yet these were children\u2019s films, which brimmed with an innocence that could easily be squared with the simpleness of their themes. Sumitra\u2019s film, on the other hand, is not an innocent film, though it too brims with innocence.",
    "One may be taken in by its old-world charms \u2013 in a film that evokes birth and rebirth from start to finish, in only one scene is there a real hint of death, the protagonist\u2019s attempt to cut his wrist after learning of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s elopement \u2013 but there is a profoundly serious theme hidden beneath. The supernatural occurrences, in that regard, are not cosmetic: they grow out of the puppet\u2019s feelings for the protagonist, and the protagonist\u2019s unwillingness to reciprocate them.",
