    "The Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court today sentenced the Gnanasara Thero, to 09 months imprisonment over his defamatory statement on the religion of Islam.",
    "Although the Thero has filed an appeal against the sentence, his attorneys had requested bail pending the hearing of the appeal and the announcement of a final decision.",
    "Gnanasara Thero filed an appeal against his nine-month prison sentence at the Colombo High Court through his attorneys, which was filed before the Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "Attorney-at-Law Gamini Alwis, appearing on behalf of the Thero, presented facts requesting bail for his client pending the hearing of the appeal.",
