Cautions that undermining independence could take SL back to troubled state

The recent uproar over the Central Bank’s salary increases has caught widespread attention and according to Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, this controversy is a deliberate attempt to undermine the institution’s autonomy.

He cautioned that exaggerating the salary increases to undermine the financial sector regulator’s independence could severely impact the economy, potentially regressing it to its troubled state just a few years ago.

“Our need for the Central Bank independence in setting wages and salaries for the staff is quite important to avoid undue influence from the fiscal authorities. That was the issue earlier.

The salary issue we can talk temperately if it is immoral or unethical. That we can discuss separately. But using this issue to oppose the Central Bank or compromise the independence by changing law is a major risk,” he added.

The alumni of the two colleges living around the world have come to visit the competition.

This is a record in the history of the World Schools for the 145th consecutive year.

The cricket Samar is also seen as an unforgettable competition while revealing the traditional cultures of the two colleges.

Also, the Samaritan of the sapphire, on the one hand, is a gathering of two colleges, contemporary students and alumni of the two.

The Toma team, led by Maid Perera, who is a powerful team, will not lose many success during the current school cricket season.

On the other hand, the results of the Royal team led by Sineet Jayawardene, who played the Sri Lankan team at the Under -19 World Cup cricket matches, were not satisfactory.

Last year, in a similar manner, when the two teams met in the 144th sapphire. The Toma team was a powerful team and was permitted as a winning team.
