The deflationary conditions, which have persisted for many months since around the middle of last year, continued through January, as the prices contended by the producers across the industries have fallen by 3.0 percent from a year ago.

What is officially referred to as the Producer Price Index, measured by the Census and Statistics Department, has been on a decline since June last year, around the same time the consumer prices also turned around quite notably.

The producer prices provide a forerunner for what could look like the consumer prices.

In February, the consumer price inflation, according to the officials’ preferred Consumer Price Index, softened to 5.9 percent over the last 12 months, from 6.4 percent in January, as the supply conditions improved while the one-off impacts from the Value Added Tax hike were dissipating.

The northern town of Vavuniya which was once at the front lines of the war is now a peaceful and bustling urban centre. Its physical infrastructure leaves much to be desired, with rundown buildings, and open drains that emit a foul odour. Vavuniya has not had the fortune of a political patron vested with governmental power to transform it like Polonnaruwa and Hambantota have been. But the town itself is peaceful. It is difficult to imagine that it was once under threat of bombardment and thousands of soldiers transited through it on the way to the front lines or back to their homes in the south. In the past there were a large number of security checkpoints at which busloads of people had to disembark and walk on foot from point to point while their vehicles were checked.

A group of civil rights activists yesterday staged a protest in front of the Central Bank against latter’s sharp salary increments which has come under much criticism.

“We have gathered here at another State within the country — the Central Bank. It operates autonomously, seemingly unchecked,” Magen Ratata Chairman Sanjaya Mahawatte, asserted.

Accusing CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe of undue influence, Mahawatte claimed that there are alarming discrepancies in the bank’s operations.

“Recently, a bundle of cash went missing, however, when the investigations were conducted by the Fort Police the Governor did not know how much was missing from the stack of money printed at that time. This shows his lack of oversight,” Mahawatte charged.

He also alleged Dr. Weerasinghe of implementing policies that disproportionately affect private sector workers, by reducing the EPF rate to 9%, while exempting CBSL employees from such measures.

In this context the Ministry of Finance has issued instructions not to increase any salaries of employees in the Government sector.

### Women’s political enthusiasm must be encouraged

Sri Lankan women seem to have gained an unprecedented and considerable importance in Sri Lankan politics lately, thanks to the record gatherings of women by JVP/NPP as a part of their show off of power, as the major elections are around the corner.

These gatherings have some sort of copycat effect on some other political parties as well, which is also a good sign, as far as women’s politics is concerned.

It is within that context that the International Women’s Day fell on March 8. Yet, we could witness comparatively fewer commemorative events and media concerns this year, in view of that day.

The need for women’s politics has been felt for a long time not only as they are half or more of the population, but also in most so-called developing countries they play a subservient role in politics, giving up the decision-making right to men in the family, the father, brothers, husband or sons.  Very rarely do women make political decisions totally independent of the male relatives.

The Online Safety law and the Anti-Terrorism Bill are two important building blocks in the architecture of repressive laws the Government is constructing. Both were challenged in the Supreme Court, with the Supreme Court finding certain provisions of both unconstitutional. Stakeholders, such as opposition politicians, civic activists, tech companies and the United Nations called upon the Government to, at a minimum, incorporate the Court’s recommendations in the Online Safety Bill before it was enacted. The Government instead passed the law ignoring parliamentary procedure and failed to ensure compliance with Supreme Court determinations.

Malnutrition stunts the brain and affects the body. It is not an issue to be resolved in 2048 – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Contrary to claims of ‘technocrats’ claiming robust progress, there is real, visible, touchable and detectable misery in the heartland. According to the latest WFP country report 17% of the population is facing moderate acute food insecurity. 31% of children aged under 5 are malnourished. 20% of children aged under 5 suffer from wasting. People are compelled to skip meals, beg, or borrow food, or simply learn to live in the gutter, staring at stars

In his recent update to Parliament on the nation’s economy, President Wickremesinghe claimed that it is “widely acknowledged” that Sri Lanka has achieved a certain level of economic stability.

“We’re diligently strengthening the economy each day, striving tirelessly to improve the lives of our people and fortify the economy. Our actions are guided by a strategic plan, ensuring a systematic and methodical approach.”

### It’s happening now…what

*2024-03-11 23:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/its-happening-nowwhat/) · `en`

Singer Alston Koch, who now resides in Australia, came up with a song, titled ‘Can We Take This Climate Change,’ and that was 16 years ago…in 2008.

Elaborating on what made him come up with this ‘climate change’ song, the ‘Disco Lady’ hitmaker said that he noticed that some of the beautiful fruit trees, butterflies, birds, etc., that existed when he was young, were gradually disappearing and that the heat was on the rise.

‘Can We Take This Climate Change’ was created by Alston for a United Nations WTO presentation in London, and that was in 2008.

The song was also presented by Geoffrey Lipman, Chairman of International Council of Tourism Partners (ICTP) at the ‘Live the Deal Climate Change’ conference in Copenhagen.

Alston Koch was the Goodwill Ambassador for the campaign, and the song was promoted, globally, by ICTP, in their campaign for green growth.

He insists on not negotiating with the IMF and has outlined amendments to be discussed with the Monetary Fund representatives.

🟩

The International Monetary Fund did not seek negotiations with international credit providers. Parliamentarian Harsha de Silva said he emphasized that negotiations with the loan owners should be transformed and obtained the compliance of the opposition.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe was summoned by the International Monetary Fund on Monday (11). In response, he further stated that he added.

I do not request negotiations with the IMF. Sought negotiations with international credit providers. It is imperative for the government to advance in the wake of the current compliance with the International Monetary Fund.

Therefore, if compliance with international credit providers and financial institutions can be implemented in the future, it would be a crisis for the new government that would rule. In the event of such a situation, the country will be able to repay the bankruptcy and cannot repay the debts.
