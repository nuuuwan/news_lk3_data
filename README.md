ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka will exempt one house from a proposed wealth tax outlined in an International Monetary Fund program, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

About 90 percent of the people’s houses are likely to be exempt from the proposed tax, he said.

“[O]ne house will be exempt from this,” President Wickremesinghe told parliament Monday.

“It is going to have a very high threshold and I do not think the vast majority of the people in this country should even be worried about their house

The IMF program document however did not mention an exemption on one house, but did mention an exemption threshold.

Taxing houses and thrift in general could have detrimental effects on people’s well-being, housing stock and their willingness to remain in the country without migrating, critics say.

### Sri Lanka says imputed rental tax will not apply to all

*2024-06-18 05:03:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-says-imputed-rental-tax-will-not-apply-to-all-168480/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s planned imputed rental tax will only apply to wealthier persons, according to a Finance Ministry statement.

Wealth taxes, which have been implemented in a number of other countries, have had detrimental impacts on housing as well as other negative fallouts, partly due to the lack of cashflows to pay such taxes.

“The envisaged property tax is in an advanced stage of design and therefore, it is premature to outline specific details of rates and thresholds,” the Finance Ministry said.

“However, the focus of this tax is on high wealth individuals, and not on average income earners.

“This objective will be achieved by a suitable tax-free threshold to ensure that the tax is targeted on very high value property or multiple properties that are owned by wealthy members of society.

Most assets have been built out of earnings already taxed by the state. Taxes that penalize thrift in general tend to have negative consequences, critics say.

United Peace Coalition Chairman Basheer Segudaoud said that a Tamil -speaking minority general candidate should be suspended as the overall representative of the Tamil, Muslim and Upcountry Minority Communities in the country.

He said this in a media statement issued to the media on Monday (17) regarding the general candidate in the presidential election.

The upcoming presidential election has become a speech. The proposed candidates of the Great Forces have come to the North, East and the hill country to seek the support of minority communities.

Vishwaroopam is the biggest match that the election has not existed before. Winning any candidate with a uniqueness can be as difficult as fiber in the stone.

Beyond that, it is no exaggeration if any candidate wants to get 50 percent of the votes.

A president could not appear from minority communities in Sri Lanka. But who is the President?Minority communities can become a power that determines.

### Sarvajana Balaya to hold first political rally in Nugegoda today

Hints two additional parties may join their coalition during meeting

Sarvajana Balaya is set to hold its inaugural political rally today in Nugegoda, aiming to reignite the support of the 6.9 million voters who previously backed a better future for the country. During the meeting, it is hinted that two additional parties may join their coalition.

Holding a media briefing, Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) leader Dilith Jayaweera expressed readiness to rekindle the enthusiasm of those voters.

He stressed that none of the Sarvajana Balaya representatives were responsible for the downfall of the previous regime, attributing the failure to the Rajapaksa family’s inability to meet the people’s expectations.

Jayaweera specifically blamed Basil Rajapaksa’s liberal ideologies for the regime’s collapse.

“The 6.9 million voters symbolise those who love the country,” Jayaweera stated.

He said there is no option for the people of the country other than rallying around Sarvajana Balaya.
