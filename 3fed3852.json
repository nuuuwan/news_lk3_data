    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has developed a tea plucking machine which selects the most suitable leaves, overcoming drawbacks of earlier mechanized devices, M A Wijerathna, Head of Agronomy Tea Research Institute said.",
    "Though hand plucking is considered the best method to get the best leaves, the Tea Research Institute had been working on plucking machines for several decades knowing that workers were moving out of the sector triggering labour shortfalls.",
    "In 2014 a pilot project was implemented to popularize plucking devices among tea smallholders.",
    "Though there are imported tea plucking machines they were not found to be suitable for Sri Lankan conditions.",
    "In 2020 a machine was developed to pluck selected tea leaves.",
    "\u201cFor that we coordinated with two firms, and two\u00a0machines\u00a0have been designed, and a prototype of one of those\u00a0machines\u00a0is in really good conditions,\u201d Wijeratne said.",
    "\u201cWe have already applied for the patent for that\u00a0machine, and by the end of the year we will probably be able to introduce a plucking\u00a0machine\u00a0that only plucks selected leaves from Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s large plantations in particular have been losing labour to other sectors as younger workers move out of plantations.",
    "Workers in Sri Lanka\u2019s large plantations have fallen to around 115,000 by 2021 from around 255,000 in 2001, according to data released by Sri Lanka\u2019s Planers\u2019 Association.",
    "In the smallholder sector employment is estimated to be 455,000 workers. (Colombo/June28/2023)"
