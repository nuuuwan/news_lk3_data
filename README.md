Cinnamon Development Department says that the main export agricultural crop of Sri Lanka is planning to earn a US $ 500 million annually by cinnamon cultivation.

The cinnamon production of Sri Lanka is about 25,000 metric tons, which exports nearly 19,000 metric tons.

Director General of the Cinnamon Development Department Janaka Lindara said Cinnamon exports would earn about $ 250 million a year to Sri Lanka.

The plans have been made to double that income.

Accordingly, the cinnamon development department has been prepared to expand cinnamon cultivation in the Kurunegala, Puttalam and Mahaweli zones in Galle, Matara areas.

Meanwhile, Mr. Lindara said that a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed with China.

As a result, the export of cinnamon to China from January 2025 will be exported to China.

### Colombo‚Äôs garbage surges during festive season

*2024-12-28 09:49:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104535/colombos-garbage-surges-during-festive-season) ¬∑ `en`

The Colombo Municipal Council says that there is an increase in the garbage disposed within the Colombo municipality during the festive season.

Colombo Municipal Commissioner Palitha Nanayakkara explained that the daily garbage collection, which usually amounts to 450 tonnes, is expected to rise to 500 tonnes by the end of the month.

He further stated that the festive season has caused a slight increase in waste generation, with the daily waste production in Colombo normally ranging between 420 and 450 tonnes.

‚ÄúHowever, due to the large number of people arriving in Colombo by December 31, we predict that this amount could be around 500 tons,‚Äù he added.

Meanwhile, the Director of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Ajith Gunawardena stated that the large amounts of food being thrown away has led to an increase in the amount of biodegradable waste.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Helmut Schlesinger, who retired from Deutsche Bank 1993 as its President after helping keep Germany stable with the strong Deutsche Mark, standing against mainstream Saltwater-Cambridge inflationism that rocked the rest of the world, has passed away.

Schlesinger‚Äôs passing comes as Germany is experiencing the highest inflation and social unrest since the Great Inflation period under the Euro, and early elections have been called after the collapse of a coalition government and calls to re-establish the Deutsche Mark.

In 1952 Schlesinger had joined Bank deutscher L√§nder, the predecessor agency set up to issue to run Deutsche Mark and served the agency in different capacities maintaining monetary stability when the Fed fired global inflation to promote ‚Äòfull employment‚Äô.

### Elephants, Monkeys & Kidneys

I have chosen this seemingly peculiar title for the reason that each summarizes the plight of our farmers, unresolved challenges that warrant greater attention of politicians, administrators and researchers. These are real and urgent problems.

All three share the common feature that easy solutions remain elusive and most likely to involve a number of causes and disciplines (multifactorial) and thus a simple or single solution is unlikely.

Farmers are the most affected by elephant and CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Aetiology), while the monkey menace troubles urban communities as well. All three are not new, but have come into prominence lately. The economic consequences are very clear. The helplessness of the victims is pathetic.

### Russia may be responsible for downed Azerbaijani plane, says US

White House spokesman John Kirby has said the US has seen ‚Äúearly indications‚Äù that Russia may have been responsible for the downing of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed on 25 December, killing 38 people.

Mr Kirby did not elaborate further, but told reporters the US had offered assistance to the investigation into the crash.

The plane is thought to have come under fire from Russian air defence systems as it tried to land in Chechnya before being diverted across the Caspian Sea to Kazakhstan, where it crashed.

The Kremlin has refused to comment, but the head of Russia‚Äôs civil aviation agency said the situation in Chechnya was ‚Äúvery complicated‚Äù due to Ukrainian drone strikes on the region.

Mr Kirby said the indications the US had seen went beyond widely circulated photos of the damaged plane, the Washington Post reported.

The year 2025 lies ahead, and addressing climate change is high on the list of priorities for countries across the world as well as the global community at large.

In between these sessions, much work remains to be done to advance climate action at the national and international level, including on a range of topics that include climate finance, the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), a new round of national commitments, and many more.

For many participants and observers, COP29 fell short of expectations. However, the conference still produced several decisions that lay out a roadmap for 2025 and beyond, while other agenda items were postponed until June or November 2025.

A vision to develop Sri Lanka‚Äôs railway infrastructure is the need of the hour even now, over four years after the island nation arbitrarily terminated a project that would meet its creaking infrastructural needs at concessionary terms from a friendly nation‚Äôs government

The project that was due to commence with land acquisition in 2020 and be concluded in 2024 with an LRT that would have trains running along an elevated track at four-minute intervals during rush hour and 10-minute intervals at off-peak times ended in ignominy for the Sri Lankan Government when the project was arbitrarily terminated by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration citing the ongoing economic crisis at the time

[This article is based on a talk given to the members of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service Association on the 10th of December, 2024]

I was invited to address you today on the topic of what the second coming of Donald Trump as President of the United States holds for the United States and the wider world outside of its shores. I was also requested to explain to you the Electoral College process by which a president is elected in the United States. This is a process that baffles even those familiar with the United States and the way its institutions function, as it is markedly different from the way in which other democracies elect their presidents and prime ministers.

I shall try my very best to not confuse you in my attempt to explain the manner in which the POTUS, to use the abbreviation for the President of the United States first used by telegraphic code operators in the 1890s, is elected.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday dissolved Germany‚Äôs lower house of parliament to pave the way for snap elections on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz‚Äôs three-way coalition.

‚ÄúEspecially in difficult times, like now, stability requires a government capable of acting, and reliable majorities in parliament,‚Äù which was why early elections were the right way forward for Germany, Steinmeier said in Berlin.

After the elections, problem-solving must become the core business of politics again, added Steinmeier in a speech.

The president, whose post has been largely ceremonial in the post-war era, also called for the election campaign to be conducted fairly and transparently.

‚ÄúExternal influence is a danger to democracy, whether it is covert, as was evidently the case recently in the Romanian elections, or open and blatant, as is currently being practiced particularly intensively on (social media) platform X,‚Äù he said.

The makeshift boat was carrying around 80 people when it capsized. Only 11 survived, the Ministry of Malians Abroad said in a statement on Thursday, after collecting information to reconstruct the incident.

A crisis unit has been set up to monitor the situation and will report any further updates, it added.

The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to the Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach Spain, has seen a surge this year.

Years of conflict in the Sahel region that includes Mali, unemployment and the impact of climate change on farming communities are among the reasons why people attempt the crossing.

The route, which traces the Atlantic coasts of Mauritania and Morocco up to Spain, is one of the world‚Äôs deadliest.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka is sending a fresh batch of 79 workers to Israel, which a United Nations agency and a growing number of experts and rights organisations have accused of carrying out genocidal acts against the Palestinians.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs Foreign Employment Bureau handed over air tickets to the latest group of Sri Lankans who had returned from a previous stint in the belligerent state.

The group of 79 workers are required to work for 5 years and 3 months in Israel, and are scheduled to leave for Israel on December 28, a government statement said.

‚ÄúThese workers can act as brand ambassadors in creating new job opportunities for the job seekers who are looking to go abroad for jobs related to the agriculture industry in Israel, which has been a source of controversy,‚Äù Bureau chairman Kosala Wickramasinghe was quoted as saying.

Wickramasinghe urged the workers to act responsibly so that ‚Äòthe dignity of the motherland is protected‚Äô.
