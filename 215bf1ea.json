    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka plans new regulations to control a nascent \u2018gig economy\u2019 and slap new taxes, according to discussions that had taken place at a parliamentary sectoral committee discussion.",
    "\u201cThe \u2018gig economy\u2019 is now expanding and a it was proposed to introduce a legal framework to regulate the activity and also introduce a new digital services tax,\u201d a statement said.",

    "Sri Lanka also has a separate effort to de-regulate the economy, where activities had already been stifled by the state.",
    "In many countries all domestic activities are in general be subject to value added tax, regardless of the jurisdiction of the country where good or services are produced or made.",
    "Sri Lanka had slammed a discriminatory tax on credit card transactions making it more expensive for domestic consumers to access e online services, and give an protectionist advantage to domestic firms  by taxing payment flows.",
    "The protectionist tax, introduced at the behest of some taxi and e-commerce firms to push up costs for consumers and reduce competition, had been deemed a multiple currency practice (MCP) by the International Monetary Fund.",
    "The internet has increased the economic freedoms of individuals around the world and allowed them to directly transact with foreign companies and enhance free trade, reducing opportunities for businesses to oppress consumers through protectionism, analysts say.",
    "Businesses in Sri Lanka generally try to promote that idea that that consumers within a geographical region is fair game for oppression had exploitation through import taxes.",
    "Economic buraucrats who print money to mis-target interest rates and create forex shortages, indirectly support these efforts, which benefits a few business owners at the expense of a national population, particularly the poor and push up relative costs, making the economy non-competitive globally.",
    "Sri Lanka for a few years had also gone on a drive of increasing income tax, where the state appropriates earnings before people spend them and creates economic activity as opposed to consumption taxes, including import taxes, where taxes are collected after a gainful economic activity.",
    "There were views expressed in the committee that the gig economy should be encouraged, the statement said.",
    "Internet companies are not paying corporate taxes domestically, the committee had been told.",
    "There was no information on whether profits are actually being made in the country by the companies if the actual costs were allocated or whether they are greater than the investments being made by these companies in Sri Lanka, than profits made.",
    "Pioneer companies could \u2018burn\u2019 capital for many years before making profits. In Sri Lanka, areas like taxis, are less regulated, entry and exit is unrestricted and therefore, it is already a competitive business.",

    "The most innovative large companies have emerged in the US where there is more economic freedom and less in Europe where business regulations and taxes are tighter.

    "Classical economists had pointed out that Mercantilists made up of traders or producers (non-capitalist business that try to earn profits by oppressing consumers or nationalist or other grounds) can easily dupe the ordinary public.",
    "\u201cThe interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public,\u201d wrote Smith in his Wealth of Nations.",
    "\u201cTo widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of the dealers.",
    "\u201cTo widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens.",
    "\u201cThe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\u201d",
    "Members of the ordinary public has been persuaded to give up their own interest by these parties.",
    "\u201cIt is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to give up both his own interest and that of the public, from a very simple but honest conviction that their interest, and not his, was the interest of the public.\u201d (Colombo/June17/2023)"
