    "Says in case of a delay, IMF is likely to provide breathing space",
    "A potential delay in securing an agreement-in-principle (AIP) with Sri Lanka\u2019s private bondholders is unlikely to impact the second review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, former Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.",
    "Rothschild, the financial advisor to the bondholder group, is currently studying the proposal and consequently, will present the proposal to the bondholder group with its recommendations, said the senior economist, addressing an informative forum organised by CA Sri Lanka in Colombo yesterday.",
    "While this process could take some time, he was confident that the bondholders, based on the recommendations of their advisors, would soon come onboard to reach an AIP with the government, possibly within the second review of the IMF programme.",
    "In a case of a delay, Dr. Coomaraswamy shared that the IMF would provide breathing space to the country, given that the negotiations are progressing on a \u2018genuine and good faith\u2019 basis.",
    "He acknowledged that the country has made significant strides in stabilising the economy, in line with the IMF criteria, ahead of the second review, which is set to start this week (March 7).",
    "\u201cI think one can safely say that we have done very well. In the sense that when the IMF conducted its review in December, they actually upgraded the macroeconomic framework. Growth recovered to the positive territory in the third quarter of last year,\u201d Dr. Coomaraswamy told the forum.",
    "The progress in meeting the key commitments under the IMF-backed programme is set to be formally assessed in the context of the second review of the Extended Fund Facility arrangement, alongside the forthcoming 2024 Article IV consultation assessing Sri Lanka\u2019s economic health.",
    "In addition, the IMF expects Sri Lanka to reach the final agreements with the official creditors as well as reaching in-principle agreements with the external private creditors (bondholders) on the external debt restructuring, ahead of the second review.",
    "The government earlier last month submitted an \u2018enhanced\u2019 proposal through its advisor Lazard, countering the bondholder group\u2019s previous offer from October last year. The bondholders had proposed a 20 percent haircut and the issuance of macro-linked bonds.",
    "Without divulging the details of the \u2018enhanced\u2019 proposal, Dr. Coomaraswamy noted that the government is not against the idea of linking debt restructuring with macroeconomic\u00a0performances in principle.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s official (bilateral) creditors are only expected to finalise agreements on external debt restructuring after studying the AIP reached with the private bondholders.",
    "Therefore, Dr. Coomaraswamy asserted that the AIP with the private bondholders needs to be aligned with the in-principal agreements that were reached with the country\u2019s bilateral creditors late last year. Otherwise, he cautioned that the bilateral creditors could walk back from in-principal agreements, triggering back and forth negotiations with the two groups, as happened in the case of Zambia.",
    "Although Zambia defaulted on its debt in 2020, the country is expected to complete the external debt restructuring only in the first half of this year.",
    "Sri Lanka reached the AIP with the Official Creditor Committee, representing the bilateral creditors and China, late last year."
