  "original_body_lines": [
    "If Sri Lanka feared a long day out in the field with Pakistan piling on the runs, with the second day customarily among the most profitable for batsmen at the SSC, they were spared of that with rain allowing for only ten overs of play.",
    "This does not bode well for Sri Lanka however, who need to win this Test to draw the series, after losing the first Test in Galle by four wickets.",
    "Pakistan, who started the day 21 runs in arrears, surged ahead to gain a 12-run lead, in a rather trouble-less passage of play with Abdullah Shafique moving onto 87 not out and Babar Azam unbeaten on 28.",
    "Pakistan were on 178 for 2 when rain stopped play at 10:43 a.m. and intermittent spells of rain ensured that no further play would be possible. (Pix: Kushan Pathiraja)"
