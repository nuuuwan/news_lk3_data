    "CCI Arch President Jayantha Perera in his speech noted that success of the construction industry is the culmination of the successes of its stakeholders. That is the architects, engineers, and other related professionals, contractors, materials producers and suppliers, for the construction industry.",
    "CCI CEO/Secretary General Eng. Nissanka N. Wijeratne stated that the Build SL 2025 launch is held at a time when the construction industry is emerging from a recession that lasted four years from 2020 to 2023. This year during the first two quarters the construction industry recorded a growth of 14.2% and 15.5% respectively. With foreign debt restructuring completed under the IMF program all the donor funded projects that were suspended are due to commence in the near future. With this and the expected increase in tourism and the construction industry is due to rebound in the growth trajectory in the coming months. By the time Build SL 2025 is held, there will be a big demand for construction services and materials and the exhibition is bound to have great success."
