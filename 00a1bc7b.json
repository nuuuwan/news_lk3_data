    "Faster output growth would boost job creation, including for women",
    "This year\u2019s Nobel Prize for economics was awarded to Claudia Goldin for drawing attention to gender gaps in economic activity. In few developing country regions are these gaps more pronounced than in South Asia.",
    "In the past two decades, South Asian women have continued to catch up with men in educational attainment. They are having fewer children, which has freed them up to work outside the home. South Asian countries have also passed laws aimed at improving employment opportunities for women.",
    "And yet their participation in labour markets has remained low. Just 25 percent of South Asia\u2019s working-age women were in the labour force in 2021\u2014about half the average among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). About 40 percent of young women in South Asia are not employed, in school, or receiving professional training\u2014about three times the corresponding share among young men.",
    "The arguments for why women need to participate in the labour market are well-established. Families where women are more economically empowered tend to invest more in their children and women\u2019s participation can raise productivity. When men are over-represented among breadwinners, entrepreneurs and high-earners and women comprise the majority of homemakers talent is misallocated and growth suffers.",
    "Women\u2019s low labour market participation risks wasting the demographic dividend from South Asia\u2019s still growing working-age population. By one estimate, South Asia\u2019s long-term sustainable growth in the rest of this decade could be boosted by as much as one percentage point a year if female labour force participation were raised to the EMDE average. Another estimate suggests that South Asia\u2019s GDP per capita could rise 19-58 percent in the long-term if women\u2019s employment was equal to that of men.",
    "So, why have women not joined the labour market in greater numbers?",
    "Dr. Poonam Gupta, Director General of the National Council of Applied Economic Research, recently points to many pieces that are currently missing in most South Asian countries: a care economy that caters to children and the elderly, safe transport and workplaces, women in leadership positions and the police force, economic and tax incentives, jobs that would allow women to return to the labour market after children are older, and an education system that promotes gender equality. Education gaps and limited access to finance and other inputs are also missing pieces. Indeed, many of these measures rank high in a recent World Bank assessment of interventions aimed at boosting female labour force participation. Comprehensive, multi-pronged approaches dealing with supply side barriers to women\u2019s employment have shown to be effective.",
    "But on their own, these measures are unlike to be sufficient. Two complementary factors are needed to catalyse women\u2019s economic empowerment. First, boosting job creation is vital to ensure women can thrive in current and future labour markets. Second, changing mindsets, behaviours, and attitudes around women\u2019s work is key to improving women\u2019s employment outcomes in a sustained manner.",
    "Faster output growth would boost job creation, including for women. In the 2010s, South Asian employment growth has averaged around 1 percent per year\u2014about one-third less than the rate of working age population growth. India is no exception. Faced with a challenging labour market, both male and female labour force participation rates have declined in India since 2010. Accelerating economic growth in the next decade could be key to turn this around.",
    "That said, the type of growth matters for job creation, too. The export-oriented sectors\u2014sectors in which firms face stiff competition in their product markets\u2014tend to be more gender-equal. More open trade and competition policies would not only boost output and productivity growth, but also favour greater gender equity. Indeed, Bangladesh\u2019s garment sector is a clear example of a light manufacturing-driven growth process that has attracted millions of women into the labour force. Similarly, the rise of the business, processing, and outsourcing industry in India attracted millions of women into the workforce and encouraged them to remain engaged in the labour market throughout their lifetime. Similar examples can be found in Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey.",
    "Social norms are tougher to change, but some interventions have been shown to be effective. These include mandated hiring policies (such as quotas), political reservations including in village councils, public works and employment guarantees, classroom discussions, community discussions, and efforts to lower search and match costs. But, for financially constrained governments, the fiscal cost of scaling up some of these measures needs to be carefully weighed against their likely benefits.",
    "Poor job prospects and negative attitudes towards women\u2019s work outside the home can interact in ways that deter women\u2019s participation in labour markets. For example, when jobs are scarce, social norms, rather than productivity, may determine labour market outcomes. According to the World Value Survey, a large majority of people in South Asia agree that \u201cwhen jobs are scarce, men have more right to a job than women\u201d. This majority has increased over the past decade in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.",
    "A comprehensive package of measures is therefore needed to draw more women into South Asia\u2019s labour markets. This package will need to include greater economic dynamism that creates jobs as well as shifts in mindsets and the removal of obstacles to women\u2019s participation. This is challenging work, and progress will not necessarily be steady and gradual. But increasing female labour force participation in South Asia is a challenge that all economies must rise to meet\u2014their future success depends on it.",
