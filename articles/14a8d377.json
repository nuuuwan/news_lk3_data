    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will charge taxes on owner occupied and vacant residential houses on imputed or \u2018imaginary\u2019 rents from April 2025, under an International Monetary Fund deal after aggressive macroeconomic policy pushed the country into sovereign default.",
    "The imputed rents will be calculated based on a property price register. However there will be an exemption threshold, a report released by after",
    "A nationwide digital Sales Price and Rents Register (SPRR) is to be set up by March 2025, and accessible to the Department of Inland Revenue.",

    "The tax on housing comes as there are existing constraints in building houses with high protectionists taxes on building materials. The IMF program however supports trade liberalization.",
    "Sri Lanka has trade controls due to a deeply flawed operational framework of the central bank which triggers forex shortages as rates are mis-targeted or including through sterilization of interventions to avoid market pricing interest rates allowing \u2018import substitution businesses\u2019 to claim that they can \u2018save foreign exchange\u2019 if given protection.",
    "Housing taxes like all wealth-style taxes have to be paid without cash flow unlike taxes charged on actual income.",
    "Areas with high property tax rates such as Baltimore in the US have led to falling populations and reluctance by owners to refurbish houses as higher values attract more taxes.",

    "Soaring property assessments ignite calls for tax reform in Baltimore City",
    "Sri Lanka has dodged a bullet on wider property taxes as there was a constitutional block.",

    "\u201cThe tax is imposed on the income of individuals (rather than real property itself) and thus raises central government revenue in accordance with the constitution.\u201d",
    "Sri Lankans already pay \u2018rates\u2019 for local government services based on a small assessed value, many of which have not been revised to in line with currency collapses triggered by the central bank.",
    "Unlike value added tax that people do not feel and conform to the South Asian taxation principle of Kautilya of not damaging the flower and taking honey like a bee, income style taxes make people \u2018feel the pain\u2019.",
    "As they are charged before a productive transaction is initiated, they also lead to lost income taxes and lost economic activity, analysts have said.",
    "But an advantage is that they make the public feel the \u2018feel the pain of the large government\u2019 and may lead to a push for a return to spending-based consolidation.",

    "There have been claims made that progressive income taxes led to a brain drain in Sri Lanka as people fled the country after the latest currency collapse.",

    "Sri Lanka started going to the IMF from the mid-1960s by printing money to suppress interest rates for refinance rural credit.",
    "Taxing non-existent incomes and savings could also lead to reform fatigue and turfing out of reformist administrations.",
    "Analysts who warned of the consequences of aggressive monetary policy say that while raising taxes is necessary it is not a replacement for monetary stability as seen repeatedly in Latin America and Sri Lanka in the past.",
    "After the IMF\u2019s Second Amendment to its Articles deprived the central bank of a credible anchor, currency depreciation inflation and civil conflicts ratcheted up in the 1980s as attempts were made to target money supply without a floating rate.",
    "The current serial currency crises came from targeting high levels of inflation without a floating rate.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s government spending is also high due to high nominal interest rates, which is also an inevitable consequence of a monetary regime with dual anchor conflicts.",
    "Before 1978 and the jettisoning of the external anchor Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation and interest rates broadly in line with that of the US.",

    "There have been claims that about 58 percent of defaulting countries since 1978 (waves of external defaults started after IMF\u2019s Second Amendment each time the Fed hiked rates) became repeat offenders. (Colombo/June14/2024)"
