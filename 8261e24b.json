  "original_title": "Who is Hanzeer  Azad Maulana,  the  Whistleblower Featured in the Channel 4 TV Documentary on Sri Lanka\u2019s Easter Bombings?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Britain\u2019s Channel 4  TV aired the documentary \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s Easter Bombings\u201d   in its \u201cDispathes\u201d program  on Tuesday 5 September 2023  at 11:05pm. Prior to the telecast, Channel 4 Dispatches stated that the documentary has \u201cexclusive interviews with high placed whistleblowers who allege that some Sri Lankan government officials were complicit in the bombings.",
    "The Oxford dictionary defines a Whistleblower as a  \u201csource who makes public information about alleged wrongdoing, typically by or within the organization in which they are employed. A person blowing the whistle to journalists\u201d",
    "The Merriam-Webster Dictionary says  a whistleblower is \u201cone who reveals something covert or who informs against another\u201d.",
    "The Cambridge dictionary describes a whistleblower as \u201ca person who tells someone in authority about something illegal that is happening, especially in a government department or a company.\u201d",
    "According to Collins dictionary a whistle-blower \u201c is someone who finds out that the organization they are working for is doing something immoral or illegal and tells the authorities or the public about it.\u201d",
    "In this context the Channel 4 documentary featured three \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d. One was Hanzeer Azad Maulana the former aide of Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP) leader and Batticaloa district MP  Sivanesathurai  Santhirakanthan  alias \u201cPillaiyaan\u201d who is currently the  state minister. for Rural Road Transport.",
    "The second  was Ex-police officer Nishantha Silva  the Police sleuth who probed the murder of Lasantha  Wickrematunge and  who in the process of doing so interrogated Gotabaya  Rajapaksa intensively.",
    "The third was another top Sri Lankan Govt official who remained anonymous without his image being shown. Both Azad Maulana and Nishantha Silva are reportedly living in Europe now.",
    "Although three whistleblowers were featured in the documentary, the star among them was Hanzeer Azad Maulana. The allegations levelled by him  against persons such as  Ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, State Intelligence Service chief Suresh Salley and   State minister Pillayan helped the documentary film makers  to make out a strong case. The importance of Maulana\u2019s role in the documentary was acknowledged by Gotabaya himself.",
    "The Former President who had been maintaining a public silence since his ouster last year, responded to Channel 4 by issuing a public statement. The first two paragraphs of Gota\u2019s statement are excerpted here \u2013",
    "\u201cThe central allegation made in the latest film on Sri Lanka broadcast by Channel 4 is that the Easter Sunday suicide bombings of 21 April 2019 carried out by Islamic extremists had been deliberately facilitated in order to create the conditions to get me elected to power in November 2019.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis charge hinges on claims made by one Hanzeer Azad Maulana, an applicant for political asylum in Europe, that he had introduced Maj General Suresh Sallay (who is best known for his past role as the Director of Military Intelligence) to the principal suicide bomber Zaharan and his brother Zainee Moulavi in February 2018.\u201d",
    "It is against this backdrop that this column focuses  on the key  whisleblower Hanzeer Azad Moulana. Who is this former aide to TMVP leader and State minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakantha alias Pillayan and why has he dared to take this bold step of blowing the whistle at great risk to himself?",
    "The man known as Hanzeer Azad Maulana hails from   Maruthamunai in the Eastern province. Maruthamunai is a predominantly Muslim coastal about 360 km from Colombo. It is part of the Kalmunai electoral division within the Amparai district. Hanzeer\u2019s father was Mohammed Aliyar Mohammed Mihilar.  Hanzeer\u2019s  given  name is Mohammed Milhilar Mohammed Hanzeer. Azad Maulana is not his real name. It was a nom de guerre he adopted after joining the Thamil Makkal Viduthalap Puligal(TMVP).",
    "Hanzeer\u2019s father Mihilar was left-oriented in his political thinking. He also got along well with members of the Tamil community especially those from the adjacent Tamil village Paandiruppu. The Tamil militant organization Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation front(EPRLF) had a strong presence in Paandiruppu. This led to Mihilar becoming a member of the EPRLF even before the 1983 July anti-Tamil pogrom.",
    "After \u201cBlack July\u201d Mihilar  received arms training at the EPRLF camp in Kumbakoanam,Tamil Nadu. Mihilar was given the nom de guerre \u201cKamalan\u201d by the EPRLF> Thereafter he worked for the EPRLF in the Amparai district and was appointed to the Central Committee. The Indo-Lanka accord of 1987 brought about the  Provincial Councils scheme through the 13th Constitutional Amendment.  Unlike the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) the  EPRLF backed the Indo \u2013 Lanka accord and cooperated fully with India to  hold Provincial elections in the Northern and Eastern provinces.",
    "The EPRLF contested the first elections to the North -Eastern Provincial council comprising both the Northern and Eastern provinces. Mihilar himself was a candidate. He also campaigned actively for the EPRLF. The EPRLF along with the newly created Eelam National Democratic Liberation front(ENDLF) formed the first administration of the merged North \u2013 East provincial council.  Mihilar  however  was not elected to the first and only N-E PC.",
    "Annamalai Varatharajapperumal became the first chief minister of the North -eastern provincial council. Mihilar went to Trincomalee and worked as an official at the Provincial Council office. Things  changed after the Indian army  was withdrawn in 1990 March.Fearing a massacre at the hands of the LTTE, most of the EPRLF frontliners fled to India. Mihilar was one of them",
    "Kanthasamy Padmanabha the  amiable Secretary-General of the EPRLF along with many cadres moved to the Orissa (now  Odisha)state. Mihilar too went to Odisha and served as one of Padmanabha\u2019s bodyguards. The EPRLF continued to maintain its main office at Choolaimedu in Kodambakkam, Chennai.",
    "On June 19th 1990, Padmanabha came to Chennai(then Madras).Mihilar too accompanied him. Padmanabha was at a flat in Zacharaiah Colonu near the EPRLF office in Choolaimedu with some visiting  EPRLF stalwarts from Sri Lanka when the LTTE struck. A tiger squad led by Kiruban and one-eyed Sivarasan burst in and fired away. Padmanabha and 12 others were killed. Among those killed   were  North -Eastern Province Finance Minister Kirubaharan, Parliamentarian Yogasangary and Padmanabha\u2019s bodyguard Mohammed Mihilar alias \u201cKamalan\u201d",
    "Mihilar had four children ,  two girls and two boys. Eldest son  Hanzeer born in 1983 was only seven when he lost his father. The family was in dire straits. The EPRLF in those days  had a trust fund from which it helped the families of members killed by the armed forces or other militant groups like the LTTE. This  financial aid was of great help to the family then. Subsequently Hanzeer\u2019s mother married again.",
    "Mohammed Hanzeer studied at the Maruthamunai Shams Madhya Maha Vidyalaya.He  was a bright student who entered the Peradeniya University in 2003  to do a Bachelor\u2019s degree course in agriculture.  Having  financial difficulties  in pursuing higher studies, Hanzeer turned to Douglas Devananda for help. Douglas  who had broken away from the  EPRLF , was  the leader of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party(EPDP).",
    "However Devananda had been the  commander of the EPRLF\u2019s military wing known as the Peoples Liberation Army when he was in the EPRLF. Hanzeer\u2019s fathe Mihilar/Kamalan  was closely associated with Douglas. So when Mihilar\u2019s son sought his help, the EPDP Leader felt he had to help the son of his erstwhile comrade at arms.",
    "The EPDP was then running a weekly paper called the \u201cThinamurasu\u201d. Douglas  gave Hanzeer a job at \u201cThinamurasu\u201d.",
    "Hanzeer Mohammed was fluent in Tamil and English. He was  well-read and was  a very good writer in Tamil. He was also capable of translating from English to Tamil. So Mohammed Hanzeer began to work at Thinamurasu while pursuing his higher education at Peradeniya. Since he had lectures for only four days a week, Hanzeer would spend three days in Colombo working for Thinamurasu. He wrote political articles under pseudonyms and also translated news and articles from English into Tamil.",
    "About two years  later,  Hanzeer dropped out of Varsity and requested Douglas for a job. Devananda was then a cabinet minister. The Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation came under his purview. Former Amparai district MP Markandu Gunasekaran alias Shankar was the chairman of Cashew Corporation. Hanzeer was appointed as the chairman\u2019s secretary. After some months Hanzeer resumed his studies again and eventually  graduated. He had also studied Sinhala and was now trilingual.",
    "Meanwhile the LTTE underwent a major split in 2004 when its  Eastern regional commander Vinayagamoorthy Muraleetharan alias \u201cCol\u201dKaruna revolted against  tiger supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran\u2019s leadership. The breakaway  group known for a long time as the LTTE Karuna faction, aligned itself with the Sri Lankan Govt and its armed forces and intelligence services.",
    "The Karuna faction with State backing  took on the LTTE in the East.  Karuna\u2019s deputy  Pillayan (Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan )  based himself in Batticaloa as field commander. A political party known as the Thamil Eelam Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal(TEMVP)was also formed. Later the name was changed to Thamil Makkal  Viduthalaip Puligal(TMVP)",
    "After Mahinda Rajapaksa became President  in 2005 November, he appointed his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa as Defence Secretary. The new Defence secretary utilised the TMVP in a big way in the war against the LTTE. The TMVP was given the green light to function openly as a politico-military outfit.",
    "It was at this point that Mohammed Hanzeer\u2019s life got completely transformed . He was summoned by Douglas Devananda for a meeting in April 2006. Douglas told Hanzeer about the TMVP going to function independently as a political party. According to Douglas , Karuna\u2019s group had come out of the LTTE and was now trying to proceed on the democratic path. The EPDP leader told Hanzeer that   they must encourage them  and  said  that the TMVP required the support and help of people like Hanzeer because the TMVP leadership lacked proficiency in English and Sinhala.Hanzeer was asked whether he would help the TMVP.",
    "Hanzeer hated the LTTE which murdered his father in Madras. He also regarded the LTTE which massacred  Muslims in cold blood at various places in the east  and chased away the Northern Muslims at gun point as a fascist entity. Since the TMVP had  split from the LTTE and was combatting it, Hanzeer agreed to work with the TMVP. This  was his way of seeking vengeance for his father",
    "Thereafter a meeting was arranged by Devananda where Hanzeer met TMVP leader Karuna and deputy leader Pillayan. The meeting went off well. Both Karuna and Pillayan took an  instant liking to Hanzeer.   It was  arranged that a monthly stipend would be paid for services rendered. The amount agreed upon was in five figures. This was how Mohammed Hanzeer teamed up with the TMVP",
    "Initially Hanzeer had to adopt a nom de guerre. He was asked to choose a name for himself Hanzeer chose the name Azad Maulana. The name Maulana (some spell it as Moulana or Mowlana) means \u2018our master\u2019 and also refers to those  regarded as descendants of the Prophet. In practice however  those who are not descendants of the prophet also tend to use the name . Many add the name Seyyed or Zeyyed to it as a prefix.",
    "In Sri Lanka there have been quite a few Muslim politicians with the name Maulana like former minister Alavi Moulana, former B/caloa MP Ali Zaheer Moulana and ex -Senator Mashoor Moulana who like Hanzeer  is  also from Maruthamunai.",
    "In  Hanzeer\u2019s case his choice of Azad Maulana  was inspired by the great Indian educationist and freedom fighter  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad who was generally known as Maulana Azad or Azad Maulana. Azad opposed the creation of Pakistan and was a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity. Since  the TMVP membership was basically Hindu and Hanzeer a Muslim was going to work closely with Hindu comrades, the Muslim Hanzeer meaningfully  chose the name  Azad Maulana for himself.",
    "Mohammed Hanzeer now known as Azad Maulana\u2019s duties in the TMVP were three-fold. He had to work as a journalist on the Tamil fortnightly \u201cThamil Alai\u201d. He had to teach young members of the TMVP the political history of Sri Lanka with particular emphasis on the ethnic crisis.  Most importantly he was appointed  the accredited spokesperson of the TMVP. Hanzeer was proficient in Tamil and English and reasonably fluent in Sinhala also.",
    "Soon Azad Maulana  became a public figure giving media interviews and conducting press conferences.  He was also the public face of the TMVP. As time went on TMVP leader Karuna began to use Azad Maulana as an interpreter in dealings with the Government, Govt officials, members of the armed forces and intelligence service personnel Azad Maulana\u2019s influence and importance grew and  he became an integral  part of  the TMVP.",
    "The TMVP asked him to move from his residence in Panadura to the two storeyed  TMVP office premises  in Narahenpita. Apart from an increase in his monthy stipend, Azad Maulana was  given two cell phones and a motor cycle  for his use by the TMVP. Also he was absorbed into the TMVP party hierarchy  and made a Central Committee member.  In addition to being the official  spokesman,he was also appointed TMVP Media secretary.",
    "In 2007 there was an internal coup in the TMVP resulting in Karuna being ousted. Pillayan became the new leader. Azad Maulana latched on to Pillayan who also needed Azad\u2019s services.",
    ". In 2008 ,  elections  were held to the Eastern Provincial Council, The TMVP contested as part of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance(UPFA). In an unexpected move Pillayan became the first chief minister of the Eastern province. Pillayan appointed Azad Maulana as his coordinating secretary in addition to being the TMVP  spokesperson cum media secretary.",
    "Since Pillayan needed Azad Maulana to aid him in communicating with non \u2013 Tamils,  the young Muslim lad from Maruthamunai became  indispensable to Pillayan.  Maulana was the \u201clamb \u201c to Pillayan\u2019s \u201cMary\u201d. As in the words of the nursery rhyme \u201cEverywhere that  Mary (Pillayan)  went, the lamb (Azad Maulana) was sure to go.  Azad Maulana became Pillayan\u2019s right hand man and all-powerful. Everything seemed hunky -dory for Mohammed Hanzeer alias Azad Maulana. What happened thereafter will be related in the second part of this article next week.",
