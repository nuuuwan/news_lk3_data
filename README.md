### It is dangerous to provide a two -thirds majority to the national people's power - the son of Rohanavijayaweera

Dangerous two-thirds majority for JVP: Son warns against electoral disaster.

🟩

Wijeweera, son of JVP's founder Rohanavijayaweera, has warned that it is a dangerous thing to provide a two -thirds majority to the national popular power.

The general secretary of the second generation of the party, Uvindu Wijeweera, said that the issuance of a two -thirds majority to the JVP in the upcoming parliamentary election would be a political disaster.

He has appealed to voters to be cautious about the consequences that the JVP gets two -thirds.

After gaining a major majority in the 1977 general election, JR Jayawardene recalled the political tactics that JR Jayawardene advanced, said Rohana Wijayaweera's son, not to bear such a situation.

I do not think that the declaration of the national people's power to defeat corrupt politicians to clean up the parliament is wrong, but it is not right for voters to be elected only members of the national people's power at this moment.

He has appealed for voters not to be killed by the propaganda of the national people's power.

### Republicans win control of US Senate, make gains in House

Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate with victories in West Virginia and Ohio on Tuesday, ensuring Donald Trump’s party will control at least one chamber of Congress next year.

Republicans also posted early gains as they battled to retain control of the House of Representatives.

But Tuesday’s results ensured Republicans would be able to help Trump appoint conservative judges and other government personnel if he wins the presidential race, or block much of Democrat Kamala Harris‘s agenda if she prevails.

Republican Jim Justice was projected to win an open Senate seat in West Virginia shortly after polls closed, taking over the seat previously held by Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent. In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno was projected to defeat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown.

Those two victories ensured Republicans will hold at least a 51-49 majority in the Senate, with further gains possible as results in other competitive races come in.

Thank you for providing such a detailed overview of the political landscape in Sri Lanka. It appears you've been following the developments closely.

🟩

The November 2019 presidential election and the August 2020 parliamentary election for Janata Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) and its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have become a big disappointment. JVP as a tactical move. In both elections, the compass contested as part of a new political front under the new symbol.The party set up a vast front of the national people's power. Although the first appeared among nominally equitable organizations, it was practically the dominant party that controls the power of the national people.

The JVP is the only simple reason. Dressed in the dress of national people power. It wanted to seize power by election. The JVP has overthrown the Sri Lankan state through the armed struggle. Tried twice. Both attempts failed.

Migrants stranded for years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia will be offered the right to come to the UK, under a government proposal.

Around 60 Sri Lankan Tamils have spent more than three years in a makeshift camp on the island, which hosts a secretive UK-US military base, after becoming the first people ever to file asylum claims there.

The government has previously opposed bringing the group to the UK and complex legal battles have been fought for years over their fate.

In a letter on Monday, government lawyers said that “following further consideration”, the government had proposed a “change of policy”.

Under this, “all families, children and those of the unaccompanied males who do not have criminal convictions, outstanding charges or investigations would be offered the opportunity to be transferred directly to the UK”.
