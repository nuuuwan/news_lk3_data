    "COLOMBO (News 1st); In response to a decline in tea yields, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has announced a new initiative: interest-free loans for planters to purchase essential fertilizers.",
    "This program aims to revitalize the nation's iconic tea industry, which has suffered in recent years due to fertilizer shortages.",
    "The issue stems from a previous ban on chemical fertilizers imposed in April 2021.",
    "Secretary of the Ministry, Janaka Dharmakirthi, noted, last year's tea harvest reached only 260 million kilos, a disappointing 40 million kilos less than the previous year.",
    "This new loan program funded by the Tea Fund, aims to increase green tea yield by a remarkable 90 million kilos within the next six months through proper fertilizer application.",
