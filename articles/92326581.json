  "original_body_lines": [
    "Congratulations on your remarkable landslide victory, securing over a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This is a testament to the trust and belief the general public has in you. You have also set an inspiring example for greater women\u2019s political participation, which is truly commendable.",
    "As Sri Lankans, we have often relied on politicians to handle everything, but this approach has proven flawed. I genuinely want you to succeed so our country can regain its former glory. That is why I am raising my voice and sharing my perspective through this note, hoping it might be of value.",
    "We can\u2019t afford any more mistakes; the situation we find ourselves in today is dire. Every decision must be made with great care. The glass cliff lies before you and your Government, and navigating this challenging situation requires caution and thoughtful action. I offer this note in the hope that it may provide some guidance as you proceed.",
    "Public trust is the most crucial factor determining the sustainability of any government. It is essential that you uphold this trust at the highest level. Moreover, Sri Lankans have lost faith\u2014in themselves and in the nation. Your foremost priority must be to restore this faith. Help us fall-in-love again both with ourselves and our country. This will reignite the passion and momentum necessary for progress. It should be the core of your governance.",
    "Do not make the mistake of taking the public for granted. They are far more powerful than you may realise.",
    "Our economy is in dire need of urgent attention and reform. Fixing it must be a top priority and should remain directly under the President\u2019s leadership.",
    "1. The most immediate opportunity lies in tourism\u2014our \u201clow-hanging fruit.\u201d Launch a strong global campaign to create awareness about Sri Lanka, as many people around the world still don\u2019t know enough about our country. A consistent and impactful message is crucial. Focus on attracting quality tourists who will bring sustainable value rather than simply increasing numbers. This should be the primary short-term priority.",
    "2. In the short to mid-term, prioritise investment promotion by creating a business-friendly environment. However, ensure that the investors invited align with national security and long-term well-being objectives.",
    "3. The government must simultaneously focus on promoting SMEs and exports. Ensure capital is easily accessible for SMEs, and support organisations that enhance their capacity and export capabilities. Assist exporters in identifying and accessing global markets, reduce bureaucratic red tape, and simplify processes for businesses to operate in Sri Lanka. Foster and encourage an entrepreneurial culture, which will significantly boost the local economy over time.",
    "Identify and prioritise strategic export sectors such as IT, BPO, cinnamon, and the care industry, providing substantial support to drive growth in these areas.",
    "4. In the long term, establish a robust economic policy framework that remains consistent across successive governments. Ensure that infrastructure, ecosystems, and policies are in place to sustain and stimulate economic activity effectively.",
    "Next to the economy, foreign policy must be your next critical focus. This portfolio requires the most capable individuals. Sri Lanka holds a highly strategic position on the global map, making it essential to appoint skilled, intelligent, and patriotic representatives to lead this front effectively.",
    "Prioritise key foreign policy partners and assign the most qualified individuals to those crucial destinations. These roles are too significant to compromise. With the right people in place, Sri Lanka can unlock tremendous opportunities and achieve remarkable progress on the international stage.",
    "This is an area that has been overlooked for far too long by successive governments, leading to Sri Lanka\u2019s isolation in global diplomacy. Please address this with utmost care and attention.",
    "The third priority is education, which is currently in disarray. A complete overhaul is needed, starting from the ground up, to create an education system that nurtures true Sri Lankans. Quick fixes will not suffice; a thorough transformation is necessary. A slow, steady, and well-planned approach will yield long-term success.",
    "The fourth priority is enhancing government efficiency. This has been one of the most significant barriers to Sri Lanka\u2019s development and growth, and it must be addressed urgently. There are too many public servants and excessive bureaucracy that hinder progress. Introducing good governance practices, enabling technology, and ensuring transparency will be key. Streamlining government services to make them leaner and more efficient will significantly reduce red tape and corruption, leading to better service delivery and a more responsive government. These changes will foster an environment where businesses, including SMEs and exports, can thrive, driving long-term economic stability and growth.",
    "If you focus on these four priorities, you will achieve significant progress. This is exactly what Sri Lanka needs for the next five years. You and your Government will be remembered with gratitude if these goals are accomplished, or even if substantial progress is made in these areas.",
    "You must also learn from where previous governments have failed. These are important lessons that should not be repeated:",
    "1. Meritocracy \u2013 Past governments failed to appoint the right people to the right positions. This is a key area where the public judges the Government, and missteps here can erode trust. Ensure that appointments are based on merit, selecting individuals who are truly qualified for the roles.",
    "2. Avoid the mafia \u2013 Sri Lanka has various forms of mafia\u2014industry mafia, Government sector mafia, and others. Be vigilant and avoid associating with these groups. They have a history of exploiting power and pushing their agendas, which can be harmful to the government and the country. In the past, the mafia has always found ways to get around the governments! Please remain cautious and vigilant.",
    "3. Authentic leadership \u2013 Always remember that you are a temporary custodian, and ultimate power rests with the people. Stay grounded and connected to the public, as detachment leads to a loss of support. Always be truthful and authentic in your approach. The public understands that no Government can perform miracles, but genuine efforts will always be appreciated. Strive to do what is right for the country, engaging in open communication and consultation with the people.",
    "Sri Lanka is our country, and it pains me deeply to witness her struggles every day. I often dream of a day when I can proudly introduce myself on a global stage, saying, \u201cI am Seroshi Nandasiri, from Sri Lanka, one of the developed and accomplished nations in the world!\u201d I think together we can make it happen. Thank you."
