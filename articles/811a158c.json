  "original_body_lines": [
    "US Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has sued President Donald Trump over his attempt to fire her, setting up a potential legal battle with implications for the US central bank\u2019s autonomy.",
    "Cook has asked the Court to declare Trump\u2019s firing order \u201cunlawful and void,\u201d and also named Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as defendant.",
    "Trump has said there was \u201csufficient reason\u201d to believe Cook had made false statements on her mortgage, and cited constitutional powers which he said allowed him to remove her. Cook previously said that \u201cno cause exists under the law\u201d to sack her.",
    "The President has put increasing pressure on the Fed over what he sees as an \u201cunwillingness to lower interest rates.\u201d Cook is part of the Board responsible for setting interest rates in the US. Thursday\u2019s lawsuit is likely to bring up a number of legal challenges that could end up at the US Supreme Court.",
    "\u201cThis case challenges President Trump\u2019s unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would be the first of its kind in the Board\u2019s history,\u201d Cook\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell wrote in the lawsuit.",
    "\u201cIt would subvert the Federal Reserve Act, which explicitly requires a showing of \u2018cause\u2019 for a Governor\u2019s removal, which an unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not,\u201d Lowell wrote.",
    "White House Spokesperson Kush Desai said the President \u201cexercised his lawful authority to remove\u201d Cook.",
    "\u201cThe President determined there was cause to remove a Governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\u201d",
    "The Federal Reserve Act does not give the President authority to remove a Fed official at will, but as Trump has said, it does allow him to do so \u201cfor cause.\u201d",
    "The allegations against Cook were first made in a public letter from housing finance regulator, Bill Pulte, a Trump ally. In the letter, he accused Cook of falsifying records to obtain a mortgage.",
    "The letter alleges that she signed two documents, two weeks apart, attesting that two homes in different States were both her primary residence. No charges have been brought against Cook and it is unclear if she is under investigation for these allegations.",
    "She previously denied that there was any cause to sack her and legal experts have shown scepticism in Trump\u2019s standing.",
    "She is one of seven members of the Fed\u2019s Board Of Governors, and in this position sits on the 12-member committee which is responsible for setting interest rates in the US.",
    "Since returning to Washington, Trump has put increasing pressure on the Fed \u2013 especially Powell \u2013 over interest rates.",
    "The US President nominates candidates for the role, so removing Cook would mean she could be replaced by someone more favourable to lower interest rates and to the Trump economic agenda.",
    "The Fed\u2019s decision affects the rate at which Americans can borrow money as well as the savings rates on their bank accounts. US interest rates are also closely watched by central banks who set monetary policy in other countries.",
    "Cook voted alongside Powell and most other members of the committee to maintain US interest rates at the Fed\u2019s last rate-setting meeting at the end of July."
