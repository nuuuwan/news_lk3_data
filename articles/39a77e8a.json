    "The Cabinet of Ministers has given the go-ahead to make several amendments to the Online Safety Act based on the proposals submitted by various industry professionals.",
    "As such, the Legal Draftsman will be directed to outline a draft Bill to amend the much-disputed legislation as per a proposal tabled by the Public Security Minister at the Cabinet meeting on Monday (Feb.12).",
    "The Online Safety Act, which seeks to regulate online content, was passed in Parliament with amendments on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who alleged the new law will muzzle free speech.",
    "It garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects.",
    "In response to the criticisms, the Sri Lankan government has said the new law aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts \u2013 both authentic and inauthentic \u2013 for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters."
