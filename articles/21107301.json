  "original_title": "Malini Fonseka :  Why the  \u201cQueen  of Sinhala Cinema\u201d Became a UPFA National List  Parliamentarian.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The first Sinhala language feature film \u201cKadawunu Poronduwa\u201d(Broken Promise) premiered on 21 January 1947 at the Kingsley theatre in Colombo. Four months after that historic event ,on 30 April 1947,  a  baby girl was born in a Sinhala speaking family living in the Colombo suburb Peliyagoda. A few weeks later the parents went to an astrologer to cast a horoscope for the new arrival. They were astounded when the astrologer  said their daughter would be a queen someday according to the planet configuration at the time of her birth.",
    "Sri Lanka known as Ceylon became free of colonial rule under the British monarchy on 4 February 1948. There were no Kings or Queens in Independent Ceylon/Sri Lanka. Yet the astrologer\u2019s prediction did come true. The little girl did become a queen \u2013 a moviedom Queen! She took to acting and reigned for many years  as the Queen of Sinhala cinema.",
    "The Sinhala cinema queen I am  referring to  is oof course Malini Fonseka who breathed her last on 24 May 2025 at the age of 78. In an illustrious career spanning six decades, Malini acted in many stage plays,films and teledramas. The multi-faceted Malini  has even produced and directed films and teledramas. Her remarkable achievements led to  her  innumerable admirers and aficionados dubbing  Malini  as the Queen of Sinhala cinema.",
    "The doyen of Sri Lankan filmmakers and the director who pioneered authentic Sinhala cinema Lester James Peries was foremost among those who acknowledged her as queen. On 30 April 2003,her birthday, a felicitation ceremony named \u201cMaliniye\u201dwas held at the BMICH to mark four decades of Malini\u2019s thespian contribution. On that occasion Lester stated \u201cyou are called the Queen of the silver screen by the masses and I too accept that fact. If I had a crown, I would have surely crowned you here\u201d.",
    "Such praise coming from an eminent director like Lester James Peries is by itself a crowning laurel indeed. The cinematic relationship between Lester and Malini  has been deep, long -standing and productive.  Malini has acted in six of Lester\u2019s films. The films she acted in and the names of the roles she acted  are \u2013  Kumari-Akkara Paha, Irene-Nidhanaya,Bandara Menike -Veera Puran Appu,Punchi Menike-Beddagama, Sujatha-Wekande Walauwwe and Sumanawathie- Ammawarune.",
    "The first film Malini acted under Lester\u2019s direction was \u201cAkkara Paha\u201d(five acres)released in 1969. S he acted as Kumari  in a supportive role.In  Kumar de Silva\u2019s  book \u201cLester by Lester\u201d \u2013 a compilation  of interviews with Lester James Peries \u2013 the director refers to Malini\u2019s part in \u201cAkkara Paha\u201d in this way \u2013 \u201cIt had Malini Fonseka, not in a major role, but it was the first time she played in any of my films. At that time she was flitting from film to film. I did not know that she was becoming popular and going to be an icon in her own right.  I also did not know that she was going to play in my next film   Nidhanaya  ( 1970), which was going to be the seminal film of that period.",
    "Besides being the best Sinhala film of the 20th century, \u201cNidhanaya\u201d (treasure)was a milestone movie in the  careers of Lester James Peries, Gamini Fonseka and Malini Fonseka. As such the film and  aspects of Malini\u2019s performance in Nidhanaya  require special mention.",
    "Nidhanaya made in 1970 was entered for the 1972 Venice International Film Festival where the film won the Silver Lion of St. Mark award. It also received a certificate as one of the outstanding films of the year at the London Film Festival. Nidhanaya was also included in the global list of 100 best films to be ever made that was compiled by the Cinematheque Institute of France to mark the World Film Centenary. It has also won critical acclaim globally as one of the 10 top Asian films for all time.The film  also won the award for being the best Sinhala movie in 50 years, at Sri Lanka\u2019s Golden Jubilee of Independence in 1998.",
    "The shooting of the film took over seven months as both Gamini and Malini being busy film stars were available for only five days each month for Nidhanaya. Usually Lester shoots his films at a stretch without breaks but here it was not possible. Despite the long breaks in shooting, the continuity was maintained with great intensity by both Gamini and Malini, who complemented each other. About 70% of the film scenes featured both the Fonsekas only.",
    "Some of the great sequences in Nidhanaya relate to the acting skills of Gamini and Malini. In the waltz sequence both had to enact the dancing steps in natural slow motion as there was no second camera available to shoot in slow motion. So both coached by Keerthi Sri Karunaratne practised the steps and then danced for the camera in exaggerated slow movements. This was a feat that required perfect coordination and both Fonsekas rose to the occasion and did themselves and the film proud.",
    "Another scene where Malini excelled was when Gamini suddenly slaps her and berates her. Malini acts startled and upset perfectly. What really happened was that Lester and Gamini did not reveal how the scene was going to be shot to Malani beforehand. She did not know that Gamini was going to slap and shout at her. So when it did happen, she was naturally surprised and shocked. The result was a superb piece of contrived  \u201cnatural\u201d acting.",
    "A  strange   happening was the birthmarks phenomenon. Nidhanaya was based on a short story by G.B.Senanayake who in later years lost his sight. Malini played Irene the \u201cvirgin\u201dwife of  Willie Abeynayake played by Gamini Fonseka. The virgin had to be sacrificed to gain the treasure or nidhanaya.",
    "According to G.B. Senanayake\u2019s story the virgin woman to be sacrificed had four birthmarks. In an unbelievable coincidence Malini Fonseka had the identical birthmarks in the exact places. When told of this G.B. Senanayake refused to believe it. Later he felt the birthmarks with his fingers and shed his disbelief.",
    "Nidhanaya was the jewel in the crowns of both Malini and Gamini Fonseka. Apart from this artistically acclaimed film, the Fonseka duo starred in several commercially successful  films in the seventies of the previous century.  Sooraya Soorayamai,  Aawaa Soya Aadhare, Sana Keliya, Kasthuri Suwandha, Hondata Hondai. Hondhai Narakai, Hondama Welawa, Sadahatama Oba Mage,  Sahanaya, Edath Sooraya Adath Sooraya and Aadare Hithenawa Dekkama were but some of the  hits featuring the Fonsekas.The pair was so popular that many thought wrongly they were husband and wife,",
    "Unfortunately this blissful state of affairs underwent change gradually.Despite the glorious on  screen chemistry between both, Gamini and Malini , their off screen relations began deteriorating. There are some who opine that the somewhat egoistic and possessive Gamini  was cheesed off with the growing affinity  and screen popularity of  Malini and other  younger heroes like Vijaya Kumaratunga, Ravindra Randeniya  and Tissa Wijesundara.",
    "Whatever the reason or reasons, Gamini and Malini stopped acting together after 1977. I think \u201cDeviyane Oba Kohedha\u201dwas their last film then. However Malini and Gamini re-united on  the silver  screen after an absence  of 21 years. The film was \u201cAnthima Reya\u201d released in 1998. Malini Fonseka\u2019s  former husband Lucky Dias produced the film while Gamini Fonseka directed it. Interestingly Gamini,Malini and Lucky acted together in Anthima Reya.",
    "What is of noteworthy mention here is that Gamini Fonseka the superstar of Sinhala filmdom continued to regard Malini Fonseka as the finest actress to have graced the Sinhala silver screen. In an exhaustive interview given shortly before his  demise, Gamini Fonseka described Sandhya Kumari as the most beautiful Sinhala actress but praised Malini Fonseka as the best actress. He said Joe Abeywickrema was the best actor and Tony Ranasinghe the best character actor.",
    "Apart from  Gamini  Fonseka , Malini Fonseka\u2019s acting ability has  impressed other leading actors too. Sivaji Ganesan regarded by many  as the  greatest actor of  Tamil cinema  referred to Malini as one of the finest actresses he has paired with in several interviews given to Tamil journals. Sivaji acted with Malini in the film \u201cPilot Premnath\u201d released in 1978.",
    "\u2018Pilot Premnath\u2019  was an Indo-Sri Lankan co-production directed by A.C. Trilokachander. Sivaji Ganesan acted in the titular role \u201cpilot Premnath\u201d. Malini Fonseka played his wife  under her own name as  Malini. According to the story line, Malini Premnath dies early and features in the film through extensive flashback sequences. Critics reviewing the film on both sides of the Palk straits noted that  some of the scenes with Sivaji and Malini were intense and close. One review said Malini was sweetly seductive.",
    "The film was  shot in many scenic locales in Sri Lanka and had some lilting, toe-tapping songs.The most popular song in the film was \u2018Ilankayin Ilankuyil\u2019 (the young cuckoo of Sri Lanka) picturized on Malini and Sivaji. Singer Vani Jayaram lent  her voice (play-back) to Malini, and T.M. Soundararajan voiced  for Sivaji. Music was composed  by the monarch of light music music  (Mellisai Maamannar) M.S. Viswanathan. The movie ran for more than 100 days both in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka.",
    "Their inter-action on the film resulted in a bond of affinity between Malini and  the Sivaji Ganesan family. She visited them whenever she was in  Madras  now known as Chennai. Malini in an interview to the \u201cNew Indian Express\u201dsaid \u201c Sivaji introduced me to his wife and children and invited me to dinner at his house. I was very happy to work with him. In fact, it was an honour to work with him,\u201d",
    "Malini also  stated   in the interview that Sivaji Ganesan  had encouraged her to become a film producer. \u201cIt was Sivaji who urged me to become a producer. He would say \u2018Malini, you should make a No. 1 Sri Lankan creation,\u201d Malini disclosed to the then New Indian express correspondent P.K. Balachandran/",
    "Subsequently  Malini  broke new ground as a producer and director when  she made \u201cSasara Chethana\u201d in 1984. She also starred in the film. Malini took the film to Madras and screened it specially for Sivaji and his family. Malini also produced, directed and acted in \u201cAhinbsa\u201d(1987). She also directed and acted in \u201cSthree\u201d (1991)  and \u201cSanda Madala\u201d(1994) for which she was a script writer too.",
    "Several Sinhala filmstars have dabbled in Politics. These include Gamini Fonseka, Vijaya Kumaratunga, Ravindra Randeniya, Sanath Gunatilleka, Geetha Kumarasinghe and Upeksha Swarnamali. Malini Fonseka too entered politics briefly and served as a national list MP from 2010 to 2015.",
    "Malini had been generally supportive of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP).  Sri Lanka\u2019s lengthy civil war ended in 2009. In 2010 the war -winning President Mahinda Rajapaksa was re-elected as president. The  SLFP led United Peoples Freedom Alliance(UPFA) won the 2010 Parliamentary elections. Malini Fonseka was appointed  as a  UPFA national list  MP. A few years later Basil Rajapaksa wanted Malini to resign as MP in order to appoint another. But Mahinda overruled his brother and Malini continued to remain as MP.",
    "Malini  opting to serve as a UPFA national list MP under President Mahinda Ranasinghe  incurred the displeasure of many of her fans. Malini Fonseka   provided an explanation for her entry into politics as an MP belonging to the Mahinda Rajapaksa Govt.  This was part of a personal essay published in the \u201cSunday Times\u201dof 20 June 2010. In that Malini  rationalises  in her own words the reasons for her plunge into politics. Here are relevant excerpts \u2013",
    "\u201cMany ask me why I took the plunge into politics when I have had more than my share of fame and fortune in the movies and had reached heights which I could never reach as an MP. I had nothing to gain and my reputation to lose, they said.\u201d",
    "\u201cIndeed, for some time now I have had invitations from both major political parties but I have resisted all of them. However, I had this lingering notion that I could use whatever position I enjoy today for the greater good only if I had the power to do so. That is very difficult to muster as just another individual. As a parliamentarian, on the contrary, many closed doors open for you and more opportunities to be of service present themselves. That is one major factor that made me finally decide in favour of politics.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere are other reasons as well. In 2005, I was afflicted with a life-threatening illness. Looking back, I was devastated. But I was so deeply moved by the outpouring of support, love and affection of my fans that I became stronger and more determined than ever to overcome that challenge. My fans gave me the strength and courage. I faced that gauntlet with fortitude and succeeded.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt was overwhelming to realise that you are appreciated and cared for so much. But with this came the courage to face that illness \u2014 a courage which I now make it a point to pass on to others who are in a similar predicament.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe responses I received from those near and dear to me \u2014 as well as those who knew me only by name \u2014 convinced me that I should do more for all of them in return. And I was not sure I could do that as a mere citizen.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat clinched the issue was the end of the war, as we had known it for the past thirty years. I felt that it was a golden opportunity to rebuild not only the nation but also to help those less fortunate than me to realise their dreams and potential. When the invitation came from President Mahinda Rajapaksa, I knew that I would be failing in my duty towards the country if I said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d",
    "\u201cI must admit, I had my reservations too \u2014 politics has acquired such a notorious reputation. However, having been to Parliament for a few months now, I must say that my faith in this democratic institution has been restored, even if there have been instances in the past when its integrity has been questioned.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat then, of the future? Since becoming a parliamentarian I have also been nominated among the top 25 actors in Asia by the Cable News Network. That has made me proud because it means that a Sri Lankan has won the award.\u201d",
    "\u201cI do have more plans in store and I plan to formally announce them in due course but they will be directed at lending a helping hand to both those within and outside the movie industry. When that becomes a reality, I would have repaid at least a part of the debt I owe to this country.\u201d",
