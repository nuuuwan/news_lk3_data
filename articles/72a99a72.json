    "ANC Education recently hosted a special Pre-Departure Event to celebrate and support students who have successfully secured their student visas to begin their higher education journey in the United States and Canada. This important event was designed not only to recognize the achievements of these students but also to provide them and their families with valuable guidance and reassurance as they prepare to embark on a new chapter of their lives. In addition to these sessions, attendees had the opportunity to connect with ANC alumni who had previously transferred to universities in the US and Canada. These alumni shared personal insights and firsthand experiences on adapting to life overseas, managing academic workloads, and building successful careers after graduation, offering current students inspiration and confidence.",
