    "Kandy, the largest city in the Central Province of Sri Lanka, will see the grand opening of a mega, cozy\u00a0bookstore on 20th December 2024, equal in importance or quality to any highly patronized bookstore in Colombo, N.B. Basnayake, Managing Director of N.B. Basnayake Company Pvt. Ltd., told The Island Financial Review last week.",
    "We listened to the entrepreneurial journey of the man born in Hasalaka and studied at Rahula Vidyalaya, Katugastota who had his nose buried in the library books during his school days and came up the hard way.",
    "\u201cIn the mid-1990s, there was no hype or school entrepreneurship programmes or bank seminars about entrepreneurship. I simply had a love for books in my youth and I spent a great deal of my free time in the school library. This inspired in me a desire to build a supermarket-model bookstore in Kandy; a cozy place where those who live in Kandy as well as who visit there for work, business or leisure can walk in and buy a good novel, a biography, English translations of greatest books ever-written or the whole range of schoolbooks for the academic success of school going children, under one single roof in Kandy. The Rs. 70 million worth bookstore aptly named as Sipsayuri Poth Medura that we are opening on Dec. 20, in Tennekumbura, Kandy will be the largest of the kind outside of western province of Sri Lanka. It will have not only all type of books but also stationery, schoolbags, shoes, lunchboxes water bottles and all other school educational items,\u201d he said.",
    "Reflecting on the past he said,\u201d As a young man, I first earned my own livelihood as a mathematics tutor for some years. In the meantime, I started distributing school textbooks printed by various publishers in the country to bookshops in all parts of the country. In addition to that, I organized bookfairs at many schools in the country where I saw firsthand the demand for high-quality schoolbooks. The market taught me that having a strong sales network, a pool of recognized authors for different subjects and a publishing house with high print quality would be the recipe for success in this domain. Taking insights from that ground-based experience and the funds I accumulated over the years from the distribution operation, I ventured into becoming a publisher making significant investments in infrastructure, human resource, transporting lorries and state-of-the art German machinery. Today, I have reason to believe that my company is among the top ten publishers of Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "When asked what today\u2019s young people can learn from the entrepreneurial journey of a man born in Hasalaka, studied at Rahula Vidyalaya, Katugastota and distributed other publishers\u2019 books for more than 20-years and built his own publishing house and mega bookstore, he replied,\u201d Find your passion, be honest, be flexible, deliver quality, take risks, trust yourself and above all set goals beyond profit.\u201d",
    "Basnayake noted that if the policymakers explore ways to reduce the high taxes applicable to input imports for the publishing industry, the current prices of books and educational materials could be brought down by about 20%, which he said would ease the burden on struggling families and encourage the reading public to enhance their cognitive skills.",
    "\u201cPublishing is for reading. And reading maketh a full man,\u201d Basnayake said referring to a quote by Francis Bacon, the famous English philosopher.",
