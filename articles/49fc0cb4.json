    "High Commission of India in Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre, organised two special meditation sessions to observe the United Nations-designated World Meditation Day on 21 December 2024.",
    "The sessions, which took place in Colombo and Ratnapura, provided a unique opportunity for individuals to enhance their mental and physical well-being through the practice of meditation.",
    "The first session was held at the Mayurapathy Meditation Hall in Colombo, while the second session took place simultaneously at Jethvanarama Buddhist Monastery, Kalatuwawa, Ratnapura. Both sessions were attended by a large number of participants and were widely appreciated for their calming and transformative effects.",
    "On 6 December 2024, the United Nations General Assembly in its unanimously adopted resolution A/79/L. 27 declared 21 December as World Meditation Day. The core group of the resolution which included both India and Sri Lanka, made a joint effort to recognise the positive impact of meditation on mental and physical health. The declaration of this day emphasises the complementary relationship between yoga and meditation, both of which play an integral role in promoting holistic health. 21 December holds special significance as it marks the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere \u2013 the shortest day and longest night of the year. This natural phenomenon has been seen as a time for introspection and renewal, making it the perfect occasion for individuals to engage in meditation and reflect on their well-being."
