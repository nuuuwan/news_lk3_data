SYDNEY, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

Governor Weerasinghe told the media on Tuesday that "I do not see the currency exchange rate when looking at the foreign returns and allowances that come in the future."

"Despite the change, our policy will allow the market to operate, and we have the ability to interfere if there is too much fluctuation."

The central bank is now $ 5.4 billion, but the central bank allows the market to determine the rates based on requirements.

Governor Weerasinghe said that I do not think that there will be massive inequalities based on the current available data.

He said Sri Lanka expects to complete the debt restructuring, which would lead to the restoration of new projects.

Last year, Sri Lanka had repaid US $ 2.5 billion loan to parties, including multi -level creditors.

### Australia raises minimum savings for student visa, warns on fake recruitment

Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

Colombo, May 8 (Daily Mirror) - In light of emerging reports detailing the involvement of Sri Lankan veterans in foreign mercenary forces, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Shavendra Silva has issued a heartfelt plea to his fellow veterans, urging them to resist the allure of mercenary service.

“These veterans, once the pride of our nation, have succumbed to the seductive promises of riches and adventure, forsaking the values that define us as warriors and patriots,” General Silva said in a statement yesterday.

He also stated that as members of the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka, “we are bound by duty, honour, and a deep sense of loyalty to our motherland. We have stood valiantly in the face of adversity, sacrificing for the greater good of our nation. Yet, there are whispers of temptation, enticing some of our comrades to forsake their loyalty for the allure of easy money and transient glory.”

### Sri Lanka gross foreign reserves rise to 3.5 year high in April

*2024-05-08 06:15:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-gross-foreign-reserves-rise-to-3-5-year-high-in-april-161947/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves rose by 478 million US dollars in April 2024 to 5,438 million US dollars, official data shows, as the central bank continued broadly deflationary policy.

Deflationary policy (net sell downs of central bank-held domestic securities) at a market-appropriate interest rate allows a balance of payments surplus to develop.

The rupee sharply appreciated in March and early April, leading to importer bill delays and heavy reserve collections.

Some pressure came in the latter half of the month largely due to oversold position and the central bank used moral suasion and some dollar sales to keep the exchange rate stable.

Sri Lanka’s private credit is still weak, allowing reserves to be collected and the external sector to be kept stable easily.

Sri Lanka depends significantly on pulse imports, yet there is a sizeable gap in the total pulse supply to meet the dietary needs of the population

Given the current level of pulse production in Sri Lanka, the immediate goal should be to improve local production gradually while filling gaps in supply to achieve dietary requirements through imports

Everything needs to have a reason, framed in its purpose. Without reason and purpose, life and everything that is part of living decays into meaninglessness. Mark Twain brilliantly explained, “The two most important days in life are the day you were born and the day you find out why.” That truth applies as much to life as to business. There was a time – when it was thought private enterprise – businesses pursuing their own interests – would contribute to a better outcome for society as a whole. It was thought that individuals in pursuit of profit would inadvertently contribute to the economic well-being of society as a whole.

### Religious misrepresentation and Israeli bloodlust in Rafah

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for the obliteration of Rafah, Deir al-Balah, and Nuseirat.

In the dark ages one could, to an extent excuse bloodlust and calls for the eradication of an entire race of a particular people. People of that day and age were primitive. Bloodthirsty men of the cloth called for the eradication of particular peoples whom they saw as their enemies. They used God’s name as a cover for their hatred.

The fear of so-called ‘Holy men’ who had private discourses with the deities led them to follow the dictates of those crazed characters.

So it is quite surprising, to hear modern-day rulers of Israel spout blood-thirsty calls for the killing of an entire people -in today’s context the Palestinians- because of what some misguided old men called for in bygone ages.

Israel’s Finance Minister was referencing passages in Israel’s ‘Holy  Book’ where early religious leaders called for the total destruction of  the Amalek people.

Two days ago this newspaper highlighted the story of a Woman Police Constable (WPC) being arrested for picking the handbag of a shopper in Kandy. Not many of us citizens were shocked or dumbfounded. After all, this was ‘merely’ a case of a so-called ‘law keeper’ breaking a law.

We as a nation know how our country’s leaders brought our people and the nation to a position of bankruptcy through corrupt practices. The political leaders of this country are not much different from political leaders in even the richest country in the world.

During the era of prohibition in the United States, the infamous US criminal Al Capone rose to success on the back of the Temperance Movement. On January 16, 1919 prohibition was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

### How wheeler-dealing over visa  could  kill tourism’s golden goose

If the Government of Sri Lanka desires to streamline the inefficient and corruption-laden immigration and emigration authorities, one can’t find fault.

The Immigration Department is infested with crooks that have fought against even the most innocuous measures of oversight and accountability. CCTV cameras purchased to install in its head-office are still stored in the warehouses for six years, the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts (CoP) found recently.

But, a controversial and unsolicited tender that awarded the monopoly of visa processing to a private contractor, VSF Global -- which overnight doubled the on-arrival visa fees, unleashed chaos and confusion at the airport, and risked the future of the tourism industry in the country--smack of a scam far extraordinary or grand incompetence, and most likely both.

Colombo, May 7 (Daily Mirror) - Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne requested Sri Lanka's war heroes not to become victims of human smugglers who are recruiting people to serve in the armed forces on the Russian-Ukrain war front.

He revealed that Sri Lanka's war heroes are being lured by false promises to join the armed forces in the Russia-Ukrain conflict.

"These promises include offers of land in Saint Petersburg, Russian citizenship for their families and monthly salaries exceeding Rs.1 million. However, these promises remain unfulfilled, with no compensation provided for deceased war heroes and their families.

General Gunaratne clarified that these soldiers were not legally recruited but rather coerced into serving as mercenaries. He urged war heroes to avoid falling prey to these human smugglers.
