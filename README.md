### ‘Kala Wewa Back to the Elephants’ project a success

*2025-09-08 04:47:33* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Kala-Wewa-Back-to-the-Elephants-project-a-success/56-781366) · `en`

The President’s Media Division (PMD) yesterday said that in parallel with the ‘Clean Sri Lanka’ initiative, the ‘Kala Wewa Back to the Elephants’ project was successfully carried out over three days in the floodplains surrounding the Kala Wewa National Park.

Due to the spread of invasive plant species, including Japan Jabara, across several tank beds in the North Central Province, the tender grass that usually grows in these areas and serves as vital food for elephants, has been destroyed. These grass varieties are rich in protein and highly favoured by wild elephants. It is estimated that around 400 elephants inhabit the vicinity of Kala Wewa, the PMD said in a statement.

A lack of adequate food has driven elephants into nearby villages, intensifying human-elephant conflicts. In recent months, several people have died as a result of elephant attacks. The area is also heavily cultivated with paddy, as well as soya, maize, fruits, and vegetables.

### Japan’s PM Shigeru Ishiba resigns after election drubbing

*2025-09-08 04:43:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Japan-s-PM-Shigeru-Ishiba-resigns-after-election-drubbing/56-781363) · `en`

Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba yesterday announced he was stepping down after less than a year in the role, following two major election losses, the BBC reported.

The move comes a day before his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was expected to vote on whether to hold an internal leadership vote that could have forced him out.

The LDP has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades, but under Ishiba, it lost its majority in the lower house for the first time in 15 years and then lost its majority in the upper house in July.

Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy and a key US ally, now faces a period of political uncertainty as tensions rise with China and regional insecurity mounts.

“Now that a conclusion has been reached in the negotiations concerning the US tariff measures, I believe this is precisely the appropriate time,” Ishiba said, referring to a deal signed last week to ease tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese cars and other exports.

For Sri Lanka to prosper, he said that the latter should be defeated. What he presented 13 years ago is valid for Sri Lanka even today.

### EY Sri Lanka sets out guidelines  for SVAT phaseout

*2025-09-08 02:37:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/EY-Sri-Lanka-sets-out-guidelines-for-SVAT-phaseout/34-781330) · `en`

With the Government abolishing Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) from 1 October 2025, EY Sri Lanka has issued guidelines on how businesses can manage the transition and comply with strict timelines.

The firm has outlined the forms, deadlines, and reporting requirements that Registered Identified Suppliers (RIS) and Registered Identified Purchasers (RIP) must follow to complete the transition.

Sri Lankan businesses face a significant change in their tax compliance obligations with the withdrawal of the SVAT system from 1 October. The end of the SVAT will remove the upfront VAT suspension mechanism that exporters and other registered parties relied on to manage cash flow.

All supplies and purchases after 30 September will be subject to the standard VAT system, requiring companies to manage refunds through the regular process. EY Sri Lanka has issued detailed guidance for RISs and RIPs, stressing that strict adherence to deadlines is needed to avoid compliance risks.

### Is India a ‘tariff king’? Not really

*2025-09-08 01:58:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Is-India-a-tariff-king-Not-really/4-781320) · `en`

Indian PM Narendra Modi (left) and US President Donald Trump

It goes without saying that the tariff war initiated by the US is in violation of its commitments under the WTO agreements. But then, the WTO itself has been moribund for a while. It is also worth noting that tariffs cannot be the same for all countries. It is a truism that low-income developing countries will have higher tariffs (for reasons mentioned above) compared to G7 countries

There is a widespread but fallacious perception that India’s tariffs are inordinately high. There are subjective factors when it comes to a country like liveability, public courtesy, or even how foreigners are welcomed. But tariffs are quantifiable and there should really be no place for subjectivity. So, let us consider the facts in the case.

I was delighted to be there when the book titled “Essentials of Modern Marketing” was launched recently. The key role played by Denzil Indrajith Perera, one of my MBA “learning partners”, in this regard, was indeed commendable. As a “non-marketer”, I enjoyed reading it and as a case-writer I saw the richness in it. Today’s column is an exploration of such essentials.

The “‘Essentials of Modern Marketing (EOMM)” is a flagship marketing series by the “Knight of Marketing”, Prof. Philip Kotler. The Sri Lankan edition of it was officially launched in cooperation with Kotler Impact Inc. and Deyo Consultancy and Advisory, recently. As one solid step in Kotler’s series of country specific editions, 22 Sri Lankan cases have been included in this valued volume. According to Denzil who represents Kotler Impact in Sri Lanka and Maldives, this is a sure showcasing of 22 local brands in the global arena with needed recognition.

### Taxes for life: Shaping our collective future through education

*2025-09-08 01:41:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Taxes-for-life-Shaping-our-collective-future-through-education/4-781317) · `en`

The solution is clear, simple, and revolutionary: integrate age-appropriate tax education into our school curricula

magine they would still ring so true centuries later. At first glance, the line may seem like a clever remark. But it holds a deeper truth: taxes much like death are a universal part of life. Inevitable, often misunderstood, and sometimes dreaded, taxes quietly power the engines of society. They fund the roads we drive on, the hospitals we depend on, the schools that shape our future, and the safety nets that protect the most vulnerable.

### Spare a thought for the coloniser

Ahmed Abu Amsha and the children’s music group Gaza Birds Singing – Reuters

I wonder: what inhuman power compels one to walk, or crawl, or locomote in any way whatsoever, towards gunfire so that another life may not end while they live? Surely, this must be the animalistic behaviour Barrack is referring to, through which the bravery of “the region” still shines forth

“Do you think this is fun for us,” asked Tom Barrack, the US special envoy for Syria, addressing a group of Lebanese journalists after a meeting with President Joseph Aoun in Beirut on 26 August. Speaking what appears to be the only language he knows—that of finance—and referring to his deputy Morgan Ortagus, he further added, “Do you think this is economically beneficial for Morgan and I to be here putting up with this insanity?”

### Dayan Jayatilleka: The strategist Sri Lanka discarded

*2025-09-08 01:27:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Dayan-Jayatilleka-The-strategist-Sri-Lanka-discarded/4-781314) · `en`

Dayan Jayatilleka today remains one of Sri Lanka’s sharpest political minds

Sri Lanka’s only victory at Geneva was delivered by Dayan Jayatilleka. Six weeks later, he was removed under foreign pressure. Since then, Sri Lanka has never won again. The West tried to choke Sri Lanka with false accusations of war crimes. Dayan stopped them. He showed that sovereignty could be defended with clarity, courage, and coalition. And then he was betrayed

He gave Sri Lanka its only victory at Geneva. Six weeks later he was thrown aside. A nation that trashes its finest minds does not deserve victory — and that is why we keep losing.

For decades, Sri Lanka has stumbled through Geneva, battered by hostile resolutions and accusations of war crimes. The UN Human Rights Council became a courtroom, and Sri Lanka its permanent defendant.

The fact that the facts of the atrocities committed by the fellow man against humanity in Sri Lanka have been revealed and waiting for justice to be established, and the land and long -awaitedness of the atrocities have begun to dissolve today without the pain of waiting.. The human wreath, which is now being said to be landlord, has begun to shake the conscience of the world.

The story of the famous sheep land begins with the assassination of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy. Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, who wrote the GCE Advanced Level Examination at the Chundukkuli Ladies' College, Jaffna on September 7, 1996, and his mother Rajamma Kumaraswamy, the younger brother Kumaraswamy Pranavan and the neighbor Chidambaram Kripamoorthy were killed by the army.

### Kapruka’s platform pivot powers 94% operating profit surge

*2025-09-07 22:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/kaprukas-platform-pivot-powers-94-operating-profit-surge/) · `en`

Kapruka Holdings PLC is reaping the rewards of a strategic shift from traditional e-commerce to a capital-light platform model. The company reported a striking 94% year-on-year improvement in operating performance for its latest quarter, driven by the accelerating momentum of its Kapruka Partner Central initiative.

This platform transformation is moving Kapruka beyond an inventory-led retailer to an ecosystem orchestrator. By onboarding major Sri Lankan brands onto a shared infrastructure of tools, logistics, and service agreements, Kapruka has expanded its product selection without the proportional working-capital demands. This strategy enhanced unit economics, contributing to a 14% rise in revenue to LKR 448.52 million and a 30% jump in gross profit.
