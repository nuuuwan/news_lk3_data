Sri Lanka urged caution over Adani Group plans amid US lawsuit allegations. Experts warn of potential corruption risks, citing past scandals like Airbus fraud and Pandora Papers revelations. Social media calls for investigation into Adani's projects, aligning with anti-corruption promises made by newly elected officials.

ЁЯЯй

Experts have said that Sri Lanka should be cautious about the strength of power.

The US has issued a lawsuit against seven people, including Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani.

"We have seen the details of the corruption in Sri Lanka," said Nissan de Mel, the Colombo -based Veritte Research, said.

He pointed out that a few years ago, he was accused of fraudulent scams at the Airbus purchase for SriLankan Airlines from Airbus.

Pointing out the release of local politicians and traders on Pandora Paper, he said that Sri Lanka should double his actions against corruption to ensure that we are protected from the Nissan Demel scam.

Many people have commented on social media that the Anura Kumaratisanayake government should conduct a serious investigation into the Adani Group's strength plans in Sri Lanka after the release of the Adani Group's bribery scandal.

They pointed out that Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who won the presidential election in September, also promised to eradicate corruption.

Even a cursory glance at the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2024 will amply demonstrate that the earth has well and truly moved under our feet

### Sri LankaтАЩs SMEs: Debt-trapped dilemma

A substantial portion of Sri Lankan SMEs, approximately 70%, are currently insolvent or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy

A cornerstone of successful debt recovery lies in preserving the businessтАЩs operational viability rather than resorting to liquidation. Many debt restructuring solutions fall short by neglecting the critical aspect of cash flow matching, which is fundamental to servicing debt obligations. By strategically realigning assets based on their utilisation, it is possible to strike a balance between debt recovery and cash generation, fostering a more sustainable recovery process

The path to prosperity of Sri Lanka starts from political stability to enable it to attract mainly FDI as it lacks the capital, skills, technologies and the required international market access to start an export-led strategy of economic development to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty. In this strategy it is important to emphasise on promoting especially the productivity (of the private sector, (which has been described as the тАШthe engine of growthтАЩ) apart from upgrading the macroeconomic stability of the country and the international market access

The president does not clearly mention his policy declaration on foreign policy. So this is a bit of a matter of observation. He said the government should reveal what kind of foreign policy it is.

The 2024 Sri Lankan Parliamentary election concluded last week, in which the ruling National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) gained a record majority and made headway into the Tamil homeland. There were notable casualties for senior Tamil nationalist politicians and for the first time ever a southern political party managed to gain a majority in all but one district in the north-east. Commentators have since speculated whether the result spells the beginning of the end for Tamil nationalist politics.

Instead, the figures highlight a range of factors, including the fall of other southern Opposition political parties, leftist coalitions and paramilitary groups that allowed the NPP to siphon votes and grow their base amongst those who had already previously voted for pro-state forces.

Today is a special day in our Parliament. The authority was handed over to both groups. Our side has empowered the last presidential election. It is important in the history of Sri Lanka.Most MPs have been selected in our country's electoral system. All the provinces and people have contributed to it as the North and East.

Political parties have been formed on the basis of provinces, nationalism and religions for so long. So the separation, doubt and racism were strengthened between people. When racism is strengthened on one side, racism will be strengthened against it. Racism will not be in the same place. We have seen the history of it in our country, politics and society. But we thank all the people who believe in us.

There are people who believe in other parties without trusting us. That is democracy. It is not democratic to create people's activities surrounding a single party.
