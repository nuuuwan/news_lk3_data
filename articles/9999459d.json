    "That rampant disorder is the starkest of global realities currently is a fact beyond dispute. While the international community is confronted with the grueling challenge of stemming such runaway disorder, an equally exacting undertaking for the world is the need to keep up its spirits in this uphill task of bringing order out of chaos.",
    "However, before getting down to any major \u2018damage control\u2019 initiatives or \u2018saving acts\u2019 in relation to the contemporary world, governments and publics would need to gain increasing clarity on the present pervasive issues in global politics. That is, educating and enlightening these sections emerge as principal needs and it is up to universities, higher educational institutions, research organizations, progressive think tanks and the like to take on these challenges.",
    "Of the tertiary level educational institutions in Sri Lanka that have boldly and resourcefully taken on such tasks, the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS), Colombo, has been among the foremost. On May 14, 2024, the BCIS once again proved its capabilities in this regard when it held a largely attended and lively forum titled, \u2018Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace\u2019.",
    "Under BCIS Chairperson, former President Ms. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and its Executive Director, Professor Emeritus Gamini Keerawella, the path-breaking nature of such BCIS initiatives has been increasingly in evidence in recent times. Panelists at the forum were, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Hideaki Mizukoshi and Resident Coordinator of the United Nations, Sri Lanka, Marc-Andre Franche. The forum was moderated by Member/Council of Management of the BCIS, Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy.",
    "Admitting that it is \u2018difficult not to feel cynical today\u2019 in the face of the world\u2019s rising disorder and insecurity, Amb. Franche pointed out that multilateral institutions have not taken on current challenges effectively. For example, the UN Security Council\u2019s dysfunctional nature in the face of present day global law and order issues has never been greater.",
    "While it is difficult, Amb. Franche explained, to be optimistic currently, the UN has, nevertheless, forged ahead to the best of its ability to maintain world peace. It has prevented nuclear wars and helped in the socio-economic progress of countries to the extent possible. Moreover, the UN has been placing an emphasis on conflict prevention, mediation and the transformation of global peace operations in recent times.",
    "It was Amb. Franche\u2019s submission that the threats facing peace are vastly different today. However, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has stuck to his task of being \u2018the Conscience of the World\u2019. In a historic statement recently Guterres called for a \u2018New Social Contract between states and peoples, based on trust, inclusion and human rights, along with women\u2019s active participation in all social segments.\u2019",
    "Ambassador Mizukoshi, among other things, pointed out that since Japan joined the UN in the mid-fifties, it has been dominant in the area of international cooperation and the socio-economic advancement of peoples.",
    "Cooperating in advancing international peacekeeping and taking up in a major way global humanitarian relief operations, Japan has been prominent in even assisting Sri Lanka on a number of fronts. For example, in the early 2000s, Japan played a major role in conflict resolution and peace-building in Sri Lanka. Currently, it is in the forefront of Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring effort as a principal facilitator.",
    "Japan, it was pointed out, is for peace and stability in the Asia-pacific region. It also actively supports peace diplomacy since international peace is high among its priorities.",
    "The BCIS forum threw-up many a thought-provoking issue in current world politics for Sri Lanka and the world. It was a stimulant to fresh thinking on how the world community could forge ahead with meeting the challenge of fostering conflict-resolution and peace. This task is of the utmost importance because many are the observers who are likely to succumb to a mood of despair on seeing the increasingly aggravating lawlessness the world over.",
    "However, it is important to point out that all peace hopes are not lost. It is particularly important that the UN Secretary General and his vast team ensure that the spirit of peace and reconciliation remains alive in them.",
    "Although it is true that the UN system could be found to be inept in the Ukrainian and Gaza theatres in particular, the UN would do well to perceive that it still retains the initiative on the peace-building front. Its options continue to be ample and now is the time for the system to redouble its efforts to exploit them patiently and discreetly.",
    "The unique strength of the UN is its ability to plod along with providing material and emotional assistance to the needy of the world on a non-discriminatory basis. These efforts have not and are unlikely to produce positive results in the near future but by being constantly there for the deprived the UN could inspire the needy with the hope that all is not lost for them in terms of bettering their lot eventually and blossoming into relatively stable persons and communities.",
    "With time, such wholesomeness and stability could lay the basis for enlightened, democratic thinking among the social segments concerned. But the world would need to wait with immense patience until these welfare efforts of the UN bear fruit. There are no short cuts to bringing into being wholesome, democratically-inclined individuals and communities.",
    "Besides providing nutritious food to the poor, the UN needs to work untiringly towards meeting the educational needs of the deprived. The long-term consequence of such efforts is the coming into being of democracy-conscious persons and communities. Thus, UN personnel cannot afford to give in to a mood of despair.",
    "But there is no underestimating or denying the heartburn of those sections that want to see an improvement in the present lawlessness. A primary cause for such disenchantment is the irresponsible, reckless conduct of the foremost powers. Their agony is compounded by the fact these powers are permanent members of the UN Security Council.",
    "There is the case of the US, for instance, which touts itself as the \u2018World\u2019s mightiest democracy\u2019. However, it has done precious little to bring the Israeli state to the negotiating table over the issues in the Gaza. But on this question too all is not lost. Recently, apparently in reaction to increasing protests at home, the Biden administration had delayed some arms shipments to Israel.",
    "Apparently, protests by democratic forces could make a dent in the conduct of governments that are committed to supporting repressive states. Much more needs to be done by the US, of course, to enable a negotiated settlement to solidify itself in the Middle East, but we have some proof in the US decision that democracy-inclined societies provide the best hopes for the world\u2019s betterment. Thus, is the UN vindicated by plodding on with the task of fostering the wellbeing of the deprived the world over. Such efforts provide the fundamental basis for highly literate and democratic societies.",
