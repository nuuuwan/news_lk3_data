  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its support for the recently announced ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon.",
    "In an official statement, the Ministry emphasized its optimism, stating, \u201cWe remain hopeful that the ceasefire will pave the way for enduring peace and stability in Lebanon and in the region.\u201d",
    "The ceasefire announced Tuesday (26) is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.",
    "There were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce, and there were signs of celebration in Beirut. But Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the agreement.",
    "The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance.",
    "An Israeli military spokesman, in an Arabic-language X post in the first half-hour of the ceasefire, warned evacuated residents of southern Lebanon to not head home yet, saying the military remained deployed there.",
    "The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war. At least 42 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities.",
    "The ceasefire does not address the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable.",
    "Lebanon\u2019s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the ceasefire and described it as a crucial step toward stability and the return of displaced people.",
    "Hezbollah has said it accepts the proposal, but a senior official with the group said Tuesday it had not seen the agreement in its final form.",
    "\u201cAfter reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,\u201d Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah\u2019s political council, told the Al Jazeera news network.",
    "\u201cWe want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state,\u201d he said, referring to Israel\u2019s demand for freedom of action. \u201cAny violation of sovereignty is refused.\u201d",
    "Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.",
    "Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have exchanged barrages ever since."
