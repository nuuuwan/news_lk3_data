  "original_body_lines": [
    "A coalition of Opposition party leaders yesterday held a press briefing in Colombo to denounce the arrest of ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "Gathering under the banner \u201cLet\u2019s Defeat the Constitutional Dictatorship,\u201d the speakers accused the administration of weaponising the legal system against political rivals. Party leaders argued that Wickremesinghe\u2019s detention was part of a wider attempt to erode democratic institutions and suppress dissent.",
    "Ex-President Maithripala Sirisena said he was disappointed and distressed by the arrest and called on all political parties and civil society organisations to condemn the arrest and defend democracy. Former MP Patali Champika Ranawaka speaking at the press conference said the arrest of Wickremesinghe was the Government\u2019s attempt to squash dissent towards establishing a single-party State.",
    "Separately, Sri Lanka\u2019s main Opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), denounced the arrest of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, calling it a politically motivated move aimed at silencing dissent.",
    "In a statement yesterday, the SJB said the arrest, first publicised through what it claims is a pro-Government social media account, undermined the rule of law and revealed what it described as an effort by the administration to establish a one-party State.",
    "The party also criticised Government programs, including the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 initiative, regional and district committees, and limits on Local Government funding, saying these measures weaken multi-party democracy. It added that attempts to control public service unions reflected a dictatorial approach.",
    "The SJB urged all political groups and civil society organisations to rally together against what it termed anti-democratic practices, warning that collective resistance was needed to prevent the emergence of one-party rule in Sri Lanka.",
    "Meanwhile, ex-President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a statement yesterday opposed last Friday\u2019s arrest and detention of fellow ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is in remand custody until 26 August.",
    "She noted that the timing of Wickremesinghe\u2019s arrest, coming when investigations are close to completion, raises serious questions about the resilience of democratic institutions in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWhat we are witnessing is a calculated onslaught on the very essence of our democratic values. The consequences of this go far beyond the fate of an individual or any political grouping and involve peril for the rights of our society as a whole,\u201d the statement said.",
    "Kumaratunga further declared that she \u201cwholeheartedly joins in expressing her unreserved opposition to these initiatives,\u201d adding that all political leaders have a responsibility to oppose them.",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday accused the Government of using political revenge to conceal its failures and attempting to dismantle State institutions.",
    "Speaking to the media, Rajapaksa said the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was now trying to achieve within Government what it had failed to do during the violence of 1988-89, thereby weakening the State under a democratic framework.",
    "He said the SLPP had repeatedly raised concerns about political victimisation and alleged that the administration was once again demonstrating incompetence.",
    "\u201cThe worst instances of political revenge in this country were suffered by former Presidents Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tried to prevent such actions at every opportunity, but the Government continues to pursue them instead of addressing the real issues facing the people.\u201d",
    "Rajapaksa added that his party opposed any dismantling of State structures, whether inside or outside the democratic process. \u201cThe Government must stop this revenge. Instead of taking revenge, it should fulfil the promises made to the people. When the promises cannot be fulfilled, the Government takes revenge,\u201d he said.",
    "Among the attendees were the Freedom People\u2019s Congress\u2019 Prof. G.L. Peiris, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem, Sri Lanka Freedom Party\u2019s Dayasiri Jayasekara, Democratic People\u2019s Front/Tamil Progressive Alliance Leader Mano Ganesan, United National Party Assistant Leader Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, and United People\u2019s Party\u2019s Tiran Alles.",
    "There was opposition to the arrest from across the Palk Strait as well.",
    "Indian Congress MP Shashi Tharoor took to \u2018X\u2019 and said: Concerned about the detention of former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on what, on the face of it, seem trivial charges. His health issues have already seen him taken to the prison hospital. I call on the government of Sri Lanka, while fully respecting that this is their internal matter, to abjure the politics of vengeance and treat their former President with the respect and dignity that he deserves, after his decades of service to the nation.\u201d",
    "Norwagian diplomat and former politician Erik Solheim also took to X in support of Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cPlease urgently release Ranil Wickremesinghe! I join the many leaders in Sri Lanka, South Asia and around the world calling for the immediate release of Sri Lanka\u2019s former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. We are all concerned for his health during detention.\u201d",
    "Solheim, a prominent figure in the peace negotiations between the Sri Lankan Government and the rebel LTTE in the 2000s, said that Ranil was the leader who stood up to save Sri Lanka when the nation reached rock bottom of economic and political disaster in 2022.",
    "\u201cThe accusations against Ranil are without merit. Even if they were true, they will not constitute any criminal or even unacceptable behaviour in Europe. I give full support to the Sri Lankan Governments campaign against corruption, but please focus on real issues!\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe, who is in remand custody on charges of misusing State funds, was transferred from the prison hospital to Colombo\u2019s National Hospital.",
    "He was first admitted to a paying ward but later shifted to the Emergency Treatment Unit after doctors reported elevated blood pressure and the need for closer observation. Medical staff were considering moving him to the ICU if necessary.",
    "This marks the first time a former President of Sri Lanka has been taken into custody and remanded. Pressure is mounting on the Government to carry out its mandate to eradicate corruption and clean up politics in Sri Lanka, and begin investigations and legal proceedings against several high-profile politicians who remain untouched."
