    "The King and Queen of Spain have been pelted with mud and other objects by angry protesters during a visit to flood-hit Valencia.",
    "Shouts of \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201cshame\u201d were directed at the royal couple, Spain\u2019s prime minister and other leaders as they walked through the town of Paiporta - one of the worst-affected in the region.",
    "With mud on their faces and clothes, King Felipe and Queen Letizia were later seen consoling members of the crowd.",
    "More than 200 people were killed in the floods, the worst in Spain for decades. Emergency workers are continuing to comb through underground car parks and tunnels in the hope of finding survivors and recovering bodies.",
    "There has been anger at a perceived lack of warning and insufficient support from authorities after the floods.",
    "Footage showed the king making his way down a pedestrian street, before his bodyguards and police were suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of protesters, hurling insults and screaming.",
    "They struggled to maintain a protective ring around the monarch, as some of the protesters threw mud and objects.",
    "Images showed mud on the faces and clothes of the king, queen and their entourage, who held umbrellas over the monarch as they departed.",
    "Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and the head of Valencian regional government, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, joined the royal couple on the visit, but were swiftly evacuated as the crowd grew increasingly hostile.",
    "Spanish media reports that objects were hurled at S\u00e1nchez, while footage verified by the BBC appears to show stones being thrown at his car as he was driven away.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m just 16,\u201d one boy, Pau, told the BBC through tears. \u201cWe\u2019re helping \u2013 and the leaders do nothing. People are still dying. I can\u2019t stand this anymore.\u201d",
    "Another woman said: \u201cThey left us to die. We\u2019ve lost everything: our businesses, our homes, our dreams.\u201d",
    "The civil guard and mounted officers were later seen attempting to disperse the angry crowd.",
    "The royal entourage had intended to travel on to Chiva, another town in the Valencia province badly impacted by the flooding, but that visit has since been postponed.",
    "The king later said he understood the \u201canger and frustration\u201d of the protestors in a video posted on the royal household\u2019s Instagram account.",
    "The mayor of Paiporta, Maribel Albalat, told the BBC she was shocked by the violence, but that she understood \u201cthe frustration and desperation of the people\u201d.",
    "Juan Bordera, a member of the Valencian parliament, called the king\u2019s visit \u201ca very bad decision\u201d.",
    "Authorities \u201cdidn\u2019t listen to any warnings,\u201d Mr Bordera told the BBC.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s logical that the people are angry, it\u2019s logical that the people didn\u2019t understand why this visit is so urgent,\u201d he added.",
    "On Saturday, S\u00e1nchez ordered 10,000 more troops, police officers and civil guards to the area.",
    "He said the deployment was Spain\u2019s largest in peacetime. But he added that he was aware the response was \u201cnot enough\u201d and acknowledged \u201csevere problems and shortages\u201d.",
    "The flooding began on Tuesday, following a period of intense rainfall.",
    "Floodwaters quickly caused bridges to collapse and enveloped towns in thick mud.",
    "Many communities were cut off, left without access to water, food, electricity and other basic services.",
    "On Sunday, the death toll from the flooding rose to 217, with many more feared missing.",
    "Almost all of the deaths confirmed so far have been in the Valencia region on the Mediterranean coast.",
    "Some areas have been particularly devastated. Authorities in Paiporta, the town visited today by the royal delegation, have reported at least 62 deaths.",
    "Spain\u2019s meteorological agency AEMET issued its highest level of alert on Sunday for parts of southern Valencia - including the cities of Alzira, Cullera and Gandia.",
    "Intense storms forecast to pass the area will not be on the scale of Tuesday\u2019s, the agency said, with 90mm (3.45 inches) of rainfall expected."
