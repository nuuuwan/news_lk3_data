As India gears up for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, people are divided over whether they should celebrate by setting off firecrackers, which worsen the country‚Äôs chronic air pollution.

Diwali, which will be celebrated Thursday, is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many Indians light earthen oil lamps or candles. But every year the festivities are tinged with worries over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can takes days to clear.

The capital, New Delhi, which is among India‚Äôs worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali. Authorities there and in some other states have banned the use and sale of firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for more sustainable options like environmentally friendly firecrackers and light shows, but the rule is often flouted. Firecrackers can be easily bought from roadside stalls and stores.

### Anurakumara Dissanayake and the creation of the national people's power

*2024-10-31 13:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197579) ¬∑ `ta`

Based on the detailed historical and political analysis provided, here are the key points regarding the JVP and its evolution:



1. The JVP initially pursued revolutionary violence but shifted towards democratic methods after the armed conflicts in 1971 and 1988-90.



2. In the 2015 parliamentary election, the JVP received 543,944 votes (4.8%) and won six seats.



3. The party contested alone in 2015 instead of joining an opposition coalition.



4. In the 2018 local government elections, the JVP received 693,875 votes (6.27%) but failed to capture any councils.



5. The JVP formed the National People's Power alliance in 2019, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.



6. In the 2019 presidential election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake received 418,563 votes (3.15%) as the National People's Power candidate.



7. In the 2020 parliamentary election, the National People's Power received 445,958 votes (3.84%), winning three seats.



8. Despite efforts to increase its vote bank, the JVP has struggled to overcome its status as the third political power in Sri Lanka.



9. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been instrumental in changing the electoral strategy and enriching his political image within the party.



10. The JVP continues to maintain its independence and does not want to form coalitions or alliances with other parties, preferring to lead as an equal partner.



The analysis suggests that while the JVP has made some progress in recent years, it still faces challenges in increasing its vote share and electoral performance compared to the major political parties in Sri Lanka.

üü©

This is the fourth part of my article on Sri Lanka's new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

In the first part, I wrote about his gradual development in the second part of the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the second part and his rise to the JVP leadership in the third part.

The JVP led by Dissanayake in this fourth part. Let me explain how the national people's power was transformed into a party.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is an important day on February 2, 2014. It was on that day that the 17th National Conference of the JVP was held.

The change in the leadership of the party was the best of the conference. Somawansa Amarasinghe, who has been the leader of the JVP for 24 years, took over.

Anura or AKD. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, popularly known, arrived as the new leader of the JVP.

It was generally revealed before the conference that Somawansa is going to retire from the post of Chairman.

He was speaking at a major propaganda meeting of the Democratic Tamil National Alliance (TNA) held at the Anaikkottai Chakkattu area on Wednesday (30).

The JVP has forgotten the decree issued by the JVP's presidential candidate to the people.

Those who said they were going to change have begun to show the old faces of JVP, unable to make the expected change.

The current president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has issued a promise of presidential meetings as a presidential candidate to abolish the Terrorism Act.

Those who claimed that they would be arrested within 24 hours when the Central Bank bailbage of the past mass corruption scandal, did not arrest the bribery corruption.

With the present parliamentary election, they have launched an inquiry into the Sunday attack on the bailout fraud.

The current government has questioned Sri Lanka's foreign policy by ignoring important international conferences. Former parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said this would be a name for the entire country in the middle of the international community.

He further stated at a press conference held at the United People's Alliance office in Colombo on Wednesday (31).

The best foreign policies have been adopted so far in Sri Lanka. But currently there are problems in it. Three major diplomatic international conferences are held within a month of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The government has boycotted the United Nations Human Rights Council Meeting, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the BRICS Conference.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt crisis is a stark example of the destructive power of predatory lending

The current NPP administration has agreed to implement a new variant of the same corrupt deal which merely reduces the weighted coupon rate of interest of bonds from 8.1% to 6.5% from 2028 onwards reducing total payments by $ 1 billion. The new Government must reject this destructive path and prioritise people‚Äôs interests. It is evident that the Sri Lankan Government‚Äôs actions have been influenced by corrupt interests. The cosy relationship between the Government and international creditors raises serious questions about transparency and accountability. The new administration must break free from this destructive path and prioritise the well-being of the Sri Lankan people

### Irrational behaviour of RW and MR vs. rational behaviour of President AKD

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President RW will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behaviour can be compared with the rational behaviour of President AKD. Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost

Given the parliamentary election on 14 November 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Professor Harini Amarasuriya clash over public servant salary increases. Wickremesinghe denies violating election laws, while Amarasuriya accuses him of making false promises. Both sides question each other's constitutional authority and experience in governance.

üü©

On October 29, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe held in a campaign meeting in Pannala, Professor Harini Amarasuriya is a statement.

He responded that the Prime Minister was based on October 27 on October 27.

Accordingly, an alleged war between the former President and the present Prime Minister insists that there is growing.

Speaking at a public meeting in Padukka, Amarasuriya expressed his views that the salaries of public servants increased by the false promise of "a false promise."

"Now Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to increase the salaries of public servants, but the decision of the Cabinet decision at the Cabinet discussion is not approved by the Treasury or the Treasury.. The decision was made, but the decision was taken to make the decision to be implemented, but not done. What does that mean then?Clearly, it is a false promise in the election period, to mislead the people. "

Is the presidential announcement on salaries of public servants violating election laws?

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake greets Hindus on Diwali, emphasizing change and unity. He calls for celebrating the festival as a symbol of hope and progress, urging Sri Lankans to work towards eliminating injustice and promoting cultural diversity.

üü©

In his Diwali greeting, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that we have initiated the era of change of public expectations.

The Diwali festival is celebrated by Hindu devotees in the world to mark the light of darkness.

The Sri Lankan people who have been searching for light from the dark after independence are now carrying new expectations. This is the many years expectation of the people. We have begun the age of change of the expectations of the public who have been paralyzed by the rulers of Sri Lanka for so many days.

There are many reasons for the Diwali celebration. The festival is celebrated to commemorate the return of Ayodhya and destroy Krishna Narakasura after the 14 -year wilderness.

I urge the people to celebrate the Diwali festival this time that the new revolution will lead to the new revolution by carrying torches in the tone of the light of the conscience.

We extend their hands for honor, acceptance and brotherhood, in order to enrich the beauty of cultural diversity.
