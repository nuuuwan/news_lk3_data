    "The price of an egg has spiked again after the recent price drop.",
    "The price of an egg was seen reduced to Rs. 30 in local markets recently, however, it was reported that an egg is being sold at prices of over Rs. 40 this week.",
    "Chairman of Sri Lanka Livestock Producers Association Ajith Gunasekara stated that several factors have impacted the relevant price hike.",
    "\u201cA large number of wholesalers have sold the eggs at lower price. It brought great relief to the customers. By now, the surplus products have left the market. Only the daily eggs that are currently produced come to the market. But there has been a huge price fluctuation. We have a question whether it happens artificially.\u201d"
