In particular, the result will empower the disempowered and marginalised people from lower socio-economic classes and those from rural and urban fringes who have been misled by previous rulers either by offering temporary inducements while enjoying the aura of power or spreading fear about the different other-generally ethnic minorities- and expensive media campaigns.

“The National People’s Force has achieved significant achievements in the North and Eastern regions so that the President can become a leader who can unite various communities in Sri Lanka.

### What is the meaning of NPP’s Parliamentary victory?

*2024-11-15 22:59:03* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-is-the-meaning-of-NPP-s-Parliamentary-victory/4-769309) · `en`

Will Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the top leadership grasp the true significance of their achievement?

Considering the recent past alone, the Parliamentary results clearly build on a process of politicisation that was catalysed by the crisis and the Aragalaya. People are talking everywhere, and they are enthusiastic despite the enduring pressures of crisis and austerity on their households. But we need to remind ourselves that this moment represents a movement with a long genealogy, and not only a charismatic individual. It is now up to a wide set of progressive forces extending beyond the immediate NPP coalition to capitalise on the energy of the electoral victory and channel it in the appropriate direction

### General Election 2024: Opportunity to work towards common purpose

For the first time since the enactment of the 1978 Constitution and the advent of the system of proportional representation, the Sri Lankan people have united to confer a two-third majority of its legislative power to a single party, Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s National People’s Power. It also marks the first time that Sri Lankans of all ethnicities across the country all spoke with a single voice, and placed their faith in a single leader.

In one fell swoop, Sri Lanka made clear that it has had enough of race baiting, nepotism, class warfare, corruption, cronyism, political vendettas and rank incompetence.

They saw in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake a leader who they could trust, who sincerely cared for them, who would work hard for them, has no interest in political theatrics and amassing power for himself.

The people could be no clearer – their patience for drama and pettiness has clearly run out.

AKD, your leadership has the potential to bring about a new dawn for Sri Lanka

The people of Sri Lanka have spoken! The time for systemic change has arrived and people have entrusted the new Government with the monumental task, demanding a Government that is no longer willing to accept business as usual—they are calling for a Government that prioritises the public interest, promotes social justice, and ensures that the benefits of development reach every corner of society.

The mandate is clear: Sri Lankans want to see a Government that works for them, not against them —a Government that acts in the national interest and upholds the rights and dignity of every citizen. A truly systemic change to fulfil the promise of a “Change and Corruption-Free” Sri Lanka.

To meet these demands, it must remain fearless, bold, and uncompromising in its pursuit of reform.

### Dismantle 76-year charade: Rename and celebrate Independence Day as Memorial Day from 2025 onwards

The illusion of civility and humanity in celebrating independence faded as local elites implemented the colonial project of nation-building on the island, primarily through distorting religion, history, archaeology, and national symbols. This approach solidified racist communalism as a means to deny and suppress demands for equal rights and freedom for all. Beneath this façade lies a subtler exclusion: the romanticisation of the nation as ‘mother’ or ‘motherland,’ idealising gendered traits like care, sacrifice, nurturance, and emotional support
