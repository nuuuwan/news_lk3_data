    "(This article was written in May 2022 to commemorate the birth centenary of  Firebrand Trade Union Leader Bala Tampoe.It is re-posted without any changes here  to denote his 11th death anniversary on September 1st 2025)",
    "The \u201cPolitical Pulse\u201dcolumn focuses  this week on a man who was perhaps the last of the great trade unionists. A legend in his lifetime who was at the helm of a vibrant trade union   continuously for a   period of sixty six years \u2013 an unsurpassed record! I am of course referring to comrade Bala Tampoe  who was the Ceylon Mercantile Union (CMU)  General Secretary from 1948 to 2014. Though called the CMU still, the amended name of the union is now The Ceylon Mercantile, Industrial and General Workers Union. The  trade union firebrand  is  no more with us having passed away in September   2014. Bala Tampoe\u2019s  birth centenary  was on May 23rd.",
    "Bala Tampoe was a colourful personality of multiple dimensions. Underground member of the Lanka Sama Samaaja Party (LSSP), during the second World War days; Agricultural Dept. lecturer who lost his job due to involvement in a general strike; leader of the same trade union for more than six decades; fiery orator known for defiant speeches; witness of the Independence ceremony of Ceylon when the Union Jack was replaced; key organizer of the historic 1953 \u2018Hartal\u2019; one time Central Committee and Politbureau member of the largest Trotskyite party recognized by the fourth international; architect of many strikes, including one which paralyzed the Colombo harbour causing declaration of emergency; one of the trouble-making leftists earmarked for incarceration at the Naval armoury by the 1962 coup d\u2019etat planners; pioneer of a collective agreement that proved to be a model for many such agreements; trade union leader who ushered in the payment of allowance scheme based on the rise in the cost of living index; man behind a series of strikes leading to progressive measures regarding termination of employment; co-leader of revolutionary breakaway group in LSSP that formed its own party; unsuccessful candidate in three parliamentary polls; lawyer who defended JVP comrades free-of-charge after the 1971 insurgency; dedicated trade unionist who drove to office and back for six days of work, even at the age of 92. These are, but a few facets of comrade Bala Tampoe.",
    "Being General Secretary of the CMU for 66 years since 1948, has been a marvellous achievement. All the more so because of comrade Bala\u2019s ethnicity in Sri Lanka\u2019s deeply divided society. Philips Balendra Tampoe was of Jaffna Tamil origin. The membership of the CMU though multi-ethnic is predominantly Sinhala. This fact has been highlighted often by many observers of Sri Lanka\u2019s political scene. It is however noteworthy that Bala had never  ever projected himself as an Ethnic Tamil or engaged in communal politics.",
    "Bala was born in Negombo on May 23, 1922 Both his parents were of Jaffna Tamil stock. His father, Francis Tampoe-Philips was an excise officer under British rule who served in various parts of what was then known as the Madras Presidency in India.Bala\u2019s mother Beatrice Thangamma Saverimuttu, though hailing from Jaffna, was born in Kurunegala. Her father was Mudaliyar A.G. Saverimuttu who had been the Chief Post Master at the General Post Office in Colombo for many years. The rank of Mudaliyar had been conferred on him by the British rulers in recognition of his distinguished service to the crown.",
    "Trotskyite Bala was born and baptized as a Christian. His given name then was Balendra Tampoe-Philips. Due to compelling circumstances during school days, his mother registered his name as Philips Balendra Tampoe when admitting him to Royal College in 1934. Ten years later, after graduating Bala was appointed as a lecturer in Botany and Horticulture at the Peradeniya School of Agriculture in February 1944. It was then that he legally changed his name to Philips Balendra Tampoe and placed advertisements to that effect in newspapers. He became known thereafter in a general sense as Bala (derived from Balendra) Tampoe or PB Tampoe.",
    "Though an active trade unionist , Bala Tampoe did dabble in electoral politics for some years. However his foray into Parliamentary politics did not meet with much  success. Bala Tampoe  first contested   Parliamentary elections in 1960.He was fielded by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) under the key symbol   in the multi-member constituency of Colombo Central returning three MP\u2019s. March 1960 polls were held at a time  when the LSSP was expected to romp home as winners with  Dr. N.M. Perera becoming Prime Minister. Bala was  expected to come first  in Colombo Central. Yet, it was Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel and Ranasinghe Premadasa of the UNP, along with the Communist party\u2019s Pieter Keuneman who won. Bala Tampoe came fourth out of fifteen candidates polling 22,228 votes.",
    "In the  July 1960  elections, the number of candidates had dwindled to six. For some reason, the expectation again was that Bala Tampoe would be elected as first MP. But again that was not to be. Sir. Razeek Fareed from the SLFP came first with Pieter Keuneman and Dr. Kaleel coming second and third respectively. Bala Tampoe came fifth, behind Ranasinghe Premadasa. His vote tally had shrunk to 16,406.",
    "The LSSP underwent a crisis  in 1964 when the party leadership opted to form a coalition govt. with the SLFP, led by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. 14 members of the then LSSP Central Committee dissented. These included Bulathsinhala MP Edmund Samarakkody, Moratuwa MP Meryl Fernando, Theoretician V. Karalasingham and Bala Tampoe. The dissident group formed the LSSP-R or LSSP-Revolutionary party minus the Karlo group of Karalasingham that rejoined the parent body. The mainstream LSSP was expelled from the fourth international and the LSSP-R was recognized in its place as the Ceylon section of the fourth international.",
    "The LSSP-R contested the 1965 parliamentary elections but did not fare well. Bala Tampoe contested in Colombo Central again but this time under the lamp and not key symbol. He came fifth out of ten candidates polling only 4,559 votes.",
    "The LSSP-R  experienced  further fragmentation when Edmund Samarakkody left the LSSP-R after engaging in a vitriolic campaign against Bala Tampoe. The Edmund faction formed the Revolutionary Samasamajist Party. Later on it became the Revolutionary Workers party.",
    "The LSSP-R continued to be under the sway of Bala Tampoe. The CMU was its mainstay. The LSSP-R did not contest the 1970 General elections and accused the LSSP and Communist party of \u201cmisleading the masses\u201d. The party too was renamed as the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) and continued to be recognized as the Ceylon/Sri Lanka affiliate of the United Secretariat of the fourth international for several years.",
    "In 1977, Bala Tampoe reversed the earlier position of not contesting parliamentary polls and fielded a few candidates at the July hustings. Bala Tampoe himself did not contest. The CMU and RMP together put forward four candidates on a \u201crevolutionary socialist platform\u201d calling for \u201cthe overthrow of capitalist rule and the establishment of a Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Government by the masses\u201d.",
    "Upali Cooray and T.N. Perera contested on behalf of the RMP in Dehiwela and Kesbewa, while Vernon Wijesinghe and H.A. Seneviratne were put forward by the CMU in Colombo North and Kelaniya. All four fought the election campaign under the bell symbol. The results were a disaster. The four candidates got 402, 298, 193 and 162 in Dehiwela, Kesbewa, Colombo North and Kelaniya respectively.",
    "The failure of the Parliamentary path, and the personal electoral defeats of Bala Tampoe in 1960 and 1965 were blessings in disguise for trade unionism in general and the CMU in particular.",
    "Though called the CMU still,the amended name of the union is now The Ceylon Mercantile, Industrial and General Workers Union. Bala Tampoe has for many decades been the driving force behind the CMU in the capacity of General Secretary. He became the CMU General Secretary in 1948 and remained so for 66 years till he died.I do not know whether any comparative study was ever made but I do feel that being general secretary of a trade union for 66 years is an unsurpassed world record.",
    "The CMU  at its hey- day had 37,500 members .It was powerful and influential.Bala Tampoe in the sixties of the last century,  organized a series of more than 70 strikes across the country protesting the way employers could summarily dismiss workers. This led to the then Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake meeting with him to discuss ways and means of addressing the issue. Bala Tampoe proposed that the State should step in and examine grounds for removal. Tampoe submitted a legal draft which laid the foundation for the Termination of Employment Act that was enacted in 1971.",
    "The veteran trade unionist  was married twice and hd two children. His  first wife was Nancy Kotalawela from Passara. She was a Montessori teacher.They married  on October 28, 1950. The son Dhiresh was born on December 1, 1951; and daughter Shyama on January 6, 1956. They  separated in 1957, and were divorced in April 1966. Nancy migrated to the United States in September 1967, with the  two children.",
    "Bala Tampoe\u2019s second wife was May Wickramasuriya who was an institution by herself. They were married on September 22, 1966. May worked at the CMU for decades and was well-known in Trade union and Trotskyite circles. She had joined the CMU in 1951 and remained an efficient colleague and loyal companion to Bala Tampoe.",
    "She became assistant secretary of the CMU in 1956. May was paralyzed after suffering a stroke in November 1995. She died a few years later on December 15, 1998. CMU contemporaries speak highly of the fond affection with which Bala cared for her. Bala describes her as his \u201ccompanion and comrade\u201d. There is a conference room named after May at the CMU office\u201d.",
    "Bala Tampoe has been one of those formidable figures who have fascinated me since childhood. I first heard of Bala Tampoe as a six-year-old boy in 1960.There were two parliamentary elections that year in March and July.",
    "We were then living in Hulftsdorp which came under the Colombo Central electorate. PB Tampoe or Bala Tampoe contested Colombo Central in both elections as a Lanka Sama Samaaja Party (LSSP) candidate under the key symbol. It was during the election campaign that I first heard of Bala Tampoe whose name was in wide circulation in the Colombo Central constituency.",
    "My father would take me along for meetings conducted by the LSSP. He had been an ardent supporter of the LSSP from his schooldays. I was regaled during childhood with tales related by him of  events like the \u201cSuriya Mal\u201d movement, the Bracegirdle Affair, the Bogambara Prison escape by LSSP stalwarts in 1942, the 1953 Hartal etc.",
    "Since Bala Tampoe was the LSSP Colombo Central candidate I saw much of him at election meetings. There were posters and leaflets all over the area. Bala Tampoe with his fire and brimstone speeches made an indelible impression on me even though I could not comprehend all that he was saying then.",
    "The larger than life image of Bala Tampoe instilled in me since childhood  kept growing as I too grew up. Many relatives and friends in the private sector were CMU members and the stories they told about Tampoe enhanced his image further in my eyes.",
    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) led insurgency of 1971 captured the imagination of youths in the seventies. Bala Tampoe  aided by a team of dedicated lawyers appeared for many of the accused at the Criminal Justice Commission. He had taken his oaths as an advocate in 1954. Even as I lapped up newspaper reports of the proceedings eagerly, my esteem for Bala Tampoe increased.",
    "I began interacting with  Bala  personally when  I entered journalism through the Tamil daily \u201cVirakesari\u201d in 1977.  This inter-action continued  even after I moved into English journalism via  \u201cThe Island\u201d . When I first joined the newspaper in November 1981 I used to cover the Trade Union and Customs as my regular beat. My first lead story at \u201cThe Island \u201c had some points made by Bala  Tampoe and former CWC General Secretary MS Sellasamy through interviews.",
    "However I was soon put on the Tamil political round at \u201cThe Island\u201d. With the ethnic crisis escalating the \u201cTamil round\u201d assumed crucial importance.I found myself writing many news stories and articles and even a weekly column pertaining to the ethnic problem. The trade union beat was taken off. My interaction with Bala Tampoe gradually ceased. In 1988 I left the shores of Sri Lanka.",
    "The year 2013 was a blessed year for me as I got the opportunity of returning to Sri Lanka after 25 years. After travelling about and visiting relatives and close friends I began meeting \u201cother\u201d people during the latter stages of my stay in Sri Lanka. One such person was Bala Tampoe.",
    "I went to the CMU headquarters in Kollupitiya one morning after a friend had secured an appointment to meet Bala Tampoe. The CMU office that buzzed vibrantly with activity at one time seemed relatively quiet now.",
    "When I walked into the hall and saw Bala from afar, the nonagenarian seemed to look the same despite the withering gaze of age. When I got closer I could see the toll of nine decades. Yet he was quite sprightly in his walk and had a firm handshake as usual. The physical movements were somewhat slower but unimpaired. His hair remained still with a silvery grey hue.",
    "When I sat down to converse I discovered that the fire in the doughty fighter for workers\u2019 rights was still ablaze. He was in full command of his faculties. His mind was razor sharp as usual. The flow of ideas and words gushed forth as in the past. The familiar gritting of teeth frequently occurred. The fiery glint in his eyes was very visible at close quarters. His memory was fantastic.",
    "It was while conversing with Bala that I realised what a treasure trove of information the trade union veteran was. From DS Senanayake to Chandrika Kumaratunga he had seen many rulers \u201ccome and go\u201d but Bala Tampoe like Tennyson\u2019s brook had kept  going \u201con forever\u201d.",
    "Until his demise Bala Tampoe lived alone in Ratmalana. The CMU office is in Kollupitiya. Each day he drove from home to work and work to home. Bala had a vintage Volkswagon which  he drove for decades. He worked six days a week and at times seven, depending upon necessity. His workday was around 7 to 8 hours daily.",
    "I asked Bala Tampoe  in 2013  as to how he managed to lead such a busy, strenuous life at his age. What was the secret of his long life, good health, and youthful energy? He replied pensively-",
    "\u201cI think there are genetic as well as other reasons for my having lived thus far, with the capacity to drive to work and back between my house in Ratmalana and the CMU headquarters in Colpetty, five to six days a week, for a full day\u2019s work. One is that I cannot let go of the needs of the Union and its members. Another is that I have been fairly frugal in my diet, and have never been given to excesses in anything but my activities on behalf of others. I also can\u2019t yet bring myself to think of myself as old, as I remain young at heart and in mind\u201d",
    "I also asked Bala  once to tell me his daily routne.He  responded  in writing as follows-",
    "\u201cI usually wake to the sounds of early birds chirping outside my bedroom window, between 5.15 and 6 a.m. I then make myself a cup of tea, and sit down at my laptop, to check my email and respond thereto straightaway sometimes, or just browse a bit on the internet, before I prepare my breakfast.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt normally consists of cereals, mixed in a little milk with curd, a spoonful of kitul honey and a sliced kolikuttu plantain. I am giving you those details because people sometimes ask me about my daily diet, when questioning me about \u201cmy secret\u201d, as you\u2019ve done\u201d.",
    "\u201cI normally leave for the CMU headquarters by 8.30 a.m., driving my old Volkswagen which I have had re-conditioned recently. The Union spends for its maintenance and costs of petrol for my daily travelling to and from the headquarters. I preferred that to the Union\u2019s purchasing a new car for me, as its General Council had wished. One of my reasons for that preference was that I am too advanced in years to need a car for much longer than I\u2019ve driven the one I have!\u201d",
    "\u201cMy working day now normally ends by 5 p.m. but continues till 8.00 or even 9.00 p.m. on Wednesdays, when the Executive Committee or the Working Committee meet alternately, from week to week.  It takes me about an hour to drive home to Ratmalana\u201d.",
    "\u201cI have a short nap in the afternoons at the headquarters but have found it desirable as age creeps upon me, to have a longer nap when I get home, before warming my dinner (prepared for me at the headquarters) on a microwave oven\u201d.",
    "\u201cAfter dinner, I stretch my legs a bit, walking around the house for about fifteen minutes, before normally settling down to watch a DVD film till 11 p.m. or later, depending on how absorbing it is and how tired I may be at end of the day \u2013 and so it ends!",
    "The end came finally!. Philips Balendra Tampoe  known to all as Bala Tampoe  passed way on September 1st 2014. Comrade Bala Tampoe whose name is indelibly etched in Trade union annals  may be no more , but the legendary leader of the working class   will always be regarded as an incomparable Sri Lankan phenomenon!",
