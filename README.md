### The president who handles another important challenge

*2024-11-02 11:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197697) · `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Sri Lankan government faces challenges in economy, travel advisories, and reconciliation. National People's Power wins local election, increasing support. New government maintains economic committee, gaining IMF confidence. Travel restrictions implemented due to terror threats. Government addresses concerns about foreign tourists' illegal activities. President announces provincial council elections to promote diversity and decentralization. Critics argue high costs, but decentralization crucial for addressing ethnic and regional disparities.

🟩

The government is very intelligent in its actions, if it is a matter of dealing with the economy, travel instructions or reconciliation process.

Experiences its resulting benefit. The victory of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha in the South is a sign that the popular population continues to increase after a month of power.

The increase in the currency expands to the national people's power, not limited to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The difference in the success of the national people's power is much greater than the last time it faced such a local election.

Earlier in 2019, the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha had two seats.

Now it has captured 15 designs. The national people's power, which received only six percent of the vote, now received 48 percent of the votes.

The increase in the victory of the National People's Power in the Local Government election is the result of the polls of voters that they will benefit after the victory of the national People's Power in the presidential election.
