*2025-09-16 05:30:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-bank-foreign-assets-in-reverse-gear-240623/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Net foreign reserves of Sri Lanka’s banking system have started to go on reverse gear after April 2025, official data show, amid rate cuts and a pick-up in private credit, while central bank net reserves are also struggling to grow.

Net foreign assets of the banking system peaked at around 3.3 billion US dollars in April 2025, just before a rate cut, central bank data show, amid a strong pick up in credit.

In May bank NFA fell to 3.15 billion US dollars, in June to 2.96 billion dollars and in July to 2.90 billion dollars.

Bank net foreign assets fell to a negative 6.4 billion US dollars until April 2022 as the central bank used its own reserves and borrowed reserves to finance imports and maturing debt in a bid to keep rates down.

In April 2022 rates were hike steeply, but India gave ACU dollars to the central bank, which the central bank used in sterilized sales (printing money after intervention) which delayed a correction in the system.

The Kalutara District Crimes Division yesterday uncovered a house in Mayurapura, Hambantota, allegedly used by underworld figures ‘Kehelbaddara Padme’ and ‘Kudu Nilanga’ to manufacture the drug ‘Ice.’

Police said the search of the house uncovered 52 litres of chemicals suspected to be used in producing Ice. One room had been set up as a laboratory, containing four white iron cauldrons, six plastic buckets, and other equipment believed to be linked to narcotics production. A vehicle allegedly used to transport the drugs was also seized. Investigations show it is registered to an organised criminal residing overseas and had previously been in police custody before being released.

Earlier this month, sleuths seized about 50,000kg of chemicals at a residence in Thalawa, Middeniya, suspected to be used for Ice production. Tests by the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board confirmed that 17 of 20 samples taken contained substances used to manufacture methamphetamine.

Slams Govt. statement on Israel’s Qatar strikes as apathetic, one-sided, distorted

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader MP Rauff Hakeem yesterday accused the Government of shielding Israel in its foreign policy, saying the Foreign Ministry’s statement on the recent attack on Qatar downplayed Israeli aggression, ignored international law, and risked undermining Sri Lanka’s ties with key Gulf partners.

“At the time of Israel’s recent attack on Qatar, I was in Tehran, Iran, attending the World Islamic Solidarity Conference on Palestine, which was attended by representatives from more than 50 countries.

While returning from there, I came across a statement issued by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs following Israel’s attack on Qatar.

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry has demonstrated once again not just how incapable it is or distinguishing between an occupier and the occupied, or between an air attack and an incident, or even worse, between a mercenary behaviour and solidarity with victims.

The IMF senior mission chief Peter Breuer, presenting the approval of the third review of Sri Lanka’s $ 2.9 b bailout (Source: Al Jazeera)

When the National People’s Power (NPP) Government assumed office in September 2024, it inherited more than a fragile economy and the hopes of a disillusioned citizenry. It also assumed responsibility for steering Sri Lanka through arguably the most significant moment of international recalibration since the end of the Cold War. The global order is shifting once again, with China and Russia presenting themselves as alternatives to Western dominance, and smaller states forced to reposition themselves in ways that are both delicate and strategic.

Signals of a profound reordering of the international system have been apparent for some time. Early indications of this impending shift can be, perhaps, traced to the rise of far-right nationalism and systemic dissatisfaction that emerged in many parts of the world over the past decade.

### Budget 2026 imperative: Making housing affordable through tax reform

By incentivising private homeownership through tax relief, the burden shifts from public provision to empowered individual ownership

Housing is a fundamental human need. Yet, for many Sri Lankans, the dream of owning a home remains elusive due to rising property prices, volatility of interest rates, and limited access to affordable financing. In this context, it is both timely and necessary for the Government of Sri Lanka to reintroduce housing loan interest as a qualifying payment relief under personal income tax—reviving a policy that once existed in the Sri Lankan income tax Law.

### M.H.M. Ashraff PC: Power of  education to transform communities

When history remembers leaders, it often lists their victories, their alliances, or their parliamentary debates. But the truest measure of a leader lies in the legacy that endures long after their voice has fallen silent. On 16 September 2025, the day which marks the 25th anniversary of the passing of M.H.M. Ashraff PC, that is the very question that begs a response.

For Ashraff, his enduring legacy was neither in the party he founded nor the speeches he delivered. Rather, it was in the institutions he envisioned and enabled, the most notable of such achievements being the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka (SEUSL). Education was, for him, more than a policy matter. It was the foundation of empowerment, the key to dignity, and the one tool capable of transforming the lives of entire communities. In establishing the SEUSL at Oluvil, he did not merely create a campus. He opened a doorway for thousands who had, until then, been denied access to opportunity.

China firmly opposes a U.S. demand that Group of Seven (G7) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries impose tariffs of 50 to 100 percent on China due to the country’s purchase of Russian oil, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said Monday.

Such a move seriously violates the consensus reached during a phone call between the two heads of state and could severely impact global trade and disrupt the stability of industrial and supply chains, the spokesperson added.

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has raised its world growth forecasts for the year since the June Global Economic Outlook (GEO) on better-than-expected incoming data for 2Q25, but expects world GDP to slow significantly this year, it said.

“There is now evidence of an underlying US slowdown in ‘hard’ economic data and positive surprises on eurozone growth have partly reflected US tariff front-running,” the ratings agency said.

Global growth is now forecast to be 2.4 percent in 2025, Fitch said.

This is up 0.2pp since June, but is a ‘sizeable’ slowdown from 2.9 percent last year and below trend.

China’s forecast has been raised to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent, the eurozone’s to 1.1 percent from 0.8 percent and the US’s to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent.

“There has been a reduction in uncertainty over US tariff policy after a flurry of announcements.

“Our latest estimate of the average US effective tariff rate (ETR) is 16%, very close to the rate assumed in June.
