    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media Sunday that he wants another judge and another city, as he feels he will not get a fair trial from the judge hearing his case in Washington, D.C.\u00a0related to conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
    "Trump has pleaded not guilty to the four charges. It will be up to Judge Tanya Chutkan to decide, if and when his lawyers file such requests. The next court date is on Tuesday, August 8, 2023. Judge Chutkan has a reputation as a tough judge who has already sentenced many of those convicted over the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol to years in prison, often longer terms than the prosecution has asked for.",
    "\u201cNo way I can get a fair trial, or even close to a fair trial, in Washington, D.C. There are many reasons for this, but just one is that I am calling for a federal takeover of this filthy and crime-ridden embarrassment to our nation,\u201d Trump said in a post on his own social media platform Truth Social.",
    "Trump is also already facing six other cases, civil and criminal, in a number of different states. These include federal criminal charges in a Florida federal district court that he mishandled classified government documents; and state criminal charges in New York of fraud over election campaign funds.",
