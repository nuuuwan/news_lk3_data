Why are these countries scrambling for dollars to pay for essential electricity?

The core question all energy-importing countries face is dependence. Modern societies cannot function without electricity.

President Anura Kumara DissanayakeтАЩs rise to the top bears some resemblance to that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His Indian visit was a triumph for him, and overall, a win for Sri Lanka.

He thanked India fulsomely for its economic support, arrived at convergence on a number of economic initiatives, and tabled some others. Sadly, he couldnтАЩt secure a commitment on the piratical incursions by Indian fishermen. Connectivity of electric grids and building a pipeline are to тАЬcontinue to be consideredтАЭ but Anura didnтАЩt sign-off on these projects which would ensure a dangerous, vulnerable dependence.

Depositors who earn less than 150,000 rupees a month can get a direction from the Department of Inland Revenue to get an exemption, he said.

### 90 Days Of AKDтАЩs Presidency

The first 90 days of the PresidentтАЩs tenure serves as a prelude to the leadership expected over the next five years. While initial steps like limiting expenses and curbing waste were commendable, the government has failed to deliver clear solutions to key issues impacting the people. This period highlights the administrationтАЩs shortcomings, particularly in planning, risk assessment, and crisis management when addressing critical matters.

One of the most pressing failures of President Anura Kumara DissanayakeтАЩs government is the inability to recognise and confront the deep-rooted control of state machinery by Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe loyalists. For the last three decadesтАФsince 1994 under Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Ranil WickremesingheтАФgovernment offices, public institutions, military, police, and the foreign service have been systematically filled with political appointees, loyalists, and close confidantes of these regimes.
