### US billionaire plans submersible trip to Titanic wreck

*2024-05-29 11:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/US-billionaire-plans-submersible-trip-to-Titanic-wreck/107-283599) · `en`

BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

Ohio tycoon and adventurer Larry Connor and Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines, say they want to take a sub to a depth of around 3,800m (12,467ft) to see the shipwreck in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr Connor’s company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer – the “4000” refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.

ECONMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s retail sales are picking up and private credit is expected to follow in the second half of the year if businesses begin investing for expansion, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

Though private credit is positive it is still ‘sluggish’ , the central bank said.

Businesses are trying to de-leverage after a currency crisis, and also re-negotiate old loans with lower interest rates as complaints from the SME sector shows.

De-leveraging is part of a credit cycle that improves the balance sheets of business across the board and leaves them in a stronger position to expand in the future.

To expand however retail sales have to pick up. Capital investments then start as existing capacity or slack runs out and there is more confidence in the future.

“We have seen retail sales picking up in the recent past,” Governor Weerasinghe said. “I think that will push up some of the SME borrowings in the coming months.”

Loans to loss making SOEs beyond 5 percent of equity will require special board approval and risk management sign off.

Any loans against Treasury guarantees will be subject to a ceiling under an upcoming fiscal management law.
