### New chapter for Sri Lanka: We cannot give something out of nothing

*2024-12-02 01:59:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-chapter-for-Sri-Lanka-We-cannot-give-something-out-of-nothing/4-769957) · `en`

The railways, historically designed for goods transport, must be reimagined to meet modern needs economically

The nation spoke and a new Government was elected. Now it’s time to unite and work collectively to pull ourselves out of the economic crisis we face. But in doing this, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. While rooting out corruption is critical, it is not the sole solution to achieving prosperity. To truly transform the country, we must prioritise efficiency and overhaul the sluggish State mechanism, reorganising the way in which it runs.

Let’s take Sri Lanka Railways for example. Each year, the State pumps approximately Rs. 57 billion into the railway system in 2024, while its annual revenue from ticket sales is only a mere Rs. 12 billion. A staggering Rs. 45 billion was lost to the State due to inefficiency.

Amid these transformative efforts, a thought-provoking question emerged on social media recently: Should Sri Lanka retain the traditional eight-hour workday or explore a shorter six-hour workday? This debate touches on broader concerns about labour productivity and its critical role in driving economic growth.

Labour productivity is a fundamental driver of economic progress, directly influencing GDP growth and national prosperity. According to the Solow Growth Model of Economics, long-term economic growth is fuelled by labour growth, capital accumulation, and technological advancements.

When the policy rate of the Central Bank is reduced, the banks immediately cut the deposit rates meaning that they are downward flexible

Since REPO bids should be below OPR and Reverse-REPO bids should be above OPR, they are synonymous with SDFR and SLFR, respectively. Since they should be around OPR, the earlier announced SDFR and SLFR become irrelevant. Also, commercial banks should fix their call rates around OPR. That is how call rates are manipulated by the Central Bank through rules and OPR practices

### Proactive Diplomacy In A Challenging Landscape

*2024-12-01 16:44:37* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/proactive-diplomacy-in-a-challenging-landscape/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s recent political shifts and economic woes have created both challenges and opportunities. As you rightly highlight, the emergence of new leadership is a chance to redefine the country’s global image, rebuild trust among creditors, and solidify international partnerships. Proactive diplomacy should prioritize reassuring stakeholders of Sri Lanka’s commitment to economic stability and sovereignty while maintaining strong ties with traditional allies like China and India.

Despite its size, Sri Lanka’s location in the Indian Ocean makes it a vital player in regional and global geopolitics. The growing interest from major powers—whether through China’s Belt and Road Initiative or India’s regional ambitions, controversial initiatives by the QUAD in the region—underscores the need for Sri Lanka to carefully balance its foreign policy. A strategic and neutral stance that benefits national interests while maintaining independence is crucial.
