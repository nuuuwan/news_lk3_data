    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013\u00a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties must rally behind a leader they can all agree to support at a future presidential election with the next favourite agreeing to be prime minister in a common workable arrangement, a breakaway faction of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said.",
    "Dilan Perera of the Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC), a makeshift party split from the SLPP after the 2022 crisis and now sits in the opposition benches, told reporters that opposition parties must either back a Premadasa-Dissanayake ticket or vice versa or someone else altogether.",
    "All opposition parties, factions and groups must agree on a viable arrangement, according to Perera.",
    "The former minister\u2019s statement is a likely indication that offshoots of the SLPP who have been seen in regular dialogue with the SJB leadership are eager to back opposition leader Sajith Premadasa in the event of a snap presidential poll.",
    "However, Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties have yet to formally announce a common alliance against incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe who is speculated to be keen to hold an early presidential election.",
    "While the SJB, as the main opposition, has declared its readiness for any poll, the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also seen a surge in its popularity since the crisis, though how sustainable that popularity is remains to be seen. An alliance between the SJB and the NPP remains highly unlikely, as the NPP has been increasingly positioning itself as an uncompromising alternative to Sri Lanka\u2019s traditional wielders of political power which the NPP maintains are essentially on the same team.",
    "What with the economy slowly stabilising and inflation on track to dropping to a single-digit level by the fourth quarter of the year despite a rise in poverty and continuing unaffordability of a number of goods and services, reports of a speculated early presidential election indicates that Wickremesinghe is fairly confident of his chances at the polling booth.",
    "Backers of Wickremesinghe have cited what they call a faster-than-anticipated recovery from the crisis, increased availability of goods and services after months of queues, shortages and power cuts, ongoing reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) including the restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as factors that will be in his favour. However, allegations of government overreach, particularly with regard to containing dissent and alleged stifling of free expression, may prove damaging to a future campaign, as will the political cost of some of the more unpopular reforms such as a tax hike in the alleged \u201csale of national assets\u201d, a euphemism for privatisation. Wickremesinghe\u2019s overtures to the Tamil community in resolving the country\u2019s ethnic issue is also likely to be exploited by his opponents.",
    "The president, however, appears confident, having recently claimed, somewhat controversially, that despite a united opposition, none of the parties currently represented in parliament could obtain 50 percent of the vote.",
    "Against this backdrop, and with increased factionalisation in the ruling SLPP \u2013 with some speculated to be resolutely backing Wickremesinghe while others remain loyal to the Rajapaksas \u2013 how opposition parties will align themselves is still unclear. Reports of speculated crossovers from the SJB also persist despite strong denials.",
    "Perera used Adamp\u2019s Peak, the popular Buddhist pilgrimage site in Ratnapura, as a somewhat laboured analogy for the two paths being followed by Premadasa and Dissanayake, with the former taking the shorter route through Hatton while the latter is slowly gaining ground via the longer and more strenuous Ratnapura route.",
    "\u201cThe SJB is taking the Hatton route while the JVP is taking the Ratnapura route. But we must all come together and take the same route in order to worship at the temple,\u201d said Perera.",
    "Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe\u2019s UNP, has accused opposition parties of sabotaging his attempts at reviving the country.\u00a0 UNP general Palitha Range Bandara said speaking at an event recently that his opponents have already resorted to old tactics of weoponising false patriotism.",
    "\u201cPatriots are popping up just as the country starts to become stable and people are able to eat,\u201d said Bandara.",
    "\u201cThese patriots are nowhere to be found when the country is in crisis,\u201d he added.",
    "Bandara claimed that the same forces that had allegedly thwarted Wickremesinghe\u2019s attempt to develop Sri Lanka using this tactic every time he was in a position of power \u2013 in 2001, 2004 and 2015 \u2013 are once again resorting to patriotism to undermine him now that he is president.",
    "UNP deputy leader Ruwan Wijewadena, meanwhile, feels that no party in the opposition has the capacity to take Sri Lanka through its current recovery cum development trajectory.",
    "\u201cThe opposition is trying to sabotage Mr Wickremesinghe. None of our politicians has a plan on how to take the country forward.",
    "\u201cWhere do we take the country by handing it over to such groups?\u201d he said at a UNP event, adding that the next presidential election will in fact be held in 2024.",
    "The SJB feels differently, rumoured crossovers and willingness of some members to worth with the president notwithstanding. SJB legislator Hector Appuhamy told reporters that \u201cthose who lie with dogs\u201d inevitably get up with fleas.",
    "\u201cAll we have to say is find a treatment for the fleas. This is why we opted not to lie with dogs,\u201d he said. The SJB made a last-minute decision in July 2022 to pit Dullas Alahapperuma, another breakaway MP from the SLPP, against Wickremesinghe, with the latter eventually winning the presidency with the support of 134 MPs, mostly from the SLPP.",
    "Appuhamy\u2019s SJB colleague Eran Wickramaratne says his party is ready for any poll.",
    "\u201cIf he says a presidential election is needed, we\u2019ll raise both hands in parliament in support of that. The SJB is ready for any election, be it presidential or parliamentary,\u201d he said.",
    "If Wickremesinghe does in fact want to secure an early mandate as speculated, he will need to seek a constitutional amendment repealing a provision that prevents a president elected by parliament from calling an early presidential election.",
    "Provided that the Supreme Court determines that the amendment will not be inconsistent with any of the entrenched clauses of the constitution, it may be passed by a two-thirds majority in parliament.",
    "Parliament support well in excess of a two-thirds majority for such an amendment is likely given that the SJB has already declared its support for an early poll. Dilan Perera\u2019s FPC has also spoken in favour of an early election. The NPP\u2019s position is less clear, however, with its leaders still calling for a local government election.
