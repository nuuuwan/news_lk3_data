    "AmCham Sri Lanka\u2019s annual CxO Forum: Unlocking 2024, powered by HSBC, was held on 31 January, at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo.",
    "The half-day symposium comprised four cohesive sessions aimed at equipping members and organisations with global, local, and regional macro and microeconomic insights and inspiring and empowering transformative leadership through turbulent times.",
    "Welcoming the delegates to the sessions, AmCham SL President Shirendra Lawrence noted, \u201cWhile we look back on the past few years as especially challenging ones, the fact of the matter is that as circumstances, resources, and ways of life evolve, the challenges that face our business continuity will do the same. While each year brings with it a new set of challenges, it also brings with it a new set of opportunities. We at AmCham Sri Lanka have designed this day to provide you with macro and microeconomic insights, trends, tips, and inspirational thought leadership, along with some sharing of organisational best practices, which we hope will stimulate each of you to unlock the best that 2024 can offer you.\u201d",
    "The Chief Guest of Unlocking 2024 powered by HSBC, Ambassador Julie Chung made the keynote address, where she noted that exports and private sector growth will be the engines of the recovery of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, which needs space and support to thrive, and that while Sri Lanka has taken difficult measures to put the country on a long-term sustainable footing, the people of Sri Lanka deserve and continue to demand openness, transparency, and accountability from their leaders as the process of reform moves forward. She also noted that the private sector has a crucial role to play as a community of thought leaders.",
    "She concluded her address by stating, \u201cApple just became the world\u2019s most valuable brand, leading Microsoft, Google, and Amazon... nearly 50 years after it was created, after almost going bankrupt, after facing tumultuous management changes, how did Apple become the world\u2019s most valuable brand? It took innovation, openness to making mistakes, and creativity\u2014all things that Sri Lankans can be and Sri Lankan companies can do. We should see Sri Lanka\u2019s own Apple take seed here and grow to be a global leader. The United States government is cheering for you, and we stand ready to partner to create an environment that enables you and the next generation of companies to succeed.\u201d",
