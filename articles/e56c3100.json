    "[Foreword excerpted from \u2018Interventions: Selected Political Writings\u2019, by Dayan Jayatilleka]",
    "\u2018The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so free, that your very existence is an act of rebellion.\u2019\u2013 Albert Camus",
    "It is with great honor and profound admiration that I write this foreword for Interventions, the most recent publication of my mentor and friend, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka. As is often the case with Dr. Jayatilleka\u2019s literacy works (one would even say \u2018always\u2019 the case), this anthology compels the reader to engage in an intellectual gymnastic that pushes the boundaries of conventional thinking -an exercise that he, himself, has excelled in since a very young age.",
    "I first crossed paths with Dr. Jayatilleka in the spring of 2011 during his posting in my hometown, Paris. I had just completed my masters\u2019 degrees at the Sorbonne and Sciences Po and was looking to gain some experience in the diplomatic world. Little did I know that this encounter would be the premise to a unique intellectual journey that would significantly influence my perspective on the political landscape of Sri Lanka, but also on global politics and international affairs in general. Throughout this journey, I have had the privilege of engaging with the different persona that Dr. Jayatilleka embodies: the diplomat, the political philosopher, the teacher, the friend and most importantly, the rebel.",
    "A rebel, he sure is! Much like Camus, for Dr. Jayatilleka every major life decision has been an act of rebellion in its own way. The man himself epitomizes the true essence of revolution; one that is fought both within and outside. This constantly permeates his writing, often reflecting a commitment to challenging the status quo. Yet, underlying it all lies an urge, one might even say an obsession, to rectify injustices prevalent in Sri Lanka\u2019s political and social landscape. By drawing on historical context and contemporary realities, his writings emphasize on the urgency of addressing systemic injustices.",
    "Remaining true to his father\u2019s legacy and armed with nothing more than words, he has over the past decades transformed the prevailing political narrative in Sri Lanka by appealing to both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, somehow transcending traditional divides. An ability that very few of his contemporaries were ever able to achieve, let alone excel in. Perhaps it\u2019s this capacity to connect with both ends of the spectrum that propels him to constantly rise from his own ashes, leaving an indelible mark on the ever-evolving political landscape that is Sri Lanka.",
    "As I read through the manuscript, especially the many references to Israel that sadly hold greater relevance today, I couldn\u2019t help but reminisce about shared anecdotes. One notable memory instinctively transports me to October 31, 2011, a historical moment where 107 countries voted to admit Palestine as a full member state within UNESCO, defying a mandated cutoff of American funds. I can distinctly remember the intense gaze of the Swiss delegates sitting beside me when, then Ambassador, Dr. Jayatilleka proudly casted a loud \u2018YES\u2019 on behalf of Sri Lanka. The patriot in me could not have been prouder that day.",
    "While most are acquainted with his achievements at the UNHRC in Geneva, UNESCO, without a doubt, was the intellectual arena where Dr. Jayatilleka seemed the most in his element. Whether it was championing Irina Bokova\u2019s concept of New Humanism or revitalizing a decaying non-aligned movement through informal state coalitions building, he constantly stood at the forefront of every intellectual battlefield. Throughout his tenure in Paris, his diplomatic finesse and philosophical acuteness had briefly elevated Sri Lanka to one of the most esteemed countries in the international sphere, making it a beacon of diplomatic excellence.",
    "While UNESCO was his battlefield, Paris became his playing field where he sharpened and shared his political acumen by engaging in various political and academic stages. For Dr. Jayatilleka, Paris served not only as a backdrop for intellectual pursuits but also as a dynamic arena for practical engagement in the highest echelons of politics, contributing to the evolution of his political thought and strategy. His below essay \u2018A Farewell to Fidel\u2019 somewhat captures the reflective journey through which he engaged himself and others, long before those years.",
    "These reflections are indeed underlined throughout his contributions, always connecting the rest of the world to Sri Lanka, and vice-versa. Like his father, Mervyn de Silva, Dr. Jayatilleka\u2019s work indeed demonstrates a persistent effort to link global perspectives with the intricacies of Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape. His writings and actions serve as a conduit, fostering a reciprocal understanding that transcends geographical boundaries. Whether delving into international relations, mastering multilateral diplomacy, or addressing local issues, his ability to connecting the global North and the global South, but also the global and the local, is indeed a constant theme, reflecting a nuanced and interconnected worldview.",
    "For any student, his writings, in particular those meticulously selected for the purpose of this anthology, not only offer intellectual nourishment, but also serve as a blueprint to understanding the intricate dynamics of blending theoretical discourse with practical engagement in the realm of politics. Regardless of whether one aligns with Dr. Jayatilleka\u2019s perspectives or not, his analysis stimulates intellectual curiosity and pushes us to constructively question prevailing rationales, as well as established norms and ideologies.",
    "In doing so, his contributions intend to become a basis for cultivating a generation of independent thinkers who are not merely passive recipients of information but active contributors to the ongoing discourse in Sri Lankan politics, and beyond. In a country where youth has historically played pivotal roles in two violent insurrections, Dr. Jayatilleka\u2019s work is especially significant. It gives the opportunity for young people to reflect on the past, through a comparative lens, while at the same time offering a compass for those seeking a nuanced understanding of the complex political landscape that we are currently in.",
    "For the past 13 years, I have had the privilege of engaging with both Dr. Jayatilleka and his wife, Sanja Jayatilleka, on various such themes, some of which are covered in the below anthology. These discussions have been the cornerstone of our friendship. A friendship that, to me, is invaluable in many ways. Yet, while most may only know the intellectual, a very few of us are fortunate enough to delve into the persona that emerges when the pen is finally laid to rest (if it ever truly is).",
    "Dr Jayatilleka, as I have come to know him, is someone that cares deeply for others. One to whom loyalty and true friendship extend beyond the realm of intellect to the depths of genuine compassion. One who, even behind the scenes, would fight against injustices and ignorance expecting no reward other than a restoration of justice. A trait and passion he shares with none other than his wife, the central figure in his life. A connoisseur of jazz and cinematography, in those brief moments when the pen is set aside, he would be the first one on the dance floor and the first at a movie screening. For those astute enough to read between the lines of his writings, these dimensions of his persona may surface from time to time, offering a deeper appreciation for the individual he truly is.",
