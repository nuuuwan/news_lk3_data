    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed questions from students, and below are some of the queries along with his responses.",
    "Tax revenue is the main factor in a country\u2019s income. We study entrepreneurship ideas and entrepreneurship in our university studies. But Mr. President, it does not work in practice. Therefore, we request you to improve the activities for the inclusion of students\u2019 ideas for entrepreneurial activities.",
    "You can establish such a circle in your faculty and connect directly with our finance team.",
    "Mr. President, if this program is encouraged to be implemented in all universities, it should be said that it is more suitable.",
    "Groups of university students can visit the Treasury for a day or two and study how it works.",
    "University students are facing a big problem in pursuing their studies through the English medium. On one occasion, a suicide incident was also reported due to having to engage in studies in English at our university. Therefore, is it possible to make necessary arrangements to improve students\u2019 English knowledge from the basic level?",
    "I think there is no such problem in Colombo University. Such a problem has not arisen in the University of Moratuwa. But all of you should study English. English is an international language. If you work with modern technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), you need English knowledge. Many countries in the world, including America, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, conduct work in English. China will probably follow this path in the future.",
    "As we have planned to introduce a course on AI in the next two years, it is mandatory to develop the English language knowledge of university students. Accordingly, we expect to facilitate it through the University Grants Commission and, if necessary, institutions such as the British Council.",
    "Mr. President, the duration students spend in a government university to attain academic qualifications for degree completion is considerably longer than the time spend in private universities. Consequently, upon entering the job market, individuals from private universities often have more practical experience than their counterparts from government universities. What suggestions do you have to address this discrepancy?",
    "I attended a state university, commencing my studies at the age of 18 and completing my degree at 21, subsequently becoming a lawyer at 23.",
    "This pertains to an internal matter within the university. Presently, there are disruptions to university education caused by certain individuals. However, during my time at the university, we reached an understanding with the Vice-Chancellor. We agreed that any strikes or protests would be confined to the last two weeks of the first semester, a compromise that was mutually accepted. I believe it is crucial to establish and adhere to a standardized approach to address such issues.",
    "Additionally, we anticipate proposing legislation in the future stipulating that students, once admitted to universities, should aim to complete their education within a specified timeframe of three or four years, leading to their timely departure from the university. Notably, this proposed regulation does not apply to medical faculties.",
    "Mr. President, may I offer a suggestion? Government schools commonly have synchronized start and end dates. Could we not implement a similar approach for state universities?",
    "The academic year for universities traditionally commences in October and concludes on September 30 of the subsequent year. This timing has been consistent, even during my time in university when the academic year also began in October. It\u2019s worth noting that in numerous countries, the standard university academic year spans from October to September.",
    "Notable attendees included Member of Parliament Mr. Wajira Abeywardena, the Northern Province Governor Ms. P.S.M. Charles, President\u2019s Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake, President\u2019s Special Projects Director Mr. Theekshana Abeywardena, President\u2019s Trade Union Director General Mr. Saman Ratnapriya, University Grants Commission Chairman Professor Sampath Amaratunga, Jaffna University Vice-Chancellor Professor S. Sri Srisatkunaraja, Former Vice-Chancellor Professor Vasanthy Arasaratnam and a group of university students actively participated in this event."
