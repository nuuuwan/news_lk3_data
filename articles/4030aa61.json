    "Founder, Managing Director of Resus Energy, Kishan Nanayakkara of Sri Lanka, was recognized at the 7th annual Asia Pacific \u201850 Leading Lights: Kindness in Leadership campaign\u2019 that was released on the recent World Kindness Day.",
    "\u201cAs we celebrate the seventh year of our 50 Leading Lights: Kindness in Leadership campaign, it\u2019s evident that kindness is much more than a feel-good gesture \u2013 it\u2019s a strategic advantage. Both successful leaders and leading academics consistently affirm that kindness enhances wellbeing, fuels innovation, and drives productivity. It is, therefore, a great honour to announce the 2024 APAC Leading Lights list, in association with Asia Square. By leading with kindness, these remarkable men and women transform workplaces into thriving ecosystems where both people and businesses flourish. They are an inspiration to us all\u201d, said Pinky Lilani, CBE DL, Founder, Kindness & Leadership: 50 Leading Lights.",
