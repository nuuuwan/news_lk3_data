    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has affirmed People\u2019s Leasing & Finance\u2019s (PLC) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A-(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable, the company said in a stock exchange filing.",
    "The rating reflects PLC\u2019s financial strength as a large finance and leasing company (FLC) focusing on vehicle financing and other asset-backed loans, Fitch said.",
    "\u201cA gradual easing in vehicle import bans may further underpin growth, albeit with some collateral value risk.\u201d",
    "PLC\u2019s franchise also benefits from the linkages with its parent, state-owned People\u2019s Bank (A(lka)/Stable), the country\u2019s second-largest bank, the rating agency said.",
    "Fitch noted that the operating environment for Sri Lanka\u2019s finance and leasing companies (FLCs) continues to stabilise, with improving GDP growth.",
    "\u201cWe expect PLC\u2019s core vehicle financing business to benefit from improving economic conditions and the potential liberalisation of vehicle imports.\u201d",
    "Fitch Affirms People\u2019s Leasing & Finance at \u2018A- (lka)\u2019; Outlook Stable",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 04 Oct 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed People\u2019s Leasing & Finance PLC\u2019s (PLC) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A-(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "Standalone Profile Drives Rating: PLC\u2019s rating reflects its intrinsic financial strength as a large finance and leasing company (FLC) focusing on vehicle financing and other asset-backed loans. The rating also reflects the significant capital buffers and liquidity levels built up through the country\u2019s economic crisis. PLC\u2019s franchise also benefits from the linkages with its parent, People\u2019s Bank (Sri Lanka) (A(lka)/Stable), the country\u2019s second-largest bank.",
    "Stabilising Operating Environment: The operating environment for Sri Lanka\u2019s finance and leasing companies (FLCs) continues to stabilise, with improving GDP growth (1H24: 5.0% yoy; 2023: -2.3%), normalising inflation and reduced market interest rates. This should support the sector\u2019s credit growth, asset quality and profitability. A gradual easing in vehicle import bans may further underpin growth, albeit with some collateral value risk.",
    "Loan Growth Expected: We expect PLC\u2019s core vehicle financing business to benefit from improving economic conditions and the potential liberalisation of vehicle imports. This growth in business volumes will be supported by its solid domestic franchise. Net loans as a share of assets remain below pre-crisis levels (1QFY25: 65%; FY24: 63%; FY21: 81%), but should continue to increase as growth resumes.",
    "PLC\u2019s risk profile reflects its exposure to customer segments that are lower in the credit spectrum and therefore more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions. We expect loan growth in the near to medium term could exert pressure on its underwriting standards due to increasing competitive pressures. PLC\u2019s exposures are mostly backed by collateral, with its share of unsecured lending only 1% of loans.",
    "Asset Quality to Improve: We expect PLC\u2019s stage 3 loan ratio to decline gradually over the medium term, given its planned growth, recovery efforts and improved borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity as the economy stabilises. The company\u2019s stage 3 loan ratio declined to 13.1% by the end of the first quarter in the financial year ending March 2025 (FY25), from 15.1% at FYE24. That said, PLC\u2019s stage 3 ratio remains higher than Fitch-rated large FLC peer average of 7.9% (FYE24: 8.2%).",
    "Profitability to Recover: We expect PLC\u2019s proposed loan growth to improve its margin as the company redeploys its funds to expand higher-yielding vehicles loans while reducing treasury securities. We believe this should strengthen its core profitability, which has been weaker than its historical average and peer metrics. PLC\u2019s pretax income/average assets was 3.9% in 1QFY25, lower than the Fitch-rated large FLC peer average of 8.2%. An increase in the scale of operations should also reduce the cost/income ratio (1QFY25: 64%; FY23: 59%).",
    "Leverage to Increase: We expect PLC\u2019s debt/tangible equity to increase modestly and trend towards pre-crisis levels in the medium term as growth resumes. PLC\u2019s debt/tangible equity was 2.6x at end-1QFY25 (pre-crisis, FY21: 3.1x), below the Fitch-rated large FLC peer average of 3.2x, but we expect the increase in leverage is likely to narrow the gap with peers over time.",
    "Liquidity Buffers to Decrease: We expect PLC to prioritise redeploying its excess liquidity to support loan growth in FY25. PLC has maintained a more stable funding cost within Fitch\u2019s rated FLC universe in Sri Lanka, demonstrating the relative strength in its funding franchise, partly benefiting from its link with People\u2019s Bank. Unsecured debt/total funding was high at 95% at FYE24 (FYE23: 93%), given PLC is mostly funded by deposits and some unsecured wholesale borrowings.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The National Long-Term Rating is sensitive to changes in PLC\u2019s standalone credit profile relative to rated issuers on Fitch\u2019s Sri Lankan national scale. A downgrade could result from a materially higher leverage, a substantial erosion of capital buffers due to excessive growth or significant asset-quality deterioration with weakening profitability. Increased risk appetite, as evident in a business mix shift towards riskier products and more vulnerable customer segments, or sustained weaker asset quality relative to peers, could also lead to a negative rating action.",
    "Fitch may also take negative rating action if there is renewed weakness in market variables or funding and liquidity conditions, leading to increased risk to PLC\u2019s asset quality, profitability and capital buffers.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "An improved operating environment, together with enhancement in PLC\u2019s credit profile relative to peers on Fitch\u2019s Sri Lankan national scale, could lead to a rating upgrade. A significant shift towards less risky asset classes with sustained asset quality performance, profitability and adequate capital buffers could also lead to positive rating action.",
    "PLC\u2019s national scale senior debt ratings have been affirmed at \u2018A-(lka)\u2019. PLC\u2019s senior unsecured debt is rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, as it ranks equally with claims of the company\u2019s other senior unsecured creditors.",
    "The senior debt rating will move in tandem with the National Long-Term Rating.",
