    "A potential bumper harvest of soybean in South America and the USA in 2024 would see a significant drop in soybean import prices, and it could help countries like Sri Lanka that imports the commodity from the U.S.A. as a key poultry feed, Jim Sutter, CEO at U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC) told The Island recently.",
    "\u201cApart from that, as we now directly collaborate with Sri Lankan poultry farmers, they are exposed to the latest technologies that enhance productivity. This would also help bring down the price of chicken in Sri Lanka,\u201d Jim Sutter said.",
    "Meanwhile, USSEC Chairman, Stan Born said that soybeans Sri Lanka imports from the USA have intrinsic benefits that soy from other sources can\u2019t give.",
    "\u201cWe provide a high-quality product that will put on flesh faster and more economically. Quicker turnover of animals should have a positive impact on price and a positive impact on availability,\u201d he said.",
    "Born said sustainability is extremely important for the Sri Lankan government and the people of Sri Lanka, and therefore, USSEC has continuously worked with its partners to improve sustainability in agriculture.",
    "\u201cWe have managed to increase production of soybean, while we have also gotten better at less erosion, less greenhouse gas emissions and greater sustainability of the overall process. We demonstrate while we increase production, while doing it more sustainably. What we really want to do is to help Sri Lankan farmers increase their productivity in a sustainable manner,\u201d he said.",
