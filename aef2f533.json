    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed MP Vadivel Suresh as a Senior Advisor aimed at \u201cfostering the integration of Hill Country Tamils into Sri Lankan society\u201d, the president\u2019s office said.",
    "A statement from the President\u2019s Media Divison (PMD) said Suresh\u2019s \u201cpivotal role will centre around overseeing the comprehensive integration of Hill Country Tamils, particularly focusing on the districts of Badulla, Nuwara Eliya and Rathnapura\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe Senior Advisor will play a key role in coordinating various initiatives related to the welfare of Plantation Companies, the promotion of women, safeguarding children, addressing disparities in Tamil schools and upgrading the delivery of health services,\u201d the statement said.",
    "In May this year, Suresh, who represents the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in parliament and also serves as the general secretary of the Lanka Jathika Estate Workers\u2019 Union, made headlines when he issued an ultimatum to opposition and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, demanding an apology for a perceived slight on the Indian-origin Tamil community that Suresh represents. He also spoke favourably of President Wickremesinghe, hinting at a possible cross over.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Indian-origin Tamils, most of whom have historically worked in the plantation sector and live in dire conditions on wages widely considered unacceptably low. Speaking at a May Day rally, the Badulla district MP said Premadasa must apologise to the estate Tamils for allegedly snubbing them at an event in Madulsima that he failed to attend.",
    "\u201cI would like to say to our leader, sir, do not take us for granted,\u201d said Suresh.",
    "\u201cIf you need us to stay with you, come right now to Madulsima and apologise to my people and then we shall restart our journey. Otherwise I won\u2019t be part of that journey. There will be no Vadivel Suresh. If you don\u2019t apologise to my people, I won\u2019t be with the SJB,\u201d he said.",
    "Making matters worse, the MP also expressed a willingness to join President Wickremesinghe if he was able to raise the daily wage of plantation workers and resolve their grievances. He also said the president has been successful in containing the disruptions caused by the currency crisis.",
    "\u201cOn this May Day, we say to both the opposition leader and the president, I and my people would join hands with a leader that worked to increase [estate workers\u2019] wages and give them [access to the Samurdhi welfare scheme] and include them in national policy,\u201d he said.
