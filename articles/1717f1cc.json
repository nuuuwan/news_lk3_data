    "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that the current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake lacks a parliamentary majority, similar to himself.",
    "He made these remarks while attending a public meeting held by the New Democratic Front in Negombo this morning (27).",
    "\u201cIf you look into his list, I don\u2019t know whether his government can last three months or at least three weeks. We need experienced people for the country to run. We ask to put experienced people forward. He can last at least for three years only if he has a majority,\u201d the former president added.",
    "\u201cThey tell me to stay at home if I lose. I lost, I accept that. I contested the presidential election. The majority did not vote for me. So I lost, but the majority did not vote for him either,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",
    "The former president further pointed out that Dissanayake also failed to secure 51% of the vote, stating that both he and the current president are presidents without a majority.",
    "\u201cI am the former President without a majority. He is the current President without a majority. Neither he has it, nor me. That is what\u2019s special. We are both the same\u201d, he added."
