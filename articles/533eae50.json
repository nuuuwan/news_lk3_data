    "On a bright April morning in 1982 at an astrologically auspicious hour of 10.13 a.m., Sri Lanka inaugurated its new capital, Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte to a triumphant conch shell sounds and reverberating drums when a third of the construction of the new Parliament was over. President J.R. Jayewardene following an ancient tradition deposited nine different gems and followed other rituals to invoke the blessings of the deities on the building.",
    "The site known popularly as Kotte has eventually become the sumptuous home of the Sri Lanka\u2019s lawmakers. The historic Diyawanna Oya was reclaimed from what was a wasteland of marsh. A 300-acre lake was created on which now stands as one of Asia\u2019s most famous architectural buildings \u2013 the Parliament of Sri Lanka.",
    "It was designed by Sri Lanka\u2019s best-known Architect, Geoffrey Bawa whoconceived and designed the whole complex. It stands as an elegant embodiment of the rich and cultural and aesthetic heritage of this land.",
    "The one ton silver plated chandelier in the main Chamber and the skillfully carved mahogany wall outside the Members\u2019 special entrance stand testimony to his work. Once a capital of Ceylon in the 15th century, it will be regarded as a return to the fortified city of Sri Jayawardenapura, Kotte. The idea behind this was to methodically ease the congestion of Colombo.",
    "Today, the city of Colombo is still growing from the original one and half million population living there. The idea was to make it the administrative capital of Sri Lanka and it was so gazetted. The idea was to have the diplomatic missions,, Government Ministries and offices, hospitals and schools but sadly this has not happened as originally planned.",
    "Whether the costly investment, will be justified is too soon to say, but it is certainly a good start. The Pacific Area Travel Association (PATA) has bestowed on the new Parliament a Heritage award. Capitals in Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Washington DC, Bolivia have been developed as new emerging capitals.",
    "The Member of Parliament for Kotte, Anandatissa de Alwis suggested the site to President Jayewardene after being told by Geoffrey Bawa that the site is the most suitable saying, \u201d if we are going to build a new capital, why not return to the capital of the Kings?\u201d",
    "When the Portuguese arrived in 1505, the shrewd Sinhalese tried to keep secret Kotte\u2019s proximity to the country\u2019s port in Colombo. They led the foreigners through a labyrinth of roads and paths on horseback stretching over a seven mile journey. But the Portuguese saw though this, as they could still hear their ships guns boom. Hence saying the popular saying \u201cParangiya Kotte giya (\u201cLike the Portuguese going to Kotte\u201d.)",
    "The building has a huge copper pitched Kandyan roof to disguise its height. In the main pavilion conclave, layers of space on every level are articulated by rectangles of dark wood and glass. Even the stucco columns on the ground floor are unadorned and fuse easily with the simple wooden beams above.",
    "The structure has a definite Eastern flavour and Bawa commented \u201cWe have a marvelous tradition of building in this country which has got lost. It got lost because the people followed outside influences over their own good instincts. I just wanted the building to fit into blocks. You must run with the site, after all you don\u2019t wait to push nature out of the building.\u201d",
    "Rupert Scott writing in an Architectural Review states, \u201cmost important, the building appears to be in tune with the climate, topography and a culture\u201d To stand at the entrance of the complex, besides the reflecting pools and terraced slopes of cascading water, it had to be kept in mind that for centuries the site was an absolute marsh.",
    "Reclaiming the land and constructing and re-building on it fell to a consortium of two Mitsui companies, an international builder from Japan, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore along with a skilled labour of masons, labour force and carpenters from Sri Lanka. They completed the project in a very impressive period of 26 months. The real heroes of the project are the artisans and craftsmen of Sri Lanka, most of them unacknowledged, who helped create the magnificent work of art and sculpture.",
    "The opulent Chamber, the focal point of the complex is covered with a shimmering tented ceiling made of thousands of small pieces of pressed aluminum linked by a tiny brass sequence. Suspended from the centre of the atrium is the enormous silver plated chandelier with over 500 bulbs in a double-palm motif designed by Sri Lankan sculptor Laki Senanayake. This young artist who\u2019s mother sat in the Parliament of Ceylon was given only six month to create this wonder. Senanayake says \u201cI could never have succeeded without the brilliant master thinker Edwin Perera and his competent craftsmen.",
    "Eighteen silver flags, beams and standards of kings, temples and korales displayed prominently from tall steel posts are the craftsmanship of D. Wimal Surendra. He was responsible for this as well as for the massive silver door leading to the Chamber. The intricate carved square copper door is silver plated and decorated with an elaborate inscription with the words of the preamble of the 1978 Constitution in all three languages, English, Sinhala and Tamil are inscribed on the door. The walls flanking this ornate door are covered with the beautiful line drawings of murals by the late LTP Manjusri, a Magsaysay Award winning artist.",
    "The story in the Salelihini Sandesaya, an eloquent legend of King Parakrama Bahu VI by a famous Sinhala scholar monk of the 15th Century is depicted here. The Selalihiniya was the bird chosen as the courier to convey the Kotte king\u2019s supplication for a male heir to the deity Vibushana in the nearby city of Kelaniya. The understated elegance of the mural juxtaposes nicely with the lobby walls of the entrance for the members of Parliament.",
    "This special entrance, usually off limits to the public, is surrounded by wall space covered with multi dimensional jungle scenes carved in mahogany by Mahinda Abeysekara. The interior of the main Chamber the centerpiece of the entire complex exudes luxury. The plush red carpet, the billowing ceiling together with black leather chairs for the Members are bathed in indirect lightening.",
    "At the opening of the new Parliament, Dr. Anandatissa de Alwis MP for Kotte, defended such seeming extravagance by rhetorically asking \u201cIs this unworthy of such a nation, who can look towards the world and say we are not made by treaty, we were not created by the United Nation Conference, we were not created at Potsdam, Zurich or Washington. We have a history of over 2,500 years of writing of poetry of sculpture of learning second to nobody except the most ancient civilization of my Dravidian friends across the floor of this House\u201d \u2013",
    "These were truly historic and memorable words, uttered by the Member of Parliament for Kotte on this historical occasion. His valuable contribution of this occasion must be recorded and not forgotten.",
