  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has downgraded the national long-term rating of Sri Lanka\u2019s Singer Finance (Lanka) Plc to \u2018BBB (lka)\u2019 from \u2018BBB+(lka)\u2019.",
    "This rating is a support driven rating and therefore this downgrade follows similar rating action on SFL\u2019s parent, the company said in a statement.",
    "Its senior listed rated unsecured debentures of Rs 5 million issued on May 19, 2020 were also revised down from BBB+ ro BBB; and subordinated listed rated unsecured debentures of Rs 2,000 million issued in June 25, 2021 were revised down from BBB- to BB+.",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo/Mumbai \u2013 07 Dec 2023: Fitch Ratings has downgraded Singer Finance (Lanka) PLC\u2019s (SFL) National Long-Term Rating to \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 from \u2018BBB+(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also downgraded SFL\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured debt to \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 from \u2018BBB+(lka)\u2019, and the outstanding subordinated unsecured debentures to \u2018BB+(lka)\u2019 from \u2018BBB-(lka)\u2019.",
    "Parent\u2019s Weakening Ability to Support: The downgrade follows similar rating action on SFL\u2019s parent, consumer-durable retailer, Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (A(lka)/Stable), on 29 November 2023. SFL\u2019s rating is based on our expectation of support from Singer, taking into account Singer\u2019s 80% shareholding in SFL, the common brand name and a record of equity injections into SFL. As such, the downgrade reflects Singer\u2019s weakening ability to provide support.",
    "Moderate Synergies: We believe SFL has limited synergies with Singer, as evident from SFL\u2019s small share of lending within the group\u2019s ecosystem. We also believe support from the parent could be constrained by SFL\u2019s significant size relative to Singer, as its assets represented 41% of group assets at end-September 2023. SFL\u2019s operational integration with the group is also low, although the parent has increased its focus on the subsidiary\u2019s strategic long-term decision-making over the past few years and has meaningful representation on SFL\u2019s board.",
    "Weak Standalone Profile: SFL\u2019s intrinsic financial position is weaker than its support-driven rating. It has a small domestic vehicle-focused lending franchise and a high-risk appetite stemming from its exposure to customer segments that are more susceptible to difficult operating conditions.",
    "Less Severe Economic Risk: We expect downside economic risk to moderate after Sri Lanka completed the local-currency portion of its domestic debt optimisation, which addressed one element of risk to financial system funding and liquidity. We expect the operating environment to remain challenging in light of strained household finances and fragile investor confidence, but conditions should stabilise with a gradual economic recovery amid easing inflation and interest rates.",
    "Vehicle Loans Remain Dominant: SFL\u2019s business model is dominated by vehicle financing, which accounted for 69% of its lending portfolio as at end-June 2023. Gold loans have been growing at a faster rate in the last few quarters, reaching 28% of SFL\u2019s portfolio, amid lower demand for vehicle financing. However, we do not expect a major change in SFL\u2019s vehicle-focused business mix in the medium term, given its more established franchise in this segment.",
    "Weak Asset Quality: SFL\u2019s reported stage 3 assets ratio rose to 11.9% in the financial year ending March 2023 (FY23), from 6.6% in FY22, on weaker collections in its core vehicle loans segment as well as implementation of a stricter stage 3 recognition rule. We expect asset quality to remain stressed in the medium term, due to the weak economic environment. Nonetheless, loan collections could increase as borrower repayment capability improves, provided the economy gradually stabilises with declining inflation and interest rates.",
    "Profitability to Recover, Leverage Rising: We expect SFL\u2019s net interest margin to gradually recover in the medium term amid a declining interest-rate environment. This, along with a potential pick-up in loan growth, should support earnings and profitability, but a strong loan expansion in the medium term could pressure leverage.",
    "Pre-tax profit/average total assets declined to 3.1% in FY23, from 4.5% in FY22, due to a sharply narrower net interest margin of 9.4%, against 12.7% in FY22. This followed a surge in borrowing costs due to rising interest rates. SFL\u2019s debt/tangible equity reached 5.4x by end-September 2023, from 5.1x at FYE22.",
    "Improved Funding and Liquidity: SFL\u2019s share of unsecured deposits/total debt swelled to 80% by end September 2023, from 52% at FYE22, supported by a greater focus on raising deposits. SFL\u2019s increased cash and cash equivalents from deposit raising and reduced lending mitigated near-term liquidity pressure.",
    "Liquid assets/total assets rose to around 27% by end-September 2023, from 8% at FYE22, as SFL boosted its investments in liquid assets amid fewer lending opportunities.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "SFL\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in Singer\u2019s credit profile, as reflected in Singer\u2019s National Long-Term Rating.",
    "Singer\u2019s weaker ability to provide support to SFL, as signaled through a further downgrade of its rating, SFL\u2019s increased size relative to Singer that makes extraordinary support more onerous or delay in providing liquidity support relative to SFL\u2019s needs due to economy-wide issues could also lead to negative rating action on SFL.",
    "The ratings may also be downgraded if we perceive a weakening in Singer\u2019s propensity to support its finance subsidiaries due to weakening links. That said, SFL\u2019s standalone credit profile could provide a floor to the rating.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "A significant positive turnaround in Singer\u2019s financial prospects or increase in SFL\u2019s strategic importance to Singer through a greater role within the group could lead to narrower notching from Singer\u2019s profile. A large improvement in SFL\u2019s intrinsic credit profile could result in its ratings been derived from its standalone profile.",
    "The rating on SFL\u2019s senior unsecured debt is in line with the National Long-Term Rating, as the debt constitutes the unsubordinated obligations of the company.",
    "SFL\u2019s Sri Lankan rupee-denominated subordinated debentures are rated two notches below its National Long-Term Rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured obligations. Fitch\u2019s baseline notching of two notches for loss severity reflects our expectation of poor recovery. There is no additional notching for non-performance risk.",
    "SFL\u2019s senior unsecured debt and subordinated unsecured debt ratings will move in tandem with the National Long-Term Rating.",
