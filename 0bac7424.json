    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka based Japanese firms were most badly hit by fuel shortages and currency depreciation, following an economic crisis, according to an annual survey by the Japan External Trade Organization.",
    "About 80 percent of the firms said operations had been adversely affected (up 13.3 percent from 2022), while 13.3 percent said they had not been affected, in a survey conducted between August and September 2023.",
    "\u201cThe impact of the economic crisis on Japanese companies in Sri Lanka was more serious than initially assumed,\u201d JETRO said in a statement.",
    "Top blows came from \u2018petrol/fuel shortages\u2019 (82.6 percent) followed by \u2018currency depreciation\u2019 (60.9 percent).",
    "Central bankers and the IMF generally advocate both depreciation and currency volatility (flexible exchange rate), but businesses and their customers dislike it as it makes planning difficult (businesses).",
    "The third biggest hit came from \u2018electricity shortages/power cuts\u2019 (60.9 percent) and \u2018income tax and other tax increases\u2019 (60.9 percent).",
    "Businesses were now seeing a gradual recovery from the crisis.",
    "Among the surveyed companies, 33.3 percent said their business had \u2018improved\u2019 from last year, 50 percent said it had remained unchanged and 16.7% said it had \u2018worsened\u2019.",
    "Specific factors contributing to the improvement included the ending of petrol and fuel shortages (75.0 percent), \u2018power cuts have been eliminated\u2019 (75.0 percent), \u2018logistics problems have been resolved\u2019 (37.5 percent) and \u2018price increases have settled\u2019 (37.5 percent).",
    "About 12.5 percent had cited an improvement in exchange recovery.",
    "Though the rupee collapsed from 200 to 360 in 2022. It appreciated to 360 and but moved between 320 to 330 within short periods under a so-called \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019.",
    "\u201cThis indicates a need to restore international financial confidence promptly through debt restructuring,\u201d the statement said.",
    "The currency collapse led to a steep increase in poverty according to available data.",
    "Japanese firms were still willing to stay in the country, despite the problems.",
    "\u201cWith regard to business development plans over the next 1-2 years, no companies responded that they would relocate to a third country or withdraw,\u201d the statesman said.",
    "About 28.1 percent (+ 2.5-ct from 2022) had said they were planning an \u2018expansion\u2019 and 65.6 percent (+ 11.8 percent from 2022) said they were \u2018remaining the same\u2019.",
    "Only 6.3% (- 20.1 % from 2022) responded saying they planned a \u2018reduction\u2019.",
    "Sri Lanka was pushed into the worst currency crisis in the history of the central bank in 2022 after the agency aggressively targeted \u2018potential output\u2019 with rate cuts.",
    "Sri Lanka also had currency crises in 2015/16 and 2018 as well as 2012, after rate cuts were enforced with reverse repo operations (liquidity injections), which pushed up foreign borrowings.",
    "In 2020, tax cuts were added to rate cuts to target potential output and in 2022 Sri Lanka defaulted on foreign loans.",
    "At the time printing money for potential output targeting was illegal. Several economic bureaucrats including two central bank governors as well as key politicians have been faulted by courts for their part in triggering the crisis.",
    "RELATED Top court faults Sri Lanka ex-President, Fin Min, PB, CB, Governors for economic collapse",
    "Printing money for growth has been legalized in a new IMF backed monetary law.",
    "The central bank has also been given a license by political authority to create up to 7 percent of inflation with no questions asked. (Colombo/Jan06/2023 \u2013 Update III)"
