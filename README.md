*2024-06-17 02:47:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186225) · `ta`

ஆன்மிக மற்றும் உலக வெற்றியை அடைய, மனிதன் சுயநலத்தை விட்டொழித்து, தியாகம் மற்றும் நல்லிணக்கத்துடன் வாழப் பழகிக் கொள்ள வேண்டும் என ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க விடுத்துள்ள ஹஜ் பெருநாள் வாழ்த்துச் செய்தியில் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

ஒவ்வொரு ஆண்டும் முஸ்லிம்கள் அந்த உன்னத நோக்கத்தின் அடிப்படையில் ஹஜ் பெருநாளைக் கொண்டாடுகிறார்கள்.

உலகம் முழுவதிலுமிருந்து முஸ்லிங்கள் அனைவரும் ஒரே நோக்கத்துடன் ஒரே புனிதத் தலத்தில் கூடி, மனிதகுலத்தின் எதிர்பார்ப்பான சமூகத்தின் ஒருமைப்பாட்டிற்காக இத்தினத்தில் பிரார்த்தனை செய்கிறார்கள்.

உலக மக்கள் அனைவருக்கும் சமத்துவம் மற்றும் சகோதரத்துவ உணர்வுகளை விதைக்கும் ஹஜ்  கொண்டாட்டம், உலக அமைதிக்கான சிறந்த செய்தியையும் தரும் என்பது எனது  எதிர்பார்ப்பாகும்.

மனித குலத்தின் அபிலாஷைகளை வென்றெடுப்பதற்காக அனைவரும் ஒரே இலக்கில் ஒன்றுபடும் ஹஜ்ஜுப் பெருநாளை மகிழ்ச்சியுடன் கொண்டாடுவதற்கு இலங்கை மற்றும் உலக முஸ்லிம்கள் அனைவருக்கும் நல்வாழ்த்துக்களை தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன் என்றார்.

உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள முஸ்லிம்களின் மிக முக்கியமான கலாச்சார மற்றும் மதப் பண்டிகையாகக் கருதப்படும் ஈதுல் அல்ஹா பெருநாளை முன்னிட்டு தனது வாழ்த்துக்களை எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவர் சஜீத் பிரேமதாச தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

இத் தருணத்தில் அதன் முக்கிய விழுமியங்களைப் பற்றி நினைவில் கொள்வது சாலச்சிறந்தது என உணர்கின்றேன்.

வரலாற்றின் தொடக்கத்திலிருந்தே, மக்கள் பல்வேறு மத தியாகங்களுக்காக கூட்டாக கூடினர், அதில் தங்கள் சொந்த மதத்துடன் தொடர்புடைய மரபுகள் பாதுகாக்கப்பட்டு அவற்றுக்கிடையே தொடர்புகளை ஏற்படுத்திக் கொண்டனர்.  இஸ்லாத்தில் புனிய ஹஜ் யாத்திரையும் அவ்வாறானதொன்றாகும்.

இஸ்லாத்தின் ஐந்து பெரும் கடமைகளில் ஐந்தாவது கடமையாகக் கருதப்படும் ஹஜ் யாத்திரை இறைவன் மீதான பக்தி மற்றும் நம்பிக்கையை மீண்டும் மீண்டும் உறுதிப்படுத்துவதாகும். அந்த நம்பிக்கையின் காரணமாக, உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள மில்லியன் கணக்கான இஸ்லாமியர்கள் ஒரே நோக்கத்துடன் ஒரே நேரத்தில் புனித மக்காவில் ஒன்று கூடி, மனிதகுலத்தின் எதிர்பார்ப்பான  சகோதரத்துவ கூட்டு மதிப்பைப் போற்றுகிறார்கள்.

### It is difficult to reduce the model

Despite global lubricant price drops, immediate fuel price reductions in Sri Lanka are challenging due to the country's reliance on imported and refined fuel, influenced by international market prices, particularly from Singapore. About 35% of Sri Lanka's fuel demand is met through imports. While the cost of lubricant oil has decreased significantly since last September, affecting overall fuel prices, the situation remains complex.

🟩

The Ministry of Power and Energy has said that despite the decline in lubricant prices in the world market, it is difficult to reduce the prices of fuels in the country immediately.

According to the government -approved purchases, fuel prices should be carried out in Sri Lanka.

The refined fuel is imported according to the Singapore Business Index. Accordingly, the secretary also stated that fuel supply should be supplied in Sri Lanka in accordance with the prices that are determined there.

Sulakshana Jayawardena also said that about 35 per cent of the country's total demand is imported and refined, and that the prices of refined fuel in accordance with world market prices cannot be corrected.

However, Professor Vasantha Attukorala of the Economics University of Peradeniya University said that the price of lubricant oil fell by 27 per cent compared to last September.

He said this during a media briefing held at his party headquarters in Jaffna on Sunday (16).. In this regard, he said ..

In fact, I see this as an attempt to keep the problems of the Tamil people as long -standing problems.

Although they are all tied together in a potato bundle, they are scattered like a rolling in every direction, as Prabhakaran is not in the absence of today.

In this case, where is unity among them. What did you get for many years. Is it possible to control the destruction?Is there any improvement?In the absence of the election, they are talking about that again.

🟩

Douglas Devananda, Secretary -General and Minister of the EPDP, said that we are not concerned with our welfare.

He said this while commenting on the 13th Amendment at a media briefing held at his party office in Jaffna on Sunday (16).

The main candidates who are contesting the upcoming presidential election have come to the Northern Province. You know what they have spoken and what other Tamil parties have heard.

The Tamil party, in particular, has asked them, "Calvasi thariya, a half -tharami, three -quarters. But we don't have to ask.

In fact, the 13th Amendment was introduced as the Sri Lanka-India Agreement Media due to the sacrifices of the Tamil people.

When the correction is available, half the half, Kavasi, three -quarters. He said it was fully.

India had also sent its forces at the time of implementing it. Thus, one side sent its forces and took action diplomatically.

### Why Sri Lanka needs new leadership

*2024-06-17 00:01:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-Sri-Lanka-needs-new-leadership/4-763140) · `en`

Wickremesinghe’s track record suggests a pattern of governance that prioritises personal and political survival over genuine public service

In the complex and turbulent political landscape of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe has emerged as a figure of significant controversy. Despite holding the office of Prime Minister six times and now serving as President, his tenure has been marked by a series of strategic manoeuvres that have often sidelined democratic principles and prioritised political expediency over national interest.

Wickremesinghe’s political career is a study in resilience and opportunism, akin to a chameleon that changes its colours to blend with its surroundings. The leader of the United National Party (UNP), the oldest political party in Sri Lanka, he has managed to stay relevant through numerous political storms. However, his methods and motivations raise serious concerns.

The IMF second review has not properly guided the Government to execute its first responsibility of ensuring macroeconomic stability and its continuing efficacy

The IMF issued a Press Release No. 24/214 on 12 June completing the second review under the Extended Fund Facility for Sri Lanka.

The economy is a system. The way we understand any system might be different. We understand the economy as a system having a cause-and-effect relationship. In such a system, as Buddhism preaches, nothing will happen without necessary conditions. When we look at the IMF second review, economic vulnerabilities just arise not knowing proper causes. Take the very first paragraph of IMF report. It says as follows:

Imposing such high-sounding targets to a set of ministers with such backgrounds sounds patently absurd and wildly illogical to say the least

We are living in an era under a high-level focus by UN authorities on the creation of a global level roadmap, with an open data platform, to commit all nations towards a Sustainable Development Goal.

This concept emerged with the Heads of State and High Representatives of Governments meeting at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 25-27 September 2015 to celebrate its 70th anniversary, deciding on a new action program for a global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).

The declaration adopted at this forum incorporated inter-alia the following;

### AKD’s NPP Must Win, But Where Is His Agenda & Platform?

Sri Lankans are finally ready to bid farewell to the three major parties. They are fed up with the old guard who have been cris crossing parties like leaches to remain in power, and eventually led our beloved homeland to financial ruin. It is widely believed and hoped that AKD will be elected to be our next President. I personally hope he will. Not so much know their agenda and policies but there is no other option.

But like thousands more, I am confused why Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not revealed his platform. Sri Lankans are screaming for a wholesale system change. They expect AKD and his team to deliver.

People are not expecting a change of face, but a change of the political structure that will create proper checks and balances, ensure independence of our criminal justice system, restore the rule of law and more.  With this in mind, here are my questions for AKD and his team

President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that pilgrims to Madhu will be provided with all necessary facilities to engage in their pilgrimage activities without any hindrance.

Addressing the Mannar District Development Committee meeting held today (16) at the Mannar District Secretariat, he emphasized that it is unfair to arrest and fine pilgrims on their way to sacred sites like Madhu Church and Sri Pada.

He instructed that if pilgrims are arrested in the future, the President’s Office should be informed immediately.

During the meeting, the President directed the Sri Lanka Army to clean and develop both sides of the existing Madhu Road for the convenience of the pilgrims visiting Madhu Church.

Despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire, an agreement to halt the fighting still appears distant, more than eight months since the start of the war in the Palestinian enclave.

### Rare twin elephants born in Thailand ‘miracle’

*2024-06-16 14:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/rare-twin-elephants-born-in-thailand-miracle/) · `en`

An Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a rare set of twins, in what caretakers have described as a miracle.

The mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins and when she gave birth to a male calf last Friday, staff at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal, had thought the delivery was done.

But while cleaning up the first calf and helping it stand on its feet, they heard a loud thud and realised that Chamchuri had given birth to a second calf, a female.

The second birth sent the mother into a panic and caretakers had to restrain her to prevent her from stepping on the female calf. One caretaker was hurt in the melee.

Dramatic footage on social media showed a crowd of caretakers – known locally as mahouts – frantically separating the female calf from the mother, with blood from the birth still visible on her hind legs.
