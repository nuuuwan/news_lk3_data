All the debate about Sri Lanka’s current state of sovereign default implies a much deeper question: what is the macroeconomic framework that the NPP will adopt?

With Sri Lanka continuing to reel from the economic crisis, the popular frustration paved the way for the victory of the NPP candidate, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in the recent Presidential election. Meanwhile, as indicated by the premature announcement of a settlement with bondholders just days earlier, the complex question of debt restructuring hangs like a shadow over the incoming Government. It invokes a web of international actors led by the IMF who apply pressure at different levels.
