  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Agriculture Ministry has decided to immediately suspend the use of rice stocks for the production of animal feed and beer.",
    "Minister Mahinda Amaraweera took this decision in order to face the possible food shortage in the future due to the current severe drought conditions.",
    "The Minister advised the Ministry secretary to write to the Presidential Food Safety Committee regarding this.",
    "\"Cultivated paddy lands in several districts have been destroyed due to the drought. Due to the prevailing severe drought the farmers are facing the problem of not having enough water for their crops,\" he said.",
    "\"Over 50,000 acres of paddy fields under the Udawalawe Reservoir are at risk of being destroyed due to lack of water. At least two more shifts of water should be given to these paddy fields. There is an acute shortage of water for paddy fields in the Anuradhapura district. If there is no significant rainfall forecast for the next few days, there may be a risk of a rice shortage in the coming period due to the failure of the expected harvest in the Yala season,\" the Minister said.",
    "It is reported that about 100,000 metric tons of rice processed from the paddy harvest of the last Maha season has been used to produce animal feed and beer production. It was decided to use rice in the production of animal feed in order to avoid the decline in the production of milk, eggs and chicken due to the decline in local maize production, especially for animal feed, and the lack of money to import maize, the Minister added.
