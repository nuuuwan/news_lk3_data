    "A Severe controversy has erupted over a video circulating on social media showing Jalani Premadasa, the wife of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa supposedly receiving a present arms salute by SLAF personnel while she was entering the Air Force Camp in Palali yesterday (10)",
    "The present arms is a salute position where the rifle is brought up vertically in line with the body and is usually given to the Heads of State and Members of Parliament",
    "When contacted SLAF spokesman, Group Captain Eranda Geeganage said the present arms salute was performed for MP G. L. Peiris who was among the group accompanying Jalani Premadasa and not for any other individual.",
    "However, it is evident that Jalani Premadasa was leading the group and G. L was seen walking behind her when the salute was given after which Jalani went on to be greeted as the main guest at the Palali camp and a shawl was wrapped on to welcome her.",
    "This video was initially uploaded on Facebook by an SJB organizer for the Northern Province Umachandraa Pragash but by last evening Umachandraa had edited her video on Facebook cutting off the part where the salute was given to the group entering the camp."
