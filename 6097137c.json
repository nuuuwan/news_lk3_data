  "original_body_lines": [
    "The main Opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) launched a public petition campaign yesterday to demand the stripping of civic rights of those who were found responsible for the economic crisis in Sri Lanka.",
    "The signing of the petition commenced in front of the Fort Railway Station, led by SJB leader Sajith Premdasa. Speaking to the media at the event, Premadasa said the petition will demand the establishment of a special Presidential Commission.",
    "\u201cThrough this commission, the President will be compelled to revoke the civic rights of those who have infringed upon the fundamental rights of 2.2 million people in the country. Additionally, the petition will advocate for the removal of the right to vote and contest elections for these individuals,\u201d he added.",
    "Premadasa emphasised that 2.2 million people must take to the streets to sign the petition, compelling the President to legally revoke the civic rights of those responsible for the country\u2019s financial crisis without shielding the Rajapaksas.",
    "The petition comes subsequent to the court decision on 14 November which determined that ex-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, along with former Finance Ministers Mahinda Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa, bear responsibility for Sri Lanka\u2019s severe economic crisis and had thereby violated the fundamental rights of the people by mismanaging the economy between 2019 and 2022.",
    "It calls for the revocation of civic rights of the individuals deemed responsible for the country\u2019s financial crisis. It advocates denying them further state-sponsored benefits and seeking compensation for the 2.2 million people adversely affected by the country\u2019s economic downfall."
