    "A masterful double century that put Abdullah Shafique in elite company and a rapid Agha Salman hundred drove Pakistan into an overwhelming position of strength in the second Test against Sri Lanka at the Sinhalese Sports Club grounds.",
    "As Sri Lanka\u2019s bowlers laboured hard for the occasional scrap of a reward, Pakistan plundered 385 runs in 93 overs yesterday, amassing 563 for 5 at day three stumps.",
    "In hindsight, the hosts would probably be happy they had not been on the field on Tuesday, when rain reduced day\u2019s play to 10 overs, or the 397-run lead that Pakistan currently have at hand could have bordered on astronomical.",
    "It will be a painful reminder to the hosts of the batting friendly nature of the SSC pitches and just how many runs they had left out on the field as a result of their first innings, self-inflicted implosion.",
    "Shafique was Pakistan\u2019s mainstay, having started the day on 87 and reaching his maiden double ton in the final session of play \u2013 joining the rarefied company of Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar in becoming just the third overseas batsman to score a double century at the SSC.",
    "Contributions from Agha Salman, scoring his second ton, and Saud Shakeel ensured that it would not be the lone fight as they capitalized on bowling that progressively faded and ran out of ideas through the day, Pakistan increasing their scoring rate from 2.92 in the first session to 4.43 after lunch and 5.03 in the evening.",
    "The emergence of turn at the start of the day would have come as encouragement for the home team\u2019s spinners, though it was the lack of it that earned Sri Lanka its first wicket for the day.",
    "Jayasuriya \u2013 continuing a marathon first spell which started on Monday, spanned the ten overs played on day two and carried through the whole of the first session and beyond \u2013 bested Babar Azam for the third time in three innings, as the Pakistan captain lunged forward anticipating spin, only to be rapped on the pads by a delivery that didn\u2019t deviate in course.",
    "Azam\u2019s review of the decision only confirmed that the on-field umpire had been correct and ended an 89-run partnership with Shafique.",
    "Jayasuriya would have had a second wicket had Nishan Madushka held on to a dying catch at short leg \u2013 a tough chance but the kind that Pakistan\u2019s fielders have held onto all series \u2013 that would have dismissed Shakeel for 17.",
    "Shafique stood firm though, taking Pakistan to lunch on 273 for 3 and a lead of 107, notching his fourth Test ton along the way.",
    "The next reward fell in Sri Lanka\u2019s favour 12 overs after lunch when Asitha Fernando trapped Shakeel leg before wicket for 51, ending a 109-run fourth-wicket partnership.",
    "A 25-run stand between Shafique and Sharfraz Ahmed ensued, before the latter was hit on the head by a bouncer and retired hurt.",
    "That brought Agha Salman to the crease, the catalyst in Pakistan's uptick in scoring through the final two sessions, reaching his half century in 62 balls and his century in 123 deliveries.",
    "In between that, Shafique reached his double century, perhaps exercising the most attrition in his innings in 32 balls he took to move from 190 to 200, but a dogged knock was ended when an attempted hoick over long off was taken by Dilshan Madushanka.",
    "Another century stand, this time between Salman and Mohammad Rizwan, on as a concussion substitution for Ahmed, beckoned before stumps were drawn, though it appears possible no more runs will be added to their 95-run stand, if Pakistan opt for an overnight declaration."
