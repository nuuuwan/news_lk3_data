    "A statement issued by the Ministry of Finance further elaborates:",
    "\u201cOn April 3, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the imposition of universal tariffs on goods imported from countries around the world. While the minimum rate was set at 10%, higher tariffs were applied to certain countries, with Sri Lanka initially facing a tariff of 44%. This policy was met with strong opposition globally, with China warning of countermeasures if the tariffs were not revoked. The European Union also pledged united opposition.",
    "In this context, the Sri Lankan government promptly initiated negotiations with the U.S. Trade Representative to seek revised agreements. Sri Lanka remained hopeful, and on July 12, the United States formally notified Sri Lanka of a new tariff proposal reducing the rate to 30%. It was subsequently agreed that Sri Lanka would continue discussions with the USTR to further reduce this rate.",
    "Accordingly, today\u2019s virtual discussions will be chaired by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, with participation from relevant officials.\u201d"
