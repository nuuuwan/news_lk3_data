    "Sampath Bank has been recognised as Sri Lanka\u2019s Best Bank for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2025. The award was ceremonially presented in Singapore, positioning Sampath Bank among a distinguished group of global and regional banking and financial institutions recognised for embedding sustainability into their core strategies and creating long term value for all stakeholders.",
    "The Bank\u2019s submission to Euromoney highlighted key milestones achieved in 2024, including channelling Rs.1.44 billion ($4.78 million) into renewable energy projects through its green financing programme, launching solar loan concessions to increase access to clean energy, and equipping 1,418 employees and board members with ESG training. These internal initiatives contributed to an 8% reduction in the Bank\u2019s carbon footprint and a 36% increase in solar power generation through branch network. Sampath Bank also introduced recyclable metal credit cards to reduce plastic usage while strengthening its wider waste reduction programmes.",
    "Commenting on this achievement, Sanjaya Gunawardana, Managing Director Designate of Sampath Bank, stated, \u201cBeing recognised as Sri Lanka\u2019s Best Bank for ESG by Euromoney is a defining moment for Sampath Bank. This honour reflects our deep commitment to sustainability as a core pillar of our business and our responsibility to the nation. Our efforts in corporate governance, green financing, product innovation and capacity building are not short-term projects but long-term commitments to shaping a more sustainable future for Sri Lanka. This recognition is a tribute to the dedication of our team, our valued customers and our stakeholders who continue to walk this journey with us.\u201d",
    "Sampath Bank\u2019s recognition also stems from its flagship CSR initiatives, including \u2018Wewata Jeewayak\u2019 to restore traditional reservoirs for farming communities, \u2018A Breath to the Ocean\u2019 to restore coral reefs, as well as turtle conservation and mangrove restoration projects. Alongside a tree-planting programme with 88 schools and a strong focus on green financing and renewable energy, these efforts demonstrate the Bank\u2019s deep-rooted commitment to sustainability and ESG integration.",
