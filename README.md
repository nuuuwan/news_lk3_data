### Has the new Government already violated its own principles?

*2024-09-27 05:33:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Has-the-new-Government-already-violated-its-own-principles/4-767227) · `en`

This is the first time NPP has got the opportunity and people are watching critically to see whether it is able to deliver on promises

The new NPP Government came to power in a momentous change of the political landscape of Sri Lanka. For the first time a simple village folk has become the President. It is great to see the change of guard. We should genuinely wish Anura Kumara Dissanayaka the strength and focus to deliver on promises.

AKD appears to be highly focused and his rise to power came in the midst of rampant corruption and abuse of power by most politicians of the previous governments, and quite rightly, the NPP highlighted those abominations and depravities, pledging to eradicate them, bring the perpetrators to justice, and steer the country towards a just and fair society. The people were so distressed and despondent that they clearly wanted a system change. NPP offered that. People accepted it. It is now up to the NPP to deliver.

### A call to Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya: Lighten school bags, reform education

*2024-09-27 05:29:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-call-to-Prime-Minister-Dr-Harini-Amarasuriya-Lighten-school-bags-reform-education/4-767226) · `en`

Now we are witnessing some changes in the socio-economic context in Sri Lanka. There is a need for better integration of all sectors with proper alignment focusing on the advancement of our nation. In this context, the education sector is really important and there should be a serious discussion between all stakeholders in primary, secondary and tertiary education in Sri Lanka to decide the future landscape of Sri Lankan education.

In Sri Lanka today, it’s not uncommon to see a student weighing 24 kilos carrying a schoolbag that weighs 10 kilos! I consider this as one measurement to indicate the disaster of our education system. Most of the children coming under the category of grade six to 10 have around eight subjects per day questioning whether Sri Lankan educationists have done the justice for our next generation (which we need to discuss in a separate article).

### 2024: The change and the choice

“They tried to bury us. They did not know we were seeds.” — Anura Kumara Dissanayake

The 2024 Sri Lankan Presidential election results have displayed a significant change in the decades-long distribution of political party alignment among the Sri Lankan people. This transformation showcases the desperation of Sri Lankans to choose a leader free from crimes and corruption. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a veteran politician and the leader of the National People’s Power (NPP), has won the election, dominating the majority of votes in 14 out of 22 districts.

This election marked a historic moment, electing the first leftist leader as President from a socialist and social democratic political alliance. It demonstrates that most Sri Lankans are shifting away from traditional party politics to focus on a leader who can truly relate to and understand the hearts and minds of ordinary people.

### FAQ: Understanding the myths and challenges around debt restructuring

Clearly, the IMF program is based on a flawed DSA with a problematic end-goal of Sri Lanka accessing commercial markets by 2027

Sri Lanka has just elected a new President amidst a deepening economic crisis. The people have provided a clear mandate for change and relief from the economic distress pervading their lives.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has taken over at a crucial time. Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its history in 2022, and is now in the middle of an IMF program, and a debt restructuring process that are predicated on austerity and repayment of the larger share of past debt to the creditors. How should Sri Lanka approach debt restructuring and the IMF’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) with parameters for reduced public spending and minimal debt relief? This FAQ zooms into the ongoing IMF program, debt restructuring process and options before Sri Lanka.

The European Union (EU), with its vast market of over 448 million consumers, has always been a key destination for Sri Lankan apparel exports. Known for its high-quality and ethically produced garments, Sri Lanka has secured a strong foothold in this competitive space. However, new sustainability and labelling requirements introduced by the EU present both challenges and opportunities for Sri Lankan apparel manufacturers. This feature explores the evolving regulatory landscape, the hurdles Sri Lankan companies face, and the benefits of complying with these changes.

The EU has been a leader in promoting sustainability, transparency, and traceability in global supply chains, particularly in the garment industry, where environmental and social concerns are prevalent. Regulations such as the EU Textile Regulation, the Digital Product Passport (DPP) initiative, and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act aim to ensure that imported goods meet stringent environmental and ethical standards.
