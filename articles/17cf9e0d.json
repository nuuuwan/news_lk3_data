  "original_body_lines": [
    "The current prices of Sri Lankan graphite are significantly high; key avenues can be explored to bring them down and one such is by reducing the depth of operation.",
    "The industry representatives stress that the high prices of local graphite are due to the depth of the deposits in the few operational mines within",
    "\u201cReducing the depth of operation to 10-20m from the surface could considerably lower the cost of mining, which can be done by expanding mining operations to new mines, provided adequate regulations are in place,\u201d said Bogala Graphite PLC CEO Amila Jayasinghe.",
    "He shared his views during a discussion facilitated by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) that highlighted the challenges and opportunities in Sri Lanka\u2019s graphite industry.",
    "He noted that the challenges such as the transparency of the process to obtain mining permissions from the relevant authorities deter the potential foreign investment.",
    "\u201cThe royalty fee for value-added graphite in Sri Lanka encourages the export of raw graphite to foreign anode producers, as it is cheaper, which is not beneficial to the local producer,\u201d\u00a0said Jayasinghe.",
    "According to Prof. Anura Wijayapala from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic advantage lies in upstream value chain products within the electric vehicle market.",
    "While the current graphite content of Sri Lanka is around 1.5 million tonnes, which is not adequate to meet the US demand, Sri Lanka could benefit from the high market prices for graphite by branding Sri Lankan graphite as better quality and produced through environmentally friendly and sustainable practices,\u00a0he said.",
    "Sri Lankan graphite production is comparatively a green process. Certain other manufacturing industries in Sri Lanka are already making use of the renewable energy usage to market their products to the environmentally\u00a0conscious buyers.",
    "About 50 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity is renewable and the greenhouse gas emission in Sri Lanka is also comparatively low compared to many other countries, which may help label Sri Lanka\u2019s graphite as \u201cgreen graphite\u201d.",
    "The IPS in its study titled \u2018Trade Wars in Electric Vehicle Supply Chains: A Win for Sri Lanka\u2019s Graphite Industry?\u2019 stated that success for the Sri Lankan graphite industry hinges on competitive positioning, strategic international partnerships and green manufacturing practices.",
    "\u201cAs the electric vehicle market continues to expand, Sri Lanka\u2019s graphite industry could indeed emerge as a key player in the global supply chain, provided it navigates the path with strategic foresight and innovation,\u201d the IPS\u00a0study revealed."
