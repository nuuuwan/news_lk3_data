    "Accuses Govt. of curtailing social welfare benefits accorded to those with special needs, chronic kidney disease and other illnesses",
    "Claims many injustices have also been committed when choosing beneficiaries for the Aswesuma program",
    "Says Aswesuma is a short-term political campaign leading to presidential poll",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Media Spokesman and Deputy National Organiser S.M. Marikkar yesterday slammed the Government\u2019s new social welfare program \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 calling it a mere blindfold.",
    "He said the Government has curtailed the Samurdhi benefit of the poor to implement the Aswesuma program instead to deceive the people. He said many injustices have also been committed when choosing beneficiaries for the new program.",
    "\u201cIn a country where the people are struggling under the weight of the cost of food, water and electricity tariffs, in a country where the children\u2019s education has been destroyed the Government has now introduced yet another blindfold called Aswesuma,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP revealed that social welfare benefits provided to those with special needs, chronic kidney disease and other illnesses have been curtailed as a result of the new program.",
    "\u201cThe Samurdhi has also been affected. The needy who benefitted from the Samurdhi has been removed from the Aswesuma list while those who are not in need of social welfare have been listed as Aswesuma beneficiaries,\u201d he claimed.",
    "Marikkar called the Aswesuma program a mere \u2018political campaign\u2019 and claimed it would only last until the presidential election. \u201cSamurdhi was a long-term program. But this is a political campaign. We would also like to question how this program was carried out with only the participation of university students and development officers and without the support of Grama Seva officers,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said the SJB is prepared to rally the underprivileged who have been left out of the Aswesuma program and against the injustices committed against them. \u201cThis political system needs to be changed. This requires a team with abilities and skills, as well as a team with a leader who is sensitive to the people. The SJB is the only group in existence that is capable of this,\u201d he claimed."
