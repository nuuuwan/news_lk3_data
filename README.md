### Why are boys falling behind in education and what can we do about it?

Parent and teacher attitudes and aspirations may differ with harder sanctions for boys or inadvertent rewarding for lower effort because ‘boys will be boys’

Females comprised 64% of all state university enrolments for medicine, dentistry, law, science, IT, education, management and arts

Even at the primary school level, girls’ attainment outperforms boys’ with cut-off marks for grade 5 scholarship entrance exams consistently higher for prestigious girls’ schools compared to boys’ schools

But the trend is reversed in the workplace where men earn on average more than women for every level of education in Sri Lanka in every occupational category; the disparity is a symptom of deeper structural issues

Integrating work-related initiatives into the curriculum, such as vocational training, work placements or entrepreneurial opportunities that come with a stipend or other incentive, may be a way to show that learning is worthwhile

However, other sources denied any such move and said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured that elections would be held.

Colombo, May 29 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who cannot win the presidential election will never go for a referendum, National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

He told the media in Colombo that if Ranil Wickremesinghe could win the referendum, he would definitely go for the presidential election.

Dissanayake said they are trying to create confusion in the society as Ranil Wickremesinghe and Basil Rajapaksa have no plans or vision for the election.

"The other political groups are already engaged in election campaigns. Ranil Wickremesinghe and Basil Rajapaksa have no plans or vision for the election. So, they want to create confusion in society. They created news that Parliament will be dissolved. UNP MP Vajira Abeywardane said once that Ranil should be given ten years,” he said.

He said it is not good to insult the Constitution and people's mandate and create confusion in the society for their cheap political ends.

The President reaffirmed the scheduled timing for the presidential election, set by the Constitution, during a recent cabinet meeting, ensuring no changes this year.

The United National Party has not made any decision to mark the election. The idea of ​​backing the election was Range Bandara's personal opinion, said Saman Ratnapriya, the President's Trade Union Director General and former United National Party (UNP) Member of Parliament.

He said this while speaking to the media after an event in Colombo on Wednesday (29).

His personal opinion is that the General Secretary of the United National Party Range Bandara has said that the presidential and parliamentary elections should be held two years later.

That is not the position of the United National Party. The United National Party has not made any such resolution.

### In Mayilathamaduwu

*2024-05-29 15:16:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184786) · `ta`

In Mayilathamadu, Batticaloa, ongoing injustices against immigrants involve police complicity, livestock theft, and violence. This issue, rooted in a long history of livestock farming, escalated during planned settlements from 2013 to 2016. The Tamil National Alliance opposed these actions, leading to legal challenges. The situation worsened under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's governance, with farmers resorting to hiding their livestock due to threats and inadequate food supply. Over 1400 cattle have died, and four departments allegedly deceive farmers. The government's economic crisis exacerbates the problem, risking the destruction of native breeds and potential importation of foreign cattle. This scenario is seen as a form of political manipulation aimed at fostering communal conflict for political gain. Efforts to address these issues, including international outreach and legal actions, have yielded limited results, with continued atrocities against the immigrants.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that financial allocations have already been allocated.

Once a law passed in the England parliament, no one can interrogate. That was the foundation of the supremacy of Parliament. The Parliament is the Parliament.

American method is different. By the American methodology, when they drafted some law, they gave the executive powers to the executive powers and the Congress Congress and the Court of Justice.

We maintain the English method because our country does not follow a federal way.. But we are not a federal country. Parliament is the final powers of the country's legislation.
