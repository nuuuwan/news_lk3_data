    "Following is a response to Tisaranee Gunasekara\u2019s article, \u2018Political monk: Disciple or destroyer\u2019, which was published in the Daily FT on 7 June",
    "The third paragraph of Tisaranee Gunasekara\u2019s piece contains the heart of her argument \u2013 it\u2019s the content and not the packaging that matters \u2013 and her quote wraps it up very nicely indeed.",
    "The absolute untruths trotted out to defend the indefensible is epitomised by the statement that US foreign policy is being determined at the current time by what some deranged Sri Lankan politician utters, as if some \u201cpolitical establishment\u201d in the developed world is waiting with bated breath for the denouement being trotted out as some sort of \u201cfact\u201d by some Sri Lankan \u201cpundit\u201d before they issue a response of any substance!",
    "The unfortunate reality, though, is that \u201cbig lies\u201d have a habit of receiving credibility in some quarters and staying \u201ccurrent.\u201d This appears to be one of those occasions. There are constant reminders of this fact on, virtually, a daily basis. The practical implications of this state of affairs are only too evident with what has emerged in the matter of the controversy swirling around the utterances of that robed master of purple-prose, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, back in the business of issuing headline-grabbing threats/promises in the public domain, in this instance alleging a \u201cWestern conspiracy\u201d afoot to destroy that bastion of Buddhist civilisation, Sri Lanka.",
    "Is it going to take nothing less than a complete re-set of the broader political discussion to facilitate a return to sanity in political discourse? And, if this is the reality facing us, is such a re-set achievable?",
    "It would be easy enough to claim that Sri Lanka has too long a history of democratic governance to descend into the swamp that is at our feet and into which we are being pushed, but we have seen too many instances of this very fate befalling seemingly established democracies to believe that we would be the singular exception!"
