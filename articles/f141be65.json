    "Even just about a couple of decades ago, it was quite common to see our children fall victim to certain serious infectious diseases, over which we had very little control. Illnesses such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox and typhoid were rampant and seemed to rule the roost. There were regular mass epidemics of some of these nasty diseases, which occurred with disconcerting regularity.",
    "Some of these diseases killed children, while others left them severely disabled. For some of these diseases, like polio, there was no specific treatment either. In fact, just a few decades ago, the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, our premier medical institution for children, provided designated wards to look after some of these diseases, the wards being labelled as Diphtheria Ward, Polio Ward, etc. These are really things of the past now as a result of measures taken to prevent the occurrence of these dreaded diseases by successful immunisation, which to the general public means vaccinations.",
    "The Sri Lankan Ministry of Health started the Immunisation Programme all those long years ago to try and control the unfortunate occurrence of some of these diseases. Initially, the entire enterprise was viewed with some suspicion by the general population, and it took some time to build up confidence in the programme. Gradually, people started to join in and vaccinate their children. With time, the programme evolved into the present day Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) of the Ministry of Health.",
    "The success of any preventive programme depends on the proportion of the vulnerable population that elects to join the programme. Today we can boast of over 90 per cent coverage of all children by the EPI. The parents of our children have taken it to their hearts to immunise the children. This is truly a wonderful example of the successful implementation of a partnership programme between the government and the people of a country. Our EPI is today extolled by many authorities in the world, including the World Health Organisation, as a role model for most developing countries. The tremendous success of this programme has led to the virtual elimination of diseases such as diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio and measles from our country. The immunisations are recorded in a comprehensive booklet known as The Child Health Development Record (CHDR), which is issued free to every newborn baby by the Ministry of Health. Vaccination is now well established as a vital cog in the wheel of successful child care.",
    "The National Programme of Immunisation starts with the BCG vaccination at birth. This vaccine works against tuberculosis, particularly the more severe types that affect the brain, joints, bones and kidneys. It is given as a simple injection into the skin of the left upper arm near the shoulder within the first 48 hours after birth. We have the great advantage of over 95 per cent of births occurring in either public or private hospitals, and thus administration of BCG to all these babies is that much easier. The vaccination site comes up like a bump and even a blister within a couple of weeks, and sometimes opens up as a shallow ulcer, which heals leaving a scar. It is important to document the presence of a scar in the Immunisation Record component of the Child Health Development Record, as this scar fades off with time in a small percentage of children. If the vaccine does not produce a scar, it should be repeated within the first six months of life.",
    "Next set of vaccines to be administered are the triple, hepatitis B and polio vaccines. The first doses are administered at the age of two months. The triple vaccine covers the baby against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. These are given by a single injection. So is the hepatitis B vaccine. The Ministry of Health added the Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) vaccine some time ago. This bacterium causes rather severe infections of the brain, lungs and ears of children. The polio vaccine is administered by mouth. All these vaccines have to be repeated again at ages 4, 6 and 18 months to provide full protection for the baby. All the diseases against which these vaccines work are serious problems and were major killers in the past. Diphtheria, tetanus and polio have been eradicated from the country as a result of these vaccinations.",
    "At present, the baby is administered the combined Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine at nine months and 3 years of age. These protect the child against these diseases, which were major causes of morbidity and some mortality in the past. Measles is a very rare disease now, and rubella is well under control. Rubella, when transmitted to pregnant mothers, produces major congenital malformations in the unborn baby. In many countries, children getting rubella is a potential source of infection for other pregnant mothers as well and this is the main reason that children are be immunised against this disease. There were some concerns regarding the alleged association of MMR vaccine with childhood autism sometime in the past. It was a terrible fiasco created by an unscrupulous and dishonest socotr from a Western country. It is now firmly established on very strong scientific evidence that there is no such link between MMR vaccine and autism. That canard has now been finally buried for good. This vaccine has, in fact been used in Sri Lanka for many years without any problems.",
    "Now there is a vaccine that is administered at one year for the prevention of Japanese Encephalitis, a type of brain fever. Currently, this vaccine is given as a single dose, which provides adequate protection after just one dose. This is a significant advance in the development of immunisation in the country. Japanese Encephalitis was a major problem earlier and killed half of those who were affected and left a quarter with permanent brain damage. Booster doses of diphtheria, tetanus and oral polio vaccines are administered later at 5\u2013year intervals. The rationale behind these additional doses is to enhance the immunity and provide continuing protection for the child right up to adult life.",
    "In addition to all these vaccines which are provided free by the Ministry of Health, there are additional optional vaccines which are currently available only in the private sector. Some of them are quite expensive but these will provide additional protection against some other important diseases. There are vaccines against typhoid, hepatitis A, chicken pox, mumps, Japanese encephalitis, meningococcal disease and illnesses caused by pneumococci. Chicken pox is generally considered to be a kind of \u2018customary disease\u2019 or a part and parcel of childhood. In very many cases, it does not cause serious problems in children. However, a child or an adolescent could get chicken pox at some of the most inconvenient times such as before examinations and prior to competitive sporting events. In children who have not had chicken pox as an illness, the vaccine is really worthwhile but it has to be given well before contracting the disease.",
    "All these vaccines must be transported and stored properly, as otherwise they lose their potency and effectiveness. One particularly important constituent of this process is the maintenance of the proper \u201ccold chain\u201d. This refers to the exact low temperatures at which these vaccines have to be stored to maintain their potency. The low temperatures at which they have to be stored are specified for each vaccine. In all institutions, whether big or small, where vaccines are stored, stringent measures, including back-up power supplies to refrigerators, should be instituted to address this issue even during power disruptions.",
    "Our Sri Lankan government spends a great deal of money and provides all vaccines in the Expanded National Immunisation Programme, to safeguard the health of our children. At the point of administration, these vaccinations are provided completely free to the general population. Indeed, we are the envy of many countries in the world on the strength of our commitment to free health care.",
    "However, there are minor problems, molehills blown out of all proportion, and various types of undue publicity, regarding some of these vaccines, triggered by isolated untoward incidents that have occurred in some parts of the country as well as in other countries. In addition, many myths regarding unconfirmed undesirable effects of vaccines on fertility and other aspects of the health of children have produced a growing group of parents who oppose all forms of vaccinations; the so-called \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d or vaccine-hesitant people. Unfortunately, sensation-seeking media reports, along with misinformation and disinformation, have contributed to jeopardising the very core of one of the most successful programmes in the annals of our National Health Service.",
    "This author has gone through several epidemics of many of these diseases and seen firsthand the intolerable anguish caused to the parents and families by these diseases. It breaks his heart now to see some interested people and families carrying out a campaign against vaccines. If only they could have seen even an iota of the misery caused by these diseases, as witnessed by this author in the past, they would not campaign against immunisation. We have seen some horrendous suffering, deaths and long-term disabilities meted out by some of these diseases even in the second half of the last century.",
    "In the long run, the glittering successes achieved by the EPI are testimony to the effectiveness, validity and veracity of the programme. There is no other endeavour of any ministry of successive governments since independence that could boast of such spectacular results as those achieved by this programme. In fact, our country has been cited on numerous occasions by the global community as a role model of fantastically successful immunisation. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the International Children\u2019s Charter, and the provision of good healthcare is a hallowed right of children as enshrined in that charter. The Expanded Programme of Immunisation is just one venture that was designed and initiated by the Ministry of Health to honour that commitment to our children, whom we all consider to be the jewels of our resplendent isle.",
    "Finally, many publications have quipped, \u201cvaccines do not save lives but vaccination certainly does.\u201d What it means is that vaccines have to be properly administered for them to save lives.",
