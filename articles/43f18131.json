    "The Foreign Affairs Ministry said yesterday that Sri Lanka deposited its Instrument of Ratification for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) with the United Nations on Tuesday formally becoming a State Party to the convention. The ratification of the BBNJ Agreement marks another milestone in Sri Lanka\u2019s continued legacy of leadership in ocean governance, the Ministry said.",
    "Sri Lanka has played an instrumental role in international maritime governance, most notably through its leadership in the development of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).",
    "Sri Lanka actively engaged in the negotiation of the BBNJ Agreement since inception of discussions.",
    "\u201cAs a developing country, Sri Lanka is proud to be part of this historic journey to internationally recognise equitable access to and protection of ocean resources for the benefit of humanity. Sri Lanka, along with other developing nations, views the Agreement\u2019s implementation as a means to enhance conservation and the sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction,\u201d the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.",
    "It added: \u201cBy ratifying the BBNJ Agreement, Sri Lanka will have the opportunity to benefit from fair and equitable sharing of resources such as marine genetic resources (MGRs) and digital sequence information (DSI) from areas beyond national jurisdiction. The Agreement also prioritises capacity building and the transfer of marine technology, empowering developing countries like Sri Lanka to enhance its capabilities in conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity\u201d.",
    "Moreover, the Agreement will also enable Sri Lanka to work collectively with other nations to protect biodiversity, build climate resilience, and advance Sustainable Development Goals, the Ministry said."
