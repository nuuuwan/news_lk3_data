    "Take one tablespoon of orange peel powder and two tablespoons of yoghurt. Mix well. Apply on face and wash off after 20 minutes. This is an instant rejuvenating face pack which you can apply before a party or any big event.",
    "Take one tablespoon of orange peel powder, just a pinch of cosmetic turmeric, and one tablespoon of natural honey. Mix everything well into a fine paste. Apply on face and neck, and wash off after 5 to 10 minutes with any gentle face cleanser or rose water. Try not to use this on acne prone skin but if you decide to do so then follow it up with an acne skin face pack. Use this face wash over a period of time to remove stubborn tan.",
