    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will attend an all-party conference called by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on devolving power to the provinces as a solution to the island nation\u2019s decades-long ethnic issue, while a number of smaller parties have announced a boycott.",
    "The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is set to meet Wednesday afternoon ahead of the conference scheduled for 5.30pm to decide on the nature of its participation while the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has said it will attend the event but will walk out if the exercise turns out to be a political gimmick. The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has decided to boycott the event while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and a number of other opposition parties have said they plan to attend.",
    "Of the Tamil parties, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Thamil Makkal Thesiya Kuttani (TMTK) led by Jaffna district MP and former Northern Province Chief Minister C V Vigneswaran have confirmed their attendance, while MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam\u2019s Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF) will be absent.",
    "The party leaders\u2019 meeting will focus on the full implementation of the 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution, a devolution mechanism sponsored by India going back over 30 years. President Wickremesinghe was in India over the weekend, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had impressed upon him India\u2019s wishes to see the amendment\u2019s full implementation, which would include devolving police powers to the provinces, a contentious issue in Sri Lanka\u2019s south.",
    "According to MP Vigneswaran, President Wickremesinghe is keen on implementing the 13th amendment and is open to discussing police powers though he had initially indicated that police powers would be off the table.",
    "Sri Lanka president keen on 13A, open to discussing police powers: VigneswaranSee more",
    "Opposition and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa said speaking at an event that his party has agreed to attend the conference for the people.",
    "\u201cBut during the talks, if we feel that this is of no use to the country and is a usual political \u201cgilmart\u201d, we will not hesitate to walk out,\u201d he said.",
    "Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader Mano Ganesan said speaking at a separate event that, historically, solutions to the ethnic issue proposed by the United National Party (UNP) were opposed by the rival SLFP and vice versa. The TPA, which is part of an alliance led by the SJB, does not wish to \u201cplay that game\u201d, said Ganesan.",
    "The MP said that President Wickremesinghe\u2019s real challenge is to get the SLPP to agree, given that SLPP secretary general Sagara Kariyawasam has already said the president does not have the mandate to implement a solution to the problem.",
    "The SLPP, which is reportedly divided over a number of issues including its support for President Wickremesinghe\u2019s reform agenda, appears to be in two minds about his proposed solution to the ethnic issue as well.",
    "SLPP member S M Chandrasena said at a press conference at the party headquarters on Tuesday July 25 that it is not prudent for political parties to boycott an all party conference before seeing for themselves what is up for discussion.",
    "\u201cParties can attend and see if what is being discussed is good or not and then if they want they can oppose it and leave,\u201d said Chandrasena, accusing the opposition of opposing everything for the sake of opposing it.",
    "The nationalist-oriented SLPP and its membership over the years before the party\u2019s inception have historically adopted a hawkish position with regard to the national question, critics say. President Wickremesinghe, as noted by Ganesan, does have the challenge of getting the party on board with his vision.",
    "Meanwhile, the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) which has always stood for minority rights and spoken in favour of addressing legitimate grievances of the Tamil community, has also decided to boycott the all-party conference.",
    "NPP legislator Vijitha Herath called the event a sham, adding that the government must first ensure there is consensus within it over the matter of the 13th amendment to the constitution.",
    "\u201cWhat do Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and [former president] Mahinda Rajapaksa think about these solutions? There is no point talking to other parties without building consensus within the government first,\u201d said Herath speaking to reporters.",
    "\u201cThrowing a party around an empty piece of paper is not the solution to the national question. We won\u2019t join such a pointless discussion and waste our time,\u201d he said.",
    "Nalin Hewage of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) told reporters that the president plans to use this exercise to win Tamil votes to secure a victory at an upcoming presidential election. The Marxist-Leninist JVP is the main constituent party of the NPP.",
    "The Pivithuru Hela Urumya (PHU) and the National Freedom Front (NFF), two nationalist parties who had until recently been prominent members of SLPP-SLFP-led governments, have said they will join the conference.",
    "PHU leader Udaya Gammanipla told reporters that his party will \u201ctake part and use the event as a platform to expose the conspiracy to destroy the peace brough the sacrifices of our war heroes.\u201d",
    "NFF legislator Mohammed Muzzamil told reporters that \u201cnow is not the time\u201d for talks on the ethnic issue and that the government must instead focus its efforts on Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing economic crisis.",
    "A key focus of Wednesday\u2019s all-party conference will be devolving police powers to the provinces. According to Vigenswaran, President Wickremesinghe is open to discussing how police powers can be shared. One proposal, said Vigeswaran, is to explore the possibility of forming a provincial police force without weapons.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and",
    "Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment would see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more hardline parties. In February, sections of the Buddhist clergy took to the streets against the proposed full implementation of the constitutional amendment. (Colombo/Jul26/2023)"
