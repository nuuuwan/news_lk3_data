### Death toll in Gaza Strip from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000, Palestinians say

The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours.

The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2% of Gaza’s entire prewar population of about 2.3 million.

Anura bothered about his mother seeing his school report before he did

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar, by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

In 1960, as she rode to power, after a grueling campaign, as the world’s first-ever woman prime minister, Sirima Bandaranaike was making the global headlines and taking Ceylon too into the limelight, which was to last for decades. The world wondered as to how this phenomenon, of a woman being chosen to be prime minister, had occurred in Ceylon. Was it some peculiar provision of dynastic succession by which the wife succeeded to a vacancy caused by the death of a husband Could such a thing occur only in an Asian country? Was it, as uncharitable political opponents would say, a consequence of the enormous wave of sympathy that followed close on the tragic death of a popular leader? Was the phenomenon connected mystically with the primacy of motherhood’ (matar) so central a part of the culture of the Indian subcontinent?

### The Silence of the Speaker and other matters

*2024-12-16 11:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-silence-of-the-speaker-and-other-matters/) · `en`

It is more than two weeks since the matter of the Speaker, Asoka Ranwala’s doctorate, or lack of it, was raised in public. If he does have one, it is sufficient time for him to have produced the necessary evidence and laid to rest the ongoing speculation. When my daughter acquired a doctorate from a university in England, she was ceremoniously presented with an ornately inscribed scroll, on thick, parchment paper , along with a foolish hat.

To me, a non-academic, it seemed a paltry outcome for the several years of intense study which preceded the award but that, apparently, is how these systems work. Perhaps Waseda University of Japan, the institution alleged to have conferred the doctoral degree on Ranwala, does not emulate old-fashioned British institutions, but there still needs to be tangible, physical evidence of such an award, with which Ranwala came away from that institution.

ECONOMYNEXT – Germany is facing increased shortages in the labour market and is looking at India to fill that vacuum.

While the shortage is mostly in the healthcare, IT, and engineering sectors, the country is seeing an increased need for skilled workers in other trades too.

That success may lead to similar collaborations with other State governments such as Madya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

Germany is also fast becoming the country of choice for Indians pursuing higher studies.

Recent reports indicate that nearly 12.3 per cent (43, 000) of the international student body in Germany comprises Indians. They have now replaced Chinese students as the frontrunners.

During the last presidential election, there were various comments about the government's obtaining loans. However, some argue that the government is getting more debts. Some people respond that the government receives loans is acceptable. In this case, there are conflicting claims that the loans received in this position are to address the deficit of the budget, or to repay the loans we have already received.. Factcheck.lk clarifies three key questions about the Sri Lankan government's obtaining loans.

Governments get loans for three main reasons. First to make the main financial deficit. To pay off the second loans and interest. Third to pay maturity loans.

If the government is considering these three reasons for one thing, it is the total value of the debt that the government has to obtain every year. This is what we call the GFN (Gross Financing Need) total financial service.

Question - 02: 2024 How much did the government borrow?

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday pledged help from the bloc.
