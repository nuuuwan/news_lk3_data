    "All arrangements have been made for today\u2019s presidential election, and the public looks keener than ever to vote. A record voter turnout is expected, given the staggering intensity of the election campaigns, which concluded on Wednesday night, and the extremely high stakes political leaders and their parties have in the contest.",
    "This is the first election since the onset of the current economic crisis, and the people have waited for a long time to have themselves heard. Their decision will have a lasting impact on the economic recovery process and shape the future politico-economic trajectory of the country. Hence the need for the people to vote wisely without being swayed by populist appeals, rhetoric, promises, caste, ethnicity, religion and election gimmicks. If the economy goes into a tailspin again, its revival may not be possible, and the so-called interval in hell will come to an end sooner than expected.",
    "Economic recovery cannot occur in a volatile polity, and requires political stability, which is unattainable in a situation characterized by economic instability and unbearable hardships that drive the people to riot. Economic revival and political stability should go hand in hand for the country to come out of the present crisis.",
    "Public resentment resulting from unbearable economic problems and the violation of their democratic rights has a corrosive effect on political stability and therefore needs to be assuaged. It is hoped that the outcome of today\u2019s contest will have a calming effect on the irate populace.",
    "Unless the President to be elected, his party and their supporters act responsibly making an earnest effort to unify the polarized society, the task of rallying popular support for putting the economy back on an even keel will be even more uphill. But the battle lines drawn for the presidential contest and the alignment of political forces are likely to remain unchanged until the conclusion of the next parliamentary election, which is expected to be held soon. The much-delayed Local Government elections will also have to be held soon afterwards This is going to be Sri Lanka\u2019s longest-ever election period, and unless the key players in national politics act responsibly and strive to achieve reconciliation, their hostilities will stand in the way of the economic recovery process, which is already experiencing jolts and jerk due to the incumbent government\u2019s policy shifts and U-turns driven by its electoral concerns.",
    "Thankfully, all serious candidates in the fray have pledged to continue with the ongoing economic recovery efforts with the help of the IMF. This is a matter for relief, for there is no other way out, and the the IMF bailout programme has yielded some tangible results.",
    "The pre-election period has been free from violence, and this is something to be celebrated. However, everything possible must be done to ensure that the post-election period will also be peaceful. It is imperative that all political parties keep the unruly elements in their ranks on a tight leash. In a previous editorial comment, we pointed out how Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had managed a far more serious situation in 1994, when that year\u2019s regime change was expected to trigger a wave of political violence.",
    "The SLFP had borne the brunt of the UNP\u2019s spree of violence for 17 long years, and the worm had turned. The then newly-elected Prime Minister Kumaratunga transformed all grassroots organizations of her SLFP-led People\u2019s Alliance into peace committees and tasked them with ensuring the safety of everyone. Her strategy yielded the desired result. The political leaders who are contesting today\u2019s election ought to do likewise and make democracy the real winner.",
