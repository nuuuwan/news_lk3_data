### Principles and proposals for political and constitutional reform for democracy: Part I

*2024-07-26 03:24:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Principles-and-proposals-for-political-and-constitutional-reform-for-democracy-Part-I/14-764783) · `en`

An agenda for restoring democratic government calls for major changes in the Constitution as well as the system of government

2024 is a year of elections to choose a new President and possibly a new Parliament. In that context, the theme of political and constitutional reforms has once again begun to draw the attention of the citizens, civil society movements and political parties. It is necessary to recognise that any constitutional reform effort should have two main goals. They are (a) restoring the country’s parliamentary democracy and (b) replacing, not just reforming, the existing 1978 Constitution with a new and democratic constitution. A new constitution should also give effect to the democratising hopes of the people of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, an agenda for restoring democratic government calls for major changes in the Constitution as well as the system of government.

### Sri Lanka’s next President

*2024-07-26 03:16:30* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-next-President/4-764782) · `en`

A no holds barred critique on credentials of three favourites

There’s a political poster that’s been splashed on the walls of Colombo. Black letters on a yellow background mean that the author or the party cannot be identified. It is obviously a teaser campaign. It comes with a promise, which of course is the bread and butter of all politicians. Apparently, ‘the lie will come to an end,’ and on the 29th, the name of the messiah who will take all Sri Lankans to some yet-to-be-named promised land will be revealed.

This is the season for that kind of thing, so the timing is not bad at all. After all, people are talking about elections these days. They are wondering if elections will be held soon and, if so, whether it would be a presidential or parliamentary election. They talk about candidates, those who have announced their intentions and those who might very soon.

### Resource-rich, policy-poor: Sri Lanka’s flagging growth sectors

*2024-07-26 03:05:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Resource-rich-policy-poor-Sri-Lanka-s-flagging-growth-sectors/14-764781) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s agriculture and mineral policies need overhauling along with fresh thinking and national minded leadership

Sri Lanka sits on a wealth of resources, but let it all go to waste. Agriculture was one such historical natural strength in what used to be the ‘Pearl of the Indian Ocean,’ bringing fame and fortune from far and wide. Today, we import rice, coconuts and other agri-commodities – a far cry from former glory. Skewed agricultural policy perpetuated by the lack of political will burns holes in the future potential of an industry and our people.

### Fitch says lower generation costs support CEB’s tariff cut; no risk to IPP payments

*2024-07-26 03:03:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Fitch-says-lower-generation-costs-support-CEB-s-tariff-cut-no-risk-to-IPP-payments/14-764780) · `en`

Fitch Ratings said yesterday Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB, BB+(lka)/Stable) cash flow will stay adequate to service debt despite a 22.5% tariff cut from 16 July 2024.

Fitch does not expect the latest cut to affect the Sri Lankan electricity distributor’s payments to independent power producers (IPPs). Lower tariffs are supported by falling generation costs from CEB’s higher mix of hydropower and lower coal prices YoY. Financing costs will also fall amid lower market interest rates, Fitch said.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka’s instruction on the 22.5% average tariff cut, made during the regulator’s quarterly tariff review, was larger than the 10% proposed by CEB. However, generation costs have fallen in tandem with the rise in hydropower to 31% of the generation mix in 1H24 (1H23: 23%), while prices of coal, which fuels over 36% of the country’s generation mix, have dropped 32% YoY. Fitch expects thermal coal prices to fall 20% and 10% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.

### Do not underestimate the pain of Muslims

*2024-07-26 00:55:57* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/முஸ்லிம்களின்-வேதனையை-குறைத்து-மதிப்பிட-வேண்டாம்/175-341047) · `ta`

The government's decision to cremate Muslim COVID victims against religious beliefs sparked outrage. Critics argue it's naive to believe apologies alone can appease the community, suggesting deeper issues need addressing.

The community's pain and anger underscore the complexity of religious freedom and state policies during crises.

The Rajapakse government has taken steps to burn the Janasas of Muslim citizens who died in the Corona infection without any scientific resolution. The entire Muslim community was very upset by this decision of the government.It is foolish to think that the government can escape from the Muslim people to apologize to other Muslims.

The government has suddenly taken a resolution to protect the Rajapaksa from the crime and blame the authorities.. If the authorities had given the Alaration, not scientifically to burn the Janasas, who had taken the decision?

The death toll from landslides in a remote region of southern Ethiopia has risen to 257, the United Nations said on Thursday, warning that the number of victims could soar to 500.

Rescuers are pressing on with the grim search for bodies and survivors in the stricken locality of Kencho Shacha Gozdi, with crowds of distraught locals digging through a sea of mud often using just their bare hands and shovels.

“The death toll has risen to 257,” as of July 24, the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA said in statement citing local authorities. “The death toll is expected to rise to up to 500 people.”

OCHA said more than 15,000 people need to be evacuated because of the high risk of further landslides, including at least 1,320 children under the age of five and 5,293 pregnant women or new mothers.

Aid has begun arriving in the isolated, hard-to-reach area, including four trucks of life-saving supplies from the Ethiopian Red Cross Society, it said.

### Sri Lanka banks in talks about getting ISBs repaid in rupees: Sources

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s domestic banks are in talks with the government seeking repayment of their sovereign bonds in rupees, sources said though there are concerns over the likely impact on the exchange rate from such a move.

Out of 12,550 million dollars of sovereign bonds outstanding, about 1,750 million dollars of bonds are held by resident investors, the bulk of which are banks.

When a dollar asset is repaid in rupees, the banks have a negative foreign exchange position against the deposit liabilities called the net open position which has to be covered by purchasing dollars from the market.

By exchanging a rupee security, banks are hoping to reduce or avoid a haircut on the ISB holdings as they did in the case of Sri Lanka Development Bonds.

When Sri Lanka Development Bonds were repaid in rupees without a haircut, the central bank also provided some dollars in August 2023.

Calls for legal action against those responsible for the mishandling are also being made, highlighting the need for accountability and justice.

He was speaking at a debate on the State Financial Management and Economic Transfer Bill held in Parliament on Thursday (25).

The Rajapakse government has taken steps to burn the bodies of Muslim citizens who died in the Kovit infection without any scientific resolution.

The entire Muslim community was very painful by this decision of that government. The affected families are still aware of its pain.

It is a foolish thing for the government to think that the government can escape from the other Muslim people.

The government has suddenly made such a resolution to protect Rajapakse from the crime and blame the authorities.

If the authorities have been given the ally not scientifically to burn the bodies, who made the decision.
