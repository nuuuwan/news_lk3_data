### Sri Lankan jailed for 37 years for killing wife with axe in front of teenage children

*2024-12-19 10:32:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104348/sri-lankan-jailed-for-37-years-for-killing-wife-with-axe-in-front-of-teenage-children) ┬╖ `en`

A killer has been jailed for 37 years for murdering his wife with an axe in front of their teenage children, in what a judge has described as a brutal and horrific attack.

Dinush Kurera, 47, blinked and looked straight ahead as Victorian Supreme Court Justice Amanda Fox handed down his sentence today.

Kurera claimed he was acting in self-defence when he repeatedly stabbed his wife Nelomie Perera with an axe and knife at her Melbourne home on December 3, 2022.

But a jury rejected his story and in August found him guilty of murder after only three hours of deliberations.

Justice Fox described the fatal attack as brutal and horrific, saying Kurera had clearly been in a rage.

тАЬYou were motivated by anger and saw everything of the prism of entitlement and ownership,тАЭ she said in her sentence.

тАЬIn your mind, Nelomie deserved to be killed for leaving you, excluding you from your house and seeing other men.тАЭ

### Sri Lanka rupee depreciates to 292.70/293.00 to US dollar, bonds up

*2024-12-19 10:06:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-rupee-depreciates-to-292-70-293-00-to-us-dollar-bonds-up-195081/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs rupee depreciated steeply to 292.70/293.00 to the US dollar in the spot market, from 291.25/50 to the US dollar the previous day, while bond yields were up, dealers said.

Analysts had warned that if excess liquidity was allowed to build up, including from acquisition of dollars, the currency will weaken when they are used for imports as domestic prices are pushed up from higher demand.

If domestic demand and credit is pushed up from liquidity from central bank dollar rupee swaps the same consequence will happen as there was no commitment to defend the currency against excess liquidity under a so-called flexible exchange rate.

Flexible exchange rates, coupled with money printed to reach high cost of living targets, have triggered social unrest and also sovereign default in reserve collecting central banks.

A bond maturing on 15.09.2027 was quoted at 9.75/80 percent.

A bond maturing on 15.02.2028 was quoted at 10.10/15 percent.

It is meaningful to remind younger individuals that giving takes many formsтАФkindness, listening, perspective, and joy. While many children eagerly await gifts from the North Pole, it is important for them to recognise that the season encompasses much more than wrapped presents.
