    "The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) and Solidaridad, a civil society organisation, recently co-hosted a one-day workshop in Colombo to address the European Union\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).",
    "Introduced in 2023, the CSDDD requires companies in EU-bound supply chains to meet stringent environmental and human rights standards. While Sri Lankan suppliers are not directly mandated to comply, aligning with these standards is essential to remain competitive in the EU market, which accounts for 30% of Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel exports. Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and France collectively represent over 80% of these exports, further underscoring the importance of compliance.",
    "The workshop provided local businesses with actionable insights into risk assessment, sustainability metrics, and due diligence reporting, offering a roadmap to meet evolving global expectations.",
    "A significant outcome was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the JAAF and Solidaridad, establishing a strategic partnership to guide Sri Lankan suppliers in meeting the CSDDD requirements. This collaboration is set to enhance the industry\u2019s ability to maintain its status as a trusted supplier for brands prioritising sustainable sourcing.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka has always been ahead of the curve in meeting global standards, viewing sustainability and ethics as integral to business success,\u201d said JAAF Secretary-General Yohan Lawrence. \u201cThis workshop and our partnership with Solidaridad are critical steps in enabling Sri Lankan industries to adapt to changing global trade norms. By aligning with the CSDDD, we can secure our place as a key player in the global market.\u201d",
    "The event, attended by European dignitaries including Delegation for the EU to Sri Lanka and Maldives Deputy Head Lars Bredal and Mission for the Kingdom of the Netherlands Deputy Head Iwan Rutjens, highlighted the value of proactive engagement.\u00a0 The JAAF emphasised the importance of collaboration to support the apparel sector in understanding and implementing these new standards and thanks the Fabric and Apparel Accessory Manufacturers\u2019 Association (FAAMA), which is one of its members for their support in working behind the scenes on the program, as well as FAAMA Secretary Shahid Sangani for its support.",
    "By equipping the industry with the tools to address these challenges, the JAAF and Solidaridad aim to reinforce Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation as a leader in ethical and sustainable manufacturing, ensuring the country\u2019s competitiveness in global markets."
