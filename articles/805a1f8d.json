    "Israel announced Saturday that it is preparing to move Palestinians from combat zones to southern Gaza as plans move ahead for a military offensive in some of the territory\u2019s most populated areas.",
    "The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said the supply of tents to the territory would resume on Sunday. The military said it had no comment on when the mass movement of Palestinians would begin, but Defense Minister Israel Katz said on social media that \u201cwe are now in the stage of discussions to finalize the plan to defeat Hamas in Gaza.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, anxious families of Israeli hostages called for a \u201cnationwide day of stoppage\u201d in Israel on Sunday to express growing frustration over 22 months of war.",
    "Families of hostages fear the coming offensive further endangers the 50 hostages remaining in Gaza, just 20 of them thought to still be alive.",
    "They and other Israelis were horrified by the recent release of videos showing emaciated hostages speaking under duress and pleading for help and food.",
    "The families and supporters have pressed the government for a deal to stop the war \u2014 a call that some former Israeli army and intelligence chiefs have made as well in recent weeks.",
    "A group representing the families has urged Israelis into the streets on Sunday. \u201cAcross the country, hundreds of citizen-led initiatives will pause daily life and join the most just and moral struggle: the struggle to bring all 50 hostages home,\u201d it said in a statement.",
    "\u201cI want to believe that there is hope, and it will not come from above, it will come only from us,\u201d said Dana Silberman Sitton, sister of Shiri Bibas and aunt of Kfir and Ariel Bibas, who were killed in captivity.",

    "An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed a baby girl and her parents on Saturday, Nasser hospital officials and witnesses said. Motasem al-Batta, his wife and the girl were killed in their tent in the crowded Muwasi area.",
    "\u201cTwo and a half months, what has she done?\u201d neighbor Fathi Shubeir asked, sweating as temperatures in the shattered territory soared above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). \u201cThey are civilians in an area designated safe.\u201d",
    "Israel\u2019s military said it couldn\u2019t comment on the strike without more details. It said it is dismantling Hamas\u2019 military capabilities and takes precautions not to harm civilians.",
    "Muwasi is one of the heavily populated areas in Gaza where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel plans to widen the coming military offensive, along with Gaza City and \u201ccentral camps\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the built-up Nuseirat and Bureij camps in central Gaza.",
    "Israel may be using the threat to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages taken in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war.",

    "Another 11 malnutrition-related deaths occurred in Gaza over the past 24 hours, the territory\u2019s Health Ministry said Saturday, with one child among them. That brings malnutrition-related deaths during the war to 251.",
    "The United Nations is warning that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Palestinians are drinking contaminated water as diseases spread, while some Israeli leaders continue to talk openly about the mass relocation of people from Gaza.",
    "A 20-year old Palestinian woman described as being in a \u201cstate of severe physical deterioration\u201d died Friday after being transferred from Gaza to Italy for treatment, the hospital said Saturday.",

    "The U.N. human rights office says at least 1,760 people were killed while seeking aid between May 27 and Wednesday. It says 766 were killed along routes of supply convoys and 994 in the vicinity of \u201cnon-U.N. militarized sites,\u201d a reference to the Israeli-backed and U.S.-supported Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which since May has been the primary distributor of aid in Gaza.",
    "The U.S. State Department on Saturday said all visitor visas for people from Gaza are being stopped while a review is carried out of how \u201ca small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas\u201d were issued in recent days.",
    "The Hamas-led attack in 2023 killed around 1,200 people in Israel. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed 61,897 people in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.",
    "The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own"
