    "The Kandy Esala Perahera parades the streets of the Hill Capital to coincide with the eighth full moon poya of the year \u2013 the Esala Poya \u2013 in July/August. The change of date each year is because the lunar calendar is not parallel to the Gregorian calendar in use, since the full moon occurs every 28 days.",
    "The Kandy Perahera is a mix of culture, religion, historical tradition and of course a vast show, albeit imbued with dignity and splendour. It is the most ancient perahera, which combines the Dalada Maligawa procession with those of devales \u2013 Natha, Vishnu, Pathini and Kataragama devales. As time progressed, other temples and devales inaugurated their peraheras and thus we have several dotted all over the country. The next most ancient of these is the Kataragama Devale Perahera, which usually closely follows or precedes the Kandy procession. Coming into prominence as a tourist attraction is the procession in Colombo organised by the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya Vihara. Another well patronized perahera is of the Bellanwila Temple in a suburb of Colombo.",
    "Authority and power are epitomised by the Diyawadana Nilame (DN) \u2013 the chief of the Temple of the Tooth \u2013 and Basnayake Nilames of the other devales, who walk in their respective processions. They are truly majestic, dressed as they are in yards and yards of gold bordered silk cloth with huge waists and intricately sequined and gold embroidered jackets, also a hat and pointed shoes. Elaborate jewelry and a jewel studded small sword stuck in their waistbands complete their regalia. To signify their authority they have retainers who walk behind, one holding a white parasol, and dancers who precede them chanting respectful stanzas.",
    "The Kandy Esala Perahera has the longest history: an unbroken record since Maha Nuwara \u2013 Kandy \u2013 became the capital of the country\u2019s indigenous rulers and received royal patronage from the Kandyan King \u2013 Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1781). A Hindu element was introduced by the later kings of the Kandyan Kingdom who were of South Indian origin.",
    "Even during the height of World War II, when the South East Asia Command under Lord Louis Mountbatten was headquartered in Kandy, and a total blackout imposed countrywide, the Kandy Perahera was held, albeit in the precincts of the Maligawa.",
    "The religious significance is that originally it afforded an opportunity to the common man to pay homage to the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha, in the possession of the king. At present the tooth relic is not paraded; only a gold plated casket is carried by the most majestic tusker.",
    "Kandy turns into a seething mass of humanity which congregates by evening along the route of the procession which is changed daily by order of the Diyawadana Nilame.",
    "For the first five days, the short Kumbal Perahera moves within the temple square. Then on the sixth day starts the much grander Randoli Perahera with seven palanquins borne at the end of the procession; these having been the mode of travel of the ladies of state during the Kandyan Kingdom. On the final night, the entire city of Kandy turns into a blaze of colour, throbbing sound, smell of burning dried coconut and seething crowds. It is exotically resplendent with a veneer of mystique.",
    "Strikingly the procession is lit by men toting burning copra baskets which apart from illumination, keep the pachyderms from attempting tricks. Time was when they had no restraining chains binding their legs together. The elephants proceed in trios carrying minor chieftains on their backs and directed by mahouts. The babies get slightly naughty and restive and have to be kept in place. The larger have their legs, front and back, chained since one went berserk in 1964, causing pandemonium among the spectators who line the streets ten deep towards the last night of the procession. The Veterinary Department and Wildlife Protection Society place tranquiliser loaded guns in strategic positions.",
    "Drumming and dancing, conch and flute playing, distinctive from these arts of other regions of the country, introduce the culture of the Kandyans in a spectacular manner. Different types of drums are used; beaten either with a curved cane stick or the drummer\u2019s palm and fingers. Dancers range from Kandyan dancers in their distinctive costumes and dance steps to less elaborately dressed dancers who display different styles, like the lee keli and pantheri performers who use thin \u2018sticks\u2019 in dance formations. The dancers and drummers in their hundreds dance and drum to strictly traditional rituals and styles. They are preceded by lash bearers who swing their coir whips around and dash them on the ground announcing the onset of the procession",
    "Everything is done according to age-old customs and rituals. It is the Diyawadana Nilame, the Head of the Maligawa, who places the casket on the elephant\u2019s back each night. The procession leaves the temple premises at an auspicious time. On the day following the last of the brilliant night processions, very early in the morning, a small procession wends its way to the Mahaweli Ganga to perform the water-cutting ceremony. A sword used through the ages sweeps down on the water drawing a temporary incision from which water is collected in a new clay pot. This water is kept in the Maligawa until replaced by a new pot the following year.",
    "A noteworthy fact is that the performers and elephant mahouts are usually not paid in cash. They live on land owned by the Maligawa and this is their mode of paying rent \u2013 termed rajakariya, \u2018free service to the king\u2019.",
    "And so ends the Esala Perahera at noon of the full moon day in August. Sri Lanka metamorphosizes to a truly Resplendent Island during this season!",
