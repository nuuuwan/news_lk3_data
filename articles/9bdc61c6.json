    "The swearing-in was attended by Nepal\u2019s chief justice, security chiefs, senior officials, diplomats and former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai.",
    "Soon after the ceremony, jubilant youths from the Gen Z protest movement gathered outside the president\u2019s office, celebrating Karki\u2019s elevation as a victory for their struggle.",
    "Social media platforms were flooded with congratulatory messages. \u201cCongratulations to the first woman prime minister,\u201d read one post.",
    "Another user wrote: \u201cBe successful, save and build the country. Thanks to Gen Z who made this happen.\u201d",
    "Karki\u2019s appointment came after President Paudel held consultations with the military leadership, political parties, legal experts and civil society leaders, as well as youth protesters who spearheaded the uprising.",
    "Nepal now faces the dual challenge of restoring order after the worst political violence in decades and preparing for fresh elections under Karki\u2019s interim leadership."
