    "Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - As higher rainfall spreads across the country and the southwest monsoon activates after May 20, temperatures, which have risen to a 'caution level' for human comfort, are expected to decrease, the Meteorology Department said.",
    "They said higher rainfall would be experienced in most of the parts of the country. Accordingly, due to a low-level atmospheric disturbance, heavy rainfall of more than 100mm is likely after 1 p.m. in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Eastern, Southern and Uva provinces and the rain is expected to be enhanced during the next few days.",
    "Showers may occur in the eastern and southern provinces during the morning.",
    "Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Galle and Matara districts during the morning.",
    "Accordingly, Matale, Kandy, Kegalle, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Monaragala, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Galle and Matara districts were elevated to a high risk level due to higher rainfall.",
    "Therefore, the public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.",
    "With the start of the rainy weather in Jaffna district, one person was hospitalised due to a lightning strike.",
    "According to the Hydrology and Disaster Management Director Eng.S.P.C. Sugeeshwara, a total of 4,982 people belonging to 1,542 families in Sabaragamuwa, the northern and eastern provinces, have been affected by the drought, but no deaths were reported.",
    "2,702 people were affected in Kegalle district, 946 in Kilinochchi district and 1,334 in Trincomalee district due to the drought.",
    "Sugeeshwara said the existing water capacity of reservoirs is 74% and the current rain fall is not sufficient for the increase of the water capacity of irrigation and hydropower reservoirs.",
    "Due to heavy rains during the past few days, only the Dunamale gauging station of the Attanagalu Oya was alerted over a possible flood, but the water levels were falling. The situation in major rivers is normal.",
    "Moreover, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) has issued a yellow colour level-one warning to be watchful of the possibility of landslides, slope failure, rock falls, cutting failures and ground subsidence in five districts, including Badulla, Kandy, Kegalle, Kurunegala and Ratnapura."
