    "The police have launched a probe into a complaint that a former military officer supporting the JVP/NPP threatened the activists of other political parties with reprisal recently. Several persons are said to have reported the alleged incident to the police. A video of the suspect issuing threats is doing the rounds on social media. The JVP/NPP has said the clip has been doctored. Anything is possible in this digital age. The police must get to the bottom of it expeditiously.",
    "If the authenticity of the video at issue can be established, the suspect, who has been identified, has to be severely dealt with, according to the law, as a deterrent for others of his ilk. If it is found to be a deepfake, those who created it must be traced and prosecuted forthwith. The Internet is teeming with digitally manipulated images and videos which mislead the public.",
    "The UK\u2019s worst race riots in decades were incited by online disinformation campaigns, last month. The unfortunate incidents placed Britain on a collision course with Elon Musk, whose X was abused by far-right groups to stoke the flames of racism. Perhaps, nothing is more abused these days than the digital space, where privacy and security are almost nonexistent. Fake news or deepfake can wreak havoc anywhere in the world, especially in the countries where mass hysteria is the norm.",
    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka, the police, the election monitors, etc., should take up the issue of disinformation circulated via the Internet with social media platform owners, who do not seem to act responsibly.",
    "The JVP is said to have conducted its political events in a peaceful manner since 1994, when it returned to mainstream politics by securing parliamentary representation through the Sri Lanka Progressive Front. It is the only party which is free from the manape (preferential vote) battles that plague other political parties; its candidates put the party before self while their counterparts in other parties subjugate everything to self-interest.",
    "However, it is popularly said in this country that all it takes to spoil a pot of milk is a smidgeon of cow dung. Hence the need for the JVP/NPP as well other political parties to remain vigilant and rein in their unruly supporters.",
    "There have been no serious incidents of election-related violence so far. This is a matter for happiness, but given the extremely high stakes all political parties and their leaders have in the forthcoming presidential election, it is only natural that there is a sense of foreboding among the public. Prudence warrants that all precautions be taken to prevent flare-ups, especially in the post-election period. Sri Lanka is no stranger to political violence, which has even distorted the outcomes of electoral contests such as the presidential and parliamentary polls in the late 1980s and the North Western Provincial Council election in 1999.",
    "One may recall that the 1994 regime change was expected to plunge the country into a bloodbath because the UNP had perpetrated barbaric violence against its rivals, especially the SLFPers after the 1977 general election. Goons led by UNP politicians assaulted and killed SLFP supporters and torched the victims\u2019 houses. The police were ordered to look the other way while the UNP thugs were unleashing hell.",
    "But Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who steered the SLFP-led People\u2019s Alliance (PA) to victory, in 1994, turned all grassroots offices of her alliance into \u2018peace committees\u2019 tasked with ensuring the safety of the PA\u2019s political rivals. Her method worked. Her example is worthy of emulation.",
    "All political parties taking part in the ongoing presidential election ought to entrust their community-level branches with the task of ensuring peace in the post-election period. Democracy must be the winner in the forthcoming presidential election regardless of who secures the presidency.",
