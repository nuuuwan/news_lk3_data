  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a pivotal move towards revitalising Junior Chamber International (JCI) Sri Lanka, the JCI Senate Sri Lanka and JCI Colombo Mid-Town, on Sunday kicked off the Asia Pacific Development Councillors (APDC). It concludes tomorrow.",
    "Founded in 1954, JCI Sri Lanka faced disaffiliation in 2017 due to internal challenges. However, recent efforts have led to the establishment of four new chapters, including the inauguration of JCI Colombo Central held recently at the NH Collection Hotel, Colombo.",
    "The purpose of the APDC visit is to evaluate the progress made by the local JCI Movement. A positive assessment could facilitate Sri Lanka\u2019s re-admission to the global JCI network, positioning the country for the JCI World Congress in October 2024 in Taiwan. This is a crucial step in re-establishing Sri Lanka\u2019s role within the global JCI network, which emphasises leadership development, entrepreneurship, and community service.",
    "The APDC delegation will evaluate the progress of local JCI chapters and Sri Lanka\u2019s readiness for re-admission into the global JCI network. They will also oversee the inauguration of three new chapters \u2014 Colombo North, Colombo Central, and Colombo \u2014 aiming to enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s participation in JCI\u2019s global initiatives and create opportunities for young professionals and entrepreneurs.",
    "Leading the delegation is APDC Councillor JC Wilson Chu from Macau, accompanied by Development Officers JC Aiko Chao and JC Cora O, from Macau, JC Vita Subiyakti from Indonesia, JC Enkmaa Sukhbaatar from Mongolia, and JC Md Faijunnur Akhon from Bangladesh.",
    "Newly-appointed JCI Colombo Central President Dharini Seneviratne said: \u201cUnder my leadership, I envision JCI focusing on projects that are more sustainable and have a lasting impact on society. If we achieve that, it will naturally strengthen our reputation and attract new members to our chapters. When we make a genuine difference that resonates with people, they\u2019ll want to contribute their skills and ideas, making our network something everyone wants to be part of.\u201d",
    "APDC Councillor JC Wilson Chu observed: \u201cWe rely heavily on the up-and-coming leaders to promote the movement of JCI. I sense their passion and commitment to JCI Sri Lanka and foresee a bright future ahead, given their dedication to training members and delivering impactful projects to the community. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we see JCI Sri Lanka return to its former strength.\u201d",
    "JCI Past World President JC Sen. Isfahani Sameen noted that since the JCI was last active, there have been significant changes. \u201cToday, young people have access to everything on their mobile phones, reducing the necessity to join organisations for learning. However, JCI offers invaluable networking and personal development opportunities that technology cannot replicate.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe training I\u2019ve received through JCI has empowered me to engage confidently with anyone, including heads of Government and Ministers during my travels as President. I feel it\u2019s a lifelong duty to give back to the organisation that has shaped me, and that is exactly what I am committed to doing.\u201d",
    "Driving this resurgence is JCI Senate Sri Lanka Chairman JCI Sen. Malik Cader, ably assisted by JC Sandun Weerasinghe, the founder President of JCI Colombo Mid-Town. Under his leadership, JCI Sri Lanka is positioning itself to support leadership and entrepreneurship among young Sri Lankans. His vision aligns with JCI\u2019s broader goal of empowering young people to become active citizens, driving positive change within their communities."
