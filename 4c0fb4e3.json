    "United Front of Postal Unions Secretary Sampath C Liyanage told reporters at the protest, held in Battaramulla, Colombo, Friday December 08 morning, that government workers haven\u2019t received a pay rise in about eight years despite the increase in cost of living, which Liyanage said is now \u201csky high\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe demand a salary increase of 20,000 rupees starting from January,\u201d he said.",

    "\u201cThe Nuwara Eliya and Kandy post offices are sites of archaeological and economic value and are important to the country. The Wickremesinghe-led government has taken all steps needed to sell them cheap to foreign companies,\u201d Liyanage claimed.",
    "President Wickremesinghe presenting his budget proposals for 2024 told parliament in November that state sector workers will receive a 10,000-rupee salary increase. This was against a backdrop of a campaign of agitation by state sector unions demanding a 20,000-rupee hike.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) includes an agreement to achieve a primary surplus of 2.3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025.",
