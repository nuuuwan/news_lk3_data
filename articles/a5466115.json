    "BoardPAC has proudly earned the Carbon Neutral Certificate for 2022 from The Sri Lanka Climate Fund (SLCF), an organization operating under the Ministry of Environment committed to fostering a low-carbon business economy and promoting sustainable lifestyle choices. This remarkable achievement underscores BoardPAC\u2019s dedication to environmental responsibility and is a key milestone in its Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) journey.",
    "For the second consecutive year, BoardPAC has secured this prestigious certification by offsetting its Organization Level Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, after being audited to the specifications of the ISO 14064 \u2013 1:2018 standard. BoardPAC was founded with a vision to revolutionize board meetings through the power of technology, allowing companies to eliminate the need for cumbersome printed documents and transition to a paperless workflow. To date, BoardPAC has assisted clients from over 40 countries in transforming their board meetings into efficient, eco-friendly processes, resulting in the preservation of more than 16,000 trees per annum on average.",
    "Founder and Executive Director, Lakmini Wijesundera, commended this achievement and added, \u201cWe enable boards of large corporations and global banks, including Forbes Global 2000 companies, to have a paperless and secure method of conducting meetings and maintaining records. Currently, there is a global shift in focus towards ESG and making their corporations sustainable. As a facilitator in that process, we felt it was important to be carbon-neutral ourselves.\u201d",
