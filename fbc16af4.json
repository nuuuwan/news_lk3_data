    "Kuwait said Thursday it executed five prisoners, including a convicted drug dealer from Sri Lanka and an inmate convicted over the bombing of a Shiite mosque in 2015 that killed 27 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group, foreign media reported.",
    "The inmates were hanged at the Central Prison, Kuwait\u2019s Public Prosecution said in a statement. Prosecutors said the five include the mosque attacker, three people convicted of murder and a convicted drug dealer.",
    "One of the convicted murderers was Egyptian, another was Kuwaiti, and the convicted drug dealer was from Sri Lanka, AP reports.",
    "The statement didn\u2019t provide the nationality of the mosque attacker or the third convicted murderer, saying only that they were in Kuwait unlawfully.",
    "The 2015 bombing occurred during midday Friday prayers inside one of Kuwait\u2019s oldest Shiite mosques. The Islamic State group, which at the time controlled large areas in both Syria and Iraq, claimed the attack. The Sunni extremist group views Shiites as apostates deserving of death.",
    "It was the first militant attack in Kuwait, a small oil-rich country, in more than two decades. The attack was likely intended to foment unrest between Kuwait\u2019s Sunni and Shiite populations, but instead it backfired, reawakening a sense of national solidarity not seen since Saddam Hussein\u2019s 1990 invasion.",
    "The extremist group no longer controls any territory following a grueling military campaign by an array of forces, but continues to carry out sporadic attacks in Syria and Iraq. It also boasts affiliates in several Asian and African countries.",
    "Executions are relatively rare in Kuwait, which put seven inmates to death last November. Before that, the last one was in 2017, when it executed seven prisoners, including a ruling family member."
