    "The Chairman of the SLTB \u2018Samagi Sewaka Sangamaya\u2019, Niroshan Sampath Premaratne, stated that the strike was launched in protest against the National Transport Commission\u2019s (NTC) decision to implement a unified bus timetable for both SLTB and private buses, along with several other demands.",
    "The Chairman of the Lanka Private Bus Association, Gemunu Wijeratne, also stated that there are many issues with the introduced unified timetable.",

    "Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways, Prasanna Gunasena, stated that the strike is unfair, as the majority of the demands made by the trade unions have already been granted.",
