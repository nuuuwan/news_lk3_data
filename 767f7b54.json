    "The duo were appointed along with two others and were presented with the appointment letters on 5 June. The JSASL in their letter opined that the two appointments could negatively affect public confidence in the judiciary and rule of the law in the country. They also stressed that it is detrimental to the independence of the judiciary, especially the independence of the judges of the trial court. The Association also noted that Wickremesinghe had decided to go forward with the appointments disregarding the request made by them in a letter dated 26 May.",
    "The JSASL maintained that Jayathilaka\u2019s exposure to a non-legal institution was deemed to be a disqualification to reassume duties as a member of the judiciary at any future stage.",
    "It further noted that the officer from the Attorney General\u2019s Department appointed is a very junior officer in comparison to the judicial officers who are next in line in judicial seniority.\u00a0 \u201cAs such, this situation has resulted in frustration and disappointment among the judicial officers who serve throughout the country for years,\u201d the JSASL said."
