  "original_body_lines": [
    "Executive Director of the People\u2019s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi today filed a Special Determination petition in Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the private member\u2019s bills presented to Parliament by SLPP MP Jayantha Ketagoda to re-convene the dissolved Local Government Authorities without holding elections.",
    "The Petitioner states that the proposed Bill creates a bad precedent as the same creates a risk of abusing the legal framework to prevent conducting timely elections, including national elections and the same can lead to the people losing faith in the entire democratic system in the country.",
    "This petition has been filed through Attorney-at-law Manjula Balasooriya.\u00a0 (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
