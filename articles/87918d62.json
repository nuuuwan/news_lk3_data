    "JAT Holdings PLC, the leader in wood coatings and brushes in Sri Lanka, has demonstrated resilience in Q2 and the 1st Half of FY 2024/25, continuing to deliver exceptional value to stakeholders. Accordingly, Profit After Tax (PAT) witnessed a 67% surge during the six months ended 30th September 2024, reaching Rs. 512 million, amid challenges in Bangladesh and Maldives. Meanwhile, Revenue from the Group\u2019s Sri Lanka operations grew by 8% to Rs. 3,287 million during the period. Gross profit margin increased by 2% reflecting the positive impact of JAT\u2019s Acrylic Binder and Alkyd Resin manufacturing plants, which have resulted in significant cost efficiencies. Selling and Distribution expenses too declined by 10% as a result of JAT\u2019s prudent approach to cost management and a strategic increase in marketing spend in the previous year, which are now yielding returns.",
    "However, despite the Group\u2019s best mitigation efforts, its operations in Bangladesh were impacted by the adverse macroeconomic and sociopolitical climates that prevailed during the period under review, which was further compounded by a disastrous recent flood. However, the Group\u2019s strategic response to these circumstances, demonstrates its agility and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. A notable effort has been the recent launch of CoatEx \u2013 a cost-effective wood coating product tailored for the, now highly budget-conscious, Bangladeshi market. CoatEx delivers a very effective and affordable product, leveraging JAT\u2019s manufacturing infrastructure in Bangladesh, giving ACL (JAT\u2019s fully owned subsidiary in Bangladesh) an edge over other import-dependent competitors, who are feeling the pressure of tight foreign exchange controls.",
    "Accordingly, during the six months ended 30th September 2024, JAT reported a 7% decline in Total Group Revenue, recording Rs. 4,536 million compared with Rs. 4,878 million in the corresponding period in the year prior. This was led by a 33% slump in Revenue from Bangladesh, down to Rs. 1,148 million. As a result, Profit Before Tax (PBT) too recorded a marginal 3% contraction to Rs. 408 million, with finance costs seeing a slight increase due to financing of investments through debt . Meanwhile, Revenue from India, the Maldives, and other markets recorded a 9% dip, with restrictive foreign exchange policies in the Maldives driving the decline.",
