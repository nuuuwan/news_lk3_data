Alleges Govt. has implemented policies that harm ordinary citizens while benefitting capitalist class

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman has called on the Government to remove the Rs. 65 tax imposed on imported rice, leaving consumers struggling. Addressing a press conference yesterday, Rahman raised concerns over the ongoing rice shortage in Sri Lanka and criticised the Government’s handling of the crisis.

Rahman acknowledged the Government’s decision to import rice to address the shortage caused by insufficient local production. However, he highlighted that despite the imports, rice remains unavailable at a reasonable price in many shops, leaving consumers struggling to access this staple food.

### NPP needs to get serious about industrialisation to avoid another crisis

*2024-12-29 23:06:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/NPP-needs-to-get-serious-about-industrialisation-to-avoid-another-crisis/4-771128) · `en`

Speaking in Parliament on 18 December, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pledged that under the leadership of his party, “we will never allow a situation like 2022-23 to reoccur in our country”. If AKD and the National People’s Power (NPP) intend to keep this promise, they will have to get a lot more serious about industrialising an economy dependant on services and remittances.

It is regrettable that the President’s speech, while announcing welcome relief for the poor through tax cuts, allowances and subsidies, paid scant attention to increasing investment in the real economy. This is a deadly trap that centre-left governments often fall into. Naturally, the wretched conditions following economic collapse require immediate relief measures. However, long term increases in consumption can only be achieved through investment in the real economy.

### AKD and ETCA with India: Trap or opportunity?

*2024-12-29 22:58:16* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-and-ETCA-with-India-Trap-or-opportunity/4-771126) · `en`

ETCA is a way forward for Sri Lanka to harness the benefits of international trade for creating prosperity to Sri Lankans

According to the 34-point agreement which President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, AKD for short, had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi or simply Modi, the two countries have agreed to promote, among others, trade and investment between them1. There are three agreements that are strikingly prominent and promising. One is that they have agreed to continue discussion on economic and technological agreement, shortened as ETCA, which is now in an abortive state. Another is the direct use of Indian Rupee or INR and Sri Lanka Rupee or LKR for transactions thereby avoiding the intermediate exchange currency, the US dollar. The third is for India to invest in sectors that will increase Sri Lanka’s export potential. All these are interrelated and should naturally form the core of any ETCA to be negotiated.

### Country moving over to renewable energy

*2024-12-29 22:34:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Country-moving-over-to-renewable-energy/4-771125) · `en`

The Government needs to submit a plan to encourage installation of solar power by individual homes and the industry, with reduced interest loans from commercial banks

The country has almost exhausted its cheapest power hydro-electricity. Only possibility is major movement towards solar power, especially by small and medium scale industries and house owners. Most convenient new solar users would be factories and offices, who normally work during day-light hours. Also, most schools have fans in the classrooms. They could install solar panels on the roofs, eliminating electricity bills. The parents who installed the fans in classrooms could also install solar panels

### Good governance a pre-requisite for economic development:  Mr. President, you are on right path

AKD and the NPP Government must stay objective and must resist undue interference of these third parties in making decisions which are in the best interest of the country

There is a continuation of policy at least in the short term. There is no immediate disruption. Trying to do too much in too short a time invariably leads to disaster. The NPP Government is the first in recent times to continue with the economic policies of the previous regime. All this, in my eyes, points to a desire on the Government’s part of putting the country first rather than blindly following an ideology. My advice to the Government is to focus on governance reform. The economy will take care of itself in the short term

“As part of its seaside strategy, the port is entering the relay cargo market, representing a new opportunity for the country…” Hambantota International Port Group said in a statement.

By utilising an intermediate relay port, shipping lines can optimise their routes, streamline operations, and reduce overall transit times, the port said.

### அரசாங்கத்தின் மீதான மக்கள் நம்பிக்கையை பலவீனப்படுத்த போவதில்லை - சுனில் வடகல

*2024-12-29 17:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202492) · `ta`

ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க தலைமையிலான தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தியை பலவீனப்படுத்துவதற்கு ஒரு தரப்பினர் திட்டமிட்ட வகையில் செயற்படுகின்றனர். கிடைக்கப் பெற்றுள்ள மக்களாணையை ஒருபோதும் பலவீனப்படுத்த போவதில்லை என பொதுமக்கள் பாதுகாப்பு மற்றும் பாராளுமன்ற அலுவல்கள் பிரதி அமைச்சர் சட்டத்தரணி சுனில் வடகல தெரிவித்தார்.

கொழும்பில் ஞாயிற்றுக்கிழமை (29) நடைபெற்ற நிகழ்வில் கலந்துக் கொண்டு உரையாற்றுகையில் மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டார்.

ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க தலைமையிலான அரசாங்கம் பதவிக்கு வந்து மூன்று மாதங்கள் நிறைவடைந்துள்ள நிலையில் மக்கள் எதிர்பார்த்த மாற்றங்களுக்கான அடிப்படை நடவடிக்கைகள் எடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளன. அரச செலவுகளை குறைத்து ஒட்டுமொத்த மக்களுக்கும் ஜனாதிபதி சிறந்த எடுத்துக்காட்டாக செயற்பட்டுள்ளார்.

முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதிகளின் பாதுகாப்பு குறைக்கப்பட்டுள்ளமை தொடர்பில் அரசியல் தரப்பினல் மாறுப்பட்ட கருத்தை குறிப்பிட்டுக் கொள்கிறார்கள். தேசிய பாதுகாப்பை உறுதிப்படுத்தினால் முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதிகளுக்கு மாத்திரம் பிரத்தியேகமாக பாதுகாப்பளிக்க வேண்டிய அவசியம் கிடையாது.

### Chamari nominated for ICC Women’s T20I and ODI Cricketer of the Year awards

Sri Lanka’s sensational skipper Chamari Athapaththu has been nominated for both ICC Women’s T20I Cricketer of the Year and ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year awards.

It wouldn’t be an overstatement to brand Chamari Athapaththu as the most prolific female cricketer from Sri Lanka of all-time given her stellar record for the island nation, but the southpaw managed to go one further in 2024.

Despite encountering an unexpected slump in the Women’s T20 World Cup, Athapaththu was the second-highest run-getter in a calendar year in women’s T20Is. Her 720 runs included two hundreds and four half-centuries, with 86 fours and 32 sixes to her name.

Apart from her exploits with the willow, Athapaththu also picked 21 wickets in the period. Her best with the bat and the ball in T20Is came in 2024.

Amidst a series of remarkable performances, including the two centuries in Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier, it was Athapaththu’s brilliant 61 against India in Dambulla on July 28 that stood out.

### தகுதி வாய்ந்த மருந்தாளர்கள் இல்லாத நிலையில் புதிய மருந்தகங்களுக்கான விண்ணப்பங்கள் வருகின்றன - என்.எம்.ஆர்.ஏ தலைவர்

புதிய மருந்தகங்களை திறப்பதற்கான விண்ணப்பங்களின் எண்ணிக்கை அதிகரித்து வருகின்ற நிலையில் தகுதிவாய்ந்த மருந்தாளர்கள் இல்லாமல் மருந்தகங்கள் பதிவு செய்யப்பட வேண்டுமா என்று தேசிய மருந்துகள் ஒழுங்குபடுத்தும் அதிகார சபையின் தலைவர் வைத்தியர் ஆனந்த விஜேவிக்ரம கேள்வி எழுப்பியுள்ளார்.

மருந்தாளர்களுக்கு பயிற்சி அளிப்பதற்கு தேசிய மருந்துகள் ஒழுங்குபடுத்தும் அதிகார சபை பொறுப்பல்ல என்றும் அதன் தலைவர் வைத்தியர் ஆனந்த விஜேவிக்ரம சுட்டிக்காட்டினார்.

சில சந்தர்ப்பங்களில், மருந்தாளர்கள் போதுமான ஊதியம் இல்லாததால் மருந்தகங்களில் அவர்கள் பணியாற்றுவதில்லை. புதிய மருந்தகங்களை நிறுவுவதற்கு அடிக்கடி விண்ணப்பங்கள் வருவதற்கு இதுவே காரணமாக இருக்கின்றன.

தரநிலைகளைப் பராமரிக்கவும், பொதுப் பாதுகாப்பை உறுதி செய்யவும் மருந்தகங்கள் தகுதி வாய்ந்த நிபுணர்களைக் கொண்டிருப்பதை உறுதி செய்வது மிகவும் முக்கியமானதாகும் என்றார்.
