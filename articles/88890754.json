  "original_body_lines": [
    "Colombo has demonstrated its own brand of strategic autonomy on issues from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine to China\u2019s global footprint",
    "Most South Asian governments tend to have nonaligned foreign policies, balancing their relations with major powers. This maximizes their diplomatic flexibility and ability to operate independently on the world stage, also known as strategic autonomy. India and Pakistan are two prominent examples: They both balance their relations with the United States and at least one of its core rivals (Russia and China, respectively).",
    "But it\u2019s important not to overlook Sri Lanka: In the last two years, Colombo has quietly and successfully navigated global conflict and great-power rivalry. Like many other countries in the region, Sri Lanka has not condemned Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, even though resulting price shocks exacerbated its own economic crisis in 2022. Yet it has\u00a0called\u00a0for an end to the war and\u00a0announced\u00a0new measures that step up economic and energy ties with India.",
    "This week, Sri Lanka\u2019s government\u00a0announced\u00a0a $1 million donation to assist children in Gaza affected by the Israel-Hamas war, following the establishment of a national Children of Gaza Fund calling for contributions from the Sri Lankan public. The country has previously announced other\u00a0aid commitments,\u00a0expressed solidarity\u00a0with Palestinians, and accused the European Union of \u201cdouble standards\u201d in its approach to Gaza.",
    "But Sri Lanka is also a close friend of Israel, which\u00a0supplied arms\u00a0to the Sri Lankan military during its decades-long civil war. Since the Israel-Hamas war began, Sri Lanka has reached a\u00a0controversial deal\u00a0that enables Israel to hire Sri Lankan workers, and its\u00a0diplomats in Israel\u00a0have delivered assistance and donated blood. Colombo also joined the U.S.-led military campaign against Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, making it the only South Asian country to do so.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has\u00a0strengthened\u00a0economic ties with China and already hosts many large Chinese infrastructure projects. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has also\u00a0embraced\u00a0Beijing\u2019s position on key issues, including the AUKUS security alliance between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which he has\u00a0labeled\u00a0a \u201cmistake,\u201d and the term \u201cIndo-Pacific,\u201d which he has called an \u201cartificial framework.\u201d",
    "However, last November, Colombo\u00a0inked\u00a0a $553 million deal with the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. to support a port development project in Colombo that is backed by India\u2019s Adani Group. In January, Sri Lanka\u00a0imposed\u00a0a one-year ban on Chinese research ships entering its ports. The move came soon after Wickremesinghe\u00a0rejected\u00a0Indian allegations that Chinese spy vessels have docked in Sri Lanka.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s actions may be driven by a commitment to strategic autonomy, but its motivations are as much about practicality as principle. The country is emerging from an acute economic crisis, and it needs as much financial assistance as it can get. It\u2019s easier to achieve that goal when it works with all the major powers. It\u2019s not coincidental that China, India, and the United States were three of Sri Lanka\u2019s most generous donors during its crisis.",
    "Wickremesinghe must also proceed cautiously during an election year for Sri Lanka. Colombo\u2019s deals with Beijing, including the latter\u2019s 99-year lease on the Hambantota International Port, have led to increased\u00a0anti-China sentiment\u00a0in the country in recent years. But the president will also do everything he can to distance himself from his wildly unpopular predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who remains a political ally of Wickremesinghe.",
    "Rajapaksa, who heavily courted\u00a0Chinese investments\u00a0while in office from 2019 to 2022,\u00a0published\u00a0a book last month that lambasts Beijing for providing loans that deepened Colombo\u2019s economic crisis. This gives Wickremesinghe some incentive to show some love for China in order to distance himself from Rajapaksa\u2019s position.",
    "South Asia has become a battleground for geopolitical rivalry, which puts pressure on the region\u2019s nonaligned governments to take sides. But to this point, Sri Lanka has navigated this state of affairs successfully, demonstrating the capacity of states in the global south to reinforce multipolarity in the current world order.",
    "On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0blasted\u00a0the main opposition Indian National Congress party\u2014for a diplomatic decision made 50 years ago. In 1974, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi negotiated an end to a maritime border dispute by\u00a0recognizing\u00a0Sri Lanka\u2019s claim over Katchatheevu, a small island 20 miles off the southern coast of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.",
    "Modi\u00a0denounced\u00a0the decision as \u201ccallous\u201d and said the Congress party has weakened India\u2019s \u201cunity, integrity, and interests \u2026 for 75 years and counting.\u201d On Monday, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar\u00a0said\u00a0Sri Lanka had detained more than 6,000 Indian fishermen in the last two decades, suggesting its possession of Katchatheevu has worsened the plight of communities in Tamil Nadu.",
    "The comments are unlikely to cause tensions between India and Sri Lanka. They are clearly part of a tactic to appeal to long-standing grievances and secure votes in a Tamil Nadu, one of a few southern states where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has struggled to gain traction. This underscores how Modi\u2014despite being heavily favored to win reelection in national polls that begin this month\u2014is leaving no stone unturned on the campaign trail.",
    "The writer of\u00a0Foreign Policy\u2019s weekly South Asia Brief and the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center.",
