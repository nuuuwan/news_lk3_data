Occidental Eden Beruwala reopened its doors in May 2023 following the conclusion of an extensive renovation involving a total revamp of all 158 guest rooms, common spaces and guest amenities at a cost of Rs. 1.5 billion.",

This agreement also includes the management of two newly built hotels in the Maldives: a spectacular 100-villa resort located on the island of Bodufinolhu, set to open in August 2023, and an urban hotel in Mal\u00e9, the country\u2019s capital, scheduled to be opened in 2024.
