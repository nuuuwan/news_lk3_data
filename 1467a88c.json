    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s 2024 budget, while not without its shortcomings, is a forward-looking budget that aims to ensure fiscal discipline and put Sri Lanka on the path to recovery, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said.",
    "Rajapaksa, who leads the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), told parliament on Tuesday November 21, the last of the ongoing budget debate, that his party will support the budget, which he said contains strategies to avoid increased burdens on the public.",
    "\u201cThe budget presented by President Wickremesinghe is a future-oriented budget. We are always on the path of the people. So we will fully support any budget that won\u2019t see the people put in difficulty and is of use to them,\u201d said Rajapaksa.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this not because the budget doesn\u2019t have its shortcomings or things that need to be corrected. We believe that, along with the people, this country\u2019s economy must rise again quickly. We will always support a programme that will create the backdrop for that,\u201d he said.",
    "The former president said the 2024 budget contains much to ensure fiscal discipline.",
    "\u201cWhat the people want is for the country to be lifted up from where it is; not to cling to allegations and fall from the pan to the fire,\u201d he added.",
    "The SLPP leader was ostensibly referring to a recent Supreme Court ruling holding him, two of his brothers and several officials affiliated with the previous SLPP-led government responsible for Sri Lanka\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades. Rajapaksa has said he does not accept the ruling.",
    "\u201cHistorically, those who are critical always maintained that they alone were good. But when given something to do, they were unable to do it properly, especially at a time when it was most needed,\u201d Rajapaksa said in his speech to parliament.",
    "The SLPP is aware of the high cost of living, he said, adding that the party does not wish to see people suffer more and more economic burdens.",
    "\u201cThe president showed in his budget speech that the government has a plan to avoid this situation. We believe such a plan is what the country needs now,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIn this house, a great allegation was levelled at us about the economy. We reject every one of those allegations. Those who now talk about taking away people\u2019s civic rights, we remember what they did back then,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Nov21/2023)"
