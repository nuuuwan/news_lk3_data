    "Ukraine and Russia are in the news for the wrong reasons\u2014involved in a wasteful war, provoked by attempts to expand NATO borders. Ukraine has been made a pawn in the hands of western powers, the fate that often befall their allies. But the subject for this brief note is not the war but the story involving a\u00a0 region that contributed so much for the development of so many languages and cultures and its significance to Sri Lanka with regard to the development of Sinhala language.",
    "In ancient times (2000 BCE), much of the Ukraine region was covered by the Eurasian Steppes, also called the\u00a0 Great Steppes, which, by the wa,y formed the background to the novella \u201cThe Steppes\u201d by the great Russian novelist Anton Chekov, which \u00a0was a grassland and shrubland that covered a vast area in\u00a0Eastern Europe and Central Asia, extending for 8000 km from Hungary, in the west, through Ukraine, southern Russia, to Mongolia, in the east. This ecosystem was fertile ground for cultural development, during this period, and several tribal confederations, and states, had emerged in this region. Some of the important cultures, relevant to this discussion, developed in this region:\u00a0Eurasian Steppe Sintashta culture (2200\u20131800 BCE) and the subsequent Central Asian Andronovo culture (2000\u2013400 BCE) (ref. Reich D et al 2009,). Sintashta spoke a Proto-Indo-Aryan language.",
    "Indo-Aryan Languages, which were the origin of Sanskrit, Pali and later Hindi, and also Sinhala, belonged to the larger family of Indo-European languages.\u00a0Indo-European languages developed around 6,500 years ago in\u00a0the Eurasian steppe, specifically the region of the Caucasus.\u00a0\u00a0All Indo-European languages have descended from a single prehistoric language,\u00a0linguistically reconstructed\u00a0as\u00a0Proto-Indo-European, spoken sometime during the\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0or early\u00a0Bronze Age\u00a0(c.\u20093300\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091200\u00a0BC). The geographical location where it was spoken, the\u00a0Proto-Indo-European homeland, is the\u00a0Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe\u00a0in what is now\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0and\u00a0Southern Russia,  (Mallory, J. P. 2006).\u00a0This theory is known as the Steppe Hypothesis or Kuragan theory.\u00a0With advances in DNA genome mapping, the Kurgan theory is today considered to have been proved beyond doubt (Shinde, et al., 2019).",
    "A major migration took place at the beginning of the Bronze Age 2000 \u2013 700 BCE) from the Eurasian Steppes (D. W. Anthony, 2010).\u00a0The aridization of the Steppe region may have led people to migrate to other fertile areas.\u00a0Migration of peoples from this area took place westward into Europe and also in a southeastern direction into the Indian subcontinent.\u00a0This was also the origin of development of Indo-European languages with a common ancestry.\u00a0A genetic and linguistic mix would have happened due to migration of people from Steppe bringing Indo-European languages and people of Iranian ancestry bringing Iranian language elements leading to the development of Indo-Aryan languages which forms a major branch of Indo-European languages.",
    "The migrating groups had a significant advantage due to technologies like horse domestication, the wheel, and a more complex language, which helped them establish their culture and languages across new territories.",
    "Migrations led to Proto-Indo-European diversification into distinct linguistic groups, including the ancestor of European languages and the ancestor of Indo-Aryan languages in India.\u00a0Migration of peoples from this area\u00a0 may have had an impact on the development of Indo-Aryan culture and also Vedic tradition in India.",
    "This language family, comprising around 445 languages spoken by nearly half the world\u2019s population, is organised into branches like Germanic, Romance, Slavic, and Indo-Iranian, all linked by shared vocabulary and grammatical structures, despite their vast geographic distribution across Europe and Asia. The\u00a0Proto-Indo-Iranian\u00a0languages, from which the Indo-Aryan languages developed, are identified with the\u00a0Sintashta culture\u00a0(2100\u20131800 BCE), and the\u00a0Andronovo culture, mentioned above,\u00a0which flourished in 1800\u20131400 BCE in the Great Steppes.",
    "Eastern migration of people from the Eurasian Steppe Sintashta culture (2200 \u2013 1800 BCE) and the subsequent Central Asian Andronovo culture (2000 \u2013 400 BCE) and also the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (2250 \u2013 1700 BCE), resulted in major changes in the demography of the Northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Sintashta people spoke a Proto-Indo-Aryan language. These migrants when they arrived in the Indian subcontinent had settled first in the regions of Kabul River valley and in Panjab and they may have undertaken the task of developing the V\u0113dic culture and the family of Indo-Aryan languages. The latter, also called Indic languages, is a major subgroup of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family (Allentoft, 2015).",
    "Modern Indo-Aryan languages, which include Sinhalese, descend from Old Indo-Aryan languages, such as early V\u0113dic Sanskrit, through Middle Indo-Aryan languages (or Prakrits). The largest such languages, in terms of first-speakers, are Hindi\u2013 Urdu (c. 329 million), Bengali (242 million), Punjabi (about 120 million), Marathi (112 million), Gujarati (60 million), Rajasthani (58 million), Bhojpuri (51 million), Odia (35 million), Maithili (about 34 million), Sindhi (25 million), Nepali (16 million), Assamese (15 million), Chhattisgarhi (18 million), Sinhala (17 million), and Romani (c. 3.5 million). A 2005 estimate placed the total number of native speakers of the Indo-Aryan languages at nearly 900 million people. These languages are mainly spoken in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. (Source: Encyclopaedia Britannica).",
    "These migrations led to a significant population turnover and replacement not only in the Indian subcontinent\u00a0 but also in Northern and Western Europe, with the steppe populations bringing their language to the region.\u00a0Modern European languages that descended from Indo-European include the\u00a0Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian), the Germanic languages (English, German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian), the Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech), Greek (Hellenic branch), Albanian, Celtic languages (Irish, Welsh, Breton), and Baltic languages (Latvian, Lithuanian).",
    "An explanation is required regarding the Dravidian languages that existed before the arrival of Indo-European languages in the Indian subcontinent. There is some evidence, though not conclusive, that proto-Dravidian was spoken in the Indus Valley civilisation, and this civilisation was built by Dravidians (Sakthi Sri, Subhikksha, 2023). \u00a0With the decline of the Indus Valley culture, due to a long drought, and arrival of \u0100ryans in the later period, Dravidians may have migrated to the South. Indus Valley Civilization is believed to have been built not by people who came there from outside but by the indigenous people. Similarly, the Dravidian languages were not brought from outside but had developed indigenously though some scholars say there were at least contributions from Southern Iranian farming communities. Dravidian place names along the Arabian Sea Coast and Dravidian grammatical influence in the Indo-Aryan languages, namely Maruthi, Gujarat, Marwari and Sindhi, suggest that Dravidian languages were spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinent before the spread of the Indo-Aryan languages. Further Dravidian languages cannot easily be connected to any other language family and they could well be indigenous to India (Steven RF 2004, Devendra K, 2004).",
    "These fonts of culture, languages, art, architecture and other beautiful things, which were created by humans, are being destroyed by their vile nature. Ruins in Iraq, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East, which was the font of human civilization, stand testimony to this fact. One hopes a similar fate will not befall the present descendants of the Great Steppes culture.",
