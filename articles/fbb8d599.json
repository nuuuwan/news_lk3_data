    "Vision of Karu Jayasuriya and launch of the Institute of Democracy and Good Governance",
    "Sri Lanka is at a pivotal moment in its political history, facing mounting challenges to governance, accountability, and democracy. These issues demand leadership that is rooted in integrity, transparency, and a deep sense of responsibility to the people. It is in response to these challenges that the Institute of Democracy and Good Governance (iDAG) is being launched\u2014an initiative spearheaded by Karu Jayasuriya, a leader whose career has always been centered on the principles of democracy and ethical governance.",
    "The timing of this launch is particularly significant as it coincides with Mr. Karu Jayasuriya\u2019s birthday on September 29th. This initiative serves as both a celebration of his lifelong commitment to democratic values and as a gift to the nation\u2014a pathway toward building a generation of leaders with the caliber and integrity that Sri Lanka desperately needs.",
    "Throughout his distinguished career, Karu Jayasuriya has exemplified the qualities that define true leadership\u2014honesty, fairness, and a steadfast commitment to the public good. As a statesman, his vision has always been focused on nurturing leaders who are driven by conscience, not self-interest. This belief is captured powerfully in his own words:",
    "\u201cOne day, we will all face a trial where no witnesses will testify, and no counsel will appear on our behalf. The only account the judge\u2014Mother Nature in disguise\u2014will hear is from our own conscience. My vision has always been to live as a guiltless person, so that on that fateful day, my conscience will not speak against me.\u201d",
    "These words reflect the essence of Jayasuriya\u2019s life and work: a leader whose conscience has always guided his decisions, and whose vision for Sri Lanka is built on the foundation of integrity and moral responsibility. It is this philosophy that underpins the creation of iDAG.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s current political landscape is marked by increasing concerns over governance, corruption, and a weakening of democratic institutions. The erosion of public trust in the political system has left citizens disillusioned and disengaged, while accountability and transparency in governance have become ever more elusive.",
    "iDAG is not merely a response to these challenges\u2014it is a proactive effort to change the future of governance in Sri Lanka. The Institute is designed to foster a new generation of leaders who prioritise ethical governance, transparency, and active citizen participation. By focusing on education, policy reform, and leadership development, iDAG aims to rebuild the public\u2019s trust in government and create a political culture that serves the interests of all Sri Lankans.",
    "From his tenure as Speaker of Parliament to his ongoing work as a senior statesman, Karu Jayasuriya has consistently demonstrated that true leadership is about service to the people. His vision for iDAG is rooted in this principle: that Sri Lanka needs leaders who are guided by integrity, who are willing to confront the challenges of governance with courage, and who are accountable to the citizens they serve.",
    "The launch of iDAG is an embodiment of this vision, providing a platform for training and empowering future leaders who will carry forward the principles of good governance and transparency. It is a step towards ensuring that Sri Lanka\u2019s political future is shaped by individuals who are committed to the highest standards of public service.",
    "The role of iDAG goes beyond addressing immediate governance concerns. The Institute is committed to fostering long-term change by providing scholarships, leadership programmes, and public forums designed to equip young leaders with the skills and knowledge necessary to contribute effectively to governance. This initiative is essential for building a political environment in Sri Lanka that prioritises public service, ethical decision-making, and accountability.",
    "As Karu Jayasuriya has always believed, the success of a nation depends on the character of its leaders. iDAG will serve as a critical institution in ensuring that future leaders are equipped with the values and tools to navigate the complexities of governance while maintaining their integrity.",
    "The launch of iDAG on Mr. Karu Jayasuriya\u2019s birthday is more than just a symbolic gesture. It reflects his lifelong commitment to nurturing leaders of high moral caliber. By creating an institution dedicated to the principles of democracy and good governance, he is offering a lasting gift to the nation\u2014a pathway to a brighter, more accountable political future for Sri Lanka.",
    "In an era where political leadership is often questioned, Karu Jayasuriya\u2019s vision for iDAG serves as a reminder that ethical governance and leadership rooted in conscience are not only possible but essential for Sri Lanka\u2019s future. The Institute of Democracy and Good Governance will play a vital role in shaping the future of the nation, ensuring that the principles of democracy, accountability, and public service are upheld for generations to come.",
    "As we celebrate the launch of iDAG on 30 Sept., let us also celebrate the values that Karu Jayasuriya has spent a lifetime defending: that leaders must be guided by conscience, and that governance must always serve the people.",
