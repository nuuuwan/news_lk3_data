  "original_body_lines": [
    "Stop Child Cruelty Trust (SCCT) and Child Protection Alliance (CPA) comprising thirteen credible organizations committed to protect and promote the rights of children have appealed to President, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) elevate child welfare to the heart of national governance ushering a new dawn firmly focusing on the true beneficiaries of the future, our children first.",
    "The \u2018Summary Proposal for the Protection and Promotion of Child Rights \u2013 A Dawn of a New Era\u2019 highlights that citizens under the age of 18 years constitute 25% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population. Although Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1991, child protection has become a national crisis in our paradise island. The proposal defines the objectives that GOSL should focus on as Short term (0 \u2013 6 months), Medium term (6 months \u2013 2 years) and Long term (2 \u2013 4 years). The following are identified as Short term objectives: Appoint a Presidential Task Force for Women and Children, provide additional budget allocation for education and child welfare, conclude the legislative process to ban corporal punishment in all settings, revise the circular banning corporal punishment in all schools, nationwide capacity development for teachers on positive discipline techniques and update child prot4ection laws and regulations. Some of the key Medium term objectives are: Make the National Child Protection Authority independent, implement the National Child Protection Policy, compulsory safeguarding training and criminal records check for everyone dealing with children, providing compulsory sexuality education, establish separate courts to expedite cases of child abuse and establish a register of child sex offenders. The Long term objectives include protecting women and children\u2019s rights in the Constitution, implementing the Children\u2019s Act, wide reforms on institutional child care and ending period poverty.",
    "Explaining the proposal further Dr Tush Wickramanayaka, Chairperson of Stop Child Cruelty Trust and Co-convener of Child Protection Alliance said, \u201cAll of the leaders of the main political parties including President Dissanayake from National Peoples Power (NPP) signed a proposal to put child protection at the heart of the national political agenda in 2022. However, it was deeply disheartening to note the lack of a specific policy proposal for child welfare during the Presidential and General Election campaign of all parties. We hope that this summary proposal will provide direction for the new government to deliver sustainable changes to really focus on our children first beyond the rhetoric.\u201d",
