### Fitch confirms ‘A-(lka)’ domestic rating of DFCC Bank Plc

*2024-07-24 17:21:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/fitch-confirms-a-lka-domestic-rating-of-dfcc-bank-plc-173610/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings said it was confirming an A-(lka) rating on Sri Lanka’s DFCC Bank Plc with a stable outlook, amid an improvement in operating environment, indicated by headline macroeconomic indicators.

Fitch said it expected the country’s stabilising economic conditions to support DFCC’s ability to generate and defend business volumes, “but the bank’s predominant exposure to the persisting domestic OE risks constrains its business profile.”

DFCC’s net loans in total assets inched up to 56.9% by end-1Q24 from 54.1% in 2023, reversing a contracting trend since 2021 (74.9%), reflecting early signs of lending resumption, the rating agency said.

Fitch Ratings – Colombo – 22 Jul 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based DFCC Bank PLC’s (DFCC) National Long-Term Rating at ‘A-(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed DFCC’s senior and subordinated debt ratings of ‘A-(lka)’ and ‘BBB(lka)’, respectively.

Fitch expected this ratio to decrease in the near- to medium-term alongside focused recoveries.

“We expect Sampath’s impaired (stage 3) loans ratio to decline gradually in the medium term, due to its recovery efforts, improvements in repayment capacity of borrowers from the stabilisation in economic conditions, and moderate loan book growth.”

The bank also had defaulted sovereign bonds. “Defaulted foreign-currency sovereign bonds, which accounted for 1.9% of assets, had impairments amounting to 52% of its holdings as of end-1Q24.”

### 41 years ago, the Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist policies responsible for the Black July are the cause of the military occupation of today- Pearl.

*2024-07-24 12:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189249) · `ta`

In 1983, the Sinhala Buddhist majority's policies sparked the Black July massacre, leading to ongoing military occupation and economic exclusion of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The event, commemorated by the Pearl Organization alongside global Tamils, highlights the enduring impact of Sinhalaism on Tamil rights and safety. Despite calls for reconciliation and accountability, including at the UN Human Rights Council, little has changed for Tamils, who face continued marginalization and lack of justice. The organization advocates for international support and self-determination for the Tamil people.

🟩

The Sri Lankan government has said that the same Sinhala Buddhist majority policy is due to the Sri Lankan government's land grabbing military occupation and economically exclusion, the same Sinhala Buddhist policy that has led to the riots.

To commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Black July, the Pearl Organization is joining Tamils ​​around the world to commemorate the victims of the planned massacre against Tamils ​​today.

Moreover, Sinhalaism, which is responsible for violence, is trying to investigate how to influence the current events, as well as the Tamil nation.

After the independence of 1948, Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism was rapidly rooted in the structure of Sri Lanka.

Bangladesh partially restored telecommunication services on Wednesday although Internet connection was slow and social media remained suspended, days after deadly protests against reservations for government jobs killed almost 150 people.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.

As demonstrations against the quotas  which included a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan  tapered off, the government started easing the curfew imposed last week.

Restrictions will be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and offices will also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., officials said.
