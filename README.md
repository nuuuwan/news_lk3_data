### No airline in the world making profits: Minister

Parliament, May 08 (Daily Mirror)- No airline in the world is making any profits and it is a situation inherent to all airlines, Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today.

He told Parliament that airlines even in rich countries such as Air India, BOAC and Swiss Airlines were not profit making and some were sold out.

Responding to a question by SJB MP Hesha Vithanage, the Minister said Air India was sold out to Tata due to losses and added that Emirates was provided some USD 2 to 3 billion by the government every year.

He said a small country like Sri Lanka is not in a position to maintain an airline in that manner.

"We have no funds to purchase aircraft. We cannot invest a large capital. We take flights on lease. We need to join with a group which can bring in a large capital so as to continue the airline to ensure the job security of 6,000 employees," he said.

SYDNEY, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

### Australia raises minimum savings for student visa, warns on fake recruitment

Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

“These veterans, once the pride of our nation, have succumbed to the seductive promises of riches and adventure, forsaking the values that define us as warriors and patriots,” General Silva said in a statement yesterday.

He also stated that as members of the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka, “we are bound by duty, honour, and a deep sense of loyalty to our motherland. We have stood valiantly in the face of adversity, sacrificing for the greater good of our nation. Yet, there are whispers of temptation, enticing some of our comrades to forsake their loyalty for the allure of easy money and transient glory.”

### Sri Lanka gross foreign reserves rise to 3.5 year high in April

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves rose by 478 million US dollars in April 2024 to 5,438 million US dollars, official data shows, as the central bank continued broadly deflationary policy.

Deflationary policy (net sell downs of central bank-held domestic securities) at a market-appropriate interest rate allows a balance of payments surplus to develop.

The rupee sharply appreciated in March and early April, leading to importer bill delays and heavy reserve collections.

Some pressure came in the latter half of the month largely due to oversold position and the central bank used moral suasion and some dollar sales to keep the exchange rate stable.

Sri Lanka’s private credit is still weak, allowing reserves to be collected and the external sector to be kept stable easily.
