### Harshana Rajakaruna can only be accepted if international companies declare that the country has recovered from the bank -

*2024-06-25 16:28:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186951) · `ta`

Harshana Rajakaruna argues that without international acknowledgment of Sri Lanka's recovery from bankruptcy, any acceptance of this status by the government or its ministers is deceptive.

Rajakaruna emphasizes the importance of transparency and adherence to international standards in declaring such significant economic milestones.

If the country has recovered from the bankruptcy, international standards must be notified of the announcement.

Without doing so, the president or no other ministers cannot accept the announcement. United People's Shakti Gampaha District Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna said this is a move to deceive the people.

Foreign debt restructuring is very important to recover from that state of affairs.

But the government has so far gone into a very narrow amount of debt renovation in foreign debt restructuring.

Based on this, the government is trying to release the report that the country is currently recovering from bankruptcy.

When many bankrupt countries recover from bankruptcy, the debt reorganization is very successful. But such a situation did not include the Ranil Wickremesinghe -led government.

How can the country recover from bankruptcy. We also wish to recover from the bankruptcy. We will be happy if such a situation happens. But it is not possible to take action to deceive people.
