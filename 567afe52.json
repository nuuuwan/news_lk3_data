    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Jet fuel in Sri Lanka is expensive and the government should consider capping the mark-up of state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to reduce costs, according to Philip Goh, Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific of the International International Air Transport Association said.",
    "\u201cAirlines pay more for jet fuel in Sri Lanka than at other major airports in Asia,\u201d Goh told an aviation forum in Colombo, Friday.",
    "With jet fuel accounting for 30 percent of operating costs of an airline, high fuels hit raised running costs, he said.",
    "Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala said a few airports like Male was also expensive for fuel, but he was taking action to liberalize fuel.",
    "Already a tank farm was being started at Colombo Port. At the Ratmalana domestic airports, a private party was being appointed after calling for proposals, he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s aviation sector was estimated to employ around 700,000 person and there was much potential for growth in the future. But a blueprint was needed to develop Sri Lanka into a major aviation hub.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s aviation blueprint needs to facilitate the sustainable growth of the industry and having an updated airport masterplan is the first step,\u201d Goh said.",
    "\u201cI urge the government to engage in a consultative approach involving airlines to ensure that industry input is factored in.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s passenger traffic had recovered to around 71 percent of pre-pandemic level by April. IATA was projecting Sri Lanka to exceed pre-pendemic level by 2025.",
    "In the US and Middle East there was a faster recovery, with domestic aviation already exceeding pre-pandemic levels, Goh said.",
    "But in Asia, delays in key countries opening up and led to a slower recovery in aviation traffic. (Colombo/July14/2023)"
