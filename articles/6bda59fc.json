    "Continuing the tradition of celebrating Sri Lanka\u2019s natural heritage, SLT-Mobitel has unveiled the 2025 calendar themed \u2018Dragonflies of Sri Lanka,\u2019 focusing on the fascinating world of dragonflies. The calendar highlights the captivating beauty and ecological significance of these vibrant insects, emphasising the vital role they play in sustaining healthy ecosystems in the country.",
    "Dragonflies, often referred to as \u2018Guardians of the Watersheds\u2019, are apex predators among invertebrate communities and serve as indicators of water quality and ecosystem health and considered as a flagship group of insects in the conservation movement. They are generally familiar to the wider public due to their colourfulness, relatively large size compared to most other insects, flight capabilities and presence around human modified landscapes.",
    "With over 132 species in Sri Lanka, including 59 endemic species, the SLT-Mobitel 2025 calendar unveiled the unique diversity of 13 dragonflies while creating awareness of their importance in conservation efforts. Moreover, they have been artistically portrayed to emphasise their ecological significance and stunning beauty.",

The company is also dedicated to encouraging our valued customers to appreciate nature.

Through this initiative, we hope to spark conversations about conservation and sustainability, aligning with SLT-Mobitel\u2019s commitment to environmental stewardship.\u201d",
    "SLT-Mobitel\u2019s 2025 calendar features 13 stunning illustrations, capturing the vibrant hues and dynamic appearance of dragonflies across various Sri Lankan habitats.

These carefully depicted visuals by talented artists Pulasthi Ediriweera, Parami Vidyarathna, and Udeshika Priyadarshani on the dragonflies\u2019 beauty and serve as a reminder of their role in maintaining the delicate ecosystem balance.
