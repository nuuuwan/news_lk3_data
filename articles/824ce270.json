    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Ceylon Electricity Board is offering voluntary retirement package of up to 5 million rupees, to reduce excess workers, according to a gazette notice.",
    "Permanent workers who had served for 10 year or more will get the highest severance pay, of 2 months for every year served and 1.5 months compensation for the period forgone by early retirement.",
    "Employees with less than 10 years will get 0.5 months salary.",
    "The payments will be minimum 900,000 rupees and a maximum 5 million.",
    "Workers who are not in the permanent cadre will also be given compensation.",
    "The CEB had been stuffed with excess employees, from the electoraates of the minister in charge under various administrations, though qualified technical and engineering staff are in short supply.",
    "These include meter readers who work half-day, according to critics. In Sri Lanka meter readers from the CEB and Water Board visit houses on different days to read meters which are adjacent. Meters are read electronically in many other countries.",
    "Before flexible inflation targeting and potential output targeting by macro-economists led the collapse of the currency from 110 to 300 to the US dollar, people getting VRS from companies bought three wheelers or other vehicles.",
    "But a three-wheeler now about 2.1 million rupees partly due to high taxes charged to maintain a bloated state. With 900,000 rupees a laid of worker can get less than half a three-wheeler.   (Colombo/Sept02/2025)"
