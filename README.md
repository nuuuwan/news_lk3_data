### CBSL pay hike: Playing  the fiddle while the country burns

*2024-03-12 00:01:21* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/CBSL-pay-hike-Playing-the-fiddle-while-the-country-burns/4-759359) · `en`

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) salary hike ranging from approx. 29.53% to  79.97% has taken the Nation by storm! This article intends to  show the worthy citizenry of Sri Lanka that the attempts of the Governor/CBSL  to cover up this faux pax  and unconscionable  abuse of powers is utterly fallacious and designed to deceive the people and Parliament of Sri Lanka.

The Governor of the Central Bank has declared the country financially bankrupt, insolvent, unable to pay its debts on 12th April 2022. In this context the Ministry of Finance has issued instructions not to increase any salaries of employees in the Government sector. However, CBSL employees’ salaries have been increased as per Collective Agreement entered into with their Trade Unions.

### Women’s political enthusiasm must be encouraged

*2024-03-12 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Womens-political-enthusiasm-must-be-encouraged/172-278642) · `en`

Sri Lankan women seem to have gained an unprecedented and considerable importance in Sri Lankan politics lately, thanks to the record gatherings of women by JVP/NPP as a part of their show off of power, as the major elections are around the corner.

These gatherings have some sort of copycat effect on some other political parties as well, which is also a good sign, as far as women’s politics is concerned.

It is within that context that the International Women’s Day fell on March 8. Yet, we could witness comparatively fewer commemorative events and media concerns this year, in view of that day.

The need for women’s politics has been felt for a long time not only as they are half or more of the population, but also in most so-called developing countries they play a subservient role in politics, giving up the decision-making right to men in the family, the father, brothers, husband or sons.  Very rarely do women make political decisions totally independent of the male relatives.

As a turbulent world races into year 2024, the  only remaining superpower is a troubled giant (China is a great power, but its military (especially naval) and nuclear forces are still no match for America’s, and it would be economically  disastrous for China to start an arms race with the US now with its economy in  trouble).

The American economy is in trouble, too, with the US dollar losing its value and dire predictions of another Great Depression by next year, though some analysts predict that the US will emerge in better shape from a possible economic crash than any other country in the world.
