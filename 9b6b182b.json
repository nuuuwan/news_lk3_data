    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has only allocated funds for a few projects totalling 4.5 billion rupees for the North and the East in a 2024 budget, after the end of a civil war, a legislator representing the area said.",
    "\u201cUnlike all previous occasions where there have been calls for international conferences to raise funds for the North East, this time there has been some allocations,\u201d Ahila Ilankai Thamil Congress (AITC) General Secretary G.G. Ponnambalam said.",
    "\u201cThe total allocation for the North and East specifically is 4.25 billion.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you take the whole budget, that is 0.1 percent of it in special allocations for an area that we all know is war-affected, and that is lagging behind by 30 years. An area that has stifled development in the form of military presence, that is all oppressive.\u201d",
    "The ratio of civilians to soldiers in the Vanni is 4 soldiers for every civilian, and in Jaffna for each civilian there exists 10 to 14 soldiers.",
    "\u201cOut of the 20 divisions of Sri Lanka\u2019s military, you have 16 based in the North and East, of which 14 are based specifically in the North,\u201d Ponnambalan said.",
    "\u201cSo those are the circumstances in which only 0.1 percent of the specifically mentioned allocations of the north and east has been made of the budget this time.\u201d (Colombo/Nov22/2023)"
