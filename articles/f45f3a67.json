    "US president-elect Donald Trump recently gave a press briefing on Ukraine and Israel. On both issues he has refused to be concrete, and on both he has polarised his critics.",
    "This is somewhat unsettling in a context where Ukraine and Israel have already become, in the post-2022 conjuncture, the two most explosive geopolitical issues of our time. The world has been close to a global conflagration many times before, even after the end of the Cold War. But it has arguably never been this close. Eurasia and West Asia have been the centres of global conflict for the longest time. But now, we are seeing both on fire, and under siege, encircling each other and, with that, the rest of the world too.",
    "It is in Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s interest to procure more aid from the US. President Joe Biden has already given him a lot of what he wants. Last November, Ukraine fired US-supplied long-range missiles at Russian territory for the first time since the war began in 2022. This was just three days after Biden gave Zelenskyy permission to use them.",
    "To date, Washington has given Ukraine more than USD 61 billion in military assistance. The equipment supplied so far include air surveillance radars, more than 3,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and unmanned Coastal Defence Vessels. This is impressive, but has Ukraine done anything to show it would merit more aid from a Trump administration?",
    "For his part, Trump has shifted from his earlier position on Ukraine, though not to the extent of abandoning his stance that the war should end now altogether. He has not condemned Zelenskyy for perpetuating this conflict, but neither has he spared Putin from his critique.",
    "At Mar-a-Lago, his residential palace, Trump was surprisingly toned down, calm, and collected when answering questions from journalists. He began his statement on the conflict by saying that, had he been president, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in the first place, and when he becomes president, he will defuse tensions as quickly as he can. Though he ran his campaign on the promise of ending the war within 24 hours, he now acknowledges that the situation is more complex and nuanced.",
    "This is to be expected. After Trump was elected president last November, Vladimir Putin congratulated him and stated that he was \u201cready for dialogue\u201d with his counterpart. He called Trump courageous, no doubt referring to the July 14 attempted assassination on him at one of his rallies. At the Valdai Discussion Club, in Sochi, Putin added that he \u201cbehaved, in my opinion\u2026 courageously, like a real man.\u201d Against the backdrop of such statements, it is likely that, whatever the US security establishment may want, there is bound to be a shift in the relationship between these two leaders.",
    "All things considered, not a few scholars and commentators would, at this point, say that a simmering down of tensions between Washington and Moscow, without ignoring the legitimate security fears of Ukraine, would be better for the world. The critique on the Left, in the West but also the Global South, is that Ukraine has become a front for Western security interests. This is not entirely untrue. The irony there, of course, is that Ukraine claims to be fighting Russian imperialism \u2013 all the while caving into the geopolitical agenda of Western countries, specifically the NATO grouping.",
    "I do not have much regard for Henry Kissinger, but to give the man his due, he navigated the US through the turmoil of the Cold War with a blend of pragmatism and idealism which has, at least from the US perspective, not been equalled since.",
    "I believe Kissinger, and Nixon, understood the Chinese better than they did the Russians, but they understood the Russians better than most US presidents after them did. The key to Kissinger\u2019s handling of tensions between Washington and Moscow was his recognition of the need for constant, consistent dialogue, especially about Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns. Russia\u2019s argument, that the US did not honour its commitments to those concerns after the end of the Cold War, in particular what Moscow frames as Washington\u2019s pledge to not allow NATO expansion to its frontiers, must be taken into consideration seriously.",
    "This leaves Israel, which is currently going through a jubilant phase following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Unlike Ukraine, which has polarised the Democrats and Republicans, there is a much stronger bipartisan consensus regarding Israel, and the rest of the region, in the United States.",
    "The difference between Biden and Trump vis-\u00e0-vis Israel is that the latter will readily invoke, not just geostrategic interests, but Evangelical fervour, when defending Jerusalem. I am not sure whether Benjamin Netanyahu is the happiest head of state in the world now, but he has, despite the egregious cost to international humanitarian law and the norms of statesmanship, achieved a double whammy.",
    "The suffering of the Palestinians continues, and as unforgivable and indefensible as it is, it will continue under Donald Trump. In his Christmas message, Reverend Munther Isaac reminded us that Bethlehem, where Christ was born, has been turned into rubble by the IDF and US-supplied weapons.",
    "This is yet another example of American exceptionalism: Washington\u2019s power to define the rules of the game in the international order, while reserving for itself, and its allies, the right to be exceptions to them. Nothing Biden has done in the face of the immense tragedy in the West Bank and Gaza will exonerate him; nothing Trump does will lessen that tragedy, even by a notch.",
    "As we leave 2024 and enter 2025, and as we contemplate the hypocrisy of the so-called international community, we should remain mindful that humanitarian concerns cannot, and should not, be disconnected from geopolitics. To ignore or belittle the suffering, whether of Russians, Ukrainians, Israelis, or \u2013 the most marginalised people on earth right now \u2013 Palestinians, is indefensible. Perhaps the biggest lesson of 2024, from an international relations perspective, is that international relations must allow for the human element. So far, it has not \u2013 and where it has, it has only been to the advantage of the geostrategic aims and interests of a group of powerful countries, led as always by the West.",
