    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Tea Traders\u2019 Association has urged the government to strictly enforce the law against factories that compromise quality during tea production, the President\u2019s Media Division said.",
    "In recent years, Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry\u2014long celebrated for its premium Ceylon tea\u2014has been grappling with rising production costs, fluctuating global demand, and a volatile economic climate.",
    "Faced with mounting pressure to remain competitive in international markets, some tea producers have begun compromising on quality to cut costs, using lower-grade leaves, reducing plucking intervals, and relying on less-skilled labour, undermining the very brand identity that Ceylon tea has cultivated for over a century.",
    "Exporters have raised alarm over declining quality, warning that such practices could erode consumer trust in key markets like the EU, Japan, and the Middle East.",
    "The Tea Traders Association\u2019s request came at a discussion with President\u2019s Secretary and higher official on Thursday (17).",
    "\u201cThe discussion reviewed the issues that have emerged within Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry. Special attention was paid to improving the quality of tea leaves and the productivity of tea cultivation and exploring new international market opportunities,\u201d the PMD said in a statement.",
    "\u201cDiscussions also covered the future programme to be implemented by the Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure regarding tea cultivation, including the establishment of a formal data system and the need for its proper follow-up.\u201d (Colombo/July 18/2025)"
