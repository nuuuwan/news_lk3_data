    "Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomists running the central bank and Treasury banned the import of vehicles and about 3,000 other items from March 2020 as the currency collapsed (flexible exchange rate) after as money was printed for potential output targeting.",
    "Though lockdowns in the next month killed domestic credit and led to a recovery in the currency, forex shortages continued as large volumes of money was printed to enforce a low policy rate and yield curve targeting by scuttling bill auctions with a rate ceilings.",
    "The import bans failed to prevent a balance of payments crisis as the printed money flowed into building materials, machinery and equipment through the credit system.",

    "Critics have described the practice of banning car imports (and other so-called non-essential goods) which leads to a loss tax revenue and more money printing as a \u2018cascading policy error\u2019 of Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomists and bureaucrats.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank is currently running broadly deflationary policy, but analysts have warned that if rate cuts are enforced with liquidity injects, (standing facilities, overnight reverse repo, term or outright purchases of domestic assets), forex shortages will re-emerge.",
    "The central bank has a large stock of bonds, whose coupons are deflationary as long as the call money rate is not targeted with new injections when payments are made by the government. (colombo/Aug14/2024)"
