    "It certainly was a great start for the group Mirage who opened their tour of Australia, in Melbourne, at the Valentine\u2019s Day dinner dance, at the Grand on Princes.",
    "Donald Pieries, Benjy Ranabahu, Manilal Perera, and the new faces in the line-up, were a treat to watch as they reeled off a wide repertoire of music that had dance goers in awe at their versatility.",
    "Their vast experience in the music industry, over several decades, was very evident as they blended with the new additions to give off a polished performance.",
    "With Melbourne\u2019s leading band Replay 6, and Esric Jackson, and the irrepressible Noeline Honter in the mix, it was a musical cocktail that appeased everyone\u2019s taste in music as several other musicians present readily admitted.",
    "Replay 6 were in a class of their own with their blend of youth and experience adding a refreshing dimension to their song choice.",
    "Noeline Honter blew everyone away with her explosive vocal that has lost little from her glory days over the decades.",
    "Noeline Honter\u2026doing it at the Valentine\u2019sDay dinner dance, at the Grand on Princes",
    "Benjy Ranabahu described the night as one that had nervous apprehension about Melbourne\u2019s dance crowd and how they would respond after the long lapse.",
    "He said: \u201cWe settled in well into our work, and then enjoyed the interaction with a terrific crowd that seemed to love what we delivered.\u201d",
    "Mirage leader Donald Pieries was rapt at the response the band received and seemed fairly confident in the band returning to Australia for more gigs of this nature.",
    "The band is listed for two more performances\u2026at the Walawwa, on March 1, and then at a Chris Cannon organised luncheon in Bentleigh, supported by Thai Street Food, a popular eating spot in the Bentleigh area.",
