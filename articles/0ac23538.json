    "Executive summary: Sri Lanka\u2019s politically tarnished centralised system of governance structure has continued to disenfranchise the majority of its citizens and has robbed its true potential before and since independence was granted, in spite of multiple constitutions and social uprisings. The need of the hour before we face a crash is to reimagine the country\u2019s political and administrative systems to prioritise capable, service-oriented, and preferably apolitical leadership at the local levels. This policy brief proposes a structural overhaul that emphasises decentralised governance, constitutional reform, and digital connectivity to enable a transparent, inclusive, and modern governance system aligned to protect and serve the needs of 22 million Sri Lankans.",
    "Problem statement: Sri Lanka\u2019s current model, dominated by a centralised political party elite, has repeatedly failed to address local issues or empower communities. Citizens often feel ignored after each post-election, and corruption remains rampant due to a lack of accountability and operational inefficiency at every level. Without structural change, the cycle of disillusionment and underdevelopment is likely to persist, despite changing political cults from now-irrelevant UNP/SJB, SLFP/SLPP remnants known for looting the country in broad daylight, and the NPP is yet to present a compelling vision for a transformational future despite a Marxist\u2013Leninist political umbrella which they have failed to shed.",

    "National education policy is based on a strong foundation and is open to exploring various opportunities through continuous education",
    "Legal and judicial coherence to create a level playing field",
    "Available and affordable Infrastructure development (e.g., broadband, utilities and transportation)",
    "National budget to develop infrastructure, support regional development, and provide fiscal oversight",
    "Independence for local economic development (e.g., SMEs) based on a central theme of innovation, and by removing colonial/cultural hurdles",
    "Establish a unified legal framework redefining power-sharing between central and local governments.",
    "Clarify shared responsibilities in areas such as taxation, infrastructure, and the judiciary.",
    "Appoint elected local representatives to the central government for brief periods and avoid duplicate elections",
    "Create mechanisms for local government accountability by introducing key performance deliverables and holding elected apolitical provincial Governors accountable",
    "Let the elected Governors appoint a seasoned professional CEO (not a political party leader) with key deliverables to lead the nation as the CEO of the National Government",
    "Launch a national initiative to connect all local governments and communities via robust digital infrastructure.",
    "Use digital tools for real-time data collection, resource allocation, and feedback mechanisms.",
    "Mobilise a new generation of leaders committed to operational excellence and public service.",
    "Invest in training programs and incubators for local governance innovation.",
    "Promote civic education to build awareness and responsibility among young citizens.",
    "Improve capacity for negotiating international agreements (e.g., IMF, MCC, SOFA) with transparency and strategic foresight.",
    "Adopt best practices in fiscal discipline, reporting standards, and accountability metrics.",
    "Integrate these disciplines across all levels of government using modern systems.",
    "A phased approach to constitutional reform, beginning with pilot regions",
    "Stakeholder engagement at all levels: civil society, youth, private sector, and diaspora",
    "Conclusion: Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal moment of growth or falling down a precipice, as we seem to have exhausted all established options. It\u2019s now time to choose an innovative system of governance by embracing decentralised governance, constitutional clarity, and digital transformation to level the playing field, so everyone can participate and contribute to create a new future of inclusive development and public trust. This transformation must be led by a new generation of leaders with a new vision and integrity to deliver lasting solutions, not just more commissions and promises."
