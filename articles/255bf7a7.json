    "Heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to the NPP on their resounding victory in Sri Lanka\u2019s recently concluded Presidential and General Elections. This landslide triumph signifies a remarkable transformation in the nation\u2019s political landscape, showcasing the NPP\u2019s ability to connect with and inspire diverse communities across the country. Overcoming their earlier pro-Marxist political roots, the NPP\u2019s success reflects a historic shift, underscoring their evolution into a unifying force capable of addressing the aspirations of the Sri Lankan people.",
    "The NPP has demonstrated unparalleled success by garnering support across diverse regions, from the Sinhala-dominated South to the Tamil-majority North, the multicultural and multi-religious West, the Central region including plantation Tamils, and even achieving significant gains in the Muslim-majority East. This unprecedented victory symbolises a unifying moment for the country, transcending traditional divides and fostering a sense of shared identity among Sri Lankans.",
    "For decades, the political landscape in Sri Lanka was dominated by entrenched elite forces rooted in Sinhala and Tamil nationalism, which deepened divisions and fostered mistrust among communities. However, this election has marked a decisive shift, relegating these forces to political irrelevance. A new generation of progressive young leaders representing Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities has risen, joined by a disillusioned adult populace, to champion a vision of a united Sri Lanka. Together, they have rejected divisive politics, embracing an inclusive national identity that celebrates the nation\u2019s rich diversity.",
    "This remarkable victory, driven by progressive movements particularly in the North and East, invites reflection on the structural and constitutional frameworks that govern the nation. Among these, the role and relevance of Provincial Councils (PCs) merit careful reconsideration.",
    "As the newly elected government has pledged to introduce a new Constitution, one that abolishes the Executive Presidency and reforms the electoral system, it is crucial to engage in thoughtful dialogue about the future of Sri Lanka\u2019s governance. These ideas, while personal, are shared here as food for thought for the NPP leadership as they embark on this transformative journey.",
    "The Provincial Council (PC) system in Sri Lanka, introduced in 1987, arose under significant pressure from the Indian government. Its aim was to establish lasting peace, particularly in the Tamil-majority regions of Jaffna, where the Tamil Tiger terrorist organisation was waging a violent campaign to create a separate state in the Northern and Eastern provinces.",
    "These changes to Sri Lanka\u2019s governance were formalised through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This amendment also declared Sinhala and Tamil as the country\u2019s official languages while introducing English as the \u201clink\u201d language to promote national cohesion. Despite these constitutional reforms, the civil war persisted until the eventual defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009. Notably, even after the war ended, the government retained the PC system but did not devolve crucial powers such as Police and Land, thereby failing to fully implement the original agreement.",
    "The justification for Provincial Councils lies in the need to decentralise power. This allows ethnic communities, such as Tamils and Muslims, to manage their regional affairs, addressing concerns of underrepresentation in Parliament. However, this system\u2019s relevance and efficiency have been subjects of debate.",
    "In countries like India, where provinces have massive populations, the PC system proves more practical and necessary. For instance, in 2024, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan are projected to have populations of 77.2 million, 238.9 million, and 82.2 million, respectively. With such vast numbers and diverse linguistic and cultural groups, decentralising governance ensures better administration and closer engagement with the populace.",
    "In contrast, Sri Lanka\u2019s 2021 census paints a starkly different picture. For example, the Western Province, Northern Province, and Southern Province have populations of 6.2 million, 1.2 million, and 2.7 million, respectively. This significant disparity in provincial population sizes between India and Sri Lanka underscores a critical issue. The PC system in Sri Lanka does not deliver the same financial and administrative advantages. Instead, it often imposes additional costs without yielding proportional benefits.",
    "Given these realities, it is clear that the PC system, designed for a much larger and more diverse country like India, may not be as effective or necessary for Sri Lanka. Rationalising governance structures and redirecting resources toward unifying efforts could better serve the country\u2019s pressing needs for economic growth and national cohesion.",
    "It is no secret that the Sri Lankan government spends exorbitantly to sustain Provincial Councils (PCs). Consider the costs: conducting elections across nine provinces, paying allowances for attending PC meetings and other engagements, providing official vehicles and drivers, subsidising telephone and electricity bills, administrative overheads, and more. Furthermore, members frequently enjoy overseas trips, to study similar systems abroad, all at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.",
    "In a nation grappling with economic bankruptcy, can we afford to sustain such an expensive layer of governance?",
    "In my view, this additional tier of political administration is unnecessary. In Sri Lanka, PCs often serve as a mechanism to accommodate party loyalists who fail to secure parliamentary seats. While the initial justification for PCs was to decentralise power, particularly to enable ethnic groups like Tamils and Muslims to manage their local affairs in regions where they form the majority, I believe that this purpose can be served just as effectively by Municipal Councils, Urban Councils, and similar local governing bodies at a fraction of the cost.",
    "The political landscape in Sri Lanka has undergone a significant transformation. Today\u2019s younger generation of Tamils share much in common with their Sinhalese and Muslim peers, prioritising unity and progress over divisions based on race or religion. They aspire to participate actively in mainstream politics, seeking inclusion rather than separation.",
    "This shift in mindset is a key factor behind the governing NPP party\u2019s success in securing a majority in the North and gaining a notable foothold in the East. Tamil and Muslim representatives now form a larger and more influential segment of the government than in previous administrations. This increased minority representation at the national level prompts a pivotal question: Does the Provincial Council (PC) system remain relevant in this new era of inclusive politics?",
    "In my opinion, the real challenge lies elsewhere. Major political parties, including the NPP, have not done enough to encourage or support Tamil and Muslim members in rising to prominent positions within their ranks, such as seats on the central committee or deputy leadership roles.",
    "The solution, therefore, does not rest in retaining PCs but in fostering greater inclusivity within major political parties. Positive discrimination policies, modelled after successful initiatives in countries like the UK and the USA, could promote ethnic minorities to leadership positions. These reforms would ensure that minority voices are not only heard but also influential at the highest levels of governance.",
    "Moreover, a long-term strategy to unite Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse communities lies in enhancing cultural and linguistic understanding. A practical step would be for the government to mandate the teaching of both Sinhala and Tamil languages in all schools from Grade 1. Early exposure to these languages would bridge cultural divides, improve communication, and strengthen national cohesion. By embedding multilingual education into the curriculum, we can build a society rooted in mutual respect and understanding.",
    "This vision of unity recalls former cricketer Kumar Sangakkara\u2019s iconic MCC Spirit of Cricket Lecture in July 2011, where he declared:",
    "\u201cI am Tamil, Sinhalese, Muslim, and Burgher. I am a Buddhist, a Hindu, a follower of Islam, and Christianity. I am today, and always, proudly Sri Lankan.\u201d",
    "Thirteen years later, these profound words resonate more than ever. Today, as a nation, we must echo his sentiment:",
    "\u201cWe are Tamils, Sinhalese, Muslims, and Burghers. We are Buddhists, Hindus, followers of Islam, and Christianity. We are today, and always, proudly Sri Lankans.\u201d",
    "By fostering inclusivity, streamlining governance, and promoting linguistic harmony, Sri Lanka can chart a path toward a united, prosperous future where all citizens feel valued and represented. In this journey, Provincial Councils in their current form might best serve as a relic of the past, making way for more cohesive and efficient systems of governance.",
