    "The 2019 and 2024 Sri Lankan presidential elections saw significant shifts in political leadership and voter preferences.",
    "In 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, representing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), won with 52.25% of the vote, defeating Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), who garnered 41.99%. Rajapaksa\u2019s victory was driven by promises of strong governance, national security, and economic stability, but his administration faced severe challenges due to the economic crisis that led to his resignation in 2022.",
    "In 2024, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, leader of the Marxist National People\u2019s Power (NPP), emerged as the victor with 42.31% of the vote, surpassing Premadasa, who secured 32.76%. Dissanayake\u2019s victory reflected widespread public dissatisfaction with the traditional political elite, as he campaigned on a platform of anti-corruption and working-class representation. His win signaled a major political shift, particularly in light of the country\u2019s ongoing economic recovery following the 2022 crisis. While Dissanayake did not secure an outright majority, he won after a second round of vote redistribution, marking a historic moment in Sri Lanka\u2019s politics, as he represented a break from the dominance of traditional political families like the Rajapaksas and Premadasa.",
    "Here\u2019s a statistical comparison between the 2019 and 2024 Sri Lankan",
    "= 2024: Dissanayake won with 9.55% fewer votes  than Rajapaksa did in 2019, and his margin over Premadasa was 9.55%.",
    "= 2024: Premadasa\u2019s vote share dropped to 32.76%, a decrease of",
    "2024: Turnout fell to 76%, indicating slightly lower voter participation This comparison reflects a shift from the dominance of traditional political figures to a more left-wing, anti-establishment candidate in 2024.",
    "If Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe had contested together in the 2024",
    "Sri Lankan presidential election, their combined vote total could have significantly altered the outcome.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s 2024 estimated vote share: Although Wickremesinghe ran as an independent in 2024, his support base would primarily come from his long-time affiliation with the United National Party (UNP). Given his recent governance, we can estimate his vote base to be around 8-10%, based on the fragmented political landscape after the 2022 economic crisis",
    "If we add an estimated 8-10% support for Wickremesinghe to Premadasa\u2019s 32.76%, their combined vote share could have reached:",
    "Around 40-43% of the total vote, with around 6-6.5 million votes.",
    "This combination would likely have outperformed Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s 42.31% (5,740,179 votes), potentially leading to a victory for the combined opposition. However, this scenario depends on various factors:",
    "Voter behavior: Not all of Wickremesinghe\u2019s supporters might have automatically backed a Premadasa-Wickremesinghe alliance.",
    "Strategic alignment: Wickremesinghe\u2019s pro-market policies and Premadasa\u2019s more populist stances may not fully align, possibly affecting voter turnout and support.",
    "In conclusion, a joint candidacy could have statistically won the election, but the actual dynamics would depend on the coherence of their combined platform and voter perception.",
    "The 2024 Sri Lankan presidential election saw a drop in voter turnout, an increase in the number of rejected votes, and a larger voter base due to demographic changes compared to 2019. Let\u2019s break down these elements:",
    "2019: Voter turnout was 83.72%, reflecting high engagement during a time when national security and economic concerns were dominant.",
    "2024: Turnout dropped to 76%, which is a significant decline",
    "Disillusionment with traditional political parties: Voters became frustrated with the old political guard due to their perceived role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic collapse. This disenchantment likely discouraged voter participation, especially for Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa, whose parties were part of the \u201cestablishment.\u201d",
    "Economic instability and voter fatigue: After a severe economic crisis in 2022, many citizens felt the political process did not adequately address their concerns, further lowering voter enthusiasm.",
    "Frustration with political elites: The dissatisfaction with traditional political families (such as the Rajapaksas and the Wickremesinghe-led UNP) led many voters to feel their votes wouldn\u2019t significantly change the status quo",
    "Reduced enthusiasm: After the crisis in 2022, many voters were struggling with day-to-day survival, leading to a decreased interest in political participation.",
    "Large-Scale Emigration Since 2022: Following the 2022 economic collapse, an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 Sri Lankans left the country. Many were professionals, skilled workers, and members of the middle class, who were seeking better economic opportunities abroad due to the high inflation, shortages of basic goods, and the general economic instability in Sri Lanka",
    "Loss of eligible voters: A significant portion of those who left were eligible voters. Since Sri Lanka does not have an established mechanism for absentee voting for citizens living abroad, these individuals were effectively excluded from the 2024 election process.",
    "Frustration and disengagement: Many who remained in Sri Lanka may have felt disillusioned by the lack of effective governance, leading to voter apathy.",
    "The exodus likely signaled a deep disconnection between citizens and the political system, as those who left may have represented a politically active demographic.",
    "\u2022 Diaspora influence: While Sri Lankans living abroad typically maintain strong ties with their homeland, their inability to vote could have dampened political enthusiasm among their families and networks at home. This may have further contributed to the sense of futility in voting, reducing turnout.",
    "= Those remaining in the country continued to struggle with the aftermath of the economic collapse, including high taxes, inflation, and daily hardships. For many, political engagement took a backseat to focusing on economic survival. When citizens are burdened with meeting basic needs, voter participation can decline as political engagement becomes less of a priority",
    "The people who left were often from urban, educated, and professional backgrounds, a group that traditionally had higher political engagement.",
    "Their absence directly impacted turnout, as many who typically participate in elections had left the country. This reduction was compounded by the youth and first-time voters who supported Anura Kumara Dissanayake, balancing the overall turnout to an extent, but not fully compensating for the exodus.",
    "With Ranil Wickremesinghe taking over after the 2022 crisis and enacting austerity measures, many citizens felt betrayed by both the government and the opposition. The traditional political parties failed to regain trust, and this disillusionment likely led to a sense of hopelessness among voters, reducing their participation further. The combination of  large-scale migration, disenchantment with the political system, and economic hardships all contributed to the reduced voter turnout in 2024. The lack of absentee voting rights for Sri Lankans abroad compounded the issue, as many potential voters were unable to participate in the electoral process, contributing to the overall decline in turnout",
    "LESSONS LEARNT TO BE LEARNT BY ALL THREE MAJOR CANDIDATES BASED ON THE ELECTION VOTES",
    "Based on the 2024 Sri Lankan presidential election  results, each of the three major candidates \u2014 Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sajith Premadasa, and Ranil Wickremesinghe \u2014 can draw important lessons to improve their future political strategies:",
    "Victory and Support from Youth and Left-Wing Voters: Dissanayake\u2019s victory in 2024 reflected his success in capturing the youth vote, as well as those frustrated with traditional political elites. His anti-corruption and antiestablishment stance appealed to many who wanted change after the economic crisis",
    ": He must now expand his appeal beyond his core base. Though his 42.31% vote share brought him victory, it wasn\u2019t an outright majority. His Marxist platform and revolutionary background make financial and business circles wary, which could hamper economic reforms and stability Lesson: To secure broader support, Dissanayake will need to moderate his economic policies to reassure businesses while staying true to his progressive base. He must also deliver on promises of systemic change, which was key to his support among younger voters.",
    "= Key Lesson: Reinvent Campaign Strategy and Unite the Opposition Failure to Build Momentum: Despite his 32.76% vote share, Premadasa failed to capitalize on the public\u2019s discontent with traditional politics. His drop in support from the 41.99% in 2019 reveals that he could not gain the trust of those seeking change Challenge: Premadasa\u2019s policies may not have stood out enough to differentiate him from the very system voters were rejecting. His inability to consolidate the opposition vote, especially in the face of Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s split candidacy, further diminished his chances of winning. Lesson: Premadasa needs to reform his image and policy platform to offer a clear alternative to the status quo. Additionally, building alliances and uniting fragmented opposition forces, including Wickremesinghe\u2019s supporters, would increase his chances in future elections.",
    "Key Lesson: Address Public Discontent and Reform Political Strategy Economic Stabilization but Political Defeat: Wickremesinghe\u2019s focus on economic recovery, including debt restructuring with the IMF, may have stabilized inflation and foreign reserves, but his low voter support (estimated 8-10%) showed a significant disconnect with the electorate).",
    "His austerity measures were unpopular, as they were perceived as benefiting the elite while burdening ordinary citizens with higher taxes and costs. Challenge: Wickremesinghe\u2019s political brand has become synonymous with the establishment, which is seen as partly responsible for the country\u2019s crises. This made it difficult for him to attract a broad voter base despite his economic reforms.",
    ": He needs to rebuild public trust, particularly by demonstrating empathy for ordinary citizens affected by austerity measures. Engaging in more transparent governance and incorporating social welfare policies into economic recovery plans could help him regain public favor.",
    "Address Voter Disenchantment: The 7.72% drop in voter turnout and rise in rejected votes signal widespread disillusionment. All candidates must focus on rebuilding trust in democratic institutions by addressing the public\u2019s core concerns, especially economic hardships and corruption",
    "Incorporate the Diaspora: Given the significant exodus of Sri Lankans overseas, candidates should advocate for mechanisms such as absentee voting to engage the diaspora, many of whom still hold strong ties to the country and could be influential voters.",
    "Offer Clear Policy Alternatives: The growing complexity of voter issues, particularly in the post-crisis landscape, requires candidates to offer clear, actionable policy proposals that address both short-term survival (inflation, employment) and long-term reforms (corruption, education, economic diversification).",
    "These lessons highlight the importance of trust, clarity of message, and broad-based coalitions in an evolving political environment marked by economic uncertainty and widespread public dissatisfaction.",
    "If Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe had contested together in the 2024",
    "Sri Lankan presidential election, their combined vote total could have significantly altered the outcome.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s 2024 estimated vote share: Although Wickremesinghe ran as an independent in 2024, his support base would primarily come from his long-time affiliation with the United National Party (UNP). Given his recent governance, we can estimate his vote base to be around 8-10%, based on the fragmented political landscape after the 2022 economic crisis",
    "If we add an estimated 8-10% support for Wickremesinghe to Premadasa\u2019s 32.76%, their combined vote share could have reached:",
    "Around 40-43% of the total vote, with around 6-6.5 million votes. This combination would likely have outperformed Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s 42.31% (5,740,179 votes), potentially leading to a victory for the combined opposition. However, this scenario depends on various factors:",
    "Voter behavior: Not all of Wickremesinghe\u2019s supporters might have automatically backed a Premadasa-Wickremesinghe alliance.",
    "Strategic alignment: Wickremesinghe\u2019s pro-market policies and Premadasa\u2019s more populist stances may not fully align, possibly affecting voter turnout and support. In conclusion, a joint candidacy could have statistically won the election, but the actual dynamics would depend on the coherence of their combined platform and voter perception.",
    "The United National Party (UNP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), despite their shared origins, remain divided as a united political force for several key reasons:",
    "The primary reason for the division is the personal and leadership rivalry between Ranil Wickremesinghe, the long-time leader of the UNP, and Sajith Premadasa, who broke away to form the SJB in 2020.",
    "Premadasa\u2019s frustration: Premadasa had long sought a leadership role within the UNP, but Wickremesinghe\u2019s reluctance to step down or share power with younger leaders created tension within the party. This frustration culminated in Premadasa forming the SJB ahead of the 2020 parliamentary elections .",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s dominance: Wickremesinghe\u2019s control over the UNP and his reluctance to pass the torch exacerbated internal tensions. Many UNP members felt that under Wickremesinghe, the party was becoming disconnected from voters, but they couldn\u2019t reform leadership, leading to the SJB split",
    "While both parties have roots in the UNP\u2019s center-right liberalism, the SJB has taken a more populist and centrist approach under Premadasa. The SJB focuses on social welfare programs and expanding public services, making it more appealing to working-class voters.",
    "UNP\u2019s pro-market policies: Under Wickremesinghe, the UNP continued to champion pro-market, neoliberal economic policies, favoring privatization, foreign investments, and austerity measures. These policies became particularly unpopular after the 2022 economic crisis, further alienating a segment of voters who felt left behind",
    "The SJB\u2019s attempt to distance itself from these neoliberal policies was a critical reason for Premadasa\u2019s breakaway and remains a central division between the two parties.",
    "The UNP\u2019s popularity sharply declined after the 2019 presidential election, where Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership was seen as ineffective in addressing key national issues, including the Easter Sunday attacks and the economic downturn. The party\u2019s inability to stop the rise of the Rajapaksas was also a sore point for many supporters.",
    "SJB\u2019s formation was seen as a fresh start and an opportunity for renewal. Premadasa\u2019s SJB quickly gained traction as a stronger opposition force against the Rajapaksas, winning more seats than the UNP in the 2020 parliamentary elections .",
    "Public distrust of the UNP after the 2022 crisis, where Wickremesinghe was appointed president following Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation, has reinforced the perception of the UNP as part of the old political guard that failed to protect the country from economic collapse.",
    "Premadasa\u2019s SJB has focused on grassroots mobilization and appealing to the general public\u2019s frustration with the status quo. His campaign style is more people-centric, offering populist measures that address immediate economic concerns.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s UNP, in contrast, relies on  institutional experience and positioning itself as the party with the capability to manage macroeconomic issues, especially in navigating complex financial negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, these strategies have not resonated with the broader electorate, which is looking for immediate relief.",
    "Both Premadasa and Wickremesinghe harbor strong political ambitions. Premadasa, as the leader of the SJB, sees himself as the face of Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition, while Wickremesinghe continues to hold the presidency and remains determined to maintain his political relevance.",
    "Competition for leadership: A merger between the two parties would likely force a power-sharing agreement, something neither leader seems willing to compromise on. This leadership struggle and competition for dominance in the opposition landscape make a merger highly unlikely without significant concessions",
    "The SJB\u2019s infrastructure and voter base have been growing rapidly since its formation, attracting disillusioned former UNP members and voters, particularly from rural areas. On the other hand, the UNP\u2019s support base has dwindled, particularly after its near-total defeat in the 2020 parliamentary elections, where it won just one seat.",
    "This asymmetry in organizational strength and grassroots support makes it difficult for both parties to merge, as the SJB now commands the larger voter base and structure, while the UNP relies on its institutional history and Wickremesinghe\u2019s position as president.",
    "The rivalry between Premadasa and Wickremesinghe, combined with policy differences, strategic ambitions, and diverging party infrastructures, makes it difficult for the UNP and SJB to unite as a political force. While they share a common origin, their leadership conflicts and differing visions for the country\u2019s future have created significant barriers to reconciliation and unity in Sri Lankan politics. For the people of Sri Lanka striving for a new beginning\u2014focused on prosperity, corruption-free governance, the rule of law, and unity among diverse communities\u2014the following guiding lessons are crucial:",
    "To ensure a corruption-free society, it is vital that Sri Lanka strengthens its legal and institutional frameworks:",
    "\u2022 Transparent governance: Implement transparency in government contracts, spending, and policies. This includes creating robust mechanisms to audit public officials, ensuring that corruption and mismanagement are detected and addressed.",
    "\u2022 Independent judiciary: Strengthening the judiciary so that it is free from political influence will restore faith in legal systems. Citizens must trust that laws will be applied equally, regardless of political or social status.",
    "\u2022 Anti-corruption institutions: Fully empower institutions such as the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), giving them the resources and independence to investigate and prosecute corruption effectively",
    "For Sri Lanka to achieve sustainable prosperity, it is crucial that economic growth is inclusive and benefits all regions, ethnicities, and social classes:",
    "\u2022 Equitable growth: Economic policies must focus on bridging the urban-rural divide and ensure equitable access to opportunities. Special emphasis should be placed on regions affected by the civil war, such as the North and East, where communities continue to struggle with poverty and infrastructure deficits.",
    "\u2022 Investment in education and skills: The country\u2019s future prosperity depends on education reform and equipping youth with modern skills for global markets. Investments in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education can boost innovation and create more job opportunities.",
    "\u2022 Support for small businesses and entrepreneurs: Encourage local entrepreneurship through microfinance programs, innovation hubs, and support for agriculture and tourism industries, which have the potential to uplift rural economies",
    "The 2022 mass protests, where people demanded government accountability, show a shift towards active civic engagement. To maintain momentum:",
    "\u2022 Participatory governance: Citizens should be encouraged to engage in local decision-making processes. Decentralization of government functions can bring decision-making closer to the people, ensuring their voices are heard.",
    "\u2022 Civic education: Programs that educate citizens, particularly the youth, on democratic values and their role in governance can foster a politically conscious population that holds leaders accountable.",
    "\u2022 Reform political institutions: There must be significant reforms in electoral laws to reduce the influence of money and political dynasties. Ensuring that elections are free, fair, and competitive is critical for democracy to flourish",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious fabric has historically been both its strength and a source of conflict. Building a unified nation requires a genuine commitment to:",
    "\u2022 Reconciliation and healing: Post-civil war reconciliation must move beyond superficial initiatives. Policies that address the grievances of Tamil, Muslim, and other minority communities  should focus on restoring cultural autonomy and rebuilding trust through transitional justice processes that include reparations, truth-telling, and recognition of past wrongs.",
    "\u2022 Inclusive leadership: Leaders must work to break down ethnic and religious divides. National discourse should celebrate diversity and encourage interfaith dialogue to foster mutual understanding.",
    "\u2022 Balanced development: Ensure that all regions and communities, regardless of ethnic makeup, receive equal access to resources, infrastructure, and education. This creates a shared sense of belonging and reduces regional disparities",
    "Given the economic crisis of 2022, public trust in governance has eroded:",
    "\u2022 Debt transparency: Sri Lanka must adopt clear and  transparent debt management policies, allowing citizens to understand how foreign loans and aid are utilized. Public access to information about IMF and other foreign assistance programs will help reduce skepticism.",
    "\u2022 Fair tax policies: Implement tax reforms that do not overly burden the working class but ensure the wealthy contribute fairly  to economic recovery. Equitable tax policies can foster trust that recovery efforts are being handled responsibly",
    "\u2022 Environmental stewardship: Protecting Sri Lanka\u2019s natural resources is crucial for long-term prosperity. Policies should promote sustainable development that balances economic growth with environmental preservation, particularly in industries like tourism and agriculture.",
    "\u2022 Disaster preparedness: As a nation vulnerable to climate change, Sri Lanka must prioritize disaster resilience through investments in infrastructure, water management, and sustainable agriculture practices",
    "One of the most pressing issues in Sri Lanka\u2019s politics has been the dominance of political families (e.g., Rajapaksas), which has led to allegations of corruption and  cronyism:",
