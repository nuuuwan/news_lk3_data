    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka will introduce new legislation in April 2024 aimed at improving financial governance within the government in a bid to propel the economy forward and transform the island nation into an export-oriented economy, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Speaking at a religious ceremony in Kegalle on Wednesday March 20, Wickremesinghe said that, if Sri Lanka continues to rely on borrowing to address the imbalance between imports and exports, the country will inevitably confront another economic crisis within a decade.",
    "A statement from the president\u2019s office quoted him as saying that this calls for economic stability and expediting the transformation of Sri Lanka into an export-oriented economy.",
    "The president said negotiations concerning certifying Sri Lanka as a debt-paying country are anticipated to conclude by June and July and any foreign aid lost due to the country being labelled bankrupt will be retrieved.",
    "The country\u2019s economy will receive a boost as the national currency strengthens with the renewed engagement of foreign banks and companies that had previously refrained from conducting business with Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying.",
    "The benefits of the growing economy are meant for everyone, not just a select few, he added.",
    "\u201cWe are looking forward to talking to the International Monetary Fund and wrapping up our work soon. In 2022, Sri Lanka was labelled as a bankrupt country. Because of this, international financial institutions and banks stopped providing us with support and loans. Our first priority is to lift this ban. Therefore, we need to reaffirm that we are a country that pays its debts.",
    "\u201cOver the past year, we have played a crucial role in rescuing the country from economic troubles. If these challenges persist, we may endure another two or three years of hardship. However, as an initial step, we have now reached the final stage of the government\u2019s programme aimed at steering the country away from bankruptcy. Achieving this required numerous steps, but we\u2019ve successfully executed them in a remarkably short time frame.",
    "\u201cThe on-going discussions are reaching their last phase, and we anticipate wrapping them up by tomorrow. Following that, our objective is to proceed with negotiations involving the countries that have provided loans to us. This process is being overseen by France, Japan, and India, who are chairing the discussions involving all the countries that have officially lent money to us.",
    "\u201cThe local staff and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are anticipated to reach a staff-level agreement this weekend after concluding their discussions. Concurrently, discussions with China are on-going, and discussions with private creditors are underway. The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank are scheduled to return to Europe to engage in discussions with these groups.",
    "\u201cFollowing the declaration of our bankruptcy-free status, a joint meeting of the World Bank and the IMF is planned for April. Subsequently, the relevant agreement is expected to be signed shortly thereafter.",
    "\u201cI aim to complete all these tasks by June and July, especially considering the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections. It\u2019s crucial to finish these activities before the elections. Once completed, we will demonstrate to the world that we are capable of repaying our debts, which will lead to the return of aid money that we haven\u2019t received yet and an increase in the country\u2019s dollar reserves.",
    "\u201cCurrently, many banks and companies are hesitant to engage in business with us, but once these activities are concluded, they will resume business with us. Consequently, our available funds are expected to increase.",
    "\u201cWe have passed a challenging period and had to make tough decisions to overcome this situation. However, we have now reached a point where we can offer some relief.",
    "\u201cThe rupee has been strengthening, and it\u2019s expected to reach Rs.280 rupees by June, leading to a decrease in the prices of goods. We anticipate the rupee will continue to strengthen next year as well.",
    "\u201cMoreover, salaries of the government employees have increased by Rs. 10,000 before the Sinhala Tamil New Year. Additionally, the \u2018Aswasuma\u2019 programme has been introduced to provide benefits three times higher than Samurdhiya to the people, with the number of beneficiary families increasing from 800, 000 to 2,400,000.",
    "\u201cConsidering these factors, the relief provided to the people as a bankrupt country is three times greater than what was provided during a stable economy. These efforts ultimately benefit the country\u2019s economy. Additionally, the funds that were not used for decentralized budgeting over the past two years will be released, contributing to the country\u2019s economic growth.",
    "\u201cLooking ahead, we have opportunities for further progress after June.",
    "\u201cStabilising the country\u2019s economy alone will not solve all our problems because we are currently reliant on imports, leading to a trade imbalance where exports are lower than imports. This gap is often bridged through foreign loans, which sets us up for another economic crisis in about a decade.",
    "\u201cTo prevent such a scenario, I plan to hold discussions with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to initiate a program aimed at swiftly transitioning the country towards an export-oriented economy. As a fundamental step, we have introduced the agricultural modernization program, which will require another 6 to 7 years to achieve success.",
    "\u201cIt is worth mentioning that the proposed law aims to foster economic stability and transition the country into an export-based economy. I plan to present this law to Parliament by April. Additionally, another law focused on financial governance within the government will be introduced, enabling us to sustain economic activities effectively.",
    "\u201cThe previous economic challenges impacted everyone in the country. Therefore, the benefits of the developing economy should not be limited to a select few but should extend to all citizens.\u201d (Colombo/Mar202/2024)"
