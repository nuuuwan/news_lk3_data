    "In governance and society today regrettably there are seven dwarfs, who are mostly not engaged in good faith, are without requisite standards of professionals, and not acting in the best interests of the common and marginalised citizenry of Sri Lanka.",
    "The President, the Cabinet and network cronies of the President in Parliament and outside, the executive, business, religious leaders/intellectuals, trade unions/CSOs and a segment of citizens are these seven dwarfs, representing Doc, Dopey (also Sleezy), Sneezy, Sleepy, Bashful, Grumpy and Happy; where Doc is the uncaring of common man Mr. Know All, the leader of the pack and a self-perceived visionary: Dopey/Sleezy, as defined is very foolish, idiotic, self-serving, corrupt and follows the leader without question; Sneezy is affected by an impairment of normal physical or mental functions in independent decision making with integrity and professionalism thus impotent in upholding democratic values and rule of law; Sleepy sees no evil, hears no evil and speaks no evil and looks inwards all the time; Bashful prefers to remain in the periphery, even when the storm warnings are visible, Grumpy always grumbles, no action talk only; and Happy being ignorant and contended with small things and unaware of the serious threats of tomorrow challenging the born and unborn commoners. \u2018Doc\u2019 bats on uncaringly, regardless of the impact of the current policies, budgetary control actions and practices of repressive governance, floating in his high and mighty position enjoyed without a public mandate, performing for the benefit of cronies, shutting his eyes to the dire state of mere existence of a majority of citizens and also to the perceived corruption and waste visible: and describing his 2048 dream and appointing committees and enquiries hiding the real short to medium term challenges.",
    "Dopey is ready to raise his hands for any law, any unacceptable budgetary actions and destroy the principles of acceptable legislative norms and codes of conduct enriching himself and enjoying the unreasonable perks of office. Sneezy stands ready to act on any command or directive of those in leadership irrespective of their public trust accountabilities by the people to be independent and not to act against the interests of the State and its people.",
    "Sleepy representing Business and Chambers is inward looking and waiting to praise every small achievement but fails to act with critical analysis, advocacy placing the interests of the nation and its people first and business second. Most regrettably Bashful is driven by petty personal priorities, political affiliations and remains anesthetised unless the emerging risk is personal and adopts a wait and see and \u201cvasi peththata hoiya\u201d. Grumpy tries hard to please his stakeholders but lacks muscle power. Happy lives within his narrow cocoon.",
    "Will the saviour Snow White, to ensure democratic and rule of law upheld good governance sans corruption and waste, come from the Judiciary, international community, the genuinely caring leaders of civil society or the ever vigilant and caring youth and young professionals\u2019 collective, acting as a well-organised pressure group via a non-political \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 or unfortunately culminate following a bloody uprising, with even more dangerous outcomes of a military or revolutionary administration grabbing power?"
