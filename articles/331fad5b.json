    "When Sri Lankan design talent takes the stage at events like London\u2019s Graduate Fashion Week, it signals more than individual success, it proves that creative youth from our island can compete globally and highlights the untapped potential of our creative industries.",
    "This year, that promise was brought to life by Nethangi Fernando, an emerging designer from AOD, who presented her final-year collection at the world\u2019s largest platform for new fashion talent. Her work, developed in collaboration with Inqube \u2014 a Brandix innovation arm showcased how local education, combined with strong industry partnerships, can deliver global impact.",
    "Following her showcase, Nethangi joined Inqube\u2019s design team, marking a smooth transition from student to professional. Her journey is a powerful example of AOD\u2019s international curriculum and industry-integrated model working together to launch creative careers that reach far beyond Sri Lanka.",
    "AOD, in partnership with Northumbria University UK, offers globally recognised design degrees right in Colombo. Based at the Colombo Innovation Tower, students gain real-world exposure through future-ready programs in Fashion, Visual Communication, Interior Architecture, Animation, and more. AOD\u2019s Design Foundation Program also provides post-O/L students with an early start toward global creative careers.",
    "AOD\u2019s education model emphasises strong industry collaboration, connecting students with leading apparel manufacturers, tech innovators, and export-driven businesses. Through live projects, internships, and mentorships, students build strong portfolios and gain market-ready experience. Nethangi\u2019s final-year collaboration with Inqube, which led to an international showcase, highlights how such exposure prepares graduates for success in global fashion and the region\u2019s innovation economy.",
    "In a world increasingly shaped by design, innovation, and digital content, creative industries are among the fastest-growing sectors. Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s rich craft heritage and export potential, creative education remains under-recognised. AOD addresses this by offering globally benchmarked programs, starting from post-O/Ls that align with international standards and local industry needs, preparing students to lead in both global and local creative economies.",
    "Nethangi joins a growing list of AOD alumni, like Amesh Wijesekara and Ruwanthi Gajadeera, who\u2019ve gained global recognition at events like London Fashion Week. Their success shows how design education can elevate both individual careers and Sri Lanka\u2019s presence in the global creative arena.",
    "For parents, educators, and policymakers, Nethangi\u2019s journey illustrates how creative education, when done right, can unlock serious professional opportunities. It challenges the conventional thinking that only traditional disciplines lead to stable or impactful careers. Design, when combined with strategy, technology, and business acumen, is a powerful force in the modern economy.",
    "AOD is committed to shaping young talent with strong foundations, global exposure, and industry readiness. Its Design Foundation Program is the perfect starting point for post-O/L students to launch successful creative careers on global platforms."
