    "At this time Anuruddha Ratwatte had emerged as the \u201cstrong man\u201d of the SLFP. As the cousin of Mrs. B he had access to her and was able to console her regarding the behaviour of her son Anura who was a captive of the anti-Sirimavo faction led by Maithripala Senanayake, who had become a favourite of the UNP. Anuruddha was living in the residence allocated to the leader of the Opposition in Colombo 7. He was the coordinator responsible for getting the signatures of the SLFP members for the impeachment motion.",
    "This was no easy task as some of them like Stanley Tillekeratne were consorting with Premadasa. I would meet Anuruddha in his residence where he was usually in the company of journalists like Victor Ivan and Sunanda Deshapriya who were able to track the anti-Premadasa moves for the readers of \u201cRavaya\u201d and \u201cYukthiya\u201d weeklies which they edited. Though the impeachment motion failed and Mrs. B was genuinely distressed by the embarrassment caused to Gamini and Lalith, the SLFP as a party gained by this manoeuvre because they were able to crack the up to now monolithic UNP apart.",
    "Mrs. B and Anura also enjoyed the humiliation of Premadasa whom they disliked at a personal level. Led by Anura who had become a skilled debater, they began to fight back in Parliament and established a cordial relationship between the SLFP and the UNP dissidents. I accompanied Gamini for several meetings with Mrs. B at her Rosmead Place residence. She had Nimal Siripala de Silva as her legal advisor at those meetings.",
    "The dissidents on the other hand were in a desperate position. They were on the verge of being driven out of the UNP by an unrelenting Premadasa. Some dissidents however wanted to remain in the party \u201cto fight another day\u201d. J. R. Jayewardene\u2019s advice was that they should remain and struggle within the party as he had done when Dudley was under pressure to expel him from the UNP. The solution which emerged was to follow a two pronged strategy. While Lalith and Gamini would face party and Supreme Court inquiries, a \u201cdummy\u201dparty was to be set up with its credentials presented to the Elections Commissioner.",
    "The new party could be activated if the duo were forced out of the UNP. The composition of the office bearers had to reflect the interests of the two leaders. Accordingly A. C. Gooneratne, a senior President\u2019s Counsel and Laliths relative, was made the President of the new party and I was made its Vice President. The Secretary was Fonseka, a lawyer from Lalith\u2019s chambers. None of us were members of the UNP and there were no complications arising regarding conflict of interest. We made an application to the Elections Commissioner for the registration of a new political party. After much deliberation we decided to seek such registration as the \u201cDemocratic United National Front\u201d [DUNF].",
    "It was an attempt to seek legitimacy as a UNP oriented outfit, while at the same time satisfying the demand by the Commissioner that it would not lead to a confusion of identities by the voter. We were lucky in that the Elections Commissioner was an old University hand who had served as a distinguished official under Gamini. He held the scales evenly but Premadasa was fighting all the way and had sent a team led by Choksy and Sirisena Cooray to file objections to our application. We were bracing for this encounter when our leaders were expelled and they were able to lead our counter attack in the Commissioners office.",
    "Having won the name of the new party we turned to the symbol and colours which had to be approved by the Commissioner. As regards the symbol someone had the bright idea to ask for the eagle or \u201cRajaliya\u201d. In Sinhala Rajaliya (meaning Eagle) can be pronounced as \u201cRaja Aliya\u201d meaning \u201cKing Elephant\u201dwhich suited the recently sacked UNPers just fine. Indeed the majority of the voting public did not bother with the appellation DUNF but referred to us as the \u201cRajaliya\u201d or King Elephant party. As regards party colours we broke new ground by asking for a combination of two colours \u2013 green and yellow. Since green was the UNP colour our platform decor had a preponderance of that colour which satisfied the UNPers who were abandoning Premadasa\u2019s UNP by the day. After a protracted inquiry the Commissioner approved our choices much to the annoyance of the President who needled his lawyers for their incompetence.",
    "However I got the sense during the inquiry that both Choksy and Cooray were not very convinced of the value of Premadasa\u2019s relentless persecution of the dissidents who were after all UNP stalwarts. But they were too afraid to argue with their leader. We on the other hand emerged from this encounter with all our demands intact.",
    "The entry of the DUNF as a third force, with its own symbol and colours, led to a considerable realignment of Sri Lankan politics. By this time there was manifest disenchantment with the autocratic ways of the new President. Also there were many businessmen who had benefited from the earlier decisions of Lalith and Gamini and were willing to bankroll the new party. The media was very supportive and we began to make headway as an efficient third force much to the annoyance of Premadasa.",
    "Our main attraction was our speakers list which included Lalith, Gamini, Premachandra, Weerawanni and a few others who could not be matched by other parties. The UNP meetings were a \u201cone man show\u201d of Premadasa who, no doubt, was an orator of the first rank. The first DUNF meeting which was held in Nugegoda was a mammoth one which scared the UNP and brought out the \u201clumpen\u201d urban supporters of Premadasa who used violence to intimidate our supporters. In Nugegoda they created a stampede and many onlookers were injured.",
    "Every meeting saw the mass crossover of UNP supporters, including some MPs, to the DUNF stage. At the Kandy meeting which was held in spite of the opposition of the Chief Minister who had become an acolyte of the President after abandoning his mentor Gamini, Muthubanda the MP for Polonnaruwa was carried on the shoulders of the bystanders to the stage from where his erstwhile boss Gamini was addressing the public. He was fired by Premadasa the following day. In Kesbewa, Lalith was attacked by the goons of a Minister who was at that time a supporter of Premadasa. We realized that politics was no longer a cakewalk. Several of us wrote our wills and testaments because the future was uncertain.",
    "We all nearly died from a grenade attack at our Pannala meeting. We planned this meeting with care because it was the political base of Gamini Jayawickreme Perera, a Premadasa loyalist. He was supported in the area by another UNP member known to be violence prone. Gamini (Dissanayake) and I left Kandy in the morning and reached Lalith\u2019s farm in Giriulla for lunch. This small plot had been inherited by Lalith from his parents and he nurtured it with great care. He loved to walk about his land in a pair of muddied rubber boots while experimenting with new breeds of rice and growing local vegetables.",
    "He had planned to feed us the products of the farm of which he was very proud of though it did not receive the same publicity as did Premadasa\u2019s farm in Ambanpola, also in the Kurunegala district. After lunch we drove to nearby Pannala for our propaganda meeting. It was a busy day for me as Hugh Fernando- a former Speaker of Parliament and the uncle of my son-in-law Rohan Fernando \u2013 had invited all of us to dinner at his house in Wennappuwa. We had started the meeting and the crowds were coming in when a live grenade was hurled at the stage on which we were seated. Had it burst on the stage all of us would have been killed instantly. However it hit a wire which was strung across the stage and fell on to the audience injuring many onlookers who had to be rushed to hospital.",
    "Naturally the dinner was not a great success. We spent time in the hospital and it was late by the time we reached Hugh Fernando\u2019s house. But he was forgiving especially after we found that he had been present \u201cincognito\u201d at the Pannala meeting and had seen the bomb attack on the DUNF stage. He was helpful to the DUNF though in the end he preferred to remain with the SLFP. Later he collapsed while leading a SLFP procession organized by Mahinda Rajapaksa and died before he could be rushed to hospital. The party asked me to represent it at the funeral which was held in Wennappuwa and in my speech I thanked him for his support. A nephew became our party organizer for the Wennappuwa electorate.",
    "While the DUNF was gathering strength in the country where we were holding well attended public meetings every week, the inevitable problem of selecting a party leader arose. Both Gamini and Lalith aspired to hold that office and there emerged a \u201ccold war\u201d among their respective supporters even though the two leaders were on good terms. They met almost daily and decided on party activities. Most importantly they shared the not inconsiderable costs of running the party propaganda machine.",
    "There were many business people who made voluntary contributions and we were able to finance our public meetings with such \u201cad hoc\u2019 support. Since I was on good terms with both leaders I could smoothen out some problems which were created by tale carriers. For instance Lalith held a meeting in the Kalutara Town Hall and a tale carrier who wanted to be the organizer rushed to Gamini alleging that Lalith had criticised him. Fortunately I happened to be at that meeting and could inform Gamini that no such thing happened.",
    "This was a difficult time for the Gamini camp because Lalith\u2019s organization was far superior and his lawyer friends were more committed to their leader. Moreover Lalith would appear in courts regularly for his supporters while Gamini\u2019s camp had to depend on lawyer friends like Nigel Hatch to represent our activists. All the while Premadasa was keeping a wary eye on the progress of the DUNF and doing everything in his power to sabotage its activities.",
    "By this time he had gathered a fawning group of courtiers led by AJ Ranasinghe who was feeding him horror stories about the DUNF and urging him to use state power to curb its progress. Some of those courtiers did not hesitate to use violence as they did in Kesbewa and Pannala. They also began to intimidate the non state media which was headed by outstanding journalists like Victor Ivan [Ravaya] and Sunanda Deshapriya [Yukthiya]. Many of them found the DUNF more responsive than the slothful SLFP which at that time was mired in internal conflicts and was intrigue prone.",
    "Independent journalists however maintained good relations with Anuruddha Ratwatte but he had no idea about getting an adequate coverage for SLFP activities. The non state media highlighted human rights abuses by the Premadasa regime. They were supported in this field by several reputed intellectuals like Reggie Siriwardene and Charles Abeysekere. The opposition managed to win the sympathy of Sinhala cultural heroes like Sarachchandra and Madoluwawe Sobhita Thero as well as religious dignitaries like Father Tissa Balasuriya of the Catholic church and several Anglican Bishops.",
    "It was an impressive collection of dissidents and Non Governmental Organizations. They were able to influence the western embassies whose leaders were themselves highlighting human rights issues. We in the DUNF were regular invitees to such embassy parties. They must have sent blood-curdling political reports to their capitals. One Ambassador of a western country told me that if my life was in danger he would personally escort me to Katunayake airport in order to ensure that I would not be kidnapped on the way by state security.",
    "President Premadasa was ill served by his media advisors. Though he was warned by close associates like Sirisena Cooray to be more tolerant he preferred to rely on the advice of his cronies like AJ Ranasinghe, Hudson Samarasinghe and Anton Alwis who were given prominent positions in the state media institutions. They suggested the launching of an aggressive approach regarding the free media using not only the state media institutions but also bringing in the police to silence critics. In the end this aggression and use of state power proved to be a boon to the opposition, particularly to the DUNF.",
    "Both Lalith and Gamini were media savvy and were always available to respond to the demands of journalists. Since they were better educated and more likely to give newsworthy interviews the free media often preferred to quote them than the SLFP which was still mired in internal wrangles. The DUNF supported the Free Media Movement which based its membership on a more radical set of journalists from the weekly Sinhala publications. They became household names in the country and created a critical readership which was hostile to Premadasa and favourable to the DUNF and the SLFP, though we were probably the biggest beneficiaries.",
    "his movement also drew in many University teachers and progressive Sinhala literati to our cause. Ravaya and Yukthiya which were close to the anti-government NGOs operating in the domain of human rights, helped in the rapid progress of the DUNF which led to further frustration in the Premadasa camp.",
