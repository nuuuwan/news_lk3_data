  "original_body_lines": [
    "Just days ago, we were told by Sri Lankan officials that trade discussions with the United States were \u201cprogressing well\u201d and all \u201cunder control.\u201d Now, we face the reality: a 30% U.S. tariff on Sri Lankan goods, effective August 1st. What happened in between? The U.S. reduced it from the potential 44% to 30%, without serious negotiations.",
    "As Sri Lanka grapples with its fragile economic recovery, the latest outcome of U.S. tariff negotiations casts a long shadow over its ability to negotiate effectively and its exports to the USA in the future. Effective August 1st, 2025, Sri Lanka finds itself lumped with Algeria, Iraq, and Libya\u2014each now subject to a staggering 30% tariff under the revised U.S. trade policy.",
    "Meanwhile, Brunei and Moldova face a 25% rate, and the Philippines has secured a more palatable 20%. Malaysia\u2019s diplomatic finesse yielded an even better deal\u2014highlighting the value of strategic engagement. Compounding the damage, Sri Lanka\u2019s regional rivals Vietnam and Bangladesh have managed to negotiate far more favorable terms, leaving Sri Lanka at a stark disadvantage in key sectors. The government seems not to have realized that this tariff is going to be a long-term issue, not limited to the period of the current president. It will further ruin the apparel market and jobs in Sri Lanka.",
    "This outcome is not a mere bureaucratic blunder despite the ability of individuals; collectively, they failed\u2014it signals a fundamental failure of negotiation abilities and leadership. The Sri Lankan delegation, as usual (we were informed), was composed of inflated egos and advisors with misplaced confidence, wrong priorities, and misjudged every critical aspect of the talks.",
    "From poor preparation and overestimation of leverage to a disturbing lack of attention to detail, the team failed to grasp the economic stakes or U.S. expectations. The apparel and rubber industries\u2014lifelines of Sri Lanka\u2019s export economy\u2014now stand exposed and vulnerable. The USA is the number one country for Sri Lankan exports of apparel, rubber, etc., with competitiveness and the advantage we had rapidly eroding, and thousands of jobs (and their families) are at risk at home.",
    "Reports from Washington suggest that the U.S. team conducted the talks with professionalism and openness. Those who were involved commented that the blame is unequivocally with the Sri Lankan team. A focused, well-prepared team should have secured concessions\u2014ideally a reduction to 15% \u2014by leveraging bilateral goodwill and shared economic interests while winning some concessions.",
    "Instead, a bloated delegation was flown out at public expense, yielding no measurable results. With the tariff set to hit in days, Sri Lanka must urgently rethink its negotiation strategy now and for the future. Notably, expertise, humility, and tactical clarity must replace arrogance and showmanship if the country hopes to restore its standing and salvage its export future.",
    "Frankly, even without dispatching an official delegation with associated taxpayer expenses, Sri Lanka may have ended up with the same tariff rate (i.e., 30%)\u2014a sobering possibility that calls into question the purpose, cost, and value of the trip itself. The absence of any discernible outcome raises serious doubts about the competence and relevance of the advisors entrusted with these negotiations. Why wasn\u2019t this tariff scaled down to the 10\u201315% range\u2014especially when comparative economies succeeded in doing so?",
    "The country deserves a candid reckoning: Who bears responsibility for this failure? What mechanisms exist to hold decision-makers accountable, especially when they make blunders? Public outrage alone cannot remedy the consequences of such costly missteps. What Sri Lanka requires now is a cadre of professionals with deep expertise to understand the broader picture. The Sri Lankan team missed the latter altogether.",
    "It is crucial to understand what the other party expected to achieve (including the minimum and maximum range) and needs for a better outcome, strategic insight, and a genuine understanding of both domestic priorities (and partner priorities) and international trade dynamics. As in this case (happened several times during the past six months), high-stakes economic diplomacy (and proper communication) cannot be left to chance\u2014or worse, to vanity. Five days more to go, 30% tariffs are going to hit Sri Lankan exports to the USA. What can the Sri Lankan government do (there are still options) to rescue itself out of this blatant failure?",
    "Despite the failure to reach a formal agreement, it is likely that the United States may unilaterally reduce tariffs\u2014typically by 5% to 10%\u2014for several countries starting August 1st. This is a common strategy used by the U.S. to encourage nations to return to the negotiating table and provide a fair deal. In parallel, many of us have directly contacted the U.S. Trade Department to advocate for a reduction in tariffs specifically for Sri Lanka.",
    "There must be transparency. There must be consequences. The damage inflicted by such ill-prepared negotiations extends far beyond spreadsheets\u2014it imperils jobs, livelihoods, and long-term national competitiveness. The people of Sri Lanka deserve a government that recognizes its shortcomings and course-corrects with urgency. Nevertheless, as history tells us, accountability remains elusive\u2014and once again, we are left holding our breath."
