    "In a landmark achievement for Sri Lanka\u2019s tech industry,\u00a0OREL IT\u00a0has earned the\u00a0TIA-942-C Design Certification\u00a0for its upcoming Tier III data centre in Nawinna, Maharagama \u2013 making it the first Sri Lankan company to attain this globally recognized standard.",
    "The certification validates the facility\u2019s ability to deliver\u00a099.982% uptime, placing it among the world\u2019s most resilient data infrastructures and signaling Sri Lanka\u2019s growing capacity to develop\u00a0homegrown, enterprise-grade digital solutions.",
    "Since 2014, OREL IT has disrupted Sri Lanka\u2019s data centre market, becoming the first to deploy\u00a0Modular Data Centres (MDCs) \u2013 a gamble that paid off, with five MDCs now operating flawlessly, some for over a decade. Last year, the company expanded into cloud services, launching Sri Lanka\u2019s\u00a0largest cloud infrastructure\u00a0and its only\u00a0NIST-compliant sovereign private cloud, ensuring data remains onshore for compliance-sensitive sectors like finance and government.",
    "The\u00a0TIA-942-C certification\u00a0is a rigorous benchmark, assessing everything from power redundancy to physical security. Tier III status means the facility can undergo maintenance\u00a0without service disruption \u2013 a critical requirement for banks, hospitals, and state institutions. Notably, OREL IT secured the certification\u00a0before construction, minimising costly redesigns and accelerating timelines. The facility, set for completion in 2025, will join OREL\u2019s existing network, which includes:",

    "With eight data centre projects underway \u2013 four certified, two in construction, and one upgrading to Tier III \u2013 OREL IT now competes directly with regional telecom giants in cloud services. Crucially, its entire operation is\u00a0designed and managed by Sri Lankan engineers, proving global-tier infrastructure can be built domestically.",
    "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about technology. It\u2019s about Sri Lanka\u2019s digital sovereignty,\u201d\u00a0said an OREL IT spokesperson.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re creating capacity, not just consuming it.\u201d",
    "The new facility will offer businesses\u00a0fully local, world-class data services, reducing reliance on foreign providers and strengthening national data security \u2013 a strategic leap as Sri Lanka eyes regional tech leadership.",
