  "original_title": "The End Of Another Schools Rugby Season \u2013 Bitter Lessons Learned",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The final whistle blew, but it didn\u2019t just end the match \u2014 it ended months of bruises, long bus rides, and dreams that didn\u2019t quite land. This season was a hard teacher. We learned that talent without discipline falters, that teamwork cracks under pressure if trust isn\u2019t there, and that grit is built only through failure. The scoreboard stung, but the real damage was in the gaps we never closed. We\u2019ll carry these lessons into the off-season, because pain fades \u2014 but the truth it leaves behind sticks.",
    "While this season showcased outstanding performances and thrilling rugby, the spirit of the game was tarnished by unacceptable lapses in discipline from both players and spectators.",
    "This season delivered exceptional rugby on the field\u2014but its legacy has been severely marred by disgraceful lapses in discipline, both from players and sections of the crowd. In particular, the conduct of some old boys and parents, easily identifiable in their school colours, was wholly unacceptable and damaging to the reputation of school rugby.",
    "The repeated invasion of the field at decisive moments, coupled with aggressive and desperate attempts to pressure referees, is an affront to the integrity of the game. Such behaviour is not passion\u2014it is misconduct. It erodes the values of respect, fairness, and discipline that school sport is meant to instil.",
    "This is no longer a matter for polite reminders. Rugby administrators, school heads, old boys\u2019 unions, parents, coaches, and players must be held accountable. Immediate measures are required:",
    "* Zero tolerance for pitch invasions, with offenders removed and banned from future matches.",
    "* Strict sanctions on schools whose supporters or players breach the code of conduct, including suspension from tournaments if necessary.",
    "* Clear enforcement by match officials and security, with full backing from governing bodies.",
    "If these standards are not enforced decisively, the proud tradition of schools rugby will be replaced by chaos, and its credibility will collapse. The game deserves better\u2014and it is the responsibility of all stakeholders to protect it.",
    "And for all the gracious losers\u2026 the season has come to a close, bringing with it a mix of pride, frustration, and reflection. While there were moments of promise, the overall campaign fell short of expectations.",
    "Several matches slipped from your grasp in the final minutes, highlighting gaps in discipline, fitness, and decision-making under pressure. Injuries to key players also forced last-minute changes to the squad, testing depth and adaptability.",
    "Despite these setbacks, teams showed resilience, with younger players stepping into bigger roles and gaining valuable experience. Coaches and players agree that the lessons from this season \u2014 sharper preparation, better communication, and stronger mental focus \u2014 will be essential in the months ahead.",
    "The season\u2019s results may not have met your\u00a0 ambitions, but the foundation for improvement is in place. The team now turns its attention to off-season training, determined to return stronger next year.",
    "*Mahil Dole SSP rtd \u2013 former player who represented UVA Gymkhana Sports Club, Dickoya- Maskeliya CC and Secretary Police Rugby."
