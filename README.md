### What will it take for a (quick) win on anti-corruption?

*2024-12-02 22:37:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-will-it-take-for-a-quick-win-on-anti-corruption/4-769992) · `en`

If the executive fails to act, the appropriate oversight committee of Parliament must act

The elements of a solution can be discerned: Use the trial-at-bar and direct appeal to Supreme Court procedure used in Mahanama. Work out a solution, in the form of an amendment to the relevant statute if necessary, to expedite the appeal.

But this will still not put a big fish behind bars within 12 months. But it will get the job done within the term of a government, unlike in the case of Premaratne who served in the 6th Parliament which ended in 2010. The case dragged on through the 7th, 8th, and 9th Parliaments

I was at a meeting where a highly respected and experienced colleague said the Government must conclude a successful prosecution of a “big fish” within the first year or lose all credibility. They rode to power on the corruption narrative and have to deliver, he said.

If he is right, I thought, the Government is in trouble. Unlike my colleague, I had done timelines for the big-fish cases.

*2024-12-02 22:32:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Vote-on-Account-and-why/4-769991) · `en`

This is the first time in the history of our legislature since the days of the first State Council of 1931 that a VOA will be proposed on the basis of a law passed by the Parliament. The recently enacted Public Financial Management Act No. 44 effective on 8 August 2024 has built in provisions for the submission of a VOA to the Parliament. Hence the examination of the background and procedure with respect to VOA is important and timely. A major legal deficiency that had been in existence for decades with respect to submission of VOA was circumvented by a law passed by the Parliament in 2024

“As the principal legal officer of my country, I have come before this court because domestic legal remedies are unable to address a crisis of the scope and magnitude,” he said during the opening session of two weeks of hearings.

“It is not possible to develop a country without the moral development of man. Let us develop the country along with moral development (of man)” So pronounced Most Ven Madihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Thero. This translation from Sinhala is by Ven Vajiraramaya Nanaseeha Thera – previously Deshabandhu Olcott Gunasekera – who was one who assisted the venerable bhikkhu to establish the Dharmavijaya Foundation in 1977. The Foundation later adopted this truth as its mission statement. Moral development connotes character building.

The thought about the quirks and misdemeanours of most Sri Lankans which ultimately tarnish the wellbeing and image of the country has long been in mind and discussed frequently when we older generations meet and grow nostalgic of how things were back then. We most definitely had a much better life, though sans TV and all these advances, since peace and general goodness prevailed.

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.

### Fine sportsman, great debater, big appetite but weak stomach

Dudley Senanayake in the short Parliament of March to July 1960

Family and background had been central in Dudley Senanayake’s case too. Greatness had literally been thrust on him when he had been appointed prime minister on the death of his father D S, in 1952. That had been a time of intrigue and maneuvering which had soured the relations between Sir John, his close relative and him.

Sir John had struck back with the Premier Stakes which he later denied having any connection with. So Dudley had been anxious to win his spurs for himself through the hustings as early as possible. And he had proved his legitimacy by winning the 1952 elections handsomely, helped by the sympathy vote created by the death of his father. But his first stint as prime minister did not last long. Plagued by illness, chronic gastritis and the hartal of August 1953 which resulted in police firing and some civilian deaths, Dudley resigned.
