    "Commenting further, Ratnayake said: \u201cUsually in presidential elections, the percentage of votes cast is more than 80%. But this time, a fewwer number of votes have been used. For this, we have to think not only from the side of the commission, but the political parties have the role of bringing the people to the polling stations in order to cast votes. We provide that necessary facility. We request the political parties to prepare some sort of program for that.\u201d"
