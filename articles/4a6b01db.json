    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe may not have expected that his refusal to abide by the Supreme Court (SC) order that an Acting IGP be appointed would trigger a wave of public anger against him. He has unwittingly helped his political opponents bolster their claim that he will become even more uncontrollable, and democracy will suffer a coup de grace if he is popularly elected.",
    "President Wickremesinghe has sought to shift the onus for cleaning up the mess of his own making to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene, who has now had to put his neck on the line. The latter cannot be unaware that politicians have to face the consequences of their actions and lapses when they retire, former President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s current predicament being a case in point.",
    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has said he will do everything in his power to ensure that all those who have defied the SC order in question are prosecuted for contempt of court if he wins the upcoming presidential election. In fact, he has made that issue one of the main planks of his election platform. He has struck a responsive chord with the public. NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also condemned the President\u2019s refusal to carry out the SC order in question.",
    "Pro-government lawyers are selectively quoting from the Constitution to buttress their claim that the EC cannot hold an election unless there is a serving IGP. Article 104C (1) says: \u201cUpon the making of an order for the holding of an election or the making of a proclamation requiring the conduct of a referendum, as the case may be, the Commission shall notify the Inspector-General of Police of the facilities and the number of police officers required by the Commission for the holding or conduct of such election or referendum, as the case may be. Article 104C (2) says: \u201cThe Inspector-General of Police shall make available to the Commission the facilities and police officers specified in any notification made under paragraph (1) of this Article.\u201d This may have prompted President Wickremesinghe to declare at a public rally, in Homagama, over the weekend, that the absence of an IGP would affect the upcoming presidential election; he drew heavy flak by offering to have the issue resolved expeditiously through a powwow between the Chief Justice and the Speaker.",
    "Now that President Wickremesinghe has put forth the aforesaid argument, he has to mind and act in accordance with Article 33 (c), which says the President has the power to \u2018ensure the creation of proper conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections, at the request of the Election Commission\u2019. Thus, he is constitutionally required to exercise his executive power to appoint an Acting IGP and thereby create one of the proper conditions for the conduct of a free and fair election at the request of the EC, or be accused of wilfully violating the Constitution. Elections have been held in this country with the Police Department functioning under Acting IGPs.",
    "Meanwhile, the EC has revealed that it had met IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon before the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing him from functioning as the police chief, and arrangements had been made for the upcoming election. It has said it can hold the presidential election with the help of the Senior DIG handling election related matters. The EC has also said in no uncertain terms that the fact that President Wickremesinghe is contesting the upcoming presidential election does not disqualify him from carrying out his constitutionally-stipulated duties and functions including the creation of conditions for the conduct of a free and fair election; he can appoint an Acting IGP, it has said. Thus, those who insist that the incumbent President cannot appoint an Acting IGP because he is a presidential candidate do not have a leg to stand on. The EC has reportedly decided to urge the President to resolve the issue at hand promptly. In other words, it is requesting the President to act in accordance with Article 33 (c).",
    "It is up to President Wickremesinghe to carry out the SC order at issue and clean up the mess forthwith or forge ahead in the wrong direction, cross the point of no return and face the consequences of his ill-conceived course of action, which is bound to be defeated by all those who uphold the rule of law.",
