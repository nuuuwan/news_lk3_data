    "President Trump has signed an executive order rebranding the US Department of Defense as the Department of War.",
    "He called the original name \u201cwoke\u201d and said the new title sent \u201ca message of victory\u201d and \u201ca message of strength\u201d.",
    "It can only be used as a secondary title unless Congress approves the change - but the department\u2019s website has already switched to war.gov - as have its social media accounts.",
    "The door of Pete Hegsesth\u2019s office has also been adorned with a fresh \u201cSecretary of War\u201d sign.",
    "Mr Hegseth said the move wasn\u2019t \u201cpolitically correct\u201d but that it showed \u201cwe\u2019re going to go on offence\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to raise up warriors, not just defenders,\u201d he added.",
    "President Trump signed the executive order in the White House\u2019s Oval Office on Friday.",
    "\u201cWe won the First World War. We won the Second World War. We won everything before that and in between,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAnd then we decided to go woke and we changed the name to Department of Defense. So we\u2019re going Department of War.\u201d",
    "The president denied the rebrand ran contrary to his peacemaking efforts - which he claims have already \u201cended seven wars\u201d.",
    "\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten peace because of the fact that we\u2019re strong,\u201d he told reporters.",
    "The official executive order states that the name \u201cdemonstrates our ability and willingness to fight and win wars on behalf of our Nation at a moment\u2019s notice, not just to defend\u201d.",
    "It also commands Mr Hegseth to pursue legislation within 60 days to make the change permanent.",
    "The Department of Defense - often referred to colloquially as the Pentagon due to the shape of its Washington HQ - was called the War Department from 1789 until 1949.",
    "Historians say the name was changed to show the US was focused on preventing conflict following the Second World War.",
    "President Trump\u2019s reversion to the previous more combative title could end up costing tens of millions, with letterheads and building signs in the US and at military bases around the world potentially needing a refresh.",
    "Joe Biden\u2019s effort to rename nine army bases honouring the Confederacy and Confederate leaders, set to cost $39m (\u00a329m), was reversed by Mr Hegseth earlier this year.",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s other federal renaming orders include controversially labelling the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf Of America\u201d and reverting North America\u2019s tallest mountain, Denali in Alaska, to its former name of Mount McKinley.",
    "The Mexican government and Alaska\u2019s Republican senators both rejected the changes."
