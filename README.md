දින ගණනක් පුරා රජයට එරෙහිව පැවති විරෝධතා ප්‍රචණ්ඩ මුහුණුවරක් ගනිද්දී බංග්ලාදේශ අගමැතිනි ෂෙයික් හසීනා අද (05) සිය ධුරයෙන් ඉල්ලා අස්වී රටින් පළා ගියාය.

බංග්ලාදේශ හමුදා ප්‍රධානියා ජාතිය අමතමින් අද නිවේදනය කළේ රට තුළ කඩිනමින් අන්තර්වාර රජයක් පිහිටුවන බවය.

බංග්ලාදේශ සරසවි සිසුන් ගෙවුණු ජූලි මාසයේ දී දැවැන්ත විරෝධතාවක් ආරම්භ කළේ රජයේ රැකියා කෝටා ක්‍රමවේදයට විරෝධය පළකරමිනි.

ඩකා අගනුවර කේන්ද්‍ර කරගෙන රට පුරා පැතිර ගිය එම විරෝධතා අතරතුරදී 300කට ආසන්න පිරිසක් මරණයට පත්වුණි.

අර්බුදයට තුඩුදුන් රැකියා කෝටා ක්‍රමවේදය අවලංගු කරන ලෙස ශ්‍රේෂ්ඨාධිකරණය නියෝග කළේ විරෝධතා පාලනයට රජය අනුගමනය කළ එම දැඩි මර්දනකාරී පිළිවෙතට ජාත්‍යන්තරයෙන් පවා එල්ලවූ විවේචන හමුවේ ය.

නමුත් ඉන් නොනැවතුණු ශිෂ්‍ය ක්‍රියාකාරීන් රැකියා කෝටාවට එරෙහි විරෝධතාව රජයට එරෙහි දැවැන්ත විරෝධතාවක් බවට පරිවර්තනය කරමින් යළි උද්ඝෝෂණ ආරම්භ කළේ මීට දින කිහිපයකට පෙරාතුවය.

ඒ, පෙර විරෝධතා අතරතුර මියගිය පිරිසට යුක්තිය ඉටුකර ධුරයෙන් ඉවත්වන්නැයි අගමැතිනි ෂෙයික් හසීනාට බල කරමිනි.

A countdown of 49 days starting on Sunday, August 4.

To continue where I left last week, Kamala Harris is till riding high, and Donald Trump is finally being exposed for his crass limitations. But with 94 days to go there is plenty of time left for twists and turns, and ups and downs.

### Monster assembled from human flaws? Frankenstein would make a Trump

*2024-08-05 10:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/monster-assembled-from-human-flaws-frankenstein-would-make-a-trump/) · `en`

Someone asked “Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?” Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever.

I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.
