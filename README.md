My mother was my first and the last teacher. If she’s looking down from heaven, I suspect she’s quietly pleased with how I’ve navigated this world. She taught me to revere Dr. Samuel Johnson, not just as an erudite Englishman and lexicographer, but as a philosopher who warned, “Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.” She also introduced me to Mrs. Malaprop, that delightfully misguided character from 18th-century theatre, who mangled words with misplaced confidence.

Thanks to my beloved mother, I developed an early aversion to linguistic misuse. Whether in Sinhala or English, the wrong word in the wrong place grates on my ears like a surgical blade drawn across bone and in Sri Lanka, where both languages are wielded by the “educated,” the misuse is rampant.

Can Tamils be bought over so easily?

Many of us in the Tamil Country were willing to forget that one of the JVP’s five lessons in 1971 was that we Tamils are intrinsicallly chauvinistic and a fifth column for India as Indian aircraft and helicopters straffed JVP positions in 1971.

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday approved calling for expressions of interest (EoIs) from both local and foreign investors to implement a public-private partnership (PPP) project on a 30-acre site allocated from Paranthan Chemicals Company Ltd.

The initiative seeks to re-establish a caustic soda and chlorine manufacturing facility at the former premises of the Paranthan Chemical Factory. Paranthan Chemicals has already completed a feasibility study and is preparing detailed plans to restart operations at the site.

Currently, the company imports chlorine for nationwide distribution, as the entire domestic requirement for water purification depends on imports. Officials have warned that this reliance leaves the country’s water purification system vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved updating the country’s National Policy on Senior Citizens, first introduced in 2006.

The revision comes in response to shifting global and domestic demographic trends. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the proportion of Sri Lankans aged 60 years and above is projected to rise to 24.8% by 2052. As a result, this demographic shift demands stronger measures to safeguard the welfare and rights of senior citizens.

The updated national policy is designed to enable older citizens to live with dignity in supportive social, economic, physical, and spiritual environments. Developed under the theme “Respectful Senior Citizen – Meaningful Retirement”, the framework emphasises both protection and empowerment, aligning with the Government’s broader policy priorities.
