    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka currently has 24 sites of historic and cultural significance yet only recognises and markets 16, according to the Central Cultural Fund.",
    "\u201cWe make use of digital media platforms such as YouTube to promote our historic sites,\u201d said Prof Gamini Fernando, Director General of the Central Cultural Fund. \u201cWe also make use of UNESCO and international hotel chains in order to market our sites. However, there are other sites that do not fall under tourist attractions and these come under the purview of the department of archaeology. These sites are not marketed as tourist\u2019s destinations.\u201d",
    "The pre-colonial occupation ruins of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte and the Raja Maha Viharaya are not considered tourist attractions, as per the Central Cultural Fund.",
    "SLTDA Chairman Priyantha Fernando said, however, that the archaeological sites in Kotte are of not much significance.",
    "\u201cAs there is only a rampart and a few other ruins, the ruins in Kotte are not as significant as those in other areas and they are not popular with tourists,\u201d he said.",
    "According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the country\u2019s crisis-hit tourism industry has seen an improvement and made progress in its target of 1.5 million tourists, which they have now revised to 2 million for the year 2023.\u00a0 This improvement is due to the recovery from the pandemic and the economic crisis, the SLTA has said.
