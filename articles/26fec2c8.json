  "original_title": "Did the LTTE get the Idea of  Suicide Bombers Using an Explosive Packed Belt  from  Author Frederick  Forsyth\u2019s Novel \u201d The Negotiator\u201d?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Is there a connection  between popular English  novelist Frederick Forsyth  who breathed his last on 9 June 2025 and  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) that was militarily defeated by the Sri Lankan armed forces in May 2009? The  answer to this question would be a simple \u201cno\u201d.  However It must be said that for a while there was intense speculation that a device  featured  in a  novel written by  Frederick Forsyth had  been copied by the LTTE known as the tigers to assassinate people!",
    "It all began with the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by the LTTE on 21 May 1991 at Sriperumbudhoor in the Tamil Nadu state of India. Rajiv Gandhi the leader of India\u2019s Congress party   was in Sriperumpudhoor to address an  election propaganda meeting in support of Congress party candidate Maragatham Chandrasekhar.",
    "It was then that a Sri Lankan Tamil girl known by the name of \u201cDhanu\u201d got close to Rajiv Gandhi and gave him a sandalwood garland. The be-spectacled girl in an orange and green churidar then bent down respectfully to touch Rajiv\u2019s feet. She set off an explosive device concealed in a belt that was strapped to her body. Rajiv Gandhi, the assailant Dhanu and at least 18 others were killed in the blast. 42 were seriously injured.",
    "The assassination rocked India and  caused shock waves around the world. This was the first instance of an explosive-packed \u201csuicide belt\u201d being used in an assassination attempt.Explosive-laden vehicles had been used but the Rajiv assassination was the first recorded incident where a suicide belt was used.  In later years the LTTE was to use suicide bombers known as \u201cBlack Tigers\u201d in many attacks .It became a hallmark of the LTTE.",
    "It was but natural for the Rajiv Gandhi  assassination to become a hot topic of media discussion in India. Many theories were floated. One such theory which caused  much excitement was that the tigers had got the idea of an explosive-laden suicide belt from the  Frederick Forsyth best-seller \u201cThe Negotiator\u201dpublished in 1989. In that fictitious  novel the bad guys use a bomb belt to kill the son of a US president.",
    "In a bizarre co-incidence, there were many similarities between the explosive belt used in the fictitious novel and the real explosive belt worn by the tiger assassin Dhanu to kill Rajiv.According to  media reports quoting  Indian investigators and analysts , both belts were made of leather and denim with a Velcro closure;both  belts were three inches wide with the inserted  explosives  being strapped to the backbone.",
    "There was a tremendous media buzz then linking Forsyth\u2019s  novel with the Rajiv killing .If I remember correctly,one Indian journalist even interviewed Frederick Forsyth. Although speculative theories and arguments were galore, no concrete linkage was ever proved  that the LTTE had got the idea of an explosive-laden suicide belt from \u201cThe Negotiator\u201d. It may or may not have been an example of life imitating art.  However it did serve to re-inforce the impression that Frederick Forsyth was indeed the  \u201cmaster of the geo-political thriller\u201d, as the \u201cNew York Times\u201dchose to describe him.",
    "There were three British writers whose \u201cspy thriller\u201dnovels, I was immemsely fond of reading(still am). The first, Ian Fleming , passed away decades ago in 1964. The second , who breathed his last some years ago ,in 2020 was John le Carre. The third who died a few days ago,was of course,Frederick Forsythe. Fleming\u2019s James Bond was a romanticised man of action. Le Carre\u2019s George Smiley  was a calculating thinker relying more on psychology.Forsythe however was different.",
    "Frederick Forsyth had no regular hero. He wrote about different characters in his books. His diverse  plots were based on different issues relating to subjects like intrigue,surveillance, geo-politics, statecraft,national security, realpolitik and the deep  state. His  well researched writing was meticulously precise and instructively informative. He was a gripping story-teller whose riveting  narratives were intricate yet believable and above all easy to comprehend and relish.",
    "Forsyth\u2019s ability to feature realistic international crises and his insider\u2019s descriptions of military and governmental operations have been especially noted by critics. As  \u201cDictionary of Literary Biography\u201d contributor Andrew F. Macdonald observed about  Forsyth, \u201cthe sense of immediacy, on an insider\u2019s view of world affairs, of all-too-human world figures, as well as quick-paced plots, are the keys to the author\u2019s popularity.\u201d",
    "According to the encyclopedi.com \u201cRealism is the key word behind the novels of Frederick Forsyth. Often credited as the originator of a new genre, the \u201cdocumentary thriller,\u201da genre first made popular by Truman Capote\u2019s \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d.  The detail in Forsyth\u2019s novels depends not only on the months of research he spends on each book but also on his own varied personal experiences, which lend even greater authenticity to his writing.",
    "Despite the success and popularity of his  books, Frederick Forsyth was looked down upon by many literary pundits and high brow critics His simple prose though lucid was dismissed snootily as  inelegant and pedestrian. His attention to realistic  detail was mocked as a  \u201cgraceless prose style \u201c. . He was also  accused at times of  being a painstaking reporter and not an imaginative writer.The literary critic Julian Symons  dismissed Forsyth as having \u201cno pretension to anything more than journalistic expertise\u201d.",
    "Forsyth however took this criticism lightly saying that he had no pretensions of being a literary icon. He  wrote  to entertain readers and earn money ,said  Forsyth, citing the millions of his published books being sold  as proof.",
    "Frederick Mccarthy Forsyth was born on 25 August 1938 in Ashford,Kent .His parents ran a business  at 4 North Street, with his mother Phyllis  selling dresses and father  Frederick snr selling furs. Young Frederick studied at a private school in Tonbridge, Kent. He displayed a flair for languages and became proficient  and fluent in French,German,,Russian and of course English.",
    "Being an only child,Frederick was lonely during childhood and  took to reading books avidly. Fascinated by Ernest Hemingway\u2019s book on bullfighting in Spain, \u201cDeath in the Afternoon\u201d,Forsyth enrolled at the Granada University in Spain to study Spanish  while trying  to become a bullfighter. After some months he returned home and enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He became a fighter pilot and was designated as  flying officer in 1958.",
    "Though Forsyth wanted to be stationed overseas in a RAF frontline squadron,he was posted   to the  Royal Auxiliary Air Force locally. This was not to his liking. The fighter pilot quit the RAF and became a journalist at the Eastern Daily Press. After a few years, Forsyth joined the news agency Reuters and was posted to the news bureau in Paris and later in  Berlin.  Some years later he went back to  Britain and joined the British Broadcasting Coropration(BBC) as a diplomatic correspondent.",
    "A pogrom unleashed against the Igbo people of Nigeria in 1967 in which thousands were slaughtered and millions displaced  resulted in the Igbo majority areas of Eastern Nigeria seceding and declaring the independent state of Biafra. BBC sent Forsyth as its correspondent to Biafra.",
    ".However the Nigerian Govt refused to let Biafra secede and a brutal civil war ensued. Soon British policy turned against Biafra.Frederick Forsyth fell foul of the British authorities as well as BBC bigwigs for being  supportive of the secessionists.",
    "Forsyth quit the BBC but stayed on in Biafra as a freelance journalist. He became a close associate and friend of Biafra\u2019s ruler Gen. Odumegwu Ojukwu.At the same time Forsyth also became a spy and informant of the British Secret Intelligence Service known as M16. The Biafra secession was gradually suppressed  militarily.",
    "In 1969 Forsyth  in a Quixotic attempt to aid the  Biafrans, wrote and published a  book \u201cThe Biafra Story\u201d .Seven months later the Biafran revolt was totally crushed. Forsyth returned to Britain a few weeks before the  Biafran civil war ended. Years later Forsyth expanded  his book on Biafra and published it under the title \u201c The Making of an African Legend: The Biafra Story\u201d.in 1977.",
    "Frederick Forsyth was now  back in Britain without a job. He was financially in dire straits. A kind friend gave him a bed in his flat. A desperate Forsyth thought of writing a  book to earn some cash .When Forsyth was  working in Paris for Reuters,there had been some attempts by some French ex-army officers to assassinate the then French president Charles de Gaulle. They were angry with De Gaulle for granting freedom to the French north African colony Algeria. None of the assassination attempts  succeeded.",
    "Forsyth now thought of writing a book based on those assassination attempts. Since De Gaulle was never assassinated, the novel was going to be an imaginary attempt that failed. It would be  about a British assassin codenamed \u201cJackal\u201dbeing hired to kill De Gaulle and the French Police trying to prevent it.Forsyth wrote the book \u201cDay of the Jackal\u201din 35 days.",
    "Mike Ripley writing an obituary  for Frederick Forsyth in \u201cThe Guardian\u201d states as follows \u2013 \u201c Frederick Forsyth always claimed that when, in early 1970, as an unemployed foreign correspondent, he sat down at a portable typewriter and \u201cbashed out\u201d The Day of the Jackal, he \u201cnever had the slightest intention of becoming a novelist\u201d.",
    "\u201cForsyth\u2019s manuscript for The Day of the Jackal was rejected by three publishers and withdrawn from a fourth before being taken up by Hutchinson in a three-book deal in 1971. Even then there were doubts, as half the publisher\u2019s sales force were said to have expressed no confidence in a book that plotted the assassination of the French president General Charles de Gaulle \u2013 an event that everyone knew did not happen.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe skill of the book was that its pace and seemingly forensic detail encouraged readers to suspend disbelief and accept that not only was the plot real, but that the Jackal \u2013 an anonymous assassin \u2013 almost pulled it off. In fact, at certain points, the reader\u2019s sympathy lies with the Jackal rather than with his intended  victim.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt was a publishing tour de force, winning the Mystery Writers\u2019 of America  award for best first novel, attracting a record paperback deal at the Frankfurt book fair and being quickly filmed by the US director Fred Zinnemann, with Edward Fox as the ruthless Jackal. Forsyth was offered a flat fee for the film rights (\u00a320,000) or a fee plus a percentage of the profits \u2013 he took the flat fee, later admitting that he was \u201cpathetic at money\u201d.The 1972 paperback edition of The Day of the Jackal was reprinted 33 times  and is still in print\u201d.",
    "\u201cDay of the Jackal\u201dwas the first of a trilogy. The second was \u201cThe Odessa File\u201dpublished in 1972. It was about a reporter who is trying to track an ex_nazi war criminal hiding in Germany. He is allegedly protected by a secret  ex -Nazi Nazi organization named ODESSA. The novel was made into a film starring Jon Voight,Mary Tamm Mazmilian and Maria Schell.",
    "The  final novel in the Trilogy was \u201cDogs of War\u201d. This was about a British mining executive hiring mercenaries   to overthrow  an African country Govt and  install a puppet regime that would  allow  cheap access to a huge  platinum-ore  deposit . This novel  too was made into a film starring Tom Berenger and Christopher Walken.",
    "Frederick Forsyth in a  creative writing career spanning more than five decades wrote several novels and many  short stories. They were all published and  well received. The triple jewels  in his writing crown were his three early novels \u2013 \u201cDay of the Jackal\u201d, \u201cThe Odessa File\u201d and \u201cDogs of War\u201d.All three best sellers were made into films and  all were box office hits too",
    "Frederick Forsyth married  a former model Carole Cunningham in 1973 The couple had two sons. After an amicable divorce in 1988, Forsythe wedded Sandy Molloy in 1994. She died in 2024 .Forsyth  was also linked romantically to actress Faye Dunaway briefly. Frederick Forsyth died  on June 9th 2025 at his home in Jordans, Buckinghamshire at the age of 86 after a short illness.",
