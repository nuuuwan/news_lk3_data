The Sri Lankan airlines‚Äô advertisement promoting the Ramayana Trail has garnered praise for showcasing locations tied to the epic.

An advertisement by Sri Lankan Airlines showcasing the ‚ÄúRamayana Trail‚Äù, a journey through the iconic locations connected to the story of Ramayana, has won hearts on the internet.

The five-minute advertisement shows a grandmother narrating the story of the Hindu epic to her grandson from a children‚Äôs book. The grandson asks about the island where Ravan took Sita after kidnapping her. The grandmother then tells him the story of the kingdom of Ravan in modern-day Sri Lanka.

‚ÄúAll the places in the Ramayana are real. Today we know Lanka as Sri Lanka,‚Äù she says, as the video shows visuals of Ravan‚Äôs Cave near Ella town, where Sita is believed to have kept before she was moved to the Ashoka Vatika inside the demon king‚Äôs palace.

### China

*2024-11-10 15:10:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198310) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



China expands operations in Sri Lanka after coup. Provides 100% school uniforms, builds low-income housing. Chinese contractors oversee projects. China strengthens Anuragumara Dissanayake government influence. US regime change aids China's expansion strategy in Sri Lanka.

üü©

Following the coup in Sri Lanka, China has begun to expand and accelerate its operations.

China's involvement with the Sri Lankan government has increased since Anuragumara Dissanayake, who was described by the Western media as the President of the Marxist.

In 2025, China has announced that it will provide the entire uniform cloth to schoolchildren.

After the economic crisis, China offered to provide uniform clothes to Sri Lankan students.

In 2023, China gave 70 percent uniform cloth. The Sri Lankan government paid the remaining 30 percent.

80 percent uniform fabric was donated by China in 2024. The remaining 20 percent was resolved by the Sri Lankan government.

Even when Ranil Wickremesinghe was in power- even when the Sri Lankan economic crisis was at its peak, China had not come before the 100 per cent uniform cloth to the students.

China was acting in the tone that should be given and not to be fully given.
