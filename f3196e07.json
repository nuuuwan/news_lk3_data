    "Stresses no low-income individual or vulnerable group in society will be left behind",
    "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has emphasised that if mistakes and shortcomings have occurred in the selection of beneficiaries for the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 programme, they will be",
    "rectified without fail, and assured that no low-income persons or patients of various diseases will be left behind.",
    "He said that this welfare programme has been included in the IMF agreement for the protection of low-income earners and vulnerable, and the President has given a very clear pledge that he hopes to expand it.",
    "Gunawardena said that the aim of the programme is to provide benefits to a greater number of low-income earners than before, and that the time for submitting appeals has not ended.",
    "He made these clarifications in response to the statements made by several MPs recently that there were deficiencies in the survey to select low-income beneficiaries for the relief programme.",
    "\u201cThis survey was implemented in the last few months. At that time too, as some officers did not participate, additional special qualified youth volunteered to conduct the survey. Accordingly, the welfare board has completed the first round of that challenge with our government officials across the country.",
    "This welfare programme has been included for the protection of low-income earners in the last budget document and in the IMF agreement which was presented and approved by our parliament.\u00a0And the President has given a very clear pledge that he hopes to expand it,\u201d Gunawardena stressed.",
    "\u201cPeople with low income and suffering from various diseases cannot be removed in any way. Therefore, the time for filing appeals in this matter is still running. If there is any question to participate in it, please let authorities know. It is the hope of the government to provide opportunities to more people with low income than before,\u201d he added.",
    "The Premier said the government can get more international support for the programme and if there is a deficiency in the work by the departments conducting the surveys as mentioned by the Opposition Leader, the government will take necessary steps to work accordingly and make the Aswesuma as a separate department immediately to reach the goal."
