  "original_body_lines": [
    "Quite understandably, the government of Israel is coming in for scathing international criticism for its current military operations against Arab and Islamic states in the Middle East coupled with its atrocities in the Gaza Strip. However, the US is as much to blame as Israel on these questions. Because it is the US\u2019 unyielding support for Israel on the policy front that is helping to sustain Israel\u2019s war of aggression in the region.",
    "While it is doubtful whether Israel would change course drastically in the Middle East in the event of the US pursuing a tougher policy line on it and pressuring it to de-escalate its war of aggression, there is no doubt that decreasing material and moral support for Israel by the US would set Israel thinking and compel it to weigh more seriously the consequences of its actions. However, as matters stand, such a situation is unlikely to come to pass any time soon and the US would need to countenance rising international censure.",
    "While it is quite some time since the US lost considerable European support for its policy course in the Middle East, the prospects currently are that even the few but important allies it had in the Arab and Islamic worlds may not be there for it on account of Israel\u2019s continuing military campaigns in the region.",
    "Meanwhile, the US would also need to contend with the fact that, as this is being written, a UN Commission of Inquiry has found Israel guilty of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. In other words, Israel is facing the censure of almost the totality of the international community over its excesses in the Gaza. Relevant UN organs are now obliged to make Israel face the full force of International Law and subject it to a stringent accountability process.",
    "The consequences from the recent Israeli military strike on Qatar, aimed at wiping out the Hamas leadership, prove the point. An Arab-Islamic Summit was held in Qatar in the aftermath of the attack and the overall tone of the meet did not give the US much cause for comfort.",
    "The possibility is that Israel\u2019s hard line positions would only help in bringing the Arab-Islamic world closer together, perhaps as never before, against the US-Israel combine. Qatar\u2019s national sovereignty was grossly violated in the Israeli air strikes and this no state could live down easily.",
    "The fact that the US joined the rest of the UN Security Council (UNSC) recently in condemning the Israeli military strikes on Qatar, without naming Israel, would not do much to undo the notoriety acquired by the US as an unquestioning, uncritical ally of Israel. However, concrete and constructive actions by the US to rein-in Israel and make it a reliable partner in bringing peace to the region through diplomatic and political means could perhaps help in projecting the US as a major actor in the realization of international peace.",
    "President Trump is in the UK at present and it will be a matter of prime interest to the observer to ascertain whether the Trump administration could be persuaded by Britain to change policy course in the Middle East.",
    "However, a huge damage-control exercise awaits the US and other sections of the world community that are desirous of moving the Middle East in the direction of a negotiated settlement. This is on account of the considerable bitterness and disillusionment the allies of the US committed to peace, in the Arab-Islamic fold, experienced in the wake of the Israeli strikes on their territories, while the US virtually \u2018looked the other way.\u2019",
    "Such disillusionment was best expressed by Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani when he stated: \u2018Israel led by blusterous extremists, has gone beyond any borders, any limitations when it comes to behavior. We are unable to predict what Israel will do. How can we host Israeli representatives when they have committed this attack?\u2019",
    "Consequently, unless the US drastically reins-in Israel and compels it to abide by the fundamental principles of International Law, the chances are that both Israel and the US would face increasing international isolation. Although the totality of the West could not be expected to bring substantive pressure on the US, the Arab world would fare better than the West on this score considering the sizeable economic pressure it could bring to bear on the US.",
    "For example, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which has within its fold a diversity of ideological persuasions, is unlikely to sit idly by as Israel, backed stringently by the US, goes about violating the basic tenets of International Law with seeming impunity. While a response of a military nature by the OIC needs to be ruled out at present it is likely to have recourse to economic sanctions, for instance, to compel the US in particular to initiate a policy re-think on the Middle East.",
    "Right now, the US faces the prospect of losing the support of some moderate Arab states in the Middle East and such an eventuality could result in political polarities in the region widening further rather dangerously.",
    "Besides pointing to the growing moderate Arab disillusionment with the US, the above statement by the Qatari Prime Minister helps the world community to place a constructive viewpoint on current developments in the Middle East. As he points out, a matter to note most is the fact that the Israeli government is being driven by extremist elements to commit its excesses. He does not refer to the Jewish people or nation in this connection. This is an important differentiation the world needs to bear in mind, going forward.",
    "However, it is a matter for regret that this vital distinction is lost sight of in international discourse on the Middle East. Considerable sections of the Jewish people are not for war or genocide; on the contrary they are peace inclined. In fact they are heirs to a noble civilization. But this does not apply, of course, to those sections of the power elite in Israel who are under the sway of racial chauvinists. Thus is conflict and war in the Middle East perpetuated.",
