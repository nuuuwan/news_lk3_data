### World summit to meet on two-state solution as support grows for Palestinian state

France and Saudi Arabia will convene dozens of world leaders on Monday to rally support for a two-state solution, with several of them expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state - a move that could draw harsh Israeli and U.S. responses.

While the summit could boost the morale of Palestinians, it is not expected to deliver change on the ground, where the most far-right government in Israel’s history has declared there will be no Palestinian state as it pushes on with its war against Hamas in Gaza.

Efforts to create a two-state solution have failed to make any progress for decades as violence raged.

Israel and the United States will boycott the summit, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon, said, describing the event as a “circus.”

Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal all recognised a Palestinian state on Sunday. France and five other states are expected to also formally recognise a Palestinian state on Monday.

### Waste & Accountability: Why Institutions Must Lead By Example

*2025-09-22 13:23:21* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/waste-accountability-why-institutions-must-lead-by-example/) · `en`

Across South Asia, institutions from hospitals to universities and government offices have no shortage of waste management policies. Documents are signed, committees formed, and declarations issued. Yet walk into the backyards of these same institutions, and the story looks very different. Biomedical waste left in open bins, hazardous chemicals poured down drains, and overflowing bins where plastic, paper, and food waste are all dumped together.

The gap between what policies states and how they are practiced is more than just an administrative oversight. It weakens public trust and puts communities at serious risk. When hospitals fail to dispose of biomedical waste safely, they don’t just put their own staff at risk they endanger sanitation workers, patients, their families, and entire neighborhoods. When schools or universities treat waste as an afterthought, they send a message to young people that environmental safety is negotiable.
