The Commission disqualified the Independent Committee, claiming that the nominations were submitted by an unauthorized person.

In a video posted on social media at the time, Senaratne expressed his frustration over the incident and said that he was asked to wait outside, which led to submitting documents.

Commenting on the issue, the Election Commission stated that nominations should be submitted by certain persons and that the failure to follow this rule would be disqualified.

Following this, Ashan Senaratna filed a case in the High Court last week against the decision of the Election Commission.

Sri Lankan politicians often prioritize personal interests over national needs. The Japanese Ambassador notes lack of transparency in trade practices. Current government maintains IMF program structure. Corruption remains a significant issue, hindering foreign investment. Delays in customs processes affect business operations. Political figures like former Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva have been accused of demanding bribes. Overall, political instability and corruption continue to impact Sri Lanka's economic development and foreign relations.

He said that there is no open trade environment in Sri Lanka, but Japanese companies do not follow the rules.

The Ambassador, who stated that they are not bribed, "he said," it is customary for Japanese to leave the country. "

Question - We are currently in the midst of the IMF plan. How far you are confident that the current government will continue to carry out this?

Answer: I have already negotiated with the President's Foreign Minister. With these negotiations, the new government is concerned that the new government is maintaining the main structure of the IMF program.

They have re -appointed the Secretary of the Treasury, who was negotiating with the International Monetary Fund.

This is the best signal that the new government respects the agreement with the International Monetary Fund.

The Hizbullah movement operating in Lebanon in the war between Israel-Kasa's Hamas Organization is in favor of Hamas. The movement is attacking Israel.

Israel is also actively attacking Lebanon. Hasbullah Movement President Hasan Nasrallah and other major commanders of the movement have been killed.

Following Nasralla's killing, his cousin Hashem Sabideen was elected as the new leader of the Hizbullah movement. Meanwhile, it has been reported that Safidin has also been killed.

On the 8th of this month, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Hizbullah's next leaders were killed.

But Hashem did not mention the name of Sabidin. The military has confirmed the killing of Hashem Sabidin.

However, it is noteworthy that the Hizbullah movement has not yet confirmed this message.
