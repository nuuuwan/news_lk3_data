### Ecuador’s debt for nature swap: Innovative bond restructuring – lessons for Sri Lanka

*2024-12-25 06:16:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ecuador-s-debt-for-nature-swap-Innovative-bond-restructuring-lessons-for-Sri-Lanka/4-771007) · `en`

The Galapagos debt-for-nature swap highlights the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable economic growth

Sri Lanka unilaterally defaulted on its external debt in April 2022, exposing its long-standing economic and financial vulnerabilities and igniting a series of inter-related multiple economic crises—fiscal, debt, currency, inflation, and balance of payments—as well as a vast socio-political upheaval. The root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis was a result of misuse of public funds by politicians on an unprecedented scale and large fiscal deficits, which were increasingly financed by unsustainable public debt, particularly foreign commercial borrowings. This carefully over time navigated Sri Lanka into a public debt crisis, international sovereign bond unsustainability, liquidity crisis, and a collapse in the exchange rate.

### Empathy and festivity: Why this Christmas uniquely needs more empathy than ever

*2024-12-25 06:06:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Empathy-and-festivity-Why-this-Christmas-uniquely-needs-more-empathy-than-ever/4-771004) · `en`

There is more that connects these two words than the fact that they rhyme. Christmas is the most anticipated time of the year for so many families but with this special time comes a unique set of emotions and relationship realities.  It is this once-a-year occasion that drives our need for more empathy than at any other point in the year – for ourselves and for each other.

Often mistaken as an ability, we are born with more or less of, empathy is actually a pro-social skillset that we all possess in order to be able to connect to those around us. It is a neurological skillset and not a mindset. At this time of year, as we share our humility and compassion with others, it is our ability to deeply understand the perspectives of others that allows us to gain both strength and unity. So how do you ensure that you are getting it right? Read on below as global expert Mimi Nicklin shares her top tips for harmony and understanding as the holidays roll out.

### Sri Lanka cabinet approves ratification of UN convention on BBNJ

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers has approved the ratification of the convention on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) agreement, the Cabinet Spokesman said.

The move is likely to allow the island nation to get more financial resources along with improved capacity and technical expertise to conserve marine biodiversity in its closest international sea.

The oceans beyond national borders remained largely unregulated, leaving them vulnerable to the escalating threats of human activities in the international seas.

Government officials say the global north’s focus on resources in the high seas and seabed poses significant challenges to maritime biodiversity, given their advanced technical capabilities and financial resources.

These efforts give rise to concerns regarding their effects on marine ecosystems, encompassing issues such as overexploitation, habitat degradation, the diminishment of genetic diversity, and disruptions to ecological interconnectedness.

இயேசு கிறிஸ்துவின் பிறப்பை நினைவூட்டும் அமைதி மற்றும் அன்பின் அடையாளமாக புனித நத்தார் பண்டிகை உதயமாகியுள்ளது. இறைவனின் அன்பும் மனித கௌரவமும் மனிதநேயம் சார்ந்த சமூகத்திற்கு நம்பகமான அடித்தளத்தை அமைத்தது. அன்று இயேசு நாதர் போதித்த அமைதி, அன்பு, கருணை, சகவாழ்வு, இரக்கம் ஆகியவை இன்றைய நமது சமூகத்தை நாகரீகமாக்க போதுமானதாக இருந்தது.

அன்பு, அமைதி மற்றும் சகோதரத்துவத்தை மையப்படுத்திய நத்தார் பண்டிகை கிறிஸ்தவர்களின் மத விழா மட்டுமல்ல, உலகெங்கிலும் வாழும் அனைத்து இனம், மதம், கட்சி, நிறம், இளையோர், முதியோர் என பாகுபாடின்றி கொண்டாடப்படும் கலாச்சார விழாவாகவும் உள்ளது. இதன் அர்த்தத்தை சரியாக புரிந்துகொண்டு நாமும் ஒரு நாடாக முன்னேற வேண்டிய நேரம் வந்துள்ளது.

இயேசு கிறிஸ்து பிறந்த தினமான நத்தார் பண்டிகையை உலகம் முழுவதும் உள்ள கிறிஸ்தவர்கள் கோலகலமாகக் கொண்டாடி வருகின்றனர். துன்பத்தில் இருந்து அனைவரையும் காப்பாற்ற இவ்வுலகின் அவதரித்த இயேசு கிறிஸ்து, ஒருபோதும் ஏழை, பணக்காரன் என்ற கண்ணோட்டத்தில் மக்களைப் பார்த்ததில்லை. அதனால்தான் அன்னார் கடவுளின் குழந்தையாக இவ்வுலகில் பிறந்த நாளில் மிகவும் ஏழ்மையான மற்றும் அப்பாவி மனித சமூகமாக இருந்த மேய்ப்பர்களிடையே பிறக்கத் தேர்ந்தெடுத்தார்.

நத்தார் தினத்தில் அடிப்படை அர்த்தம், வாத பேதங்களை ஒதுக்கி, மனிதநேயத்தின் பெயரால், மகிழ்ச்சியாகவும் அமைதியாகவும் செயற்படுவதாகும்.

*2024-12-25 01:35:13* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cql5kwwq01qo) · `si`

බුදු දහම සහ කිතු දහම එකට මුසු වූ 'රුවන්වැලි සෑයට රිදී දුන්' රිදී විහාරය

කුරුණෑගල, රිදීගම පිහිටි රිදී විහාරය සමග මට ඇති මතකය වසර 34ක් පමණ ඈතට දිව යයි.

එවකට 12 හැවිරිදි වියේ පසුවූ මා, මව සහ පියා සමග රිදී විහාරය නැරඹීමට ගියේ, මල් පහන් පූජා කිරීමේ මූලික අරමුණින් නොවේ. පුරාණ ඉතිහාසය සම්බන්ධයෙන් මා තුළ තිබූ කැමැත්ත සහ කුතුහලය හේතුවෙන් රිදී විහාරයේ පුරාණ තොරතුරු දැක බලා ගැනීමේ අදහසිනි.

අනුරාධපුර යුගයේ දුටුගැමුණු රජ සමය හා සම්බන්ධකම් ඇතැයි කියන රිදී විහාර පරිශ්‍රයේ, රුවන්වැලි සෑය ඉදිකිරීමේදී ඊට අවශ්‍ය රිදී ගොබයක් මතු වූ බව මා අසා තිබිණි.

කෙසේ වෙතත්, මගේ සිත වැඩියෙන් ම ආකර්ෂණය වූයේ, බුදුන් වහන්සේගේ සැතපෙන පිළිමය අබිමුව පිහිටි මල් ආසනයේ ජේසුස් වහන්සේගේ ජීවිත කතාව සිතුවම් කරන ලද පිඟන් ගඩොල් සිය ගණනක් වෙත ය.

වසර 34කට පසු යළිත් මා රිදී විහාරය වෙත ගියේ, ඓතිහාසික බෞද්ධ විහාරස්ථානයක දක්නට ලැබෙන ජේසුස් වහන්සේගේ ජීවිත කතාව දැක්වෙන පිඟන් ගඩොල් පිළිබඳව සවිස්තරාත්මක වාර්තාවක් සැපයීමේ අරමුණිනි.

### Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid

It’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.

The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60% of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.

The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46% of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.

### Untold Lessons: Economic Insights From History For Sri Lanka’s Crisis

*2024-12-24 16:51:35* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/untold-lessons-economic-insights-from-history-for-sri-lankas-crisis/) · `en`

With a new government in power, Sri Lanka finds itself grappling with immense economic challenges. The burden of enormous debts continues to weigh heavily on a fragile economy, necessitating robust growth to overcome these hardships. However, achieving such growth is complicated by a governmental predisposition toward centralised economic control, rooted in socialist-communal ideologies.

These challenges are not unique to Sri Lanka; they echo the historical pitfalls of centralised economic systems. This essay explores three illustrative examples from American history: The failed socialism of the Plymouth Colony, the rapid recovery during the Forgotten Depression of 1920-1921, and the transformative innovation of the Gilded Age.

These examples are not often the subject of discussion by contemporary economists, but they offer valuable insights into the perils of excessive government control and the potential of free-market principles to foster prosperity.

### South Korean opposition puts off plan to impeach acting president Han

*2024-12-24 16:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104473/south-korean-opposition-puts-off-plan-to-impeach-acting-president-han) · `en`

South Korea’s main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened.

The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived bid to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that he partly blamed on the opposition’s propensity to impeach government officials.

Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday.

The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol’s failed bid to impose martial law.
