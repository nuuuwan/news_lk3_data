### Israel’s centrist minister Benny Gantz quits Netanyahu government

Israeli minister Benny Gantz announced his resignation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency government on Sunday, withdrawing the only centrist power in the embattled leader’s far-right coalition amid a months-long war in Gaza.

The departure of Gantz’s centrist party will not pose an immediate threat to the government. But it could have a serious impact nonetheless, leaving Netanyahu reliant on hardliners, with no end in sight to the Gaza war and a possible escalation in fighting with Lebanese Hezbollah.

Last month, Gantz presented Netanyahu with a June 8 deadline to come up with a clear day-after strategy for Gaza, where Israel has been pressing a devastating military offensive against the ruling Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Netanyahu brushed off the ultimatum soon after it was given.

As of December 2023, 25% of IMF-promised reforms for Sri Lanka remain unfulfilled, including crucial aspects like good governance and anti-corruption measures. Despite progress in some areas, the lack of fulfillment indicates potential obstacles to economic recovery. The upcoming third cash tranche from the IMF, set to be signed on June 12, aims to address these issues, emphasizing transparency and combating corruption. However, the success of this initiative hinges on fulfilling these unmet commitments, which are critical for long-term economic stability in Sri Lanka.

🟩

Will it be planned that the IMF can make the project a successful manner by improving the good governance system in Sri Lanka?

On June 12, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will sign a contract for the third cash allowance of the IMF.

According to the latest Verite Company's IMF watchdogs, 25 percent of the promises have not been fulfilled as of the renewed plan of December 2023.

Of the 63 promises to be completed in this scheme, 32 have been fulfilled, but 16 promises are not fulfilled and 15 are unknown. (Could not find the truth because of the data is not available.)

The 16 -unveiled promises have come to the conclusion that good governance will fail.

Sri Lanka has not accomplished the issues that have been identified as the root cause of the economic crisis by the IMF project.That means financialization and anti -corruption.

In September 2023, it was published in September 2023 that the Good Governance Review Report was made in Sri Lanka under the leadership of the IMF in Asia.

### French President dissolves parliament and calls a snap election

*2024-06-10 08:43:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/French-President-dissolves-parliament-and-calls-a-snap-election/108-284474) · `en`

PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France’s parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.

The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union’s parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron’s pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.

Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron’s Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.

Macron himself wasn’t a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.

### Tourism trade remains robust despite seasonal softening in May

The tourism trade is going through an expected softening due to the seasonality tied to the arrivals, but it has managed to eke out an income of US$ 154.0 million in May, data showed.

This was down from US$ 225.7 million in April but up from US$ 100.0 million a year ago when the trade was recovering from repeated crises.

Sri Lanka’s economy weakened due to waning inflows from tourism and other foreign currency inflows due to the 2019 Easter attacks, two years of pandemic induced restrictions over travel and in-person events, and then by the ‘Aragalaya’ in 2022.

It added to the challenges faced by tourism in its efforts to revive while the global travel industry started picking up from two years of pursuing stay at home orders due to the worldwide pandemic.

This caused many countries to put up travel advisories against their people who were thinking of taking flights to Sri Lanka, delaying what looked like a continuous recovery in the trade.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi with leaders of several countries including President Ranil Wickremesinghe (fourth from right) after being sworn in for his third term

Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s Prime Minister for a third term in a grand ceremony at the presidential palace in Delhi yesterday.

The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party took his oath, saying he would “do right to all manner of people without affection or ill-will”.

Modi’s BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won the general election with 293 seats, a much lower margin than predicted by exit polls.

The election saw a resurgence of India’s opposition, which won 234 seats.

Thousands of guests have been attending his inauguration at Delhi’s presidential palace. Among them are the heads of neighbouring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives – but not Pakistan or China.

Tight security has been in place in Delhi, which was declared a no-fly zone, with more than 2,500 police officers deployed around the venue.

Beginning its second year of operations, the BALPP is now launching a new course: Executive Credential in Leadership and Public Policy - ECLPP, in October 2024.

The primary reason for commencing this particular course stems from the importance of leadership and public policy education in Sri Lanka, particularly during these challenging times.

As Sri Lanka navigates through a crisis of leadership, political direction and governance, it needs a new generation of leaders who are equipped with futuristic knowledge, 21st century skills, and an ethical grounding with a sense of social responsibility; all which are necessary to emerge from today’s multiple crises and to steer the country towards a bright and prosperous future.

### Lawyers’ Collective opposes President’s proposal to extend AG’s term

Lawyers’ Collective, a civil society group comprising legal professionals, has voiced its opposition to the recent recommendation by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend the term of Attorney General Sanjaya Rajaratnam beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. In a letter addressed to the members of the Constitutional Council, the Prime Minister, and other key figures, the letter outlined several serious concerns regarding the proposal.

The Collective recalled a similar situation in 2008 when an attempt to extend the term of an Attorney General resulted in a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court. They noted that this legal challenge ultimately led to the Attorney General in question opting for retirement rather than accepting the extension. According to the Collective, the Constitution does not empower the Constitutional Council to approve extensions for officials who are subject to a mandatory retirement age, thereby rendering such a proposal legally questionable.

### Gaza health ministry says Israeli hostage rescue killed 274 Palestinians

BBC: The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says an Israeli raid on a refugee camp – which led to the rescue of four hostages – killed 274 people, including children and other civilians.

On Saturday Israel’s forces, backed by air strikes, fought intense gun battles with Hamas in and around the Nuseirat refugee camp, freeing the captives.

Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrei Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, who were abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October have been returned to Israel.

The Israeli military has estimated that fewer than 100 people died in the operation.

But the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza would, if confirmed, make it one of the deadliest days of the conflict so far.

People living in the densely-populated area have described the terror of coming under intense bombardment and heavy gunfire.

One man, Abdel Salam Darwish, told the BBC he was in a market buying vegetables when he heard fighter jets from above and the sound of gunfire.

### Poverty and homelessness stare elders in the face - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-10 01:22:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Poverty-and-homelessness-stare-elders-in-the-face-EDITORIAL/172-284470) · `en`

Not many decades ago, our country was held up worldwide for its welfare state policies. Today, unfortunately, such praises are but a distant dream. Poverty rules the day-to-day life for a large number of our citizens.

Yet none of the political parties who are now canvassing for our vote, have come out with a single concrete proposal of how they intend to get this country out of its present dilemma.

In these columns, we have highlighted times out of number, the huge difference between the average wage and the cost a family of four needs to bear if they are to have two square meals a day. That cost amounted to over rupees one hundred thousand a month!

On the tea and rubber plantations -until the president recently forced owners to pay workers Rs. 1,700 per day workers were paid less than Rs. 1,000 per day. Daily paid or casual workers elsewhere in the country who form a majority of the country’s workforce receive less than Rs. 55,000 per month.

### UK centre-right media gearing up for a Third World War

Ukrainians fire at Russian forces in Donetsk province, a target of Russia’s current, narrowed offensive

Social media is agog with fears over a looming Third World War. According to the centre-right Daily Telegraph of the UK, it has already started.

According to this view, military action in Ukraine and Gaza is only a small part of a global war in which propaganda, influence buying, trade wars and misinformation are weapons as deadly as any conventional or nuclear arsenal.

But, before we examine this theory in more detail, it’s noteworthy that Third World War scares are hardly new. They have been there almost since the day the Second World War ended.

One could very well describe the Cold War between the West (the US and its NATO allies) and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc satellites as war by other means – both sides vying to outdo each other with misinformation, propaganda and influence buying and trying to bully the other side into submission.
