Peruvian former President Alejandro Toledo was convicted of taking bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht and sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison on Monday.

The verdict marks PeruтАЩs first high-profile conviction related to BrazilтАЩs continent-spanning Lava Jato corruption scandal.

Toledo, a 78-year-old economist who holds a doctorate from Stanford University, governed the Andean nation between 2001 and 2006.

He was convicted of taking $35 million in bribes from the company formerly known as Odebrecht, according to prosecutors, in exchange for letting it win a contract to build the road that now connects PeruтАЩs southern coast with an Amazonian area in western Brazil.

During the year-long trial, Toledo denied the money-laundering and collusion charges.

Odebrecht, now known as Novonor, was at the center of Latin AmericaтАЩs largest graft scandal, after admitting in 2016 that it bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts.

Sri LankaтАЩs central bank has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate amid deflationary policy since scrapping a surrender rule in 2024.

A pegged central bank has to run deflationary monetary policy (selling securities held by the agency to the banking system to curtail domestic credit from rupees generated through from dollar purchases) to generate a balance of payments surplus.

When a BOP surplus (every day or every week) is generated by the central bank it is easy to allow the exchange rate to appreciate by purchasing less than the excess dollars created by deflationary policy.

### Sri Lanka Needs A Change In Exchange Rate Policy

*2024-10-22 06:53:38* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lanka-needs-a-change-in-exchange-rate-policy/) ┬╖ `en`

The IMF promotes a floating exchange rate mechanism. CBSL governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe agrees with it, I think. Some economists too insist that CBSL cannot regulate the exchange rate, hence should allow the rupee to float. SJB has a different idea. They say that they allow first floating the currency to permit market forces to reveal the equilibrium rate , and then stabilizing that rate through CBSL intervention. I am not sure about the ideological stance of president Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the Minister of Finance.

The IMF never assumed that Sri Lanka should have a stable rate of exchange when they entered into an agreement to approve Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in March 2023. In this agreement the forecasted or estimated exchange rates were as follows:

### Clection, based on evidence to the Presidential Commission?

*2024-10-22 03:37:00* ┬╖ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c1484lz44rko) ┬╖ `si`

Based on the information provided, it seems there may be some confusion or misinformation in the text regarding the Presidential Commission of Inquiry and its relationship with the judiciary and prosecution. Let me clarify some key points:



1. Presidential Commissions of Inquiry in Sri Lanka are investigative bodies appointed by the President to inquire into specific matters. They are not judicial bodies and cannot issue criminal charges or prosecute individuals.



2. The commissions can make recommendations based on their investigations, but these recommendations are advisory and not legally binding.



3. The Attorney General's Department has the authority to decide whether to prosecute based on evidence presented to the commission. However, this does not mean the commission itself can prosecute.



4. There is a separate legal process for prosecuting crimes, involving the police, courts, and the Attorney General's Department.



5. The commissions are meant to investigate and report findings to the President, who may then take action based on those findings.



Regarding the specific cases mentioned:



- The Paskarealingam case: The Supreme Court ruled against the commission's recommendation due to procedural issues, not because the commission could prosecute.



- The Wijayapala Mendis case: The Supreme Court found the commission did not have proper evidence and lacked legal authority.



- The Sirisena Cooray case: The Supreme Court ruled against the commission's findings due to procedural errors.



- The cases involving Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, etc.: The Court of Appeal upheld the right to challenge the commission's recommendations.



In summary, while presidential commissions can make recommendations, they do not have the power to prosecute individuals or issue legally binding judgments. Any prosecution would need to go through separate legal channels involving the police, courts, and the Attorney General's Department.

ЁЯЯй

Clection, based on evidence to the Presidential Commission?

The appointment of a report on the Passover Committee on the attack has been reached.

As soon as a controversial event has a controversial event, the appointment of the investigation commissions are common.

Is there an effective role in the instanding investigations in the country?It is questionable.

Some people allege that the Commission will appoint these tests to calm the masses under the problem.

There are other allegations that the information revealed in such commissions have been tempted to carry out the legal functions and their efforts and time and money.

Accordingly, the conclusions and recommendations issued by the Presidential Commission of Initance Commission established in the country have a number of occasions as well as the judiciary of the judiciary.This is about this.

### Irrational Behaviour Of RW & MR Vs Rational Behaviour Of AKD

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behavior can be compared with the rational behavior of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD). Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost.

Given the parliamentary election on 14 Movement 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

Sri Lanka experienced six consecutive quarters of negative economic growth up to the third quarter of 2023. This downturn has had a direct impact on the labour market, leading to lower wage rates and discouraging workforce participation and skill development.

### Should Sri Lanka allow politicians to play the pork barrel game in the future?

*2024-10-21 22:37:20* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Should-Sri-Lanka-allow-politicians-to-play-the-pork-barrel-game-in-the-future/4-768237) ┬╖ `en`

Principally, every rupee spent by the Government should maximise the social welfare of the citizens

Pork-barrel politics can lead to a fragmented political system where representatives focus more on their individual districts rather than working collaboratively to address broader, more urgent national issues. It creates a system where narrow, localised interests dominate policy decisions

In the 19th century, barrels filled with salted pork were considered a significant source of food, especially in rural America. This was a food preservation technique to make the meat last through the winter. Another interesting fact is that not every family had the capability to own such a barrel full of salted pork. This means that owning a pork barrel also served as a symbol of a prestigious social class with greater access to resources.
