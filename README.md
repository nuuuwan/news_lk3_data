### China

Here's a 200-character summary:



China's diplomatic strategy in Sri Lanka avoided accusations of "debt trap diplomacy" similar to those faced in India and the West. This approach contrasted with the Rajapaksa regime's downfall due to such claims.

üü©

India and the West's continued allegations of debt trap diplomacy have affected China more. It was through this campaign that the Rajapaksa dynasty in Sri Lanka was removed from power. China could not tolerate this.

China was careful not to bring witchcraft for China's diplomacy and politics in Sri Lanka, just as the allegations of debt -diplomacy caused witchcraft in the politics of Rajapakse.

### Buddhist Way to Peace and Prosperity

*2024-10-06 03:08:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/buddhist-way-to-peace-and-prosperity/) ¬∑ `en`

Economic and social policies based on Buddhist principles were the foundation of peace and prosperity in ancient Sri Lanka. A close examination of this Buddhist foundation would be of assistance to attain, once again, the cherished goal of peace and economic prosperity.

Economic and political theories before Western influence were based on two famous ancient treatises, namely, Kautilya‚Äôs Artha≈õƒÅstra and Brihaspati‚Äôs Artha≈õƒÅstra. They had one common feature, in that, under the title of ‚ÄòArtha≈õƒÅtra‚Äô both writers had written on politics and economics, leaving out the most important ingredient for any development process, i.e. the mental and spiritual development of man.

### Back to Paradise

Fewer things are more impossible than a 45-minute layover at Doha International Airport. Disembarking takes a good 15 minutes, while the gates close 20 minutes before the next departure.

When you do the math, you realise you need to have exceptionally strong, sturdy legs to get to your next terminal. And that‚Äôs without the burden of bulky bags and the fear of wondering what will happen if you miss your flight and you have to wait a couple of hours or even a day to go back home.

In my case, home lay around 3,000 miles away. Not as far as San Francisco is to Doha ‚Äì a gruelling 14 plus hour flight that can exhaust anyone ‚Äì but far enough to make you want to go there quicker.

I had not been homesick in the US ‚Äì there had been enough and more programs and meetings, friends to meet and places to visit, that had kept me busy ‚Äì but as I sat in San Francisco, I had felt the vaguest stirrings of wanting to go back, kick off my shoes, and just collapse on my bed.

### Will there be an October Surprise to sway the 2024 election?

An October Surprise is defined as ‚Äúan unexpected political event or revelation in the month before a presidential election, especially one that seems intended to influence the outcome‚Äù. Since 1980, there have been a few ‚ÄúOctober Surprises‚Äù which may have changed the history of the nation.

The phrase originated in 1980, during the presidential election season of that year. Militants in Iran had seized 66 American citizens from the US Embassy in 1979, and held 52 of them hostage for over a year. Jimmy Carter was the incumbent president at the time. His failure to have the hostages released was the main reason he was losing in the polls to Ronald Reagan. The hostage crisis occurred after the Iran‚Äôs Islamic revolution and the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty. Carter had planned to negotiate a last-minute release of the hostages which would win him the election. It never happened.

One could not however easily get away from managing. Besides the day to day management that was necessary to maintain paper and information flows, one had to service important meetings and conferences. There was the perpetual follow-up of numerous matters, each day bringing new material. In the midst of all these, someone often created a crisis, which ultimately ended up with us.

One such, during this time was the strong attack made by the Finance Minister Dr. N.M. Perera, on United States PL 480 assistance to Sri Lanka, before a large gathering on May Day. To the Americans, this attack by a senior Minister and the Finance Minister on an important program of official assistance was indeed inexplicable and unfriendly. Chris Van Hollen the Ambassador was not unnaturally quite exercised over this.

### Nasrallah‚Äôs possible successor out of contact since Friday, Lebanese source says

The potential successor to slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been out of contact since Friday, a Lebanese security source said on Saturday, after an Israeli airstrike that is reported to have targeted him.

In its campaign against the Iran-backed Lebanese group, Israel carried out a large strike on Beirut‚Äôs southern suburbs late on Thursday that Axios cited three Israeli officials as saying targeted Hashem Safieddine in an underground bunker.

The Lebanese security source and two other Lebanese security sources said that ongoing Israeli strikes on Beirut‚Äôs southern suburb - known as Dahiyeh - since Friday have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack.

Hezbollah has made no comment so far on Safieddine since the attack.

Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said on Friday the military was still assessing the Thursday night airstrikes, which he said targeted Hezbollah‚Äôs intelligence headquarters.
