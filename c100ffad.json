    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka must ensure adequate nutrition for all pregnant and breastfeeding women amid the ongoing financial crisis, Amnesty International said.",
    "In a research briefing titled \u2018Foregoing Meals to Make-Do\u2019 on the impact of the crisis on access to nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, Amnesty International has found that falling incomes, loss of livelihoods and inflation have reduced women\u2019s purchasing power while government-funded programmes aimed at increasing maternal nutrition have also been affected by the crisis.",
    "The study has focused particularly on women living below the poverty line in Colombo, with the research team interviewing 45 people for the briefing, including healthcare workers, members of civil society, and pregnant and breastfeeding women from a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds, all of whom live in informal settlements and tenement blocks in Colombo.",
    "\u201cDue to the severity of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, health and nutrition have taken a back seat. The situation has taken a grave toll on the health and well-being of pregnant and breastfeeding women. These individuals have also been disproportionately impacted by the crisis, which has seen poverty rates double in the space of a year due to the crisis,\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s Deputy Regional Director for South Asia Dinushika Dissanayake was quoted as saying in a statement.",
    "The women Amnesty International spoke to had raised concerns about the unaffordability of food, the inconsistent supply of \u2018Thriposha\u2019 food supplements, and the inability to redeem food vouchers offered through government programmes.",
    "Pregnant and breastfeeding women had told the researchers that they aimed to \u201cfill their stomach\u201d rather than consume recommended daily amounts of a variety of nutrients due to the high cost of food. In order to have three meals a day, many had opted to limit portion sizes, while some had reduced their number of daily meals to two. One breastfeeding woman had said: \u201cWe eat breakfast and dinner and try to skip lunch\u2026 We eat a biscuit for lunch with a cup of tea.\u201d",
    "In almost all households interviewed, consumption of meat, vegetables, fruit and milk had drastically reduced, the brief said. Such deprivation increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies, which can affect the development of the foetus. Families that previously consumed meat or fish on a weekly basis now consume them just once a month or only when money is available. Another breastfeeding woman said: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford milk-inducing food. You see, fish is expensive. So, we buy what we can afford for the money we have.\u201d",
    "Most had said that they were unemployed and their husbands did not have a regular income amid the crisis.",
    "In February 2023, pregnant and breastfeeding women had told Amnesty International that government food vouchers could not be redeemed due to a lack of state funds.",
    "The international human rights watchdog had written to the Ministry of Women, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Public Administration to raise these concerns, but had not received a response at the time of publication, the statement said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s public health system has also been affected by shortages of medicine and equipment, Amnesty International noted. Health workers providing maternal care had told the organisation that they had to stop, delay or postpone non-essential surgeries and procedures. One doctor, who said they have to ration drugs for emergency cases because future supplies are uncertain, had said: \u201cWe have to see patients suffering and we cannot do anything.\u201d",
    "The rights group said it had found that health workers reused equipment or told patients to purchase medicine or equipment from private pharmacies because state-run hospitals had run out. Meanwhile, medicines in private pharmacies remain unaffordable to most due to price hikes and the devaluation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, it said.",
    "Sri Lanka has ratified several international accords requiring it to ensure that pregnant and breastfeeding women have access to adequate healthcare and food, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).",
    "\u201cProlonged food insecurity and inadequate nutrition can lead to serious long-term consequences for mothers and their children if left unaddressed. The government of Sri Lanka must urgently meet its international human rights obligations, including by ensuring access to adequate, affordable and good quality nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women. The international community must also play a role in supporting the government to ensure pregnant and breastfeeding women are able to access adequate food and nutrition,\u201d said Dissanayake.
