    "Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) -\u00a0 The Supreme Court today held that the Cabinet decision to allow former President Maithripala Sirisena to use a residence at Paget Road in Colombo was an arbitrary, unreasonable and illegal decision amounting to a violation of the Rule of Law and the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the citizens.",

    "The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices Priyantha Jayawardena, Gamini Amarasekara and Kumudini Wickremasinghe\u00a0 held that the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers to provide a residence to former President Sirisena with entitlements is beyond the scope offered by the Presidents' Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986.",
    "The Supreme Court delivered this judgment pursuant to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and its Executive Director, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu.",
