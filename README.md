South Indian comedian Vaigai Vadivel complained to the police that the well was missing in a force. That jokes went viral. A similar incident has taken place in the East.

Kinniya-Thambalakamam main road, next to Thambalakamam, the name of the Kinniya Model, which was placed by the Road Development Authority, was missing for several months.

Due to the lack of a nameplate that was planted under the Shivathappa, the pedestrians from outside are facing various difficulties in identifying the Kinniya Divisional Secretariat.

The name board, which was planted by the Road Development Authority, disappeared for a long time.

Apart from this, many newly constructed Cabinet Roads have not been set up. As a result, pedestrians from outside districts are searching the streets and wandering around here. Therefore, the appropriate council has taken action in this regard and requested to plant the name boards for the streets.

### Recent Indian films outclass most Hollywood movies

My son in the US advises me to watch this or that film – not available in my Netflix streaming.

No answer to why Sinhalese solicitor split his original name into two

Little did William Alfred Goone Tilleke know when he stepped ashore Siam in 1890 that he would create a law firm that would endure for over 130 years.

In 1890, William Alfred Goone Tilleke, a 31-year-old Singhalese solicitor, came to Siam (now Thailand) to build his legal career. Within four years, Tilleke made an international name for himself through his successful defense of the Siamese military commander Phra Yod Muang Khwang, whose prosecution for killing a French officer was demanded by the Franco-Siamese treaty.

### My time at Hindu Ladies College

*2024-03-16 23:46:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-time-at-hindu-ladies-college/) · `en`

(This chapter on Goolbai Gunasekera’s Jaffna experience is excerpted from her book on her mother, Clara Motwani, Chosen Ground. The first chapter published last week was a response to ACB Pethiyagoda’s memoir of his time at Jaffna College.)

Mrs. Visaladhy Sivagurunathan, a philanthropic Hindu lady, had gifted the property of Hindu Ladies’ College to the school in 1943. Mother was the school’s fifth Principal. Under her, the first Past Pupils’ Association was formed, with Mrs. Jeevaratnam Rasiah as its first President. Miss Thambu (Mother’s long suffering Tamil tutor) was its Secretary. Just recently, I was invited to speak to the Colombo branch of the HLC alumni.

The reverence in which Mother was held was very heart- warming, and it was a moving experience to hear the stories they related of instances in which Mother had touched — and sometimes directed — their lives.

### Nissanka – God’s secret agent

It may have been in 1983 that Dilhan introduced me to Nissanka Wimalasuriya. My friend Herman Gunaratne has devoted an entire book — ‘God’s Secret Agent’ — to his association with Nissanka and the many extraordinary incidents involving him. What I was told was that Nissanka had a unique link with the Almighty, that he would pray to God seeking intervention in the lives of distressed people, and that such prayers were answered favourably. At first I did not believe this, but having prayed with him and personally experiencing the results of such prayer, I finally became convinced that Nissanka was indeed a man with a special gift or spiritual power.
