  "original_body_lines": [
    "Moody\u2019s Ratings on Monday affirmed the Government of India\u2019s long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings and the local-currency senior unsecured rating at Baa3. The ratings agency also affirmed India\u2019s other short-term local-currency rating at P-3. The outlook remains stable.",
    "\u201cThe rating affirmation and stable outlook reflect our view that India\u2019s prevailing credit strengths, including its large, fast-growing economy, sound external position and stable domestic financing base for ongoing fiscal deficits, will be sustained,\u201d it said.",
    "These strengths lend resilience to adverse external trends, in particular as high US (Aa1 stable) tariffs and other international policy measures hinder India\u2019s capacity to attract manufacturing investment, it added. India\u2019s credit strengths are balanced by long-standing weaknesses on the fiscal side, which will remain.",
    "Strong GDP growth and gradual fiscal consolidation will lead to only a very gradual decline in the government\u2019s high debt burden and will not be sufficient to materially improve weak debt affordability, especially as recent fiscal measures to reinforce private consumption erode the government\u2019s revenue base, the ratings agency said.",
    "Even as real GDP growth moderated in FY25 to 6.5% from 9.2% in FY24, India has been and will remain the fastest growing G20 economy through at least the next two to three years, Moody\u2019s said, forecasting GDP growth at 6.5% in FY26. The forecast was on the basis of the government\u2019s continued emphasis on capital expenditure, lower inflation and the consequent easing of monetary policy, which will support robust domestic consumption and investment.",
    "\u201cThe US\u2019 imposition of high tariffs will have limited negative effects on India\u2019s economic growth in the near term,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. However, it may constrain potential growth over the medium to long term by hindering India\u2019s ambitions to develop a higher value-added export manufacturing sector, it added. \u201cAt this stage, we expect subsequent negotiations to result in less punitive rates and domestic market-oriented foreign investment to remain robust.\u201d",
    "Constraints over new applications for skilled worker visas and potential levies on US businesses that outsource operations offshore, is not expected to significantly weigh on workers\u2019 remittances or India\u2019s services exports. As such, risks of a significant widening of India\u2019s current account deficits will remain limited, it added.",
    "Upward pressure on the rating would develop if there was a material improvement in the affordability of India\u2019s high debt burden to levels more consistent with higher-rated peers, the ratings agency said. This would likely entail fiscal measures that durably raise revenue, narrow the fiscal deficit and contribute to a more marked decline in debt. The effective implementation of structural reforms that results in a significant pickup in private sector investment, faster growth in GDP per capita and broader economic diversification, for instance in higher value-added manufacturing or digital services, would support stronger assessments of policy effectiveness and the credit profile, it noted."
