    "The warning is reported to have been conveyed over the phone.",
    "Thisakutti Arachchi\u2019s recent controversial remarks have raised concerns within the party, prompting the SLPP leadership to issue a strong reprimand.",
    "He has also reportedly been summoned to the party office tomorrow (25).",
    "The remarks in question were made during a meeting held recently in Anuradhapura, where Thisakutti Arachchi stated:",
    "\u201cThe day Namal Rajapaksa becomes President of this country, I will be the unofficial president. I am his closest friend and confidant, but that does not give me the right to demand anything. When the Anuradhapura district records the highest percentage of votes in Sri Lanka, all I need to do is inform him that the people of Anuradhapura have supported him. Then he should reciprocate by serving the people of Anuradhapura.\u201d"
