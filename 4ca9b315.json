  "original_body_lines": [
    "Pastor Jerome Fernando has reportedly left the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a short while ago, after providing a statement for around 08 hours.",
    "The self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019, who was under fire for his much-disputed comments on several religions during sermon, made an appearance at the CID this morning (30), as per the court orders, to record a statement with the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival in Sri Lanka.",
    "Pastor Fernando returned to the island on Wednesday morning (Nov.29) after months of controversy over his remarks. He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.",
    "On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned Pastor Jerome should record a statement with the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. As such, he arrived at the CID premises this morning to provide a statement.",
    "This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",
    "Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.",
    "Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the country\u2019s harmony.",
    "However, Pastor Fernando flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court banned his foreign travels on May 16. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island.",
    "On May 26, Fernando filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition.",
    "In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CID\u2019s attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country."
