These topics were covered over a 12-week period with all programs being facilitated online. One of the key features of the program was the inbuilt mentoring program which allowed the females entrepreneurs the opportunities to access more specific knowledge pertaining to their business and also seek greater exposure pertaining to the market.",

    "Vasuky from the Northern Province, stated that the exposure she obtained from the program was immense. She mentioned that the program was delivered in a very practical manner and catered not only for upskilling their business skills but also their personality.

Her vision has been to become the best female entrepreneur in the country and the WCIC-IFC program is certainly a stepping-stone in her defined journey.",
    "The event was brought to a closure by inviting the graduates to participate in a brainstorming session. The objective was to understand from the ladies what are the other competencies required to support business growth. Based on the ideas exchanges, English skill development was placed as a matter of urgency. Moving on, the graduates would like to reach out to suitable resources to help support them in creating a digital marketing presence and maintaining financial records.
