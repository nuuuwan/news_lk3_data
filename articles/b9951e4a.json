    "The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) yesterday launched a new digital Case Tracking System aimed at improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability.",
    "CIABOC Chairman Justice Neil Iddawala described the new platform as \u201ca transformative step\u201d that goes beyond a mere technological upgrade. He said the system represents a major shift in how the Commission manages and processes information, records, and case files central to its work.",
    "\u201cCorruption thrives where there is opacity, delay, and inefficiency. Transparency and accountability are the strongest deterrents,\u201d Justice Iddawala said, calling the new system \u201can instrument of reform\u201d that will strengthen public trust.",
    "The Case Tracking System integrates automation and centralised digital recordkeeping to improve accuracy, enable real-time case monitoring, and streamline workflows. It also introduces data-driven decision-making tools to enhance institutional performance.",
    "The project was implemented with financial assistance from the Government of Japan and technical support from the UNDP.\u00a0 Addressing CIABOC staff, Justice Iddawala encouraged officers to embrace the new system, noting that it empowers them to work with greater precision and professionalism. \u201cEach keystroke is a contribution to CIABOC\u2019s mission\u2014to build a cleaner, fairer, and more transparent society,\u201d he said.",
    "The launch aligns CIABOC\u2019s operations with international best practices and Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC)."
