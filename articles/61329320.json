    "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Sunday called on the Youth Affairs and Sports Minister to prevent political parties from taking control of youth clubs.",
    "Making a special statement, he said: \u201cThe subject Minister should call all parties for a discussion and resolve the crisis in the youth clubs. We have heard that there are going to be islandwide protests against the politicisation of youth clubs. The clubs will decline and die a natural death if the present crisis is not solved soon. Therefore, I propose meetings between office bearers of youth clubs, other youth who face issues, and the subject Minister to resolve the crisis amicably,\u201d Wickremesinghe said."
