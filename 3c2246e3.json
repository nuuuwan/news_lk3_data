    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The World Bank believes Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt restructuring (DDR) programme has achieved an appropriate balance in the trade-off between debt sustainability and ensuring continued confidence in the financial sector, a senior World Bank official said.",
    "World Bank Country Director for the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-zervos told EconomyNext on the sidelines of a talk on Wednesday July 18 that the government\u2019s decision to go for a DDR and parliament\u2019s approval of that decision were welcome steps in Sri Lanka\u2019s path towards debt sustainability.",
    "\u201cAs we\u2019re focused on the recovery of Sri Lanka and the return to a growth path, we\u2019re very much interested in debt sustainability. The details of the restructuring parameters and the perimeter are decisions by the government and the creditors. We\u2019re not a part of that. Our position is that anything that achieves debt sustainability and achieves it as soon as possible will help Sri Lanka return to a path to growth,\u201d said Hadad-zervos",
    "\u201cDDR as part of that is a very important thing. The decision by the government and the approval by the parliament of it is a welcome step. Within that, those decisions are for the government to undertake,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked about the criticism levelled at the DDR programme on the allegedly unfair burden placed on the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF), the World Bank official indicated that a trade-off would be inevitable.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re aware that there is a tradeoff between debt sustainability and making sure that there is continued confidence in the financial sector. We leave this to the government, and our assessment is that the balance is appropriate,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties have criticised the DDR plan for laying a heavier burden on the EPF and ETF, a move that Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe has defended.",
    "\u201cThere is no better solution that is fair by everyone,\u201d Weerasinghe said, speaking at the central bank\u2019s monthly monetary policy review press conference on July 06, adding that a majority\u2019s existing bank deposits also have to be taken into consideration.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re a member of the EPF, is it important to you to protect your existing funds to live now or to protect your future pension? To protect your pension, you have to live now. If there was a bank run, everyone including EPF members would lose what they currently have as well as their EPF,\u201d he said.",
    "The government\u2019s DDR plan, as it exists now, balances these two scenarios and strives to protect the assets of all citizens, according to Weerasinghe.",
    "Sri Lanka central bank chief defends DDR, disputes projected losses for EPFSee more",
    "The World Bank, it appears, agrees that a balance has been struck, though it is not directly involved in Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring efforts.",
    "\u201cI think it\u2019s very good news that the DDR plan was passed by parliament,\u201d said Hadad-zervos during the Q&A of Tuesday\u2019s talk.",
    "\u201cOn one side you want it to contribute to debt sustainability. But not to a point where people in the financial system are worried. I think the way it has been done and approved by parliament is a very good balance between these two,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul19/2023)"
