    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) together with the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has launched an Electricity Dispatch Database and Dashboard.",
    "The US embassy in Colombo said in a statement on Friday December 01 that the dashboard is \u200ban online platform designed to enhance transparency in the management of Sri Lanka\u2019s power distribution through a visualisation platform.",
    "\u201cDeveloped and funded by USAID\u2019s Sri Lanka Energy Programme, the Dispatch Data Dashboard is a comprehensive tool that allows stakeholders to access and visualise data relevant to electricity generation, forecasts, costs, reservoir details, and emissions, providing insights into the energy sector\u2019s intricate operational dynamics. The initiative will help foster transparency and accountability within Sri Lanka\u2019s energy,\u201d the embassy said.",
    "According to the statement, the dashboard features a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to a broad audience, and users will be able to query dispatch data, gaining valuable insights into the dispatch process\u00a0 and the rationale behind cost optimisation.",
    "\u201cThis transparency not only promotes accountability but also encourages collaboration among industry players, paving the way for improvements in the dispatch process,\u201d the embassy said.",
    "It said dashboard will be used for a wide array of stakeholders, including sector analysts, researchers, current independent power producers, future renewable energy developers, and environmental\u00a0 organisations.",
    "Members of the public will now have the ability to comprehend the dispatch process, enabling them to raise inquiries and contribute to\u00a0 discussions about the energy sector\u2019s future. This marks a significant step forward in democratising information and fostering a sense of ownership among the public, the US embassy said.",
    "\u201cThis dashboard will help drive financial sustainability of the power sector, while contributing to the viability of the nation\u00a0 by enhancing energy security and ensuring the lowest possible cost of electricity. By fostering transparency and empowering stakeholders, this tool is an instrumental resource in our collective fight against climate change. In understanding and optimising our energy management processes, we pave the way for a more sustainable future, driving efficiencies that contribute to reducing the cost of power generation while reducing our carbon footprint. In the face of climate challenges, knowledge is power, and the dashboard empowers us all to make informed decisions that positively impact our environment,\u201d USAID Director of the Economic Growth Office Chris Powers was quoted as saying.",
    "\u201cThe Dispatch Data Dashboard represents a major leap towards a more transparent and accountable energy sector in Sri Lanka. By providing a platform for stakeholders to engage with dispatch data, we aim to drive positive change, encourage innovation, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable and cost-effective energy future for Sri Lanka,\u201d PUCSL Chairman Prof Manjula Fernando said.",
    "According to the US embassy, the dashboard is also anticipated to play a crucial role in driving down generation costs for the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). By facilitating a better understanding of the dispatch process and encouraging stakeholder collaboration, the embassy said, the initiative holds the potential to bring about operational efficiencies that will benefit both the industry and end consumers backed by the National Energy Benchmarking Portal \u2013 which was recently launched by the USAID Sri Lanka Energy Programme and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority to address the demand/consumption side of the energy.",
    "\u201cThe USAID Sri Lanka Energy Programme supports transforming Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector into a market-based, secure, reliable, and sustainable system by mobilising investment to deploy advanced technologies, increase flexibility, and enhance competitiveness,\u201d the statement said.
