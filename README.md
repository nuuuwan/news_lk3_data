Put in to bat at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground here on Friday, Sri Lanka saw their batting misfire in the initial phases of the game.

They lost half of their side for 82 runs in 11 overs before managing to post a respectable 163/8.

All-rounders Wanindu Hasaranga (26), Angelo Mathews (32), and Shanaka (23) fired up the proceedings down the order to take them to a competitive total.

In reply, quick-fire knocks from Paul Stirling (21) and George Dockrell (17) were the bright spots in the initial stages of the Irish chase, but former skipper Shanaka swung the momentum with his medium pace bowling as Ireland were bowled out for 122 in 18.2 overs.

FIROZPUR/KOLKATA, June 1 (Reuters) - India voted on Saturday in the final phase of a long-drawn general election, held in record summer heat in many parts, as both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his challengers said they would win the polls centred mostly on inequality and religion.

### Colombo inflation cools to 0.9% in May

*2024-06-01 11:25:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Colombo-inflation-cools-to-0-9-in-May/108-283870) · `en`

The Colombo district inflation eased further to 0.9 percent in May, from 1.5 percent in April, as both food and non-food prices continued their months-long streak of declines, although the prices could firm up slightly in the coming months, due to somewhat higher prices for staples, as a result of the current weather and revving up of economic activities with the lower interest rates.

Measured on a monthly basis, the prices fell 0.6 percent in the month, adding to the 1.9 percent and 0.8 percent falls in the prices in both March and April, respectively.

After a sharp rise in prices in the nearly last two years, the prices came back to better balance from 2023 onwards, due to the easing of global energy prices and other commodities prices.

Meanwhile, the availability of foreign currency in the country, due to the normalising tourism and remittances, also helped the prices to come back to the acceptable level, as the imported goods could be made in sufficient supply.

As such, Dr. Nanayakkara urged parents and teachers to educate children about the dangers of nicotine and the reasons for its use.

It is immensely suspicious that the results have been suspended even after all sides have made it clear to all sides.

It is very clear that this is the manifestation of the ethnic discrimination of those who cannot tolerate the development of Zahira College.

This can be understood by the mood of the exam supervisor who brought this issue to be resolved in the exam hall.

Industry stakeholders including hoteliers, tourism authorities and even law enforcement agencies have shown their utter dismay over an abrupt decision taken by the National Authority on Alcohol and Tobacco (NATA) to scrap the ‘Happy Hour’ in hotels, which was termed as an ‘absurd’ move to discourage already ailing tourism sector and consumers.

A letter circulating on social media addressed to the Chairman of a leading five-star hotel in Colombo by the NATA states that the latter is issuing a directive to all hotels to refrain from granting any discounts on the purchase of alcohol products during their ‘Happy Hour’.

The letter dated on May 28th and undersigned by the Chairman NATA Dr. Alan Ludowyke had directed the hoteliers to comply with the NATA Act No.27 of 2006 (as amended). The letter has been copied to Commissioner General of Excise M. J. Gunasiri and a senior Excise official who is the Board Director to NATA from the Excise Department.

### The Six Face(t)s of  CWC Chief Arumugan “Thamby” Thondaman

*2024-06-01 00:18:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84119) · `en`

Former  Cabinet  Minister,Nuwara Eliya district Parliamentarian and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC)  leader Arumugan Thondaman would have celebrated his 60th  birthday on 29 May,if he were alive today. Thondaman passed away  due to a cardiac arrest four days before his 56th birthday four years ago on 26 May 2020. He was serving as a  Minister  in the cabinet of President Gotabaya  Rajapaksa at the time of his death. This week’s “political pulse” – with the aid of my previous writings –  focuses on Arumugan Thondaman to denote his 60th birth anniversary.

Let me begin with two points about his name and pet name.  Thondaman’s first name Arumugan is spelled  with an N at the end. However  it  is frequently misspelled by the media  as Arumugam with an M instead of N. I too have been guilty of this error at times. I remember his illustrious grandfather Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman gently admonishing me once “ He is Arumugan not Arumugam”.

### Red herrings, referendums, poverty and postponing elections

Even though an election has not been officially announced by the Commissioner of Elections, election fever has hit our political parties. The Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) suggested a possible postponement of elections. Was he drawing a red herring to test the political waters?

The ordinary man on the street though, has not been drawn into this conversation. They are looking for ways and means to keep the wolf from the door. But this does not mean they are disinterested.

On 29 May, nearly all news media carried the pathetic tale of a mother of four living in Padaviya, having had electricity and water supply to her house being disconnected. Four months ago her husband-the sole breadwinner of the family died in a tragic accident. She has been unable to make ends meet since then.

### Referendum to extend President’s term: Is it ploy to avoid election defeat?

It is undoubtedly election phobia of the United National Party (UNP) headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe that prompted Palitha Range Bandara, the General Secretary of the Party to suggest on Tuesday to hold a referendum to extend the term of the President and Parliament for two more years.

“This is the best option at this moment to save the nation. The Government has reached agreements with the IMF, World Bank and other donors on economic reforms and it is essential to extend the terms of the President and Parliament to make this exercise a success,” Range Bandara told the media.

Although Wickremesinghe and several other UNP leaders have disowned their General Secretary’s statement, the general perception is that this is not his personal opinion but a collective decision of the top most few inner circle leaders of the party to test the waters – to feel the response of the people and the Opposition.

Even though Range Bandara’s proposal was his personal point of view and only a suggestion, it was not perceived as such. Sections of the media and social media along with Opposition political parties treated it as an official Government announcement

The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country’s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis

### Four Sri Lankans arrested in India for smuggling; here Rohan Gunaratne accuses Muslims of radicalisation

Four Sri Lankans were arrested on Monday, 20 May 2024 at the Ahmadabad Airport in India for smuggling of gold and drugs.

According to Daily Mirror of 23 May 2024 Sri Lanka’s state intelligence has asked for further information from India’s state intelligence to verify the background of these alleged suspects, as well as to probe if they are actually linked to the ISIS network.

Thus so far there was no report of their involvement in any organisation promoting violence. One should not forget the government in power in India is extremely hostile to Muslims. They demonise and unleash violence against Muslims. On the other hand it is ridiculous to state that they went to India to commit crime for a mere Rs. 100,000 each.

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to open doors to economic hitmen like billionaire Elon Musk, George Soros and James Packer by introducing the Economic Transformation Bill, NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti said.

Addressing a meeting with the business community in Badulla recently, he said President Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that Elon Musk is coming to Sri Lanka to provide WIFI.

"Ranil said in 2015 that free WIFI will be made available to all. He has now dropped the word 'free' and says WIFI will be given in 2024. Elon Musk will never give free WIFI," he said.

He said Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed earlier that James Packer is coming to invest in Sri Lanka. But he never came with any investments.

Hadunnetti said a publicity stunt is being operated through a separate company by using government funds to show that foreign investors are coming to the country.
