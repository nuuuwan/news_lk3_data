    "Urges Govt. to rectify mistakes made in choosing beneficiaries immediately",
    "Says Govt. should have resolved issues with Grama Seva Officers and others who declined to be part of the program and gained their support",
    "Claims failure to protect Samurdhi Banks will lead to social upheaval",
    "Architect of the Samurdhi relief program and ruling party MP, S.B Dissanayake yesterday admitted that critical blunders have been made when choosing beneficiaries for the recently introduced Aswesuma social welfare program.",
    "Dissanayake said these mistakes must be corrected immediately. According to the MP, Aswesuma encountered its first setback when Grama Seva Officers, Development Officers, Samurdhi Officers and Managers, as well as Agriculture Officers, declined to participate in the program. \u201cProactive measures should have been taken to address any concerns promptly and garner their support for the program,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Dissanayake also called on the Government to protect Samurdhi Banks along with the social security and housing funds to avert a crisis. \u201cIf not, it will lead to a major social upheaval,\u201d he warned.",
    "Commenting on the Samurdhi program formulated by him, which will now be replaced by the new Aswesuma program, Dissanayake said despite the many allegations it has contributed immensely in alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka since 1994.\u00a0 \u201cAt the time it was introduced 26% of the population were poor. But when Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the Government in 2015, it had dropped to a mere 6.4%,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere were blunders. At times political party offices sent in lists of names to be included as beneficiaries. Some mistakes were also made by Samurdhi Officers and Managers. However, they were not as significant as claimed. If at all perhaps there were only 12 - 15% faults in the program when choosing beneficiaries,\u201d he opined."
