    "Sri Lanka is hopeful of making progress by next month on two delayed wind energy projects to be built by India\u2019s Adani Green Energy Ltd, its energy minister said on Wednesday.",
    "The cash-strapped south Asian island nation, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages, has been trying to speed green power generation to hedge against surges in imported fuel costs, but the wind projects are still being evaluated because of disputes over pricing and plant efficiency.",
    "\u201cMaybe in the next four weeks, we will see some results on the negotiation process, and there is another negotiation for the transmission lines that is also being evaluated,\u201d Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the India Energy Week event in Goa.",
    "\u201cBoth are (happening) simultaneously, so I am hopeful that by March, we will have something,\u201d he said.",
    "Adani, which won approvals to invest $442 million in the wind projects in February 2023, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "Hydropower, coal-fired plants and oil-based power plants each account for nearly a third of the country\u2019s electricity output. The government has committed to not add any new coal-based capacity and aims to produce 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.",
    "Neighbouring India recently proposed supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help Sri Lanka produce power at two plants, and Wijesekera said India\u2019s state-run Petronet LNG and plant officials were \u201cworking out the mechanics\u201d on shipping LNG.",
    "\u201cIt is positively progressing. We should have something maybe in the next three to four weeks,\u201d he said.",
    "In November, Sri Lanka approved a proposal by China\u2019s Sinopec to build a $4.5 billion oil refinery in Hambantota, where China built a port. Wijesekera said the contract has been awarded and the government had made clarifications Sinopec had sought on land clearance, water availability, taxes and concessions."
