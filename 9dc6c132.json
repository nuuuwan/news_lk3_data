  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Support for the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) among Sri Lanka\u2019s voters dipped marginally to 40 percent in October but the leftist party managed to maintain its notable lead over the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the president\u2019s United National Party (UNP), polling data showed.",
    "The NPP had enjoyed support from 42 percent of likely voters in September. The SJB stood at 26 percent in October, increasing four percent from 22 percent in September. President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s UNP\u2019s support decreased marginally to 11 percent in October from September\u2019s 13 percent. The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) also saw a decrease to 5 percent from the previous month\u2019s 8 percent.",
    "The Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) was conducted by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP), an independent, non-partisan research centre based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.",
    "According to the IHP, SLOTS combines interviews from a national sample of adults (ages 18 and over) reached by\u00a0 random digit dialling of mobile numbers, and others coming from a national panel of\u00a0 respondents who were previously recruited through random selection. IHP estimates voting\u00a0 intent using an adaptation of Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP), with multiple\u00a0 imputation to account for uncertainties in its modelling, exploiting data from all SLOTS\u00a0 interviews to estimate voting in a particular month.",
    "The October 2023 MRP estimates were based on 567 interviews conducted in October 2023,\u00a0 and 13,935 interviews conducted overall from 1 October 2021\u201312 November 2023, with a\u00a0 margin of error assessed as 1\u20133 percent for the SLPP, SLFP, ITAK, TMVP and 3\u20135 percent for the SJB,\u00a0 NPP/JVP, UNP and the other parties. As the October update uses a more recent data set than\u00a0 the previous update, there are small changes in estimates of voting shares for previous\u00a0 months. A total of 100 stochastic simulations were used in the modelling to estimate margins\u00a0 of error, the IHP said.",
    "\u201cMRP is a method that is increasingly used by polling firms in other countries to leverage small\u00a0 samples, most notably by YouGov which used it to forecast results of the UK Brexit\u00a0 Referendum and recent UK general elections. All estimates are adjusted to ensure the sample\u00a0 matches the national population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,\u00a0 education, geographical location, and voting in the 2019 Presidential and 2020 General\u00a0 Elections.\u201d",
    "The SLOTS is funded by the Neelan Tiruchelvam Trust, the UK National Institute for\u00a0 Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Asia Foundation in Sri Lanka, and others, but the\u00a0 sponsors play no role in the study design, analysis, or interpretation of findings. Interested\u00a0 parties can contact IHP for more detailed data and results, the IHP said. (Colombo/Nov23/2023)"
