    "\u201cWe understand that public sector salaries need to be adjusted to reflect the rising cost of living. However, we cannot yet confirm whether the financial capacity exists to implement the salary hike from 1 January 2025, as planned by the former administration,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
