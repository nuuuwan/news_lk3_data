    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring process has neared its end and a bond exchange can be expected in six to eight weeks after establishing comparability, if the government proceeds with the existing debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "Responding to questions at the Central Bank\u2019s monthly monetary policy review, Weerasinghe said it is up to the Ministry of Finance to decide on the DSA.",
    "\u201cIt is difficult to give an opinion on how it will proceed. Whether to renegotiate the DSA or targets is a decision up to the Ministry of Finance. We are not party to that. They must decide whether to proceed with the existing DSA and restructure debt or to renegotiate a new DSA. I cannot comment on that. The ministry must decide,\u201d he said.",
    "However, he said, the process has neared its end, and noted that the president and the government has announced debt restructuring will be completed as soon as possible, as will be the third review of the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.",
    "\u201cI think the ministry will discuss with the newly appointed persons and decide how that should be done. The central bank cannot comment on it,\u201d he said.",
    "Explaining the remaining steps of the debt restructuring process, the central bank chief said an \u2018agreement in principle\u2019 has already been made with international sovereign bond (ISB) holders, local bond holders and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). If the government decides to proceed with the existing DSA, a comparability assessment must then be made.",
    "The comparability of the restructuring effort is determined by the net present value of the total cash flow relief provided during the restructuring period collectively through these different methods (interest reduction, maturity extension, principal haircut).",
    "\u201cWe strongly believe that there is no problem there. That\u2019s why it\u2019s all been published,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Weerasinghe, this assessment is what Sri Lanka needs to obtain most urgently.",
    "\u201cAfter that, you have to go for a bond exchange. The China Development Bank (CDB) agreements are signed after completion. Local banks must also be given new bonds for their ISBs. So the next step is this bond exchange.",
    "\u201cIf the first step is done, a bond exchange can happen in 6-8 weeks. That\u2019s the time it takes for an ISB exchange,\u201d (Colombo/Sep27/2024)"
