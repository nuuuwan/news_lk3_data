### US gives Israel 30 days to boost Gaza aid or risk cut to military support

*2024-10-16 11:03:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102728/us-gives-israel-30-days-to-boost-gaza-aid-or-risk-cut-to-military-support) ¬∑ `en`

The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off.

The letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties.

It says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month.

Israel is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country ‚Äútakes this matter seriously‚Äù and intends to ‚Äúaddress the concerns raised‚Äù with US counterparts.

Israel has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is under fire after buying a multi-million-dollar cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis.

Albanese made the purchase months out from an election in which the cost of living and housing are key issues.

The move has sparked backlash from across the political divide - with his opponents calling it ‚Äútone deaf‚Äù and some within his own party anonymously telling local media it left them ‚Äúgobsmacked‚Äù.

Albanese defended his decision, saying he ‚Äúknows what it is like to struggle‚Äù but bought the luxury property to be close to his fiancee Jodie Haydon‚Äôs family on the New South Wales Central Coast.

Property records show the four-bedroom, three-bathroom, and three-carport property in Copacabana - which has panoramic views - was sold for A$4.3m ($2.9m, ¬£2.2m) last month, but the purchase is yet to settle.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs new government has abandoned plans to sell the debt-ridden national airline SriLankan Airlines, but will restructure it for a more profitable future.

‚ÄúPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake has instructed that the airline should be an institution that all Sri Lankans are proud of, and should be owned by Sri Lankans,‚Äù the airline‚Äôs new chairman Sarath Ganegoda told TTG Asia.

The previous government had invited bids to part-sell and manage the airline that as been suffering accumulated losses over the years.

While the airline has reported an operating profit for the period April 2022 to end March 2023, its accumulated debt is US$1.2 billion. Under the earlier plan, the government was to retain 51 per cent control of the airline while selling off the remaining 49 per cent to investors. Six parties, some who had no experience in running an airline, responded with an initial call for interest but none was pre-qualified for the next step of the process.

This election is therefore about having a politically serious and a critically sharp, effectively ‚Äúnational‚Äù people‚Äôs Opposition ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Nominations for the 2024 November 14 parliamentary elections were closed island wide, on 11 October. Altogether, around 690 nomination papers have been accepted for the 52 electoral districts. Phenomenal rise to power of the JVP/NPP at the September Presidential elections has sealed the fate of over two dozen politicians, some of whom would not have wanted to leave politics yet. Not very surprisingly, since the 1936 State Council elections when D.M won the Hambantota seat, Rajapaksas are wholly absent in Hambantota for the first time, this election. On the wild side of it, there are numerous amoebic groups that have come out as ‚Äúnew‚Äù political parties and independent groups contesting most districts.

What many who run for office forget is that they are seeking to become members of a legislature

In Sri Lanka, the meaning of constituency service has been distorted over time to include matters such as springing people from remand and providing assistance in cash or kind for various ceremonies and events organised by constituents. The former should be illegal. The latter makes heavy demands on the finances of the MP and may be a causal factor fostering corruption in various forms. There will be no system change until voters cease to select their representative on how they helped get individuals out of remand or on the quality of the bus that was provided for a pilgrimage
