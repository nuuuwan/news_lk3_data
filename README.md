The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, is likely to approve another increase to crude oil production at its meeting on Sunday.

### Violence against Mannar people

*2025-09-29 17:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226435) · `ta`

The oppressive violence against the people fighting for their existence in Mannar is the blatant manifestation of state terrorism that has once again staged on the Tamil people.. Said Srikanta.

He made this statement at a media briefing held at a private guest hotel on Mattin Road, Jaffna.

If the government did not accept the real justice struggle of the people against the Mannar wind power plant, it should have legally arrested the people involved if it was illegal.

But the state has no power to attack them and cause injuries.

In this context, the state -led government is in office for a year, we consider this wild darbar that is an example of the attitude of the government when the democratic struggles against the state are expanding.

And no one who respects the fundamental rights of the people can accept democracy to recognize or recognize this ritual.

### Moody’s affirms India’s Baa3 rating, maintains stable outlook

Moody’s Ratings on Monday affirmed the Government of India’s long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings and the local-currency senior unsecured rating at Baa3. The ratings agency also affirmed India’s other short-term local-currency rating at P-3. The outlook remains stable.

“The rating affirmation and stable outlook reflect our view that India’s prevailing credit strengths, including its large, fast-growing economy, sound external position and stable domestic financing base for ongoing fiscal deficits, will be sustained,” it said.

These strengths lend resilience to adverse external trends, in particular as high US (Aa1 stable) tariffs and other international policy measures hinder India’s capacity to attract manufacturing investment, it added. India’s credit strengths are balanced by long-standing weaknesses on the fiscal side, which will remain.

COLOMBO (News 1st); His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, delivered a scathing critique of Sri Lanka’s past leadership and societal decline, stating that the country’s collapse was not accidental — but the result of a systemic failure of ethics, accountability, and justice.

Leading with moral skepticism, the Cardinal warned that a society without principles is destined to fall, and that Sri Lanka’s current crisis stems from a long-standing erosion of values across all levels of leadership.

“From the highest ranks to the grassroots,” he said, “a culture of corruption, theft, and selective justice has dragged the nation into ruin.”

He pointed to the absence of policy direction, integrity, and respect for law, noting that despite Sri Lanka’s natural beauty and potential, the country has become one of the most indebted in the world.
