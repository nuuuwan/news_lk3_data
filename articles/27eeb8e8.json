    "The government has announced new restrictions on marketing food and beverages for children under the Food (Labelling & Advertising) Regulations 2022. A long-felt need has been fulfilled, but much more remains to be done, given the increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, etc., among children. Food and beverage manufacturers stand accused of using excessive levels of sugar, salt, oil and food additives to catch them young.",
    "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), has welcomed the new restrictions at issue. Its positive response can be considered the food and beverage industry\u2019s willing compliance. Having helped the Ministry of Health during the consultation process, the CCC is of the view that under the new rules the industry must ensure that children under 12 are not featured in advertisements for food and beverage products and that such products are not advertised or promoted for children below 12 years without prior approval from the Ministry of Health. It says the updated food labelling requirements will empower consumers with essential information, including nutritional values and detailed ingredient lists to make informed food choices.",
    "It is one thing to introduce regulations to protect the public but it is quite another to ensure their enforcement. This country is not short of rules and regulations aimed at preventing unethical and illegal practices the food and beverage industry has earned notoriety for, but the regulatory authorities act in such a way that one wonders whether they are concerned about consumer safety at all. Consumers of all ages are at risk. A young woman was rushed to hospital recently after ingesting a detergent she was mistakenly served instead of a bottled soft drink at a restaurant in Pettah. A police investigation revealed that the restaurant staff had used soft drink bottles to store the surfactant!",
    "The health authorities should go beyond adopting measures such as mandatory labelling and restrictions on advertising to ensure consumer safety. The food and beverage industry must not be allowed to use labelling as a caveat emptor to market products that are harmful to consumers\u2019 health. Action must be taken to remove such products from the market to protect unsuspecting consumers who often overlook the fine print on food and beverage labels.",
    "It is not prudent to expect all food and beverage manufacturers to be truthful in respect of what is mentioned in the labels on their products. Hence the need for random testing besides stringent laws to deal with those who provide misleading or false information to consumers.",
    "There are many products sans labels for sale and how do the health authorities propose to ensure that they conform to the food and beverage safety regulations? Fast food outlets are apparently without any regulation across the country. There is nobody to check the levels of oil and additives in food items they sell, especially fried rice and koththu roti.",
    "A successful campaign to ensure that food and beverages conform to stipulated standards will go a long way towards preventing noncommunicable diseases this country is plagued by and reducing state health expenditure.",
