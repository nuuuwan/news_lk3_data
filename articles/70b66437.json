    "On December 1 television bulletins beamed and the print media published next day news of the presentation of the KT Chitrasiri report on parliamentary and presidential privileges to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. A smiling president was shown on television screens accepting the gift-wrapped report from the retired supreme court judge who with two others, retired Ministry Secretary D. Dissanayake and retired District Secretary CT Bulumulla had been tasked by the new regime to review the allowances, perks and privileges provided to MPs, ministers and former presidents. The much-awaited report is now being studied, the cabinet spokesman announced at his weekly briefing soon after it was in.",
    "Public opinion has long been running high about how this impoverished country\u2019s legislators have been showering themselves with perks and privileges at heavy cost to the taxpayer. Resentment on this score is huge. It must be said to the credit of the new administration and the president, who pledged during the election campaign to correct this situation, that they lost no time in appointing the Chitrasiri Committee, requiring it to report within a very tight time frame, on this much discussed topic affecting a wide range of politicians including former presidents.",
    "There has been no word yet on the actual content of the report; but the expectation among the public is that, befitting its gift-wrapped presentation, considerable reduction of past extravagances showered on elected officials will be addressed. These politicians sanctimoniously pledged to serve their electors rather than themselves but did quite the reverse. Particularly notable is the fact that President Dissanayake and the new parliament are willing to reduce their own privileges to within bounds of reason.",
    "Given today\u2019s prices, nobody would (or should) grudge an MP his monthly allowance or salary of Rs. 54,286 plus Rs. 100,000 a month to maintain an office. This is topped up with a sitting allowance of Rs. 2,500 a day \u2013 usually eight days a month except during the budget debate when there are daily sittings \u2013 payable for parliamentary sittings as well as attending meeting of committees on non-sitting days; an entertainment allowance of Rs. 1,000 a month, a driver\u2019s allowance of Rs. 3,500 monthly (if no government driver is provided as for ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers), Rs. 50,000 a month for telephones, a fuel allowance depending on the distance of the member\u2019s electorate from parliament (284 liters of diesel per month for Colombo MPs), a travel allowance of Rs. 2,500 per month each for four personal staff (Rs. 10,000 in all) and stamps to the value of Rs. 350,000 annually. These taken together would not seem excessive.",
    "Public resentment boils not so much over the above package but other lavish benefits served at taxpayer expense. News stories galore have been published about sumptuous subsidized meals served to MPs at the parliament restaurant scandalizing ordinary people struggling to make ends meet. Very often such reports bear no semblance of truth. Shortly after the August 2020 election, an orientation session for MPs threw up an astonishing revelation that an MP\u2019s meal cost Rs. 3,000! This fictitious figure had been calculated by dividing the total parliamentary food cost by 225 \u2013 the total number of MPs \u2013 when a large number of parliamentary staff and others are also fed off the parliament kitchen. The stated figure was far from accurate and did not reflect the reality. The last speaker (Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene) eventually offered a figure of Rs. 296 per head. But various other figures for fish and vegetarian meals have been bruited around although there was no figure offered for chicken meals that are also served in parliament.",
    "Duty free vehicle permits for MPs have been awarded from time to time \u2013 many of them sold on the market for figures running into millions \u2013 have infuriated the public. These permits were issued every five years in the past and the new administration is pledged to discontinue this widely condemned practice. President Premadasa used a special police unit headed by a respected senior officer to check on such abuses and that fueled the eventual impeachment resolution against him. Given the huge duties imposed on motor vehicles imported into this country, especially on luxury vehicles, the duty free permits exploited by many parliamentarians are widely resented. Fortunately, the new dispensation has made clear that such practices will not continue.",
    "MPs do need vehicles to carry out their duties and the issue of a non-luxury, fuel efficient vehicle to each of them \u2013 and not only government MPs \u2013 is not unreasonable. But the present administration has reversed a previous decision to issue vehicles to government MPs and decided to give them a fuel allowance instead. The NPP no doubt, is acutely conscious of its projected image that their MPs are different from those of the past and are more interested in serving their electors than themselves. Equity demands that opposition MPs are similarly treated.",
    "Payments and privileges of former presidents under the Presidents Entitlement Act of 1986 are also under review. These, including city mansions, luxury vehicles, secretarial help etc. in addition to the pension are widely regarded as overly lavish. We have seen two former presidents (Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirirsena) continue in parliament post-retirement presumably drawing current emoluments in addition to their benefits as former presidents. Among those alive today are former Presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe who served just two years. Mrs. Hema Premadasa, widow of assassinated President R. Premadasa, is also alive and paid a pension, provided a Colombo residence, transport and other privileges. The present government has expressed commitment to trim these including enormous security contingents for politicians past ad present. It has already been said that presidential mansions in various parts of the country including Kandy and Nuwara Eliya are intended to be used for the public benefit.",
    "The intentions of the new administration are excellent. Hopefully there will be delivery as promised.",
