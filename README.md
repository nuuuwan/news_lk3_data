A welcome trend is that more citizens and civic organisations are coming forward to challenge Bills before the Supreme Court

We propose a Code of Conduct applicable to Judges of Superior Courts. Allegations of serious infractions of the Code of Conduct shall be inquired into by a panel of three retired Judges of the Constitutional Court or the Supreme Court. They will be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council

We propose that the Chapter on fundamental rights be improved to include universally recognised rights. The scope of civil and political rights will be broadened. The right to life, human dignity, bodily integrity, and privacy will be guaranteed. The right of access to justice and the right to fair State action will be recognised. Social and economic rights, cultural rights, rights of women, children, the aged and the disabled, as well as group, environmental and development rights, would be recognised as judicially enforceable rights

Basil Rajapakse, the founder of the PA, said that the announcement of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's contesting as an independent candidate was completely wrong.

The executive committee of the PA was chaired by former President Mahinda Rajapakse to take a final decision on the presidential candidate.

It has been paid attention to a member of the PA in the presidential election and the candidature of President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the candidate.

One party has stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be fielded as presidential candidate and another party should field a member of the party as the presidential candidate.

It is absolutely wrong to announce that he is contesting as an independent candidate as he is in talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the issue of the presidential candidate.

We supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022 without any conditions. But for the past 2 years, he has not given priority to the PA's party.
