  "original_body_lines": [
    "The recent recall of Ambassador Udaya Indrarathna from his post in Abu Dhabi has sparked questions about the criteria used to define \u201cpolitical appointees.\u201d Widely regarded as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most effective ambassadors, Indrarathna has garnered respect as a skilled diplomat and earned a reputation as one of the top diplomats in the United Arab Emirates. Many even consider him worthy of the title \u201cDean of Ambassadors,\u201d recognising his exceptional service and influence in the region.",
    "Throughout his career, Indrarathna has exemplified dedication and integrity, bringing his vast expertise, influential connections, and strategic vision to the forefront of Sri Lanka\u2019s international representation. He has strengthened diplomatic ties and secured critical funding for Sri Lanka, achievements that underline his impact. In a short period, he has elevated Sri Lanka\u2019s profile within the Middle East, a region where his extensive network has proven invaluable.",
    "Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath himself has publicly described professionals like Indrarathna as \u201cnational assets,\u201d individuals crucial to Sri Lanka\u2019s future on the global stage. Ambassador Indrarathna\u2019s career encompasses several high level roles, including Senior Advisor to the Chairman\u2019s Office for Abu Dhabi\u2019s Culture and Tourism Department, Executive Director for Policy and Research in Dubai\u2019s Department of Tourism, Vertical CEO and Executive Committee Member at the Saudi conglomerate Ajlan Bros, and Visiting Lecturer at Paris Sorbonne University.",
    "Indrarathna\u2019s influence extends beyond policy and funding; he has also become a respected voice on the world stage, serving as a keynote speaker at numerous international events. Recently, he was a keynote lecturer in the Harvard Clubs of the APAC region, sharing the stage with prominent figures like Deepak Bagla, further emphasising his stature as a globally respected thought leader. His vision, strategic expertise, and dedication have allowed him to rebuild and revitalise the Abu Dhabi Embassy, leaving a lasting mark on Sri Lanka\u2019s diplomatic efforts in the region.",
    "Given his proven track record, Indrarathna\u2019s reassignment raises a critical question: why remove someone who has excelled in representing Sri Lanka in a region where he has strong, effective ties? In an era where diplomatic strength and strategic alliances are key, Sri Lanka\u2019s international presence would benefit from leaders like Indrarathna, whose contributions have consistently demonstrated his value to the nation.",
    "If Sri Lanka is to maximise its global potential, it\u2019s essential to support and retain talented diplomats who are not only passionate about their roles but have also proven their ability to make a real difference for the country. We hold the view that patriotic leaders, such as President Anura Dissanayake, will recognise and utilise Udaya Indrarathna\u2019s knowledge and global expertise to uplift Sri Lanka on the international stage."
