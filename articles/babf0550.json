    "Creativity is often the defining capital behind profitable ventures. This was most recently seen in the wide global recognition of entrepreneur Nawoda Bandara, taking Sri Lankan fashion international, with the support of AOD.",
    "Building brands that resonate beyond Sri Lanka is one of the most powerful ways to strengthen the nation\u2019s creative economy, drawing investment, expanding export potential, and elevating the country\u2019s profile with global consumers. Nawoda Bandara, a remarkably talented young fashion entrepreneur and graduate of AOD\u2019s Northumbria BA (Hons) Fashion and Textile Design program, is the latest to prove it. Her record of early accolades already speaks volumes: Best International Portfolio in 2023, Top Prize at Dubai Fashion Week \u00d7 IGFW, Top 5 in Asia at the CDC \u00d7 Lakm\u00e9 Fashion Week competition. Showing early signs of this success, her academic years were also filled with international recognition; Top 15 in Asia at the Redress Design Awards, Top 9 Global Finalist in Hong Kong, winner of the TAL \u00d7 Browzwear 3D Fashion Challenge, Second Place in the SDC International Design Competition, plus titles such as Multidisciplinary Designer of the Year and Outstanding Student of the Year. Her brand NAO\u2019s recent feature in Vogue celebrates her vision of Sri Lankan fashion that honours craft while embracing the future.",
    "Each milestone elevates Sri Lanka\u2019s creative industries, proving local talent can excel globally. Nawoda\u2019s success boosts investor confidence, attracts collaborators, and positions the island as a serious player in design, fashion, and cultural entrepreneurship.",
    "AOD spotted Nawoda\u2019s potential early, pairing her with mentors and opening doors to international competitions and collaborations. Now she\u2019s a designer fluent in global fashion yet rooted in Sri Lanka\u2019s stories: a mix that attracts investors and collaborators worldwide. By blending creativity with entrepreneurship, AOD equips students with tools, confidence, and global networks to build sustainable, industry-ready careers. Its partnerships, collaborations, and ongoing mentorship give graduates like Nawoda the credibility and opportunities to thrive.",
    "Nawoda confirms: \u201cAOD has been an important part of my journey, giving me the foundation and platform to grow as a designer. Its supportive environment encouraged me to experiment, refine my craft, and push design boundaries. The mentorship, exposure to industry professionals, and opportunities to showcase my work gave me confidence to pursue fashion. AOD\u2019s strong industry connections opened doors for collaborations, competitions, and international recognition. Most importantly, AOD believed in me, nurtured my passion, and helped me channel it into a career aligned with sustainability, creativity, and cultural pride.\u201d",
    "Nawoda\u2019s success highlights the power of education combined with industry collaboration and cultural innovation. Her journey proves that locally educated talent can become industry leaders and entrepreneurs who not only keep pace with the world but shape it.",
