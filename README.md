### Investment in women as a pathway to societal progress

*2024-03-09 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Investment-in-women-as-a-pathway-to-societal-progress/172-278517) · `en`

Investing in women also includes actively addressing discrimination and ensuring laws, policies, budgets and investments that respond to their needs

It is time that Sri Lanka prioritizes women’s empowerment and recognizes that gender equality is not only a matter of rights but the bedrock of an equitable, peaceful and prosperous society. However, it takes investment to build inclusive communities and societies with the full participation of women and girls from all backgrounds

When global crises such as climate disasters, poverty, and hunger occur, women and girls are affected the most

Gender inequality is also reflected in women’s representation and participation in leadership, which remains abysmally low in Sri Lanka

### The executive prevails ultimately

Despite the executive colliding head on sometimes with the Parliament and some other times with judiciary, the Constitutional Council and “independent Commissions in the recent past, the former has emerged victorious always, sometimes at the expense of the rules of the duel.

For instance, in spite of the battle between the executive on behalf of the two ruling parties and the Election Commission backed by the Opposition parties over the local government elections having been dragging on for more than a year, the two ruling parties – the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) can boast to have the “mission accomplished.”

### Harin Fernando is right Sri Lanka is part of civilizational India and should aspire to be part of economic India

Every attempt by successive Sri Lankan governments to open up the local economy to the world has been obstructed by a minority of individuals and groups with vested interests. The picture shows Colombo Port City, a project funded by China, and these groups have been skeptical of such foreign investments

Those days, I noted, when the queues get shortened, the country would revert to the old habits

How much of a window to India that Sri Lanka could now aspire to be is open to question

### Can protesting undergrads think of a ‘new’ colour?

Parents of university students are a worried lot at present. This is because there is speculation that their children in university may be featuring in a number of protests throughout March, according media reports.

There are the pluses and minuses of such protests. Protests of this nature will certainly be of news value to the media. Protesting undergrads have often won their rights and also the hearts of the down-trodden masses. But from the perspective of the country’s economy and the future of these students there are people who disapprove of such violent gatherings. Critics ask the question whether such gatherings have to be so disruptive and violent at times! They in return ask the question whether these undergraduates cannot think of an innovative way of staging a protest that will grab the attention of the government and also win their demands?

In an era where digital platforms play a central role in organizational success, many small businesses, especially those led by women, encounter significant barriers due to a lack of digital literacy, resources, and support networks. Despite possessing the drive and innovation necessary for success, these barriers often hinder #womeninbusiness from thriving in the competitive online marketplace.

We are so immersed in our bankrupted country’s economic collapse, not knowing where our next meal comes from, not knowing where to get some medicine for our ill and the elderly or books and bus fare for our children to go to school that we do not hear and see the desperate cries coming from the rubble of bombed out and devastated Gaza. The death toll in Gaza is passing the mark of 30,000. So many children and women, so many elderly who could not run away from bombs in time have died, practically all of them civilians.

March 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices surged to a fresh record high on Friday as data showing a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates soon.

Spot gold rose 0.7% to $2,173.49 per ounce by 10:42 a.m. ET (1542 GMT), while U.S. gold futures added 0.7% to $2,180.50.

Bullion was on track to post its biggest weekly percentage increase since mid-October.

Gold reached an all-time high of $2,185.19 after a report showed a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate and a moderation in wage gains despite job growth acceleration in February.

"We still believe the same underlying premise remains, which is the combination of the expectation that the Fed is still going to cut rates later this year and dollar weakness," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

### Gold hits fresh record, heads for best week in 5 months

Gold prices hit record highs for a fourth consecutive session on Friday on growing speculations over June interest rate cuts ahead of key U.S. jobs data due later in the day.

Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,168.28 per ounce as of 1057 GMT, while U.S. gold futures added 0.5% to $2,175.50.

Gold reached a new all-time high of $2,170.99 earlier in the session and has gained more than 4.1% so far this week, setting it on track to post its biggest weekly percentage increase since mid-October.

“I think a lot of the demand that we’ve seen coming from is really in the paper market. It’s just speculative demand,” said Michael Widmer, Bank of America’s head of Metals Research.

“You always had good support from Chinese buying and central bank buying. But that was never enough to take prices high.”

Gold first surpassed its December peak on Tuesday, primarily aided by growing indications of cooling price pressures and bullion’s traditional safe-haven cachet.

Within the Parliament, many groups and unions are running. However, the problems of the mountain plantation community are being investigated directly on anything that is doing so is very low. Thus, there is no such thing as the development of policymakers and projects related to the future of the mountain plantation community.

To eliminate this gap, the Union was founded in Parliament at the request of the Tamil Progressive Alliance to carry out the activities of the Upcountry Plantation Community.

Dylan Perera, a representative of the Independent People's Council, urged national unity in this coalition. Sri Lanka Peramuna's alliance with the United National Party could lead to less than 20 seats in the general election, prompting President Ranil Wickremesinghe to prioritize the United National Party.

### Indian Ocean Security Conference & Ranil’s Statement – A Point Of View

*2024-03-08 17:33:15* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/indian-ocean-security-conference-ranils-statement-a-point-of-view/) · `en`

I refer to the front page headlined news report in the Daily News paper of 29th February 2024 and wish to express my independent, objective views as a free thinker.

Indian Ocean as the name suggest is virtually India’s Ocean, because India is the predominant country in the region. The security of the Indian Ocean is a major concern of India, as much as those of the other littoral countries, including Sri Lanka. In this light, saying that Sri Lanka will remain neutral is preposterous. Sri Lanka’s security is also tied up with the Indian Ocean Security. Therefore, it cannot remain neutral and do nothing about it.
