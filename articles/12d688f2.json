    "2024 election season marked final act of the \u2018Our Saviour II\u2019 drama which premiered in November 2019. The NPP/JVP\u2019s unprecedented victories would not have happened without Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s unprecedented presidential record, turning a lower-middle income country to a bankrupt one in less than three years.",
    "On July 5, 2022, a 60-year-old man died in a petrol queue in Borella. And the Gota-go-gama protesters gave Gotabaya Rajapaksa three days to resign from the presidency.",
    "On July 8, thousands of university students marched to the Galle Face Green in a massive procession, resisting barrages of tear gas and water cannon. People lined the streets cheering them on. \u201cWe are suffering a lot,\u201d one woman cried. \u201cThese children should be protected by the gods. We are trying to correct a wrong we did\u2026 We are coming tomorrow.\u201d",
    "And come they did. On July 9, 2022, nearly a million Lankans poured into Colombo and drove out Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Another act unprecedented not only in modern times but in our entire 2+millennia history. Many a Lankan monarch got deposed, often violently, but there is no record of a king being evicted via a popular rebellion. There were no Cromwells in this island, let alone Robespierres.",
    "\u201cWe are trying to correct a wrong we did,\u201d was a constant refrain during the three Aragalaya months. Sobered by brutal reality, most of the 6.3 million Lankans who voted for Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019 had turned against their once-adored saviour.",
    "The NPP/JVP was the main beneficiary of this disillusionment. According to the IHP\u2019s first public opinion tracker, published in August 2022, 41% of Lankans would vote for Anura Kumara Dissanayake in a presidential election and 42% it said for the NPP in a parliamentary election. Neither Mr. Dissanayake nor the NPP/JVP had played a role in the Aragalaya \u2013 unlike the breakaway FSP which provided the protest movement with thousands of activists and its most recognisable spokesperson, Wasantha Mudalige.",
    "But the FSP was too unreconstructed to be electable, even in the aftermath of an unprecedented crisis. The NPP/JVP on the other hand had a more moderate, and therefore more electable, image. Moreover, it had managed to position itself as the antipode to the Rajapaksas. The SJB too contested for that position, but embraced too many former Rajapaksa-enablers (from old-timers like Dulles Allahapperuma and GL Peiris to Viyath Maga types like Charitha Herath) to carry credibility. The NPP/JVP had prudently closed its doors to any politician closely associated with the Rajapaksas. They also promised to bring the Rajapaksas to justice, another popular promise amongst one-time Rajapaksa voters who felt betrayed and dreamt of vengeance.",
    "So now the Rajapaksas are reduced to 3% and the voters have given the NP/JVP a governance magic wand. The Dissanayake government has enough power to deliver all its many promises \u2013 a new constitution downwards. 1977 was the last an administration had a hand so free, for good or ill. Almost half-a-century away, we still live in the country JR Jayewardene remade, both for better and for worse. The NPP/JVP has a similar opportunity to remould Sri Lanka. How they use that opportunity could determine Sri Lanka\u2019s fate not only in the next five years but for decades to come.",
    "The 2024 parliamentary election was a kind of a referendum on the less than two-month tenure of Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The opposition understood this fact correctly, which was why it honed on malaises such as price hikes and shortages in rice and coconuts.",
    "But that tactic failed. At the parliamentary election, the NPP/JVP managed to increase its vote by 1.23 million; 22%. Normally, when presidential and parliamentary elections are held in close proximity, the winner of the presidency gains parliamentary power as well, but with a reduced vote-haul. In 2010, Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s UPFA swept the parliamentary election with 60% of the vote but its vote count decreased by a massive 1.15million. In 2020, the Rajapaksa SLPP won the parliamentary election with 59% of the vote, but its vote count decreased by 100,000. The NPP/JVP shattered this normal.",
    "The IHP published two polls after the presidential election. One showed a surge in the popularity ratings of President Dissanayake and Prime Minister Amarasuriya, at 58% and 55% respectively. The other showed a massive turnaround in public satisfaction about the new direction of the country \u2013 from 16% just before the presidential election to 46% just after.",
    "The giant leap in the NPP/JVP vote between September and November is indicative of a sense of satisfaction with its governance performance. But the even greater leap in the NPP/JVP vote share, from 43% in September to 62% in November, was caused primarily by the opposition\u2019s galloping unpopularity. As many as 1.1million Lankans who voted in the presidential election (doubtless for Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe) didn\u2019t vote in the parliamentary election. It was this abstention which gave a two-thirds victory to the NPP/JVP. Without that, the NPP/JVP would have scored only a simple majority, with 52% of the vote.",
    "Sajith Premadasa\u2019s SJB lost 3.4 million votes and Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s NDF lost 1.7 million votes \u2013 78% and 75% respectively \u2013 in under two months. Both fielded candidates epitomising the worst of the past; by doing so both aligned with a political culture synonymous with corruption, privilege, and impunity. The ongoing infantile squabble for the opposition\u2019s meagre haul of national seats cannot but worsen matters. The SJB and the UNP \u2013 and their respective leaders \u2013 obviously don\u2019t understand how distasteful, even unsavoury, their conduct looks to ordinary people. If the two parties continue in this vein, their vote count will decrease even more drastically at the upcoming local government and provincial council elections.",
    "In 2014, the JVP replaced Somawansa Amarasinghe with Anura Kumara Dissanayake as party leader. Had that change not happened, had Mr. Amarasinghe clung to party leadership, there would have been no NPP, and no march to power in 2024. The JVP was able to make that change because it was not \u2013 at least post-Wijeweera \u2013 a leader-centric party. Unfortunately, under Ranil Wickremesinghe the UNP has become a leader-centric party; and its offshoot SJB has that fault in its very genes. The tragic fate of the UNP, reduced from being the single largest party to a mere 4% of electoral support, is the fate that awaits the SJB, not so far ahead.",
    "Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. Close to half of Lankan voters still remain on the non/anti-NPP/JVP side of the divide. If the relatively rational, moderate, and non-racist UNP and SJB dwindle into irrelevance, who or what will replace them? Especially if the NPP/JVP fails to satisfy the veritable sky of expectations deposited on its shoulders; and disenchantment, radical in consequences, sets in?",
    "What fails to evolve sinks into extinction. That Darwinian discovery is true for political parties as well. Even with \u2018Crisis Gotabaya\u2019, the JVP would not have won if it didn\u2019t change its leader or create the NPP. For a party like the JVP, such changes would not have come easily, yet it managed \u2013 and prevailed. Hopefully, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa would learn from the JVP. The best they can do for themselves and the country is to resign from their leadership positions, thereby removing the actual obstacles to the reunification of the UNP and the SJB. If they fail to act with maturity and responsibility, the next swing in the pendulum will bring to power a new generation of Rajapaksas, or something even worse.",
    "The most remarkable of the NPP/JVP\u2019s achievements in the parliamentary election was not its two-thirds majority, but the plural, Lankan nature of its mandate. In another unprecedented development, it prevailed in the Sinhala South, the Tamil North, the Muslim East and the Malayaga Tamil Upcountry simultaneously. Its vote gains in the North and the East were massive: 65% in Jaffna; 46% in Vanni; 26% in Ampara; 30% in Batticaloa; and 43% in Trinco. Economics and caste would have been factors in this voter-shift, as well as the inability of traditional Tamil politicians to deliver much on the economic or political front. The opening of the Palaly-Achchuveli main road, the promise to release all political prisoners and to return all military-occupied lands (made during the Jaffna rally) would have generated hope of a post-racial Sri Lanka in which all communities would be treated alike.",
    "The voters don\u2019t expect miracles. But if the government fails to deliver or delivers to the wrong people \u2013 such as not enough reduction in electricity prices for low-end consumers while substantial tax cuts for the rich or professionals, disenchantment will set in. Given the state of the opposition, the danger of the anti-government sentiment taking an anti-Tamil or anti-Muslim channel is considerable.",
    "Already the Rajapaksas are readying for that future, as is evident from Namal Rajapaksa\u2019s social media comment on the release of several acres of private land in Jaffna to original owners by the army after 30 years of occupation. Mr. Rajapaksa makes use of standard code-words: national security, terrorism etc. (https://x.com/rajapaksanamal/status/1859199555759227218?s=46 ) For now, the response would be limited to toxic words. Once the shine wears off the new government, the time for deeds would come.",
    "Soon after the US issued its travel advisory about an \u2018impending attack on Israeli tourists\u2019 in Arugam Bay, media reports mentioned a \u2018demonstration by locals\u2019 in support of Israeli tourists. The participants carried a host of Israeli flags. Since Israeli flags cannot be a common commodity in Arugam Bay, one wonders where they came from and whether the demonstration was organised by non-local elements, interested in creating a cat-among-pigeons type of situation in Arugam Bay.",
    "The danger of Arugam Bay and can be best illustrated via a de tour \u2013 the recent riots in Amsterdam. The story began with the match between Israel\u2019s Maccabi-Tel Aviv team and the Netherland\u2019s AFC Ajax team. Maccabi fans arrived in Amsterdam days before the match, and unlike the usual sports-tourists brought the Gaza war with them. For two days, hundreds of them roamed the city, tearing down Palestinian flags, destroying a taxi belonging to a Dutch citizen of Arab origin, and chanting such racist slogans as \u2018Victory to the IDF. F\u2026.k the Arabs\u2019. During the match, they interrupted the two-minute silence for Valencia flood victims and chanted \u2018There are no schools in Gaza, (because) there are no kids\u2019, a reference to tens of thousands of children murdered by Israeli forces.",
    "Having lost the match, Maccabi fans went out to the streets attacking passers-by and the police. \u201cThey took the metal pipes from this construction site and started throwing them at people and police vans,\u201d reported Bender, Amsterdam\u2019s teen You Tube reporter. \u201cThey have kids, I think not even twelve years old, walking around with sticks on the front. And they are looking for a fight\u2026 It looks like they have these kids, barely 1.5 meters tall, who just attacked these undercover police officers with a stick\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySHIOYyJ95A&t=21s). In retaliation, Ajax fans, made up of Amsterdam residents of Arab and Dutch origin, unleashed their own brand of violence. Though the counter-violence contained traces of anti-Semitism, it was not a pogrom as Bibi Netanyahu and Joe Biden rushed to proclaim. The Amsterdam mayor who parroted the charge later backtracked, and even admitted the role played by Maccabi fans in igniting the situation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H_ozYgHpoM).",
    "From Amsterdam to Arugam Bay. Commenting on the conduct of Maccabi fans in Amsterdam, Yuval Gal, a member of the Dutch Jewish anti-Zionist collective Erev Rav said, \u201cWe know many of them are soldiers and ex-soldiers in Gaza right now. I also tried to explain this to the police. I said, \u2018Look, if somebody just came back from Gaza, and just came back from killing a lot of people, you don\u2019t expect them to act normally in your city\u2019\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moPFJD3L16k).",
    "And in faraway Arugam Bay, there are at least at least two billboards commemorating IDF members killed in the war against Gaza. What if at some point an angry local objected? We know how easily verbal violence can descend into physical violence. All context would be lost; Bibi Netanyahu and Donald Trump would be screaming \u2018pogrom\u2019 and government would be forced to crack down on its own citizens.",
    "Why are some Israeli tourists putting up structures to honour their war-dead in someone else\u2019s country? Perhaps the answer lies in the structure at the heart of the recent terror scare. Chabad House is a religio-political structure belonging to the Chabad-Lubavitch Movement, an ultra-Orthodox Hasidic which denies Palestinian statehood and Palestinian humanity. Unlike most orthodox Jews, its members serve in the Israel army and are enthusiastic participants of the current genocidal war in Gaza. Allowing a Chabad House belonging to a right wing Israeli religious sect in Muslim majority Arugam Bay is as politically insane as allowing Bodu Bala Sena to construct a \u2018Sinhalaramaya\u2019 (Sinhala Temple) in Jaffna town.",
    "If the Chabad-Lubavitch Movement is permitted a legal footprint in the East, the next step may well be a tactical alliance between their operatives and Sinhala hardliners dreaming of regaining a slice of power via Muslim-phobia. When the US travel advisory was issued, Udaya Gammanpila did try to run with the issue, draping himself metaphorically in the Israeli-flag, but in the current non-extremist political climate his attempt did not work. The story can have a different ending once government\u2019s popularity starts to wane, especially if the democratic opposition\u2019s decline continues. Since Gotabaya Rajapaksa epitomised ethno-religious racism, the anti-Gotabaya wave was non-racist. Since the new government is non-racist, the reaction to it is more likely to be racist than not.",
