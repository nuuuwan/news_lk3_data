  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved providing financial assistance of Rs. 1 million each to young men and women leaving child development centres, to help them establish stable and secure homes as they prepare for marriage.",
    "Accordingly, a total provision of Rs. 1 billion has been allocated in the 2025 Budget for this initiative, which will be jointly implemented by the Women and Child Affairs Ministry, the Department of Probation and Child Protection Services, the Department of Finance Development, Provincial Probation Departments, District Secretaries, and Divisional Secretaries.",
    "Under the program, financial assistance will be extended to two main groups: 1) Young men and women, over the age of 18, who do not have a stable and safe home, are married or planning to marry, and have left institutional care within the last 10 years (after 30 June 2015) and 2) Young people above 18 years who continue to reside in child development centres due to the lack of proper family support or livelihood opportunities, with a special focus on young women.",
    "Officials said the scheme is designed to address the challenges faced by institutionalised youth as they transition into independent life, ensuring social stability and reducing vulnerabilities."
