ඉන්දියාවේ හිටපු අග්‍රාමාත්‍යවරයෙකු වන මන්මෝහන් සිං මහතා අද (26) පස්වරුවේ අභාවප්‍රාප්ත වූ බව විදෙස් මාධ්‍ය වාර්තා කරයි.

1932 වසරේ වත්මන් පාකිස්තානයට අයත් කොටසක් වන පංජාබ්හිදී උපත ලැබූ ඒ මහතා මිය යන විට වයස අවුරුදු 92ක් විය.

ඉන්දියාවේ 13 වැනි අග්‍රාමාත්‍යවරයා වන මන්මෝහන් සිං මහතා දෙවරක් ඉන්දීය අගමැති ලෙසින් කටයුතු කර ඇත.

ප්‍රකට ආර්ථික විශේෂඥයෙක් වන ඔහු, ඉන්දීය ආර්ථික ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ ක්‍රියාවලියේ ප්‍රමුඛයෙක් ලෙස ද සැලකෙයි.

පන්ජාබ් විශ්වවිද්‍යාලයෙන් සිය මූලික උපාධිය ලබාගත් මන්මෝහන් අනතුරුව එංගලන්තයේ කේම්බ්‍රිජ් සහ ඔක්ස්ෆර්ඩ් විශ්වවිද්‍යාලවල අධ්‍යාපනය ලැබීය.

සිය අධ්‍යාපන කටයුතුවලින් අනතුරුව ඔහු ඉන්දීය සිවිල් සේවයට එක්වී තිබුණි.

1991 වසරේදී ඉන්දීය ආර්ථිකය කඩාගෙන වැටුණු අතර එය ගොඩනැගීමේ වගකීම පැවරුණේ මන්මෝහන් ටය.

ඒ අනුව එරට මුදල් අමාත්‍යවරයා ලෙස පත්වූ ඔහු ඉන්දීය ආර්ථිකය ක්‍රමයෙන් යථා තත්ත්වයට පත්කළේය.

අද ලෝක ආර්ථිකයේ දැවැන්තයෙක්වන  ඉන්දියාව ට ඒ සඳහා මග පෙන්වූවේ ඔහු බව බොහෝ දෙනා පවසති.

මන්මෝහන් සිං මහතා, 2004 වසරේ සිට 2014 දක්වා එරට අග්‍රාමාත්‍යවරයා ලෙස කටයුතු කළේය.

### Bangladesh to re-investigate 2009 mutiny massacre, role of ‘foreign’ backers

Bangladesh on Thursday ordered a commission to investigate a failed 2009 army mutiny and subsequent crackdown, including the role of alleged “foreign” backers, the inquiry chief said.

The violent mutiny sent shock waves through the South Asian nation and ended with the army crushing the mutineers, with scores arrested and sentenced to death.

A previous official investigation into the mutiny which left scores dead blamed years of pent-up anger among ordinary soldiers, who felt their appeals for pay rises and better treatment were ignored.

But that probe was carried out during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister by a revolution in August, when she fled to old ally India.

Since her fall, families of soldiers killed in the violence have been campaigning to reopen the investigation.

They have repeatedly accused Hasina -- then newly elected -- of orchestrating a plan to weaken the military to bolster her own power in a country prone to coups.

ECONOMYNEXT – Although Germany’s Supply Chain Act on Sri Lanka’s tea industry is minimal, tea exporters are likely to be driven out of the German market to countries with less stringent regulations, a policy paper by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation says.

“Particularly in cases where Germany is not an essential market for an industry, as is the case with the tea industry of Sri Lanka, the Supply Chain Act would only drive exporters away from Germany,” a policy paper on German Supply Chain Act: Impact on the tea and apparel industries of Sri Lanka showed.

The German supply chain act was passed in the Bundestag and was in effect from January 2023.

“Tea industry is generally not happy about the new law,” Sudaraka Ariyaratne, Research Consultant and Author of the Publication said at a panel discussion organized by the Foundation to discuss the Act’s implications on Sri Lanka’s tea and apparel industries.

### The national bird of the United States of America

*2024-12-26 13:12:36* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/உலக-செய்திகள்/அமெரிக்காவின்-தேசிய-பறவை-வெண்தலைக்-கழுகு/50-349321) · `ta`

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



The Bald Eagle is the official national bird of the USA since 1782. It appears on U.S. government seals and documents. While widely considered the national bird, its status was only officially confirmed in 1940. The question about Trump's presidency is unrelated to the eagle's symbolism.

🟩

The question arises as to whether Trump will be sworn in as president next month, as the current President of the United States has signed the National Bird Eagle.

The symbol is being inscribed in all the US government documents, as the US government stamps in the United States in 1782.. In the meantime, the ventricle has been a symbol of the US government for the past 240 years.

Many people comment that this eagle is the national bird of the United States. But in fact, it has not been officially recognized by the state as the national bird of the United States.
