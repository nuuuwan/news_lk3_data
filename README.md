### Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid

It’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.

The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60% of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.

The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46% of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.

### Untold Lessons: Economic Insights From History For Sri Lanka’s Crisis

*2024-12-24 16:51:35* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/untold-lessons-economic-insights-from-history-for-sri-lankas-crisis/) · `en`

With a new government in power, Sri Lanka finds itself grappling with immense economic challenges. The burden of enormous debts continues to weigh heavily on a fragile economy, necessitating robust growth to overcome these hardships. However, achieving such growth is complicated by a governmental predisposition toward centralised economic control, rooted in socialist-communal ideologies.

These challenges are not unique to Sri Lanka; they echo the historical pitfalls of centralised economic systems. This essay explores three illustrative examples from American history: The failed socialism of the Plymouth Colony, the rapid recovery during the Forgotten Depression of 1920-1921, and the transformative innovation of the Gilded Age.

These examples are not often the subject of discussion by contemporary economists, but they offer valuable insights into the perils of excessive government control and the potential of free-market principles to foster prosperity.

### South Korean opposition puts off plan to impeach acting president Han

*2024-12-24 16:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104473/south-korean-opposition-puts-off-plan-to-impeach-acting-president-han) · `en`

South Korea’s main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened.

The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived bid to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that he partly blamed on the opposition’s propensity to impeach government officials.

Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday.

The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol’s failed bid to impose martial law.
