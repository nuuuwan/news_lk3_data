Colombo, May 27 (Daily Mirror) - If rainfall in the catchment areas increases during the day, it is possible that more sluice gates will need to be opened at various dams and reservoirs, the Irrigation Department’s Irrigation (Hydrology) Director Eng. S.P.C. Sugeeshwara Bandara said.

Addressing the media he said 80 percent of water capacity is currently avaliable in all irrigation reservoirs and said this a considerably higher capacity.

"The Deduru Oya in the Kurunegala district and the Tabbowa Wewa in the Puttalam district are currently spilling. Four sluice gates of the Deduru Oya have been opened, releasing water at a rate of 2,800 cubic inches per second. Additionally, two gates of the Tabbowa Wewa have been opened, releasing 800 cubic inches of water per second," he said.

Although the situation is not currently high risk, more rain could necessitate the opening of additional sluice gates, which would pose a significant risk to residents in low-lying areas, he said.

Govindan Karunagaram, a Batticaloa district parliamentarian, expressed readiness to negotiate with the president for economic recovery, emphasizing consideration for minority issues. He spoke at the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club, highlighting the need for addressing minority problems. The People's Alliance (PA) faces challenges in nominating a presidential candidate due to past political dynamics, but potential opportunities exist for candidates supporting the PA, especially with the possibility of multiple contestants in the upcoming presidential election. This could allow any candidate to secure over 50% of the Sinhalese vote, potentially uniting Tamil Muslims and hill country people as a formidable force.

Batticaloa district parliamentarian Govindan Karunagaram (Jana) said that if the country is to be economically recovered, we are ready to talk to them if the president will consider the minority people and examine their problems.

The PA is not in a position to field a presidential candidate at present. The people of this country are not prepared to support the PA and make their candidate win. This is because former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse, who made 69 lakhs of votes, chased him away in the last two years of the last period of 2019.. That situation is still from the Sinhalese.
