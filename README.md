The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has raised concerns about potential non-compliance with the Supreme Court’s Determination regarding the recently enacted Online Safety Act. In a letter addressed to the Speaker of Parliament, the HRCSL highlighted that the Supreme Court had identified over 30 clauses and omissions in the original Online Safety Bill that were inconsistent with the Constitution.

While the Court permitted Parliament to proceed with the Bill after incorporating specific amendments, the HRCSL’s review of the enacted Act suggests that these changes may not have been fully implemented. The Commission emphasised that enacting legislation without addressing the Court’s concerns raises serious questions about the Act’s compliance with the Constitution, particularly regarding fundamental rights protections.

Continuing its months-long streak, the Central Bank purchased another US $ 245.3 million in foreign exchange from the domestic banking system and sold nothing in January, ending as a net purchaser of foreign currency to begin the year.

This is a sign of improving foreign currency liquidity in the domestic banking system further into the new year, when the Central Bank ended up purchasing US $ 1,895.87 million in 2023, reaching a record level, given the trying conditions prevailed in foreign currency conditions for most part of the year.

The Central Bank recently said these substantial net absorptions contributed immensely for it to be able to rebuild the reserves to US $ 4.4 billion by the end of 2023.

A month later, the reserves further rose by just shy of US $ 100 million to US $ 4,491.0 million by the end of January 2024.

It is feared that an Indian State’s restrictive law on live-in relationships may be replicated by other conservative State governments in India

Earlier this month, the Legislative Assembly of Uttarakhand, a North Indian State at the foot of the Himalayas, passed a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). While most of the provisions were progressive, there were some which put fetters on “live-in” relationships, to the extent of criminalizing them. These provisions have come in for much criticism on the grounds that they invade privacy and individual liberty guaranteed by the Indian constitution.

The law defines living-in as a “relationship between a man and a woman who cohabit in a shared household through a relationship in the nature of marriage.”

President Wickremesinghe said in Parliament last week that “Sri Lanka expects to implement a debt restructuring framework within the first six months of 2024, expressing confidence that the nation was recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades.” The Sri Lankan economy is clearly showing signs of recovery from the severe economic crisis, with improvements in our foreign exchange positions and current account deficits. But a significant challenge remains in managing the country’s large sovereign debt and inequities of the partial coverage of the domestic debt optimisation program. Therefore we need to show some tangible progress in the debt rescheduling.
