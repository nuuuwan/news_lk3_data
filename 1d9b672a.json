  "original_body_lines": [
    "The prices of bakery products, including bread, will be reduced only if egg and wheat flour prices are reduced, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners' Association (ACBOA) said.",
    "ACBOA chairman N.K. Jayawardena said the price of an egg, which is provided for bakery products, should be reduced to Rs. 35 and wheat flour import, which was suspended temporarily, should be resumed with immediate effect.",
    "If the wheat flour price is between Rs. 170 and Rs. 180 while imports are not suspended, then the association is in a position to reduce the price of a 450 g loaf of bread by more than Rs 10, Jayawardena said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
