These were roles customised for Sajith and the SJB to play: SWRD 1956, Ranasinghe Premadasa 1988 or both.

The objective of lowering generation costs and, consequently, consumer tariffs will certainly not be achieved by the recent cabinet decision to reduce the Feed-In Tariff for Solar Rooftop PV, which, fortunately, has not been approved by the PUCSL

It is everyone’s hope that we may at last be moving towards a new dawn of prosperity and a future of sustainable growth in all aspects of economy and social well-being, with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake leading the way.

This hope is most prevalent in the Energy Sector, which has remained in the clutches of the fossil fuel lobby. While the transport fuels still remain nearly 100% dependent on imported fossil fuels, energy sources used for generation electricity generation have shown some progress in reducing dependence on such imports through the use of indigenous renewable energy sources.

Economic and social policies based on Buddhist principles were the foundation of peace and prosperity in ancient Sri Lanka. A close examination of this Buddhist foundation would be of assistance to attain, once again, the cherished goal of peace and economic prosperity.

Economic and political theories before Western influence were based on two famous ancient treatises, namely, Kautilya’s Arthaśāstra and Brihaspati’s Arthaśāstra. They had one common feature, in that, under the title of Arthaśātra both writers had written on politics and economics, leaving out the most important ingredient for any development process, i.e. the mental and spiritual development of man.

ECONOMYNEXT – The arrest of Chinese, Indian and Thai nationals in multiple locations who were apparently targeting financial systems and banks in third countries have left authorities wondering whether Sri Lanka is becoming a cyber crimes hub.

“We have to see if Sri Lanka is a cyber crimes hub,” Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters, “and whether our financial system is being affected by this.”

The Police have arrested over 200 foreign nationals, mainly Chinese, who were housed in several locations, including Kandy, Avissawella, Rajigiriya, and Negombo.

“They had booked 72 rooms in a hotel in Kandy where these people had access to pool and kitchen facilities,” Police Spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said.

Scammers come to the Indian Ocean island on tourist visas, Thalduwa said.

One reason Sri Lanka could be an attractive destination for cyber scamming hubs, he said, was the easy access to housing, or lodging. “It’s easier to get houses here.”
