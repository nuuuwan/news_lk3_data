    "In response to criticisms levelled against the new social welfare program \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 the Government yesterday assured it will prevent any injustices from occurring to beneficiaries of the program.",
    "Issuing a statement, the President\u2019s Media Division said the Government is paying close attention to certain attempts to satisfy their political needs by giving the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 program, which was created to aid those in need of economic stability, a political fa\u00e7ade.",
    "\u201cThe Government assures that any shortcomings in the process of selecting the relevant candidates will be rectified immediately and plans are being made to discuss this with the district secretaries, divisional secretaries, and other parties involved in the program in the coming week,\u201d the PMD release said.",
    "\u201cAccordingly, these payments will be distributed among four social categories, namely transitional, vulnerable, poor, and extremely poor. Additionally, the usual allowances for the differently-abled, elderly, and kidney patients will also be provided,\u201d it added.",
    "The release said Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena as the Provincial Councils and local Government Minister has announced that the time given to those who have been wronged in the selection of the beneficiaries of the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 welfare benefits payment program to hand over appeals and objections has been extended until July 10, as some parties have alleged that there have been shortcomings in the process.",
    "\u201cThe necessary work is also being carried out in this regard by Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe and State Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. Accordingly, if an individual or family in need of economic stability has lost this benefit, there is an opportunity to correct it by making inquiries through the Divisional Secretariats during the relevant period,\u201d it added."
