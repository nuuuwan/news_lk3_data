Hints two additional parties may join their coalition during meeting

Sarvajana Balaya is set to hold its inaugural political rally today in Nugegoda, aiming to reignite the support of the 6.9 million voters who previously backed a better future for the country. During the meeting, it is hinted that two additional parties may join their coalition.

Holding a media briefing, Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) leader Dilith Jayaweera expressed readiness to rekindle the enthusiasm of those voters.

He stressed that none of the Sarvajana Balaya representatives were responsible for the downfall of the previous regime, attributing the failure to the Rajapaksa family’s inability to meet the people’s expectations.

Jayaweera specifically blamed Basil Rajapaksa’s liberal ideologies for the regime’s collapse.

“The 6.9 million voters symbolise those who love the country,” Jayaweera stated.

He said there is no option for the people of the country other than rallying around Sarvajana Balaya.

### To criticize the pitch or the competition table

Despite early preparation and practice matches, the team struggled with quick adjustments to the US conditions, affecting their performance in the R20 World Cup. Hazaranga highlighted the importance of adapting to varying pitches within the US, attributing their losses partly to this challenge.

Sri Lankan captain Wanindu Hazaranga has refused to criticize the US pitch or competition schedule for defeats in Sri Lanka.

'The other teams played the same pitch we played. It is our duty to change our game strategies, ”he said.

The Sri Lankan team reached the United States about 10 days before the start of the R20 World Cup. Sri Lanka also played two training matches with the Netherlands and Ireland.

But Hazaranga feels that he is unable to quickly change themselves in accordance with the pitch given in the United States.

Sri Lanka scored 77 runs at the New York Nasav County Stadium against South Africa.

Sri Lanka then scored 124 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in Dallas in Dallas against Bangladesh. However, Sri Lanka lost due to the absence of leading bowlers to throw Death overs.

Sri Lanka's Super 8 round dream was scattered when the game with Nepal was completely abandoned.

Sri Lanka won by 83 runs in the match with the Netherlands. Or it would have returned to the country barefoot.

Can a nation walk out of bankruptcy with political leaderships that have no serious thoughts about solving this social tragedy?
