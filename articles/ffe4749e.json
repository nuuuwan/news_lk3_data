    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The spread of African Swine Fever in the Sri Lanka is about 95 percent under control, Hemali Kothalawala, Director General of the Department of Animal Production and Health has said after 2,500 farms were infected, killing of 67,000 hogs and also infecting wild boars.",
    "\u201cWe have curtailed the spread by taking stringent measures; veterinary surgeons inspect pig farms and ensure biosafety methods is maintained, and we have banned the transport of infected pigs and meat,\u201d Kothalawala told reporters at a recent briefing.",
    "2,500 farms across the nine provinces were infected, while 251 farms have now re-opened.",
    "\u201cThe number of reported deaths is 67,000. But we feel the actual number of deaths is more, because of unreported deaths.\u201d",
    "The prevalence of the disease in the island was first identified last September, in the Gampaha District of the western province. The government then issued a gazette banning transport of pigs or meat.",
    "\u201cOnce we identified the presence of the disease in the country, we took steps to control the spread,\u201d Palika Fernando, Additional Secretary to Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation said.",
    "It had already spread rapidly in the western and northwestern provinces by then, she said, where the island\u2019s swine farms are mostly concentrated.",
    "\u201cBut the nature of this virus is that it has a 100 percent fatality rate, so lots of pig farms got decimated.\u201d",
    "It had also spread to the central and northern provinces. \u201cThen it spread to the wildlife areas and other provinces.\u201d",
    "\u201cOne was that most pig farms are irregular. This made it hard to control the spread of the disease.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen they are transported also in a haphazard manner. That also facilitated the disease to spread to other regions fast.\u201d",
    "She said that there was yet a shortage of meat for consumption even now because the industry completely collapsed due to the spread of the disease.",
    "\u201cThere is an urgent need to build up the industry now,\u201d she said, adding that the ministry has devised plans and had appointed a task force.",
    "Although loans are available for small and medium entrepreneurs, some banks hesitate because the disease is still prevalent, she said.",
    "Changes will be made to existing laws to make it mandatory for all farms to be registered, and for transport of pigs or meat to require a veterinarian\u2019s certification, she said. (Colombo/July20/2025)"
