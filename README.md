The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday.

The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific.

### Indonesia issues tsunami alert after volcano erupts on remote island

(CNN) - Indonesian authorities on Wednesday ordered hundreds of villagers to evacuate following multiple eruptions of a remote island volcano, raising fears it could collapse into the sea and trigger a tsunami.

Mount Ruang, a 725-meter (2,400-foot) conical stratovolcano on Ruang Island, North Sulawesi, has erupted at least five times since Tuesday night, spewing fiery lava and ash plumes thousands of feet into the sky, the country’s volcanology agency said.

Agency chief Hendra Gunawan said officials had raised the volcano alert to the highest level, warning people not to go within 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) of the peak, due to fears Mount Ruang could partially collapse into the water and cause a tsunami, as it did in 1871.

“The force of Mount Ruang’s eruption is getting bigger and has emitted hot clouds of approximately 1.7 kilometers,” he told national news agency Antara, adding the eruptions were triggered by recent earthquakes in the area.

### Sri Lanka to resume bondholder talks after IMF checks their latest proposal

*2024-04-18 06:18:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-resume-bondholder-talks-after-imf-checks-their-latest-proposal-158962/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka hopes to resume talks with bondholders after the International Monetary Fund assesses their latest proposal of the ad hoc group that deals with the country, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

Sri Lanka initiated the first round of face-to-face discussions with bondholders in March where proposals and counter proposals were exchanged and agreement was reached to issue bonds linked to economic performance.

However, Sri Lanka had not agreed to the triggers nor the actual quantum of upside and the latest April proposal had not been assessed by the International Monetary Fund to ensure whether it was in line with a debt sustainability assessment. Their earlier proposal in March was assessed to be insufficient.

“The next steps would entail further consultation with the IMF staff regarding assessments of the compatibility of the latest proposals with program parameters,” Semasinghe said.

### SL on alert on possible genocide allegations by Canada

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka remains on high alert as Canadian leaders may make genocide allegations next month when the country marks the war victory, according to a diplomatic source.

Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's genocide accusations sparked a diplomatic dispute between the two nations. Sri Lanka responded with protests by summoning the Canadian envoy.

A well-placed diplomatic source informed Daily Mirror yesterday that the Sri Lankan government is keen to ascertain whether such allegations will be repeated this time, despite previous protests by Sri Lanka.

“Canadian leaders have a history of making such allegations, even though the Canadian federal government has concluded that the events in Sri Lanka during the war do not amount to genocide,” the official said.

### Tensions in Gulf could hurt Ceylon Tea cuppa: Industry

Says worsening situation in Gulf could immediately put a strain on tea prices

Tea Board says industry has not officially shared any concerns as yet

The mounting tensions in the Middle East that are becoming increasingly unpredictable are likely to impact the Ceylon Tea cuppa, the industry stakeholders said, especially since over 50 percent of the island nation’s tea is exported to that region.

While the issues stemming from the Red Sea attack have already impacted the industry with longer delivery time and higher freight costs, new issues such as closure of airspace among others could add to the woes.

“Continuity of this would mean restricted movement of people, sending out samples and getting orders. As long as the sea is open, things should be okay.
