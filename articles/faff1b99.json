    "As a globally renowned hub for quality and innovative apparel, Sri Lanka is buttoning up capacity with fully vertically integrated solutions to take on the evolving trends in retail fashion and enabling quick replenishment. A preferred manufacturing base for some of the world\u2019s iconic fashion brands, Sri Lanka\u2019s penchant for cutting-edge apparel solutions coupled with ethical and sustainable manufacturing has for long placed the island nation ahead of regional competition.",
    "Brandix Apparel Ltd. Director/CEO Rajiv Malalasekera believes Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to innovation, agility, quality, sustainable and ethical manufacturing has been unparalleled. \u201cOur customer-focused approach and solutions-driven mindset, especially in product development, has been a game-changer for us,\u201d says Malalasekera, discussing an industry that has become a cornerstone of the island\u2019s economy. \u201cWe have always taken the lead and a proactive approach in these spheres, and with digitally automated solutions playing an increased role within our entire value chain and capacity related efficiency enhancements that have followed make Sri Lanka a sought-after manufacturing base in the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d Sri Lanka anticipates earning close to $ 5 billion in apparel exports this year.",
    "\u201cNew product design and innovation are key strengths, and as a group Brandix has integrated its local research and development arm to its global network across Europe, US and Asia to drive greater synergies and value. Our ambition is to transform Sri Lanka from its inherent strengths in quality and reliable supply to a centre for global excellence in product design and development,\u201d said Malalasekera, underscoring the strategic direction of the local industry with talent that have gained critical exposure by working directly with global brands.",
    "Besides achieving many accolades as a global leader in quality apparel production, in 2019 the Brandix facility in Batticaloa was accredited as the world\u2019s first-ever Net-Zero Carbon manufacturing plant, whilst seven more plants in Sri Lanka have since been certified Net-Zero carbon. With many manufacturers on the island employing the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), which includes worker welfare and responsible sourcing, Sri Lanka has underscored its commitment and awareness of international best practices.",
    "\u201cNaturally, this level of commitment to quality and responsibility brings added pressures. But as Brandix and as an industry, Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector can hold its head high we have gone beyond convention to ensure ethical manufacturing at all levels. This standard is embedded into all aspects of our value chain. We don\u2019t simply claim to be sustainable, we do it rigorously,\u201d Malalasekera avers.",
    "Brandix is synonymous with excellence in Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel manufacturing sector, and a key differentiator at Brandix is its focus on vertical integration from yarn to fabric. \u201cThis integration has significantly reduced lead times and ensured the availability of raw materials on the island, which is crucial for the industry overall that is generally sensitive to carrying inventory in excess of optimal demand,\u201d Malalasekera explained.",
    "The company\u2019s commitment to producing high-quality, trending, and functionally superior products has attracted major global brands like Victoria\u2019s Secret, Uniqlo, and Calvin Klein. \u201cQuality is not just a department or a process; it\u2019s a mindset that permeates every level of our organisation,\u201d Malalasekera stressed. Brandix has adapted to the evolving global apparel and fashion industry needs, focusing on speed to market and product enhancements. \u201cWe are tuned to growing consumer demands for sustainable and body-positive products, incorporating recycled, flexible materials and biodegradable solutions into our offerings,\u201d Malalasekera highlighted.",
    "Over the past two decades, Brandix has expanded its global footprint with manufacturing operations in India, Bangladesh, Haiti, and Cambodia, employing over 50,000 people worldwide. \u201cThese investments in capacities overseas have diversified our risk and enhanced our ability to offer agile solutions to brands, supporting inventory management, duty-free access, and earnings optimisation,\u201d said Malalasekera. Touching on the arena of rapidly evolving digital solutions, he also explained the adoption of technology to enhance productivity and operations that has also elevated the attractiveness of working in the industry squashing age-old stigmas.",
    "\u201cIn Sri Lanka, you see a more sophisticated industry thriving at the top of its game. We have carved a niche for agile, quality, specialised solutions that has changed the face of fashion the world over. Above all, we are a responsible partner to the global community and trade, and that\u2019s what sets us apart from the rest. The competition in region will catch up to us, but our penchant for innovation and being agile in many aspects to circumnavigate disruption happening in fashion retailing can keep Sri Lanka ahead,\u201d Malalasekera added."
