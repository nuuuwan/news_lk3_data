He has shown this adaptability by accepting IMF’s EFF as the most pragmatic way forward for Sri Lanka without dragging the country to a destabilising shock as predicted by his critics.

COPF’s relentless efforts have shown the power of accountability and how one committee’s determination can make all the difference

Millions of tourists apply for visas every year to explore Sri Lanka. But in 2023, something went very wrong with Sri Lanka’s visa system, leaving many tourists and citizens questioning how such a simple process could turn into a national controversy.

### The man who could have been the President!

*2024-11-11 01:00:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-man-who-could-have-been-the-President/4-769053) · `en`

Sri Lanka is currently on a path to establishing a government free of injustice, nepotism, fraud, bribery, and all forms of corruption. For this ambitious goal to be achieved, individuals of impeccable character must hold government positions, and citizens must likewise adopt a mindset that supports integrity and accountability in all capacities. Achieving a truly corruption-free state requires that the ruling party remain open to constructive criticism, and that its supporters welcome such feedback without becoming sycophants—rejecting good advice or silencing critics.

Lawyer Nagananda, a respected attorney in both Sri Lanka and England, is widely known for his unwavering commitment to fighting injustice and corruption in all its forms. His constructive criticism is imparted without bias toward any individual or party. Consequently, he has often been regarded as an enemy by many, finding support only among a few rational-minded individuals.
