  "original_body_lines": [
    "The microfinance pioneer is accused by PM Sheikh Hasina of \u2018sucking blood\u2019 from the poor, but supporters say charges politically motivated.",
    "Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been convicted of violating Bangladesh\u2019s labour laws in a case decried by his supporters as politically motivated.",
    "\u201cProfessor Yunus and three of his Grameen Telecom colleagues were convicted under labour laws and sentenced to six months in simple imprisonment,\u201d lead prosecutor Khurshid Alam Khan told the AFP news agency on Monday.",
    "He added that all four were immediately granted bail pending appeals.",
    "Yunus, 83, is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but has earned the enmity of long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has accused him of \u201csucking blood\u201d from the poor.",
    "Hasina has made several scathing verbal attacks against the internationally respected 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was once seen as a political rival. Yunus and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom, one of the firms he founded, were accused of violating labour laws when they failed to create a workers\u2019 welfare fund in the company.",
    "\u201cThis verdict is unprecedented,\u201d Abdullah Al Mamun, a lawyer for Yunus, told AFP. \u201cWe did not get justice.\u201d",
    "Yunus is facing more than 100 other charges over labour law violations and alleged corruption.",
    "He told reporters after one of the hearings last month that he had not profited from any of the more than 50 social business firms he had set up in Bangladesh.",
    "\u201cThey were not for my personal benefit,\u201d Yunus said. Another of his lawyers, Khaja Tanvir, told AFP that the case was \u201cmeritless, false and ill-motivated\u201d. \u201cThe sole aim of the case is to harass and humiliate him in front of the world,\u201d he said.",
    "Irene Khan, former chief of Amnesty International now working as a United Nations special rapporteur who was present at Monday\u2019s verdict, told AFP the conviction was \u201ca travesty of justice\u201d.",
    "\u201cA social activist and Nobel laureate who brought honour and pride to the country is being persecuted on frivolous grounds,\u201d she said.",
    "In August, 160 global figures, including former US President Barack Obama and ex-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, published a joint letter denouncing the \u201ccontinuous judicial harassment\u201d of Yunus.",
    "The signatories, including more than 100 of his fellow Nobel laureates, said they feared for \u201chis safety and freedom\u201d.",
    "Critics accuse Bangladeshi courts of rubber-stamping decisions made by Hasina\u2019s Government, which is all but certain to win another term in power next week at elections boycotted by the Opposition.",
    "Her administration has been increasingly firm in its crackdown on political dissent, and Yunus\u2019s popularity among the Bangladeshi public has for years earmarked him as a potential rival.",
    "Amnesty accused the Government of \u201cweaponising labour laws\u201d when Yunus went to trial in September and called for an immediate end to his \u201charassment\u201d.",
    "Criminal proceedings against Yunus were \u201ca form of political retaliation for his work and dissent\u201d, it said."
