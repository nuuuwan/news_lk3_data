  "original_body_lines": [
    "Romanians were voting Sunday in the first round of a presidential election amid a surge in inflation and fears over the war in neighbouring Ukraine that could favour far-right leader George Simion.",
    "The vote kicks off two weeks of elections in the poor NATO member country, including a parliamentary vote and a December 8 presidential run-off.",
    "Social democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is leading a field of 13 hopefuls in the polls, with about 25 percent, followed by AUR leader Simion on 15 to 19 percent.",
    "Simion is targeting people like Rodica, a 69-year-old who was among the first to vote in Bucharest\u2019s chilly sunshine. The pensioner, who would not give a family name, was afraid of the Ukraine war and wanted \u201cbetter living conditions and peace\u201d.",
    "The stakes are high in the race to replace President Klaus Iohannis, a liberal and staunch Ukraine ally, who has held the largely ceremonial post since 2014.",
    "Romania, which has a 650-kilometre (400-mile) border with Ukraine, has become more important since Russia invaded its neighbour in 2022.",
    "The Black Sea nation now plays a \u201cvital strategic role\u201d for NATO -- as it is home to more than 5,000 soldiers -- and the transit of Ukrainian grain, the New Strategy Center think tank said.",
    "Simion, 38, is hoping to make a breakthrough as far-right parties across Europe notch up electoral successes.",
    "Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election has further \u201ccomplicated\u201d Romania\u2019s choice, political analyst Cristian Pirvulescu told AFP.",
    "Known for his fiery speeches, Simion -- a Trump fan who sometimes dons a red cap in appreciation of his idol -- hopes to get a boost from his victory.",
    "Simion opposes sending military aid to Ukraine, wants a \u201cmore patriotic Romania\u201d and frequently lashes out against what he calls the \u201cgreedy corrupt bubble\u201d in Brussels.",
    "Romania has so far only had \u201cminions and cowards as leaders\u201d, he recently said, adding that people \u201cno longer accept to be treated as second-class citizens\u201d in other countries.",
    "Simion has seen his popularity surge by tapping into voter anger over record inflation -- 10 percent last year and 5.5% predicted for 2024 -- while promising to deliver affordable housing for all.",
    "Should he reach the second round, analyst Pirvulescu predicts a \u201ccontagion effect\u201d that would likely boost his AUR party in the December parliamentary election.",
    "\u201cRomanian democracy is in danger for the first time since the fall of communism in 1989,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m really afraid we\u2019ll end up with Simion in the second round,\u201d 36-year-old IT worker Oana Diaconu told AFP, expressing concern about the far-right leader\u2019s unpredictable nature and attacks on the European Union.",
    "The campaign has been marked by controversy and personal attacks, with Simion facing accusations of meeting with Russian spies -- a claim he has denied.",
    "Despite low popularity ratings, he hopes to win over voters with his promise of \u201cstability\u201d for Romania.",
    "Ciolacu\u2019s Social Democratic Party (PSD), which has shaped the country\u2019s politics for more than three decades, currently governs in a coalition with the National Liberal Party.",
    "Polling in third place is former journalist Elena Lasconi, who became mayor of the small town of Campulung and head of a centre-right opposition party, who could prove to be a surprise package.",
    "\u201cOur best hope might be to wake up with Lasconi in the second round -- she seems to be the most honest candidate,\u201d said Diaconu before hopping on a Bucharest tram.",
    "Polling stations opened at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and close at 9:00 pm, with exit polls expected shortly after."
