  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Opposition parties yesterday submitted a no-confidence motion (NCM) against Deputy Minister of Defence Major General (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekara to the Speaker of the House.",
    "Although the motion was scheduled to be handed over on Monday, it was postponed to yesterday as the Speaker was in Polonnaruwa.",
    "The Opposition cited serious concerns over Jayasekara\u2019s alleged involvement and conflict of interest in the investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks.",
    "The motion raises alarm over Jayasekara\u2019s role as the Commander of the Security Force (East) during key incidents linked to the Easter attacks, including the Vavunathivu police killings and the Sainthamaruthu explosion, both considered pivotal moments in the lead-up to the bombings.",
    "It further states that a potential conflict of interest exists as Jayasekara, now holding a powerful position in the Defence Ministry, may influence subordinates or witnesses involved in the ongoing probes, risking impartiality.",
    "The motion urges Parliament to remove Jayasekara from his ministerial post, arguing that public and institutional confidence in the investigation process cannot be restored while he remains in office.",
    "Jayasekara, was appointed to Parliament via the National List in November 2024 and later named Deputy Minister of Defence."
