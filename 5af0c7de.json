    "Pastor Jerome Fernando has arrived in Sri Lanka early this morning (29) from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake, a spokesperson from the Department of Immigration and Emigration has said.",
    "Jerome Fernando returned to the island from Singapore on board a flight attached to Qatar Airlines and left the airport through the Golden route of the BIA, according to Ada Derana reporter.",
    "Accordingly, he is slated to give a statement to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) within 48 hours as per a court order.",
    "On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned the self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019 should record a statement with the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival.",
    "This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",
    "The self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019 found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.",
    "Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the country\u2019s harmony.",
    "However, Pastor Fernando flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court banned his foreign travels on May 16. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island.",
    "On May 26, Fernando had filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition.",
    "In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CID\u2019s attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country."
