    "A special meeting will be held between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Public Security Minister Tiran Alles tomorrow (July 09) on appointing the new Inspector-General of Police (IGP), government sources said.",
    "The Head of State and the minister are widely tipped to reach a final decision at this meeting.",
    "Meanwhile, it is reported that President Wickremesinghe has tasked Minister Alles with deciding whether former IGP C.D. Wickramaratne should be given another tenure extension or an Acting IGP should be appointed.",
    "Wickramaratne was initially supposed to retire from the police service on March 26, 2023, however, President Ranil Wickremesinghe extended his tenure by three months until June 26 by way of a special gazette notification dated April 06.",
    "Thus, the position of IGP is left vacant since the end of Wickramaratne\u2019s tenure on 26 June.",
    "Senior Deputy Inspector-Generals of Police (SDIGs) Deshabandu Tennakoon, Nilantha Jayawardena, Lalith Pathinayake, Priyantha Weerasooriya and Ajith Rohana are reportedly among the nominations for the top post of the police force."
