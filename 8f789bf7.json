  "original_body_lines": [
    "A humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas will extend by two days, mediator Qatar said Monday as an initial four-day truce in Gaza was set to expire.",
    "\u201cThe State of Qatar announces that, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter.",
    "Hamas confirmed Monday the truce in Gaza has been extended by two days.",
    "Hamas had said it was drawing up a new list of hostages held in the Gaza Strip \u201cin order to extend the truce\u201d with Israel.",
    "The statement from Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, came as discussions were continuing on an extension of the initial four-day pause in the fighting and exchanges of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.",
    "Israel said Monday it was open to extending a truce with Hamas if the Palestinian group continues to release hostages, as international pressure mounted for a longer pause in the Gaza fighting.",
    "If no extension had been agreed to, the temporary truce was due to expire at 7 a.m. (12 a.m. EST) on Tuesday, threatening a return to intense fighting in a war that has already left many thousands dead.",
    "U.S. President Joe Biden, top EU envoy Josep Borrell and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had all joined a global chorus urging the parties to extend their temporary break in fighting.",
    "Israel had put Hamas \u201con notice\u201d that an \u201coption for an extension\u201d of the truce was open in order to bring home 50 more Israeli hostages in the coming days, government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters, potentially implying a five-day extension.",
    "As part of the truce deal, Hamas has so far released 39 Israeli hostages, including a 4-year-old girl orphaned by the group\u2019s Oct. 7 attack, with more expected later Monday.",
    "Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners in exchange under the terms of the agreement. A further 19 foreign nationals have also been released from Gaza under separate arrangements.",
    "Tearful reunions of families and hostages, released in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners, have brought the first relief from images of civilian death and suffering in the seven-week war, with hopes high for an extension.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza,\u201d Biden said Sunday, calling for operations to remove Hamas to be paused for \u201cas long as prisoners keep coming out.\u201d",
    "The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, echoed this call as the truce entered its final 24 hours, saying: \u201cThe pause should be extended to make it sustainable and long lasting while working for a political solution.\u201d",
    "\u201cNothing can justify the indiscriminate brutality Hamas unleashed against civilians,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one horror cannot justify another horror.\u201d",
    "NATO chief Stoltenberg also weighed in, ahead of a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels.",
    "\u201cI call for an extension of the pause. This would allow for much needed relief to the people of Gaza and the release of more hostages,\u201d he told journalists.",
    "Hamas had signaled its willingness to extend the truce, with a source telling AFP the group told mediators they were open to prolonging it by \u201ctwo to four days.\u201d",

    "Under the truce, 50 hostages held by the militants were to be freed over four days in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. A built-in mechanism extends the truce if at least 10 Israeli captives are released each extra day.",
    "But some hostages are believed to be held by Palestinian militant groups other than Hamas, potentially complicating future releases. Israel is also facing pressure from the families of hostages to extend the truce to secure more releases.",

    "In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas government.",
    "The third group of hostages released Sunday included a 4-year-old American citizen called Abigail whose parents were both killed in the Hamas attacks.",
    "\u201cWhat a joy to see her with us. But on the other hand, what a pity that she returns to the reality of not having parents,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.",
    "\u201cShe has no parents, but she has a whole nation that embraces her,\u201d he added.",
    "Also among those freed Sunday was an 84-year-old woman who was rushed to intensive care in critical condition \u201cafter serious neglect,\u201d medical officials said.",
    "Separately, an Israeli soldier rescued from the Gaza Strip welcomed the releases of her fellow hostages, in her first public comments since she was freed.",
    "Ori Megidish, 19, was operating an observation post on the Gaza border when she was seized in the Hamas attacks. Her rescue was confirmed by the Israeli military just over three weeks later, but no details have since been released.",
    "In a relaxed video filmed at her home and posted to her TikTok account, she said she was \u201cfine\u201d and \u201chappy to see all the moving clips of hostages returning to their families.\u201d",
    "Israel had faced mounting pressure to extend the pause mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, though its leaders have dismissed any suggestions of a lasting halt to the offensive.",
