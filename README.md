The Colombo High Court yesterday dismissed the preliminary objections presented by the counsels representing former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella in a case brought by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) against him for criminal misappropriation of funds during his tenure as the Minister of Mass Media.

The two defendants in the case, including Rambukwella, stand accused of misappropriating Rs. 230948 from the State Printing Corporation to settle Rambukwella’s personal telephone bill during the period from March to April 2012, when he served as the Minister of Mass Media.

Under his command, the DJV-JVP in Trinco accomplished a few military strikes against the Indian Army but these incidents did not gain much publicity due to the concerted efforts of the Sri Lankan and Indian authorities to deliberately suppress information. They did not want the JVP to gain publicity and political credit through these operations. Besides most incidents of that nature in Trincomalee were believed to have been committed by the Tigers then. Although the mass media of the day have not publicised this phase, there is some important material available in books, monographs and research papers

The Commissioner of Elections made it clear to all Lankans that the presidential elections would be held in a timely manner in keeping with Constitutional requirements.

To him we owe a vote of thanks. Many a citizen had begun to doubt whether elections -presidential or general elections- would be held at any time in the near future, given the number of elections postponed via sleight of hand over the years.

Even as we pen these lines, our country is going through one of the hottest periods weather-wise. As though this were not bad enough, political party leaders and their followers are also breathing fire at their opponents, adding to the heat.

We continue witnessing intra-party squabbles in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and dirty linen being washed in public. The ‘National People’s Power is gaining in popularity. But in the past it has not been able to turn this into actual votes.

### Sri Lanka anticipating private equity deals amounting to $250mn

*2024-03-26 23:57:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98223/sri-lanka-anticipating-private-equity-deals-amounting-to-250mn) · `en`

The year 2024 is already seeing a turnaround for private equity deals with Sri Lanka expecting deals amounting up to USD 250 million, says the Hong Kong-based merchant banking firm MCM Partners.

Speaking to Bloomberg Markets Asia on Monday (March 25), Managing Director of MCM Partners Jahnavi Bhagwati explained as to why she sees a turnaround for private equity deals in 2024 as opposed to a sluggish 2023.

According to her, countries like India and Sri Lanka, which is a turnaround story, are going to present opportunities in the private space this year after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March, ending the country’s historic era of negative interest rates in a move that marked a historic shift in monetary policy.
