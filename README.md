### Poverty of CBSL’s monetary policies: Part 1

*2024-11-18 23:14:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Poverty-of-CBSL-s-monetary-policies-Part-1/4-769383) · `en`

The economic consequences of the CBSL losing control over interest rates cannot be overstated

What is notable is not only that the CBSL continues to adhere to its flawed notion of money printing despite the evident logical issues in its interpretation, but also that it persists in its commitment to the quantity theory of money (QTM)—or at least its own variant of this theory. This is in spite of the numerous and growing criticisms from researchers in central banks across the world, including those considered to be at the forefront of research in monetary policy, such as the US and the UK

The CBSL does not appear to be fully committed to setting and targeting money market interest rates, which requires it to allow the quantity of cash to be determined by the market. In fact, as the IMF observes, the CBSL seems to be permitting the market, rather than policy, to set money market rates, while managing liquidity to prevent instability in these rates

### A ‘tectonic shift’ in  the plate of politics

*2024-11-18 23:07:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-tectonic-shift-in-the-plate-of-politics/4-769382) · `en`

Give the government a place to stand and let us hope it has the strength to move the earth

It must be evident by now in the densest of crania in the most conservative of political think tanks circumscribing the cocktail circuit that ‘something happened’.

But it may be a while before the penny, as they say, drops. Because, as a London-based revolutionary far from his Teutonic homeland once essayed about the plight of an oppressed class of people his continent over – from Moscow to Manchester – and their oppressors: “When the sufferers learn to think, then the thinkers will learn to suffer.” (Yes Karl Marx)

There are, it is said jocularly in circles where wit is observational of everyone else but oneself, three types of people: those who make things happen, those who watch while it is happening, and those who wonder: ‘what happened?’

What happened was that the threefold cord which is not quickly broken snapped suddenly after ever-increasing tension over the years.

### “Help us fall in love again”: Note to President and new Government of Sri Lanka

*2024-11-18 23:03:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Help-us-fall-in-love-again-Note-to-President-and-new-Government-of-Sri-Lanka/4-769381) · `en`

Congratulations on your remarkable landslide victory, securing over a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This is a testament to the trust and belief the general public has in you. You have also set an inspiring example for greater women’s political participation, which is truly commendable.

As Sri Lankans, we have often relied on politicians to handle everything, but this approach has proven flawed. I genuinely want you to succeed so our country can regain its former glory. That is why I am raising my voice and sharing my perspective through this note, hoping it might be of value.

We can’t afford any more mistakes; the situation we find ourselves in today is dire. Every decision must be made with great care. The glass cliff lies before you and your Government, and navigating this challenging situation requires caution and thoughtful action. I offer this note in the hope that it may provide some guidance as you proceed.

### Arugam Bay is not Gaza: a reply to Tisaranee Gunasekara

*2024-11-18 22:57:39* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Arugam-Bay-is-not-Gaza-a-reply-to-Tisaranee-Gunasekara/14-769380) · `en`

Israeli tourists holidaying in southern Sri Lanka – and a somewhat pre-modern group catering to their religious needs – cannot and should not be held responsible for potential terror attacks on them stemming from Israel’s continuing war in Gaza and Lebanon

Gunasekara suggests that the ‘threat’ from the Arugam Bay Chabad stems from the wider movement’s extremist political ideology, as evidenced (by implication) in Israeli soldiers recently establishing a similar prayer house in Beit Hanoun, Gaza. And while I agree with her that any right-wing, ‘Greater Israel’-directed ideology poses a potentially serious political problem wherever it exists, I’m not convinced that is what’s at stake with the Arugam Bay Chabad

### Sri Lanka leader appoints fresh faces into new cabinet sans Muslims, Northeast Tamils

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a 21-member new cabinet on Monday, four days after the election in which his National People’s Power (NPP) recorded a landslide victory, but his cabinet lacked representations from ethnic minority Muslims and Tamils from the island nation’s former war zone of North and East.

Dissanayake’s Maxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led ruling NPP won 159 seats in a 225-member parliament in a surprise win, much higher than NPP leaders’ estimation of 120 seats.

The more-than two-third majority will enable the Dissanayake’s new government to change the constitution focusing on the key promises they have given: eliminating corruption, implementing rule of law without any discrimination, and reducing cost of living.

“Historically, Sri Lanka’s political landscape has often been defined by a divide; North against South, and vice versa, which was fueled by mistrust and division,” Dissanayake said after the new cabinet  was sworn in.

### Trump and AKD: the vital differences

*2024-11-18 14:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/trump-and-akd-the-vital-differences/) · `en`

The people of the United States of America elected that country’s 47th president on November 5, 2024. Donald Trump, who had served as the 45th president and was defeated by Joe Biden, made an unprecedented comeback, securing 312 votes of the electoral college. It left those who backed his main opponent, Democratic Party candidate and serving Vice President, Kamala Harris, in shock. After all, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York and is currently facing charges of fraud, election subversion, and obstruction.

How on earth did he even get on the ballot? How on earth did he win? Are those who voted for him ignorant of his criminal record? Have they forgotten how he covered himself in ignominy in the aftermath of losing the 2020 election? These are the questions that his detractors ask.

Trump’s proposed cabinet appointments short on quality, long on slavish loyalty

Last week, in the despair I felt in the aftermath of the election to the US presidency of the most evil man in the United States, I wrote that I will take a break to lick my wounds and get over my distress at the apparent catastrophe that has befallen my second home. Then I realized that this is not the end of the world, though it sure felt like it on the morning after the election.

I learned that I was not alone in these feelings of despair. Trump’s win had sparked off an unprecedented increase in Google searches reflecting a growing interest among Americans in relocating to foreign countries, New Zealand heading the list with an astonishing 7,600% increase! The next most popular Google search was “the least painful way to kill yourself”.

Last week’s presidential election was doubtless one of the most consequential in US history. Though the outcome was not predictable – most polls showed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump – with the benefit of hindsight one can say that the Democrats should have seen it coming. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be a slew of analyses and diagnoses claiming to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. Yet as Sri Lankan political analyst Rajni Gamage rightly put it in a recent tweet, such diagnoses are themselves problematic, and point to the biases of those making them.
