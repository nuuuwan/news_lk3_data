### Can Sri Lanka avoid borrowing from international bondholders in the coming years?

*2024-12-24 00:50:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Can-Sri-Lanka-avoid-borrowing-from-international-bondholders-in-the-coming-years/4-770936) · `en`

If we do not borrow externally in 2028, we will either default in 2028 or have to cut down our imports drastically

Sri Lanka’s emergence from default status is positive news. This means we can gradually start borrowing once again from ISB bondholders when most external debt payments come due in 2028. Many Sri Lankans may inquire why we should borrow from bondholders again and if this is detrimental. Allow me to explain as simply as possible. It would be ideal if we never had to borrow from international capital markets. However, Sri Lanka does not have a choice at present.

### Economic crisis and household debt in the north

*2024-12-24 00:44:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economic-crisis-and-household-debt-in-the-north/4-770935) · `en`

Household incomes are inadequate to keep up with rising living costs

The current economic crisis cannot be resolved by households or social institutions alone, and loans are not the solution. The Government should introduce livelihood and income stabilisation programs to help people escape the debt trap. It should also leverage cooperatives to create markets and supply chains for rural production, while expanding affordable credit for rural livelihoods and small-scale industrial growth. Additionally, a universal social security program should be implemented

### Climate resilience: Critical need for Sri Lankan salt industry

*2024-12-24 00:40:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Climate-resilience-Critical-need-for-Sri-Lankan-salt-industry/4-770934) · `en`

The recent salt shortage in the market, coupled with the Cabinet decision on 18 December 2024 to allow the import of 30,000 MT of non-iodised salt, has sparked widespread attention and discussions. Further, this decision has generated negative responses and uninformed statements from the general public, as well as politically driven media outlets. Despite the negativity surrounding this issue, the sudden attention on the Sri Lankan salt industry presents an opportunity to discuss the real situation and the importance of safeguarding this unique industry for future generations. Before delving into the specifics of the recent events, it is essential to establish an overview of the salt industry in Sri Lanka.

### Challenges of collaborative governance for Sri Lanka: Divided path ahead

*2024-12-24 00:34:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Challenges-of-collaborative-governance-for-Sri-Lanka-Divided-path-ahead/4-770933) · `en`

Long-standing political divisions and ideological differences among parties, both at the national and regional levels, often result in gridlock and hinder the formation of a united front

Sri Lanka is at a crucial juncture in its history, facing numerous challenges that threaten the stability and future of the nation. While some argue that collaborative governance, involving cooperation among political parties and civil society, could offer a way forward, the realities of the current political landscape, economic difficulties, and social divisions suggest that this approach may face significant hurdles. The promise of collaboration is often idealised, but the deep-seated divisions within the country make it a far more complicated and potentially ineffective solution.

### Continuity in change

*2024-12-24 00:29:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Continuity-in-change/4-770932) · `en`

The baby is not being thrown out with the bath water by the new AKD Government

Change was the platform on which President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and later the National People’s Power (NPP) Government claimed power in the November 2024 elections. Change from the old ways of doing politics, of governance and in the way decisions are taken on behalf of the country and its people.

And people fed up with the powers-that-be were seeking exactly that.

Despite that, the NPP absolute majority was a bolt from the blue, even for the party itself. The NPP made pre-election statements, saying why it was not critical to get an absolute majority and why a simple majority would be enough to do its work.

Yet the people spoke as one and by giving the party a full mandate to make changes, it gave AKD and his team a free hand to change the course of politics and governance in Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka’s public sector needs to undergo conceptual revolution

*2024-12-24 00:25:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-public-sector-needs-to-undergo-conceptual-revolution/4-770931) · `en`

Even though there are some entities which are relatively efficient, overall, Sri Lanka’s public sector is inefficient

With power comes responsibility. With the new swearing-in of the new ministers, new blood is infused to the Government. However, public sector officials and their thinking patterns at the grassroot levels have not changed. With an inactive, inefficient public sector, can a government run a country and lead it to the utopia that we all think of? Let’s dive into this more deeply and see the depth of the problem.

### Biden commutes most federal death sentences

*2024-12-23 21:49:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104454/biden-commutes-most-federal-death-sentences) · `en`

US President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates, switching their penalty to life in prison without parole.

The three excluded from the measure include the Boston Marathon bomber and the man who killed Jewish worshippers in 2018.

In a statement, Biden said he was “more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level”. His measure does not include more than 2,000 people convicted to death by State authorities.

Biden’s decision comes before the return of President-elect Donald Trump in January, who resumed federal executions when he was in office.

Among those reprieved by Biden are nine people convicted of murdering fellow prisoners, four for murders committed during bank robberies and one who killed a prison guard.

“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden added.

### Sri Lanka-based investment scammers target Japanese: Report

*2024-12-23 19:02:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104452/sri-lanka-based-investment-scammers-target-japanese-report) · `en`

An organization in Sri Lanka posing as an IT company is recruiting locals who speak Japanese to target Japanese nationals with investment scams, a local who briefly worked there has told Kyodo News.

While the extent of the damage caused by the phone scammers is unknown, the former worker said in an interview last month that he heard that some victims had transferred as much as 30 million yen ($192,000) to the organization’s account from Japan.

There have been a series of phone and online fraud committed by Japanese scammers based in Southeast Asian countries, but cases in South Asia involving locals hired to victimize people in Japan appear to be rare.

The Sri Lankan man, who is fluent in Japanese after having worked in Japan, said the organization in Colombo, the capital, appeared to involve more than 100 workers, though apparently without any Japanese among them.

He quit the job as he was hesitant to be engaged in defrauding people in the country he feels gratitude toward for his stay.

### The Government’s Term Tests & Results: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

*2024-12-23 11:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-governments-term-tests-results-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) · `en`

A newspaper editorial suggested that the NPP government is facing its December term test and that its weaknesses are showing. In fact, there have been quite a few term tests set up by different pundit examiners and they are producing a mixed bag of results. Overall and objectively, if I may say so, the government has done a reasonably good job for the most part; with a few bads, mainly gaffes, including a Prime Ministerial gaffe involving the two ‘Chinas’; and one standout ugly – the pathetic “PhD in Biochemistry and BSc in Chemical Engineering” lies of Asoka Ranwala MP, and his deservedly quick fall from Speakership grace. The focus has been mostly on his PhD boast, but his claim to a degree in Chemical Engineering is itself an instant hoax. And the leap from Chemical Engineering in Moratuwa to Biochemistry in Japan is manifestly ignorant and creatively stupid.
