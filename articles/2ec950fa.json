    "In 2005, tax consulting and advisory services provider, DPR, facilitated tax calculations for Sri Lankan individual taxpayers by launching the nation\u2019s first tax website. This initiative, introduced a decade ahead of government measures, set a new standard in online tax computation and e-return filing. DPR backs the advisory services with continued efforts to educate clients on tax related matters, launching an SMS Gateway in 2006 to share real-time tax updates with clients, a D.P.R. press release said.",
    "Extracts from the release: \u2018Continuing its legacy of innovation, DPR has relaunched the enhanced tax website with expansion of tax management offerings today, empowering clients with expert guidance and representation in tax-related matters.
