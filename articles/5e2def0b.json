    "Colombo, June 5 (Daily Mirror) - The All Island Canteen and Restaurant Owners' Association (AICROA) has decided to lower the prices of food items from tonight due to the reduction in the prices of domestic LP gas, vegetables and eggs.",
    "Addressing the media, the Association's President Harshana Rukshan announced that the prices of fried rice, rice and curry, and kottu will be reduced by Rs. 25 from tonight.",
    "The prices of short eats, including paratha and egg rotti, will be reduced by Rs. 10. In line with these reductions, the price of a cup of plain tea will be reduced by Rs. 5.",
    "However, there will be no price reduction on a cup of milk tea since the cost of imported milk powder has not decreased significantly.",
