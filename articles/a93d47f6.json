    "Simmering discontent in universities erupted in a token strike on Tuesday. The Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Associations (FUTA) staged protests in state universities across the country to pressure the government to redress their grievances and solve a host of longstanding problems plaguing the higher education sector. They have warned that they will be compelled to ratchet up their trade union action unless the government agrees to grant their demands.",
    "The FUTA leaders said on Tuesday that the overall student intake had doubled over the years but the national universities were experiencing a chronic shortage of teachers and physical resources. The flight of human capital had hit universities harder than most other institutions, the protesters said, stressing that it had become an uphill task to fill teacher vacancies in universities as it was not financially rewarding to pursue a university career because of extremely high taxes. The protesters demanded more fund allocations for the higher education sector.",
    "Gone are the days when politicians could follow the Machiavellian advice on promises\u2014the promise given was a necessity of the past; the word broken is a necessity of the present\u2014and get away with it. Sri Lanka\u2019s post-Independence history has been replete with unfulfilled promises made by various political parties, but thanks to the expansion of the digital realm, broken promises keep resurfacing in the form of viral videos, unlike in the past, much to the chagrin of politicians who make them to garner favour with voters.",
    "University teachers campaigned hard for the JVP-led NPP last year, enabling its meteoric rise to power, and many of them went to the extent of contesting last year\u2019s general election from the NPP. The university community is said to be overrepresented in the current Parliament; it is also well represented in the Cabinet. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya herself is a former university teacher. But the honeymoon between university dons and the government is over. This situation has come about as the NPP\u2019s key promises to the university community remain unfulfilled. Dr. Amarasuriya actively took part in FUTA protests to pressure previous governments to allocate as much as 6% of GDP for education, and increase university teachers\u2019 salaries.",
    "Non-academic workers in state universities are also resentful, and they are likely to resort to trade union action, seeking redress to their grievances. University student unions have pledged solidarity with the protesting teachers. They have already held a protest march. All signs are that the universities are heading for chaos.",
    "The NPP leaders talked the talk very effectively before last year\u2019s elections, and now they have to walk the walk if they are to prevent the irate university dons from cranking up their trade union action. A protracted strike crippling the university system is something the country needs like a hole in the head.",
    "The NPP\u2008government finds itself in an unenviable position, unable to fulfil its election promises. One is reminded of Chinua Achebe\u2019s novel, No Longer at Ease, wherein a politician says the trouble was not in the receiving of the bribe, but failing to do the thing for which the bribe was given. The same may be said about election promises; the trouble is not in winning elections by making various pledges, but failing to do what votes are obtained for.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is also the Minister of Finance, is often heard claiming that his government is not short of funds as corruption and waste have been drastically curtailed. Addressing a group of Sri Lanka expatriates in Tokyo recently, he said that for the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s history, state revenue had surpassed budget forecasts. That is no mean achievement, and the NPP\u2008deserves praise. Whenever President Dissanayake attends District Development Committee meetings, he promises more funds for new projects and urges state officials to utilise them. So, the protesting dons can argue that there is no way the government can claim it is not in a position to allocate more funds for universities.",
