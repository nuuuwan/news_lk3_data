    "The Committee on Public Accounts focused on the current performance of the National Education Management Information System (NEMIS). The officials who were present pointed out that although this data system was initiated in 2012, it has not yet reached the expected level of performance.",
    "The Committee expressing displeasure, mentioned that although this Committee has been discussing this data system for 4 years, it has not reached the desired level. The members of the Committee who were present also pointed out that the necessary data pertaining to the school system is not available in this data system and not up to expectation.",
    "Moreover, the need for accurate national data regarding education was discussed at length. This was discussed when the Committee on Public Accounts met recently to discuss the 2022 Auditor General\u2019s report of the Ministry of Education and the current performance of the National Education Management Information System (NEMIS) under the Chairmanship of State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.",
    "Furthermore, contrary to circular 2008/37, though the number of classes in schools should not be changed without the approval of the Structure Committee under the Ministry of Education, it was brought to attention that the principals of 29 schools had started new classes for intermediate classes at their own discretion without the approval of the Ministry. Accordingly, the Chair of the Committee recommended to submit a full report on this before 17 May. Attention was also paid to whether there is a lack of enrolment of children in the first year and it was recommended to give a report to the Committee within two weeks containing the information of the last 20 years. Furthermore, in a letter by the Director of National Schools bearing No. ED/1/6/1/10/2022 dated 6 June 2022, arrangements were made to temporarily admit students to schools close to their residence due to economic difficulties and transportation difficulties in the difficult situation in the country. However, the Committee pointed out that problematic situations have arisen in this regard and recommended the officials to take a decision in this regard after discussing with the Minister in charge.",
    "The current status of the Education Administration Service and Teacher Advisors\u2019 Service was also discussed at this Committee meeting held. State Minister Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva, Members of Parliament Isuru Dodangoda, Madhura Withanage, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Muditha Prishanthi, Dr. Major Pradeep Undugoda, Weerasumana Weerasinghe were present at the Committee meeting."
