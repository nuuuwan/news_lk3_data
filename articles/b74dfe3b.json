    "A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming Hezbollah and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group.",
    "Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of the conflict in Gaza.",
    "The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has raised fears of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.",
    "The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.",
    "\u201cHezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office.",
    "In a written statement, Hezbollah said: \u201cThe Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard\u201d.",

    "\u201cThey were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter...it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter). But they couldn\u2019t reach the shelter because the rocket hit the site between the ground and the shelter,\u201d said Mourhaf Abu Saleh, a witness.",
    "Footage posted on social media showed the moment the rocket hit. An air raid siren can be heard, followed by a big explosion and images of smoke rising. Reuters was able to independently verify the location with the buildings and road layout that matched the satellite imagery of the area.",
    "Idan Avshalom, a medic with the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said first responders arrived to a scene of great destruction. \u201cThere were casualties on the grass and the scene was gruesome,\u201d he said.",

    "The United States, which has been leading diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border, condemned it as a horrific attack and said U.S. support for Israel\u2019s security was \u201ciron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah\u201d.",
    "The United States \u201cwill continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,\u201d the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel.",
    "Moscow, which has ties with most of the key players in the Middle East, including Israel, Iran, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, condemned the attacks in the Golan Heights.",
    "\u201cWe condemn all terrorist actions undertaken by any entity,\u201d Russian TASS state news agency cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Sunday.",

    "Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters.",
    "In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel.",
    "Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.",
    "\u201cFor the death of children, Nasrallah should pay with his head. All of Lebanon should pay,\u201d Smotrich posted on X.",

    "Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October.",
    "Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama\u2019a Islamiya.",
    "More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam.",
    "The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.",
