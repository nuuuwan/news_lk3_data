    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe should realize that he can no longer rule the country with a suppressive mindset like in the 1980s and if he resorts to such suppressive moves, it will be a complete failure, National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.",
    "He told a news conference that the world and society have now completely changed when compared to the 1980s.",
    "The MP said ordinary people are not responsible for the present situation in the country and that the rulers should accept the blame for the economic failure.",
    "\u201cPeople have a right to organize themselves and protest against the rulers who are responsible for the economic crime and expel them. The government has no right to stop people\u2019s protests. We will not allow Ranil Wickremesinghe to suppress any protest. We will stand with the people to defeat the President\u2019s suppressive and anti-democratic moves,\u201d he said.",
    "He said the government was setting the ground to prevent a people\u2019s uprising in the near future by suppressing isolated protests organized by the people against its unreasonable and suppressive moves.",
    "He said people have now realized the government\u2019s failed attempt to show that the economy is reviving and that they have started to protest against the government\u2019s destructive moves.",
    "\u201cThe recent Central Bank report reveals the true economic situation in the country. The report clearly shows that the economic growth rate has dropped in 2023 when compared to 2022 and the budget deficit has also increased while industries have collapsed resulting in thousands losing their jobs. All sectors such as education and health are in crisis. People are not prepared to endure this situation anymore,\u201d he said.",
