From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.

Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.

If you do not share a word of the school if this bill is passed, it is not for prohibition.
