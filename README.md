මේ අනුව ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාව එවන් නීතියක් සම්මත කළ ලොව පළමු රාජ්‍යය බවට පත්වී ඇත.

සමාජ මාධ්‍ය භාවිතයේ ඇති අයහපත් කරුණු සලකමින් මෙම තීරණය ගෙන ඇති බව සඳහන් ය.

අදාළ යෝජනාව ඊයේ ඔස්ට්‍රේලියානු පාර්ලිමේන්තුව හමුවට ඉදිරිපත් කෙරුණු අතර, ඊට පාර්ලිමේන්තු අනුමැතිය හිමිවුණි.

කෙසේ නමුත් එම නීතිය ක්‍රියාවට නැංවීමට වසරක පමණ කාලයක් ගතවනු ඇත.

එම නීතිය කඩකර වයස අවුරුදු 16ට අඩු ළමයින්ට සමාජ මාධ්‍යට පිවිසීමේ අවස්ථාව ලබාදෙන ඕනෑම සමාජ මාධ්‍ය ජාලයකට ඔස්ට්‍රේලියානු ඩොලර් මිලියන 50ක උපරිම දඩයක් පැනවීමේ අවස්ථාවත් එම නීතිය මගින් පනවා තිබේ.

කෙසේ නමුත් මෙම නීතිය ක්‍රියාවට නැංවීම කෙතරම් සාර්ථක වේ දැයි බොහෝ පාර්ශ්ව සැක පළ කරයි.

சிறுவர்களை சமூக  ஊடகங்களின் பாதிப்பிலிருந்து பாதுகாப்பதை நோக்கமாக கொண்டதே இந்த சட்டம் என பிரதமர் அன்டனி அல்பெனிஸ் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

இந்த சட்டத்தை தொழில்நுட்ப நிறுவனங்கள் பின்பற்றவில்லை என்றால் அவற்றிற்கு எதிராக அபராதம் விதிக்கப்படலாம் என அவுஸ்திரேலிய அதிகாரிகள் தெரிவித்துள்ளனர்.

எனினும் இந்த தடை எவ்வாறு செயற்படும் என்பது குறித்தும்,அந்தரங்கத்தின் மீதான அதன் பாதிப்புகள் மற்றும்சமூக தொடர்பு குறித்து போதிய விளக்கமில்லை என விமர்சகர்கள் கருத்து வெளியிட்டுள்ளனர்.

உலகில் பல நாடுகள் சமூக ஊடக பயன்பாடுகள் குறித்து தடைகளை விதித்துள்ள போதிலும் 16 வயதிற்கு உட்பட்டவர்களிற்கு தடை விதித்துள்ள முதல் நாடு அவுஸ்;திரேலியா என்பது குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.

This combined operation followed intelligence received from the Sri Lanka Navy, indicating possible narcotics smuggling by Sri Lankan flagged fishing vessels.

Acting swiftly on the intelligence, the Indian Navy initiated an operation to intercept the boats involved. The operation relied on continuous inputs from the Sri Lanka Navy and the Information Fusion Centre - Indian Ocean Region, along with extensive surveillance by the Indian Navy’s aerial assets.

Both vessels set for sail on November 24 and 25. The seized narcotics were handed over to the Sri Lankan authorities, along with the crew members, for further legal action.

ඒ හේතුවෙන් මේ සම්බන්ධයෙන් පසුගිය කාලය පුරා ලද විවිධ යෝජනා සැලකිල්ලට ගෙන අයි. සී. සී.ය තීරණ තුනක් කෙරෙහි මේ වනවිට විශේෂ අවදානයක් යොමුකර තිබේ.

එමෙන්ම අවසන් යෝජනාව වී ඇත්තේ ඉන්දියාව තරගාවලිය ක්‍රීඩාකිරීම සඳහා පාකිස්තානයට නොපැමිණෙන්නේ නම්, ඔවුන් නොමැතිව සමස්ත තරගාවලියම පාකිස්තානයේ දී පැවැත්වීමයි.

කෙසේ නමුත් මෙම යෝජනා අතරින් අවසන් යෝජනාව බොහෝ දුරට ක්‍රියාත්මක නොවනු ඇති බව දැනටමත් ක්‍රීඩා විචාකරයන් මත පළකර තිබේ.

### Putin says Russia could hit ‘decision-making centres’ in Kyiv with new missile

*2024-11-29 08:39:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103855/putin-says-russia-could-hit-decision-making-centres-in-kyiv-with-new-missile) · `en`

Russia may use its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile to attack “decision-making centres” in Kyiv in response to Ukraine’s firing of Western missiles at Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Russia has not so far struck Ukrainian government ministries, parliament or the president’s office in the course of the 33-month war.

Kyiv is heavily protected by air defences, but Putin says the Oreshnik, which Russia fired for the first time at a Ukrainian city last week, is incapable of being intercepted - a claim greeted with scepticism by Western experts.

“Of course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range Western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on November 21,” Putin told leaders of a security alliance of ex-Soviet countries at a summit in Kazakhstan.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is planning to call bids to develop two 500 Megawatt wind plants offshore of Mannar and Puttalam after feasibility studies are concluded in 2027, Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman Tilak Siyambalapitiya said.

The CEB has to make detailed environmental studies, sea floor, and logistics before calling for bids, Siyambalapitiya told a forum organized by Sri Lanka’s Export Development Board.

The Mannar site is substantially superior in energy yield compared to Puttalam he said.

It will be about 100 kilometers off shore, but wind turbines could be planted on the sea floor.

Power will be brought to the shore by cables with no offshore grid substation and connected to the grid.

The Puttalam site was about 10 kilometres off shore but wind was not as good as Mannar.

Transmission cost was also higher requiring new lines as existing capacity was full.

A third location that could be developed later was Hambantota which was less attractive.

### Will NPP Govt. probe killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera?

Rohana Wijeweera was killed 35 years ago on 13 November 1989. The revolutionary leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna was 46 years old at the time of his death. The mastermind behind two bloody insurrections – in 1971 and from 1987 to 89 – was taken into custody on 12 November in the Kandy District and brought to Colombo.

Both the IMF and the Government officials should keep in mind that maintaining broad public support is as important as implementing necessary reforms

The new Government and the IMF have so far been in sync. For instance, the IMF underscored the importance of securing funding for social spending and supporting the most vulnerable. President Dissanayake has assured that his Government would prioritise effective use of social funds, focusing on combating child poverty, addressing malnutrition, and improving support for differently-abled individuals. These priorities, core to the NPP’s election platform, demonstrate at least some levels of alignment between the Government’s goals and IMF conditions. The mutual emphasis on social spending would also help the Government maintain its strong popularity
