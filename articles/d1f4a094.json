    "Congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the BJP-led NDA\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d achievement of securing three consecutive victories in the Lok Sabha elections, Sri Lanka\u2019s Opposition Leader, Sajith Premadasa on Wednesday reaffirmed support for India\u2019s permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).",
    "Making a special speech in the Sri Lankan Parliament on Wednesday, Premadasa emphasised that India, with its status as the world\u2019s most populous country and a significant global economic and military power, deserves this recognition.",
    "\u201cThis is of utmost importance as India has the largest population in the whole world. Also, when you examine the world\u2019s economic, security power configuration, I feel that this representation of India in the UNSC must be achieved and must be promoted,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "\u201cWe as parliamentarians, all 225, in this august assembly would like to propose that India be made a permanent member of the UN Security Council. I think it is long overdue and it should be implemented as quickly as possible,\u201d the Opposition leader said, expressing his confidence that the current permanent members of the UNSC would acknowledge India\u2019s rightful place in the global power structure.",
    "\u201cI am pretty sure that the five members who are there right now would have no objection to establishing this world power reality in the UN structure,\u201d he stated. Premadasa also acknowledged the strong bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and India and expressed gratitude for India\u2019s significant financial support including grants, loans, and other financial aid totaling approximately six billion USD.",
    "\u201cWe have seen the brotherly neighborhood relationship between the two countries as India is the largest single donor to Sri Lanka with around $6 billion in grants, loans and financial support.",
    "We appreciate the support that India has provided to us when Sri Lanka has been suffering from a variety of challenges including economic bankruptcy,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "Hailing his visionary leadership, practical policies, and effective governance, the SJB leader highlighted that Narendra Modi is the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to accomplish the feat of leading the country for the third time.",
    "\u201cPrime Minister Modi has been a remarkable person who commenced his work from humble beginnings. He came from a small family and didn\u2019t have a huge family background. He did not have a power base to commence work. But during his stint as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and later as the Indian PM, he has exhibited stupendous energy, charisma, hard work and the singular determination to make India number one in the world. This is at a time when most of the countries in the region are going through sluggish economic growth,\u201d said Premadasa while praising PM Modi\u2019s achievement.",
    "\u201cWe see India as a unique country that also extricated itself from the Covid-19 catastrophe.",
    "India has been a shining example of how you get out of desperate situations, despair and economic catastrophe and how you transform and translate a bad situation into a better one. I would like to congratulate honourable PM Modi on his remarkable achievement in almost all states. Of course, there have been states where he has done very well and there are certain states where the BJP-NDA is yet to make its imprint,\u201d he said in his speech.",
    "The Sri Lankan Opposition leader also reiterated his commitment to maintain cooperation between the two nations to ensure mutual prosperity and benefits.",
    "\u201cWe would like to continuously have a very close relationship with India, our great and brotherly neighbour. We would like to have a strong productive and constructive relationship with them,\u201d he stated.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe also congratulated PM Modi on NDA\u2019s victory and re-election for the third term.",
    "\u201cI extend my warmest felicitations to the BJP-led NDA on its victory, demonstrating the confidence of the Indian people in the progress and prosperity under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. As the closest neighbour, Sri Lanka looks forward to further strengthening the partnership with India,\u201d President Wickremesinghe posted on X.",
    "Modi tweeted in response: \u201cThank you President Ranil Wickremesinghe. I look forward to our continued cooperation on the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership.\u201d"
