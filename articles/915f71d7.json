    "In his statement, President Wickremesinghe stressed the urgency of reforming the global financial architecture.",

    "President Wickremesinghe also thanked President Museveni and the Government of Uganda for their hospitality and congratulated President Museveni on hosting the 3rd South Summit and assuming the Chairmanship of the Group of 77 + China, the PMD mentioned.",
    "The President also expressed gratitude to Cuba for its leadership during the past year and commended their effective leadership in the Havana Declaration.",
    "As the G77 + China commemorate their 60th year, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of remaining united to overcome multidimensional challenges based on the group\u2019s founding principles of unity, complementarity, cooperation and solidarity.",
    "As the largest alliance of developing countries within the United Nations, the G77 provided a platform for the Global South countries to express and advance their collective economic interests. It also served as a forum for joint discussions on international economic issues, fostering mutual cooperation among its member countries. The 3rd Southern Summit was convened under the theme of \u201cLeaving No One Behind,\u201d aiming to enhance collaboration among its 134 member nations in areas such as trade, investment, sustainable development, climate change, poverty alleviation, and the digital economy.",
