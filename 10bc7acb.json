Despite the challenges, the remarkable skills of the artists are evident throughout the current exhibition.",
    "It is imperative to channel these talents towards the development of the handicraft sector.

Further relief measures are anticipated in the future as we navigate these economic challenges collectively.",
    "The path we are currently taking is the only viable option. Some may suggest printing money and obtaining bank loans, but such measures would jeopardize our support from the IMF. Despite the challenges we face along this path, there is a positive outlook for the strengthening of the rupee by the end of the year, with its value increasing progressively.",
    "Preserving the value of the rupee is crucial. While providing concessions, we must avoid devaluing the currency, as that would have detrimental consequences.",
    "Admittedly, this may not be a popular program, but it is the only pragmatic option available. If there are alternative programs for economic recovery, they should be presented, accompanied by a clear strategy on how to garner the support of the IMF.

This reality underscores the urgency of finding sustainable solutions for the well-being of the country.",

Despite the challenges the country is facing, organizing this handicraft exhibition in the New Year is considered a significant accomplishment, instilling fresh hope.",

The government\u2019s commitment to supporting small and medium enterprises, especially in the traditional handicraft sector, underscores its dedication to fostering economic growth and foreign exchange earnings.",
    "Despite the prevailing crisis in the country, it is commendable that the President recognizes and values the contributions of artists in this field. In the recent budget, traditional artisans were granted necessary credit facilities, reflecting the government\u2019s support for this sector. With a considerable global demand for handicrafts, the goal is set to earn Rs.01 billion from the handicraft industry by the years 2024-2025.",
