    "Colombo, May 11 (Daily Mirror) - Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera told the Daily Mirror today that there are over 10 members currently serving in Parliament who hold dual citizenship and said that those MPs should be removed from their posts before the elections.",
    "\"In light of the Supreme Court ruling, I would like to kindly request all party leaders to disclose any members within their parties who hold dual citizenships,\" he said.",
    "MPs holding dual citizenship should step down before the upcoming elections; otherwise, the respective party leaders should bear the responsibility, he added.",
    "\"These MPs have no loyalty to the country; they simply occupy parliamentary positions for personal gain. We have the capability to disclose their identities, but they should be granted an opportunity to reveal themselves before the upcoming elections,\" he said.",
    "\"If they fail to come forward, we'll have to pursue legal action against them. However, resorting to litigation over these issues is both time-consuming and costly,\" Ven. Sobhitha Thero said.",
    "\"Therefore, I urge these MPs to respectfully resign from their positions and I also remind party leaders to choose their representatives carefully,\" the Thera said.",
    "Ven. Sobhitha Thero said that pursuing legal action over these issues is pointless and a waste of time and resources. Therefore, he urged those MPs to resign from their positions gracefully."
