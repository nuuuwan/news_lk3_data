The Bill seeks to amend present Article 83(b), according to which the maximum period to which such term or duration can be extended without a Referendum is six years. Article 83 also states that any Bill that seeks to amend Article 83 itself would require a two-thirds majority and approval at a Referendum. Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the proposed Bill will require a two-thirds majority and a Referendum.

The revival program recently initiated by CBSL is a big opportunity for the banks to reduce their non-performing balance via rehabilitating the distressed customers while contributing to the national economy of Sri Lanka

A credit decision of a bank is inextricably associated with credit risk due to the micro and macroeconomic conditions which are beyond the control of the customer. Hence, the repayment capacity of the borrower can be affected by unpredictable circumstances; subsequently the liabilities of the bank will be transferred to non-performing category. These borrowers cannot be treated as wilful defaulters, and should be immediately remedied out by different tools and techniques like Restructuring, Rescheduling and Revival with Rehabilitation

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne has condemned State Minister of Plantation Industries Lohan Ratwatte for his recent comments against rival National People’s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumar Dissanayake.

Addressing a rally in Kandy over the weekend, Ratwatte had said he will not allow Dissanayake to take over as Sri Lanka’s next leader.

“Has Anura Dissanayake constructed even a small gutter for the people? We won’t allow him to become President of this country as long as I am around in politics,” he had said.

In response Wickramaratne taking to social media platform X yesterday said such statements have dangerous undertones considering Sri Lanka’s history of election interference and violence.

“While I disagree with the policies of NPP and believe that Sajith is the election frontrunner, no politician has the right to allow or not allow a candidate to be elected,” Wickramaratne said.

### 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in Russia in 2 months!Ministry of Defense of British Defense

*2024-07-16 22:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188613) · `ta`

In the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Britain's Defense Ministry reports significant casualties among Russian forces, estimating 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in just two months. The report details heavy losses, particularly in attempts to seize Ukraine's Karkiv region, with daily fatalities exceeding 1,000 in May and June. Despite capturing territory in eastern Ukraine, Russia's inability to sustain tactical victories and the poor training of its troops are highlighted as key factors contributing to these losses. Western analysts suggest that while small-scale attack tactics offer minor gains, they do not facilitate broader operational successes, indicating a high cost-benefit ratio for Russia's military strategy.

🟩

Britain has reported that 70,000 soldiers of Russia have died or injured in the last two months of the Ukraine war.

The British Defense Ministry said in a military intelligence report released last weekend.

Russian soldiers have been reported to have suffered massive losses at the new war in Russia to conquer Ukraine's Karkiv region.

The British Defense Ministry said that the daily losses of the Russian soldiers (deaths and injuries) were 1,262 in May and it was 1,163 in June.

The Ministry said that 70,000 Russian soldiers may have died or injured in only 2 months.

In the Eastern region of Ukraine, Russian soldiers have captured several territories over the past few months.

Russia opened a new battlefield last May to capture the Karkiv region. Ukrainian soldiers were lost in this war. At the same time, the British Defense Ministry said it had caused losses to Russian soldiers.

Attorneys' unity said that there is no need to make changes in the constitution.

The Attorneys' Organization said that if the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution granted by the Cabinet is passed with a two -thirds majority, the Presidential Election Commissioner will be asked to conduct a sum of 30 days.

This is why the country will be forced to face two national elections, which will cause a chaos after one election, the lawyers' organization said.

The government has stated that it has no funding to hold a joint government election, claiming that billions of billions will be required to conduct a universal payment.

The lawyers' organization said that there is no need to reduce the ceiling of the president and parliament, and that the proposed amendment may be disturbed by the unnecessary issues and disrupting the electoral process.

The lawyers' organization, which has accused the legislature of manipulating the proposed Bill, has appealed to the democratic forces to oppose it.
