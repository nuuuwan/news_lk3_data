    "The Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday guaranteed that the bonuses to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees will not hinder the relief promised to the electricity users.",
    "He opined that the CEB should balance administrative responsibilities and trade union negotiations without affecting its commitments to the public or delaying critical decisions.",
    "\u201cAdministration is one thing and trade union demands are another,\u201d he said responding to a question raised at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "He said there is no direct connection between the trade union\u2019s demand and the Board of Directors or the decision-makers.",
    "\u201cTrade unions are simply trying to secure their rights. However, managing these demands, while meeting the PUCSL\u2019s deadline for proposals is the responsibility of the CEB,\u201d he said.",
    "The electricity regulator \u2014 Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on Monday gave an ultimatum to the CEB till 6 December to submit the proposal for tariff revision, which was a key promise made by the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government during the Presidential and Parliamentary elections.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa emphasised that the tariff revision would provide tangible benefits to electricity users by reducing costs \u2014 including production and transmission expenses.",
    "\u201cThis proposal will be conveyed to the CEB through Power and Energy Minister,\u201d he added."
