Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals went up 89 percent to 635,784 persons in the first quarter of 2024.

Tourism earnings in the month were estimated at 338.4 million US dollars, up 79 percent from 118.8 a year ago.

The tourism earnings figure is estimated from a survey conducted by Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.

Sri Lanka’s imports and the merchandise trade deficit has gradually picked as tourism earnings came in and people in the sector spent the wages and other earnings.

Related Sri Lanka trade deficit up 77-pct to Feb, imports surge, rupee appreciates

Tourism itself requires fuel for travel and operating hotels.  (Colombo/Apr8/2024)

### Fcode Labs introduces power of AI in coaching

*2024-04-08 04:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fcode-labs-introduces-power-of-ai-in-coaching/) · `en`

Fcode Labs, a leading healthcare technology consultancy company, has announced the launch of Progress Magic (www.progressmagic.com) – revolutionary platform designed to supercharge mental and corporate coaching practices.

Progress Magic leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline workflows, optimize client outcomes, and unlock transformative results for both coaches and their clients. The platform is secure. It’s HIPAA, GDPR, and PDPA compliant which means, it uses all the industry best practices on security and data privacy to operate in the USA, Europe, Singapore, and Sri Lanka.

The rise in mental health and corporate coaching clientele is outpacing the availability of streamlined administrative solutions. This cuts into valuable client interaction time, potentially leading to stalled progress or client abandonment. Traditional methods of scheduling, billing, and record keeping can be cumbersome, hindering coaches’ ability to deliver the highest quality care.

The soft pedaling by the government to carry out crucial reforms of State Owned Enterprises is forcing taxpayer’s wallets to take the brunt of the hit, says Colombo based think tank, Advocata Institute.

Dhananath Fernando, the Chief Executive Officer of the Advocata Institute said, taking into account the upcoming election cycle, the Advocata Institute, urged the need to reform State Owned (SOE) Enterprises. Here it was said that irrespective of the government that comes into power, SOE reforms must continue.

The cumulative losses of key 52 SOE’s in 2022 amounted to LKR 744.6Bn, costing LKR 1.7Mn per registered taxpayer, LKR 33,949 per citizen and LKR 141,809 per household. Despite the sharp increase in tax collection, estimates of tax collection for 2024 cannot cover the losses incurred by these 52 SOE’s for the year 2022.

The revised advisory no longer includes previous concerns regarding shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. In addition, the previously mentioned risks related to limitations in health services including the lack of medical equipment, have been omitted.

A group of sustainable energy activists convened a press conference in Colombo last week and called for resolving any issues with the Adani wind power project in Mannar and find pragmatic and sustainable ways to implement it without dragging on it.

“Sri Lanka is blessed with plenty of wind — a renewable energy resource with which cheaper electricity can be provided to consumers without spending millions of dollars on fossil fuel, but it is still an enigma why the government of Sri Lanka is dragging on finalizing the Adani wind power project in Mannar,” they said.

Indunil Bandara, Convener of the Youth for Renewable Energy Organization voiced concerns over the issue of increasing electricity unit tariffs faced by Sri Lankans. Bandara highlighted that nearly 25% of the average income is allocated to electricity consumption, posing significant challenges to households and businesses alike.

### Sri Lanka forex reserves improving, but global oil prices keep increasing

*2024-04-08 04:19:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-forex-reserves-improving-but-global-oil-prices-keep-increasing/) · `en`

The gross official reserves were provisionally estimated at US dollars 4,951 mn as at end March 2024 including proceeds from the People’ Bank of China (PBOC) swap arrangement, which is subject to conditionalities on usability, according to the Weekly Economic Indicators of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

The report, however, stated that during the period under review (March 29- April 5), crude oil prices exhibited an increasing trend. Crude oil prices increased owing to optimism on demand with the expansion in manufacturing activity in China and the US, coupled with the concerns about tight supply stemming from escalating geopolitical tensions and major producers keeping output cuts in place. Overall, both Brent and WTI prices increased by more than US dollars 3.00 per barrel during the review period.

The situation, therefore, appears to remain ambivalent for Sri Lanka as the cost of incoming shipments of oil could jump in the coming weeks.

### Ex-President Sirisena draws an India connection - EDITORIAL

Ex-President Sirisena is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Hardly had the ink dried on news stories of his sudden firing of three senior Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, we learned that a court order has barred him from performing duties as chairman of that party.

The court order was based on a complaint to the court by Chandrika Kumaratunga for the removal of Sirisena from the post of SLFP Chairman, on the grounds he was unsuitable for the role. Among the reasons for his ouster were charges he was unlawfully holding the Chairmanship of the party in violation of the Party Constitution.

Additional charges arose from Sirisena’s actions during the constitutional crisis of 2018 being deemed incorrect. He was also found guilty of having violated the fundamental rights of people in the case of the Easter Sunday bombings.

### Auspicious times! Exposing incompetence or astrology a pseudoscientific myth?

Professional rivalry or jealousy often leads astrologers outside the official team to challenge the declared times

During the Sinhala Avurudda, also known as the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, people adhere to various religious rituals and cultural practices meticulously following auspicious times known as “nekath” provided by astrologers.

In response to past controversies surrounding nekath, the government appointed a team of astrologers in 1992  to determine the official auspicious times, which were widely accepted. However, professional rivalry or jealousy often leads astrologers outside the official team to challenge the declared times, citing various unexplained theoretical concepts unique to astrology. These contradictions caused anxiety among the general public and believers of astrology, leading to uncertainty and a loss of confidence in the auspicious times provided.

### Ukraine is fighting an increasingly desperate war

Ukraine is in trouble today because the EU’s aid package was blocked by Hungary, and no EU country is able to produce the munitions badly needed by Ukraine

There is a war in Ukraine? It seems to have been forgotten by everyone–except by Ukraine, Russia and their respective allies.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February 2022, many including myself expected it to be over in weeks. In my case, this was because, as much as I dislike Putin’s dictatorship, Russian superiority in armour, artillery, aircraft and manpower was so big it was hard to see how Ukraine could stop all those tanks rolling over the country’s eastern steppes and advancing into the country, encircling and destroying outnumbered Ukrainian forces.

### Racist policy of forced cremation

*2024-04-08 02:28:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Racist-policy-of-forced-cremation/4-760427) · `en`

The whole issue of forced cremation that shook the Muslim community in 2020/21 was entirely rooted in racism.

It is the Gotabaya Government which both piloted and enforced to the full measure this racist policy, aided by experts whom the President himself effectively appointed.

Now that it has been demonstrated, after a series of international setbacks for the Government and the erosion of public trust in Government leaders and experts, the question of tendering an open apology to the Muslim community and to those who opposed the policy tooth and nail as it was ruthlessly enforced has now come up.

As admitted, Thondaman’s Ministry of Water Resources has found out that the COVID-19 virus doesn’t spread through ground water. Perhaps, Ali Sabry’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found out that the damage that this racist policy implemented by the Government, of which he remained an integral part (as Justice Minister), heaped on the country internationally was avoidable but horrendous.
