  "original_body_lines": [
    "Flight crew at Air Canada have ended a dispute with the airline which had grounded flights and stranded thousands of passengers since Saturday.",
    "A tentative agreement was announced by the union representing flight attendants and confirmed by the airline, which said flights will resume later on Tuesday.",
    "More than 10,000 staff had walked out in protest at pay and scheduling. The deal has not been disclosed in full, though the union said it achieves \u201ctransformational change\u201d for workers and the industry.",
    "The agreement will now be presented to members to be ratified.",
    "The breakthrough came nine hours after talks began with the help of an approved mediator appointed by the government.",
    "\u201cUnpaid work is over,\u201d said the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in a statement early on Tuesday, calling the negotiations a \u201chistoric fight\u201d for the industry.",
    "The union also advised its members to \u201cfully co-operate with resumption of operations\u201d.",
    "The dispute between Air Canada and the union had escalated when CUPE rejected an order to return to work issued by the Canadian Industrial Relations Board, which deemed the strike \u201cunlawful\u201d in a ruling on Monday.",
    "Following news of a tentative deal, Air Canada said the first flights would restart on Tuesday evening, but it may take days to return to a full service because aircraft and crew are out of position.",
    "It added that it would not comment on the terms of the agreed deal until it had been ratified.",
    "In contract negotiations, Air Canada said it had offered flight attendants a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, with a 25% raise in the first year.",
    "CUPE said the offer was \u201cbelow inflation, below market value, below minimum wage\u201d and would still leave flight attendants unpaid for some hours of work, including boarding and waiting at airports ahead of flights.",
    "The union also rejected an order by the Canadian government to enter binding arbitration and return to work over the weekend, accusing it of \u201ccaving to corporate pressure\u201d.",
    "After the union\u2019s refusal, Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu encouraged the two parties on Monday to resume talks and said her ministry will order a probe into \u201cthe allegations of unpaid work in the airline sector\u201d.",
    "The nearly four-day strike has impacted more than 500,000 passengers, Air Canada has said. The airline - Canada\u2019s largest - operates around 700 flights daily, serving both domestic and international travellers."
