    "Colombo, Jan 19 (Daily Mirror) - While granting Leave to Appeal in the State Minister Diana Gamage's citizenship case, the Supreme Court questioned how the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration had filed a document containing the entry and exit details of Diana Gamage, and later had stated in an affidavit that he was not aware of which Diana Gamage this information pertained to.",
    "During the hearing the Supreme Court heard that the former Controller General of Immigration and Emigration and the officers of the Department of Immigration and Emigration had, in fact said in writing that Diana Gamage is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.
