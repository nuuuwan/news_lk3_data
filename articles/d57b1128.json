    "The status quo ante as regards the on-arrival visa issuance scheme has been resorted much to the benefit of visitors to Sri Lanka. Visa queues at the Bandaranaike International Airport are becoming shorter, we are told. Hats off to newly-appointed Minister of Public Security Vijitha Herath, who acted swiftly to clean up the mess!",
    "Anything that corrupt politicians touch turns into a mess, and the visa racket is a case in point. There was absolutely no need for handing over the on-arrival visa processing to a private company; the Department of Immigration and Emigration was handling it very efficiently with the help of Mobitel, and visa fees were kept very low.",
    "But some crooks in the garb of ruling party politicians seeking to line their pockets brought a private company in, and the visa fee went through the roof without any benefit to the state coffers. The blame for this crooked deal must be apportioned to all members of the Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe Cabinet, which approved it.",
    "It would not have been possible to streamline the on-arrival visa issuance in this manner unless Emigration and Immigration Controller General Harsha Ilukpitiya and his political masters had been able to continue to meddle with it; the Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe government, which went all out to protect the interests of the foreign company they had contracted to handle visa processing, did not want to implement a Supreme Court (SC) order that the previous system be restored.",
    "Thankfully, the SC ordered Ilukpitiya remanded, the other day, over contempt of court as he had not obeyed its order, and the corrupt politicians in the Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe regime lost their grip of power.",
    "The collapse of the Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe regime, which became a metaphor for corruption, has also led to the implementation of another SC order. An Acting IGP\u2008has been appointed. In July, the SC issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from serving as the IGP; it also ordered President Ranil Wickremesinghe to appoint an Acting IGP.",
    "Wickremesinghe did not carry out the SC order, and some government pundits claimed that the IGP could not be suspended as he had been appointed by the Constitutional Council. However, Tennakoon did not dare function as the IGP for fear of committing contempt of court, but no Acting IGP was appointed. President Wickremesinghe continued to trot out lame excuses, the most ludicrous one being that he, as a presidential candidate, could not appoint an Acting IGP.",
    "He thereafter contradicted himself by making several other key appointments. His spin doctors claimed that the absence of an IGP would stand in the way of the conduct of the presidential election. Wickremesinghe himself endorsed this absurd claim in public. But nobody took it seriously, and a very peaceful presidential election was held without a police chief. This may be considered an indictment of IGP Tennakoon.",
    "The biggest challenge before the newly appointed Acting IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya is to ensure that the upcoming parliamentary polls will be as peaceful as the recently concluded presidential election. That will be the moment of truth for him.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the NPP Cabinet deserve praise for having carried out two SC orders the previous dispensation did not carry out. However, they will have to ensure that all those responsible for the visa scam, especially the corrupt politicians who masterminded it are brought to justice without further delay.",
    "The non-implementation of the aforesaid SC orders was one of the main issues that turned public opinion against President Wickremesinghe, who suffered an ignominious defeat at last Saturday\u2019s presidential election.",
