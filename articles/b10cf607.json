  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Petroleum Trade Unions have criticized the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for failing to implement the revision of electricity tariffs, which was supposed to take place on October 01, allegedly due to the irresponsible actions of the CEB.",
    "During a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (16), the convener of the union, Ananda Palitha, expressed concerns over the issue.",
    "\u201cThe Electricity Board has not yet provided the necessary data to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for the revision of the electricity tariffs. Currently, the CEB\u2019s net profit exceeds Rs. 155 billion. Why is there room for further exploitation?\u201d he questioned.",
    "Further, he urged the President to intervene, stating, \u201cIf you are committed to the welfare of the people, you should question the CEB on what it has been doing all this time. Immediate action can be taken to revise the electricity bill, potentially reducing it by at least 45 percent.\u201d"
