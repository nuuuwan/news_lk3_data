    "Iran said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was over barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to retaliate against Tehran as fears of a wider war intensified.",

    "The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.",
    "\u201cOur action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X early on Wednesday.",
    "Israel renewed its bombardment early on Wednesday of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a stronghold of the Iran-backed armed Hezbollah group, with at least a dozen airstrikes against what it said were targets belonging the group.",
    "Large plumes of smoke were seen rising from parts of the suburbs. Israel issued new evacuation orders for the area, which have largely emptied after days of heavy strikes.",

    "No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said.",
    "Iran described the campaign as defensive and solely aimed at Israeli military facilities. Iran\u2019s state news agency said three Israeli military bases had been targeted.",
    "Tehran said its assault was a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders and aggression in Lebanon against Hezbollah and in Gaza.",
    "Israel activated air defences against Iran\u2019s bombardment and most missiles were intercepted \u201cby Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States,\u201d Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video on X, adding: \u201cIran\u2019s attack is a severe and dangerous escalation.\u201d",

    "Iran\u2019s General Staff of the Armed Forces said in a statement carried by state media that any Israeli response would be met with \u201cvast destruction\u201d of Israeli infrastructure. It also said it would target regional assets of any Israeli ally that got involved.",

    "Sullivan did not specify what those consequences might be, but he stopped short of urging restraint by Israel as the U.S. did in April when Iran carried out a drone and missile attack on Israel. The Pentagon said Tuesday\u2019s airstrikes by Iran were about twice the size of April\u2019s assault.",
    "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he called \u201cescalation after escalation\u201d, saying: \u201cThis must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire.\u201d",
