    "It was only last week that I belatedly had the opportunity to view Christopher Nolan\u2019s award-winning film \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019, the real-life account of the American Theoretical Physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, who spearheaded the \u2018Manhattan Project\u2019, which successfully built the first atom bomb. The dropping of two of these bombs on the Japanese cites of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, at an enormous human cost, brought World War II to a conclusion with the surrender of Japan to the allies. Germany had already surrendered prior to the use of the atom bomb on Japan.",
    "The story of Oppenheimer, as vividly depicted in the film, is inextricably intertwined with the events that necessitated the need to develop a weapon as non-selectively destructive as the atom bomb and the scientific and technological challenges that needed to be overcome while the clock was ticking as German scientists, under Adolf Hitler, were also engaged in a similar endeavour. While these events were hugely interesting, what intrigued me most as a scientist, though by no means comparable in calibre or achievement to Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists engaged in the Manhattan Project, was the human dimension of the whole story.",
    "The film showed Oppenheimer as a man with views and opinions on socio-political issues of the day (e.g. Communism and the influence of Soviet Union on global affairs, fascism and the Spanish civil war, antisemitism in Europe, etc.) and a human being with failings like those of other mortals despite his academic brilliance and charisma. Above all, the film highlights the intense inner struggle that he endured, both before and after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in knowing the destruction that his work would cause and did cause.",
    "The movie also portrays how Oppenheimer tried to push back against the strong political forces, backed up by some of his own fellow scientists, which persecuted and tried to destroy him after the war was over, for the socio-political views that he held and the intensely difficult choices that he made. At a time when some of the Sri Lankan scientists themselves are engaged in promoting the agendas of various candidates in a closely run presidential election, the Oppenheimer story provides important parallels and lessons to the scientific community in Sri Lanka.",
    "Should scientists be apolitical and be neutral on key social issues?",
    "Advancement of knowledge and understanding via scientific research, by its very nature, is apolitical. A scientist investigates a problem with an unbiased and open mind, using the methodology that has been established as valid in previous research. When new methodology is used, it must be specifically tested and validated as scientifically sound and error-free. Once the data are collected, using valid methodology, they are interpreted, based on previously validated principles.",
    "Conclusions are drawn solely based on valid interpretation of observations and results and they are communicated to the outside world, irrespective of their implications. However, when scientists openly endorse and support political parties and their associated ideologies, the ability to engage in unbiased scientific research is compromised. When the former President of Sri Lanka decided to swScientists in Politics \u2013 Lessons from the Oppenheimer Storyitch to 100% organic agriculture overnight,",
    "the scientists, who had actively campaigned on behalf of the President, either supported the ill-fated and scientifically improbable project or remained silent. This was a clear example of allegiance to a political party getting in the way of scientific validity and unbiased judgement. When a scientist endorses and supports a political party during an election campaign, he/she is bound to endorse and support the actions and decisions that the party takes once it is in governance.",
    "Even if a scientist opposes the actions of a government that he/she publicly supported and actively campaigned to bring into governance, his/her opposition would not have the same level of credibility in the eyes of the public as that of a scientist who had remained apolitical during an election campaign.",
    "It can be argued that all scientists are citizens so that they are entitled to endorse and support political parties just as citizens of any other walk of life. However, there is only a very fine line between being a private citizen openly endorsing and supporting a political party and being a scientist, where an open mind and unbiased judgement are of paramount importance. It is not enough that scientists are unbiased and open, but they need to be seen to be so.",
    "The need for scientists to be apolitical does not mean that they should remain silent on key social issues. For example, a large majority of scientists all over the world openly endorses and supports the view that climate change is real and that rapidly increasing emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities is the primary cause of recent climate change. This view on climate change is supported by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence and, therefore, constitutes a clearcut case for lending support. Supporting issues which are less clearcut, but scientifically valid, requires courage and strength of conviction.",
    "In 1939, Albert Einstein endorsed and co-signed a letter written to President Roosevelt by Physicist Leo Szilard (with inputs from other Physicists, Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner) warning the President about the possibility of Germans developing an atom bomb and urging him to start a nuclear programme for the US as well. Similarly, all over the world, scientists are actively engaged in either supporting or speaking against various social issues impacting humanity, life and environment. Yet, there is a clear distinction between a scientist openly endorsing the view of a political party and actively supporting a social cause.",
    "While the former has the potential to diminish the credibility of a scientist, the latter has the potential to enhance it. Oppenheimer, for example, was interested in Communism as an ideology and participated in gatherings of his fellow scientists who shared the same interest along with those who were members of the American Communist Party. However, he refused to obtain membership of the party, despite both his girlfriend and wife being members, saying that he needed to maintain his independence in thinking.",
    "Pros and cons of scientists getting involved in socio-political activities",
    "Being citizens, scientists find themselves confronted with politics and social issues just as any other citizen. Consciousness about their social responsibility can drive a scientist to embrace a political party or its ideology. Apart from being a conscientious citizen, there have been many instances in the past where scientists have been seen to embrace political parties and ideologies with a view of gaining personal benefits when the party comes in to governance.",
    "This was clearly evident with regard to \u2018Viyath Maga\u2019, the gathering of intellectuals, including a considerable number of scientists; it was formed in the run-up to the presidential election in 2019. However, it was equally clear that apart from a selected few, who gained positions in the political establishment and the state sector institutions, the large majority of scientists who openly endorsed and supported the candidate promoted by \u2018Viyath Maga\u2019 were merely making up numbers in a political game.",
    "Ironically, a President who came to power on the shoulders of a body of intellectuals and scientists did not even consult them when taking key policy decisions, for which scientific evidence and input from scientists were essential. Being used as pawns in a political game is a real risk that scientists who openly endorse and support politicians and political parties are exposed to.",
    "Past experience everywhere in the world has shown that politicians readily renege on their pre-election promises and manifestos, which were prepared with significant and leading contributions from their supporting intellectuals and scientists, who also campaigned on their behalf. This leaves the credibility of those scientists in tatters, leaving their reputation for conducting research with an open mind and drawing unbiased conclusions from their results tainted, often permanently.",
    "Even a scientist as renowned as Oppenheimer was cast aside by the political establishment once his task of developing and successfully testing the atom bomb was accomplished. In a clear example of how scientists are treated by politicians after they get their work done by them, the US political establishment did not heed the advice of both Einstein and Oppenheimer to negotiate a nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union to prevent an arms race between the two superpowers, after the Soviet Union built its own atom bomb.",
    "In fact, after the war, Oppenheimer was hounded by the establishment for his past ties to Communism and his security clearance to engage in nuclear research was revoked so that he could no longer engage in it. Similarly, scientists who endorse and support politicians and political parties run the risk of future persecution, especially if the candidate or party that they support does not come into governance. It is said that even Einstein was not granted security clearance to take part in the Manhattan Project because of his pacifist views prior to the commencement of the Second World war.",
    "The purpose of this article is not to denigrate those scientists and intellectuals who have decided to openly endorse, support and campaign for any particular politician or political party. They have every right to do so as independent and conscientious citizens and professionals, and it is a choice that each individual scientist makes. However, history, both in Sri Lanka and elsewhere, has shown that political activism is a double-edged sword, and politicians are extremely fickle creatures, who would readily dump the scientists who risked their reputations and credibility to bring them into governance.",
    "Therefore, the scientists who go down the path of political activism should do so with the awareness that it might cost them their credibility as independent and unbiased explorers of knowledge. When a scientist goes into political activism, the boundary between the scientist and the politician (or the scientist politician) can quickly become blurred so that he/she may ultimately end up being a politician. In a country such as Sri Lanka where the ratio of scientists to its population is extremely low by global standards, I would hate to see that happening!",
