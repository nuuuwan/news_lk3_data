    "He stated that the first phase of the \u201cwork-to-rule\u201d strike, which was carried out to object to the proposed division, concluded yesterday, and the union has now decided to move into the second phase of its trade union action.",
    "Parakramasinghe emphasized that the public will not be inconvenienced by these measures, noting that the actions have been carefully planned in a manner that ensures the government remains informed.",
