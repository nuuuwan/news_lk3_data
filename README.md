### Israeli missiles hit site in Iran, explosions heard in Isfahan: Report

*2024-04-19 08:26:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Israeli-missiles-hit-site-in-Iran-explosions-heard-in-Isfahan-Report/108-280957) · `en`

(Aljazeera) - Israeli missiles have hit a site in Iran, according to the US broadcaster ABC News, which cited an unnamed senior US official.

The Iranian state television reported explosions in Isfahan, as air defences were activated and flights across several areas including Tehran and Isfahan were suspended.

There were no reports of casualties. Nor was there an official response from Iran.

Israel promised to respond after Iran last Saturday launched a barrage of drones and missiles on the country, after a suspected Israeli strike on Iran’s consulate compound in Damascus killed a high-ranking commander.

There have also been reports of explosions in Syria and Iraq.

The United States and a number of European countries had been calling on Israel not to respond to the Iranian attack.

### India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election

*2024-04-19 08:21:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/India-heads-to-the-polls-in-worlds-biggest-election/107-280956) · `en`

(CNN) - Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India’s marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world’s most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India’s secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.

Under Modi’s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power.

### Party leaders to shoot down MPs request for concessionary duty free vehicle permits

*2024-04-19 08:17:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Party-leaders-to-shoot-down-MPs-request-for-concessionary-duty-free-vehicle-permits/108-280954) · `en`

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - A request by some MPs across the political divide for concessionary vehicle permits is likely to be shot down by the party leaders given the dire economic situation of the country, Daily Mirror learns.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne brought to the notice of the Business Committee last week that a letter is being signed by the MPs for such a request.

He said such a request would tarnish the honorary services of the MPs and therefore such facility should not be granted to them in adherence to due protocols as in the case of other public servants and judicial officers.

However, SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said at the same meeting that such a request should not be entertained at all due to what they called bankruptcy of the country.

On that day, a group of 60 Tamils including two parliamentarians and two senators convened at the Government Clerical Service Union (GCSU) hall in Colombo.

That historic conclave resulted in the launching of a new political party with the avowed goal of establishing an autonomous State for the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known then) within a united island. The new party was named in Tamil as “Illankai Thamil Arasu Katchi” meaning Ceylon Tamil State or Tamil Government Party.

In the face of a deep balance of payments crisis in the 1980s, a recession was triggered in India in 1991. Prices for necessities were soaring, the unemployment rate was rising, and the public’s despondency deepened while facing shortages of nearly everything. The future looked very bleak for many. While some people got onto the streets out of desperation, another group of smart individuals who were passionate about getting India’s economy back on track, worked relentlessly to find solutions to their economic issues, which had a transformative effect on India to become the regional powerhouse it is today.

*2024-04-19 05:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dialog-airtel-lanka-merger-comes-centre-stage/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s premier mobile phone company, Dialog Axiata, will issue 952 million shares by way of a share swap to Bharti Airtel to acquire the latter organization. The deal was finalized yesterday, CSE market analysts said.

Bharti Airtel and Dialog Axiata entered into a Binding Agreement to merge their operations in May 2023. Dialog is the largest telecom service provider in Sri Lanka with more than 17 million subscribers as of 2021, representing around 51 percent of the market. Airtel Lanka has about 5 million subscribers. The 952 million Dialog shares amount to 10.4 percent of the total shares issued by the company.

However, the stock market was sluggish because profit takings came to the fore due to continued uncertainty in the external debt restructuring exercise. Both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 33.1 points, while the S and P SL20 declined by 8.81 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.22 billion with 3 crossings.

Port City Colombo officials expressed frustration over delays in opening the downtown duty-free mall in Colombo.

Originally scheduled to commence operations in April, the facility now faces an uncertain timeline for opening to the public, primarily due to unexpected legislative hurdles.

While concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of the duty-free mall on local businesses and Sri Lanka’s taxation framework, CHEC Port City Colombo Deputy Managing Director Thulchi Aluwihare has asserted that the facility will not have the negative effects perceived by some in the political and business communities.

“The aim is not to cannibalise but to expand the market and promote economic growth. The broader objective of Port City is to increase footfall and benefit the entire Colombo ecosystem,” Aluwihare told Mirror Business.

Harsha de Silva, Member of Parliament and Chair of the Parliament Committee on Public Finance (COPF), addressed the media in Sinhala, on 17 April 2024, shedding light on the recent breakdown of debt restructuring talks between the Sri Lankan Government and the international bondholders’ “steering committee”.

These confidential negotiations, conducted behind closed doors, aimed to restructure over $ 12 billion of debt. However, they faltered due to discrepancies between the bondholders’ proposed “baseline” assessments and the absence of a contingency plan to address ongoing economic fragility. Notably, the parameters outlined in the bondholders’ plan diverged from those outlined in the Government’s IMF program.

Claims agreement with bondholders fell through due to Govt.’s refusal to set up anti-corruption framework

Says failure to tackle corruption is delaying IMF second tranche and deal with bondholders

Stresses combating corruption would attract foreign direct investments through increased investor confidence

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday claimed that the Government’s hesitance to establish an effective anti-corruption framework, as demanded by sovereign bondholders, stems from its own corrupt practices.

Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, the MP said the Government allegedly could not reach an agreement with sovereign bondholders because it refused to comply with their requirement to implement an anti-corruption framework.

He noted that this has caused a delay in the disbursement of the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in reaching an agreement with international sovereign bondholders.

### Suppressing a community by denying education - EDITORIAL

These are days when politicians in the country are getting ready for upcoming elections, hence there are thoughts about whether anyone of them would use schools and education to promote their cause.

Some of the candidates have already started mingling with students and presenting them with opportunities to ask questions on hot topics that are bothering them. One of the probable candidates in the presidential elections is seen offering material goods to students. He dare not present the opportunity for students to ask questions because he would then be putting himself in a very uncomfortable position. There is one other election candidate who offers this opportunity to students and by doing so makes the questioner lose his way in a temporary world of stardom; because the student loses focus of the existing world when he or she gets to question the highest authority in the country. These are all political gimmicks.

A woman walks past a banner depicting launching missiles bearing the emblem of the Islamic Republic of Iran in central Tehran. AFP

Israel’s hardline and war-thirsty Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is more than ever before well close to dragging the United States into a war with Iran. Ever since Iran launched its nuclear programme in the late 1980s, Israel has been jittery. It fears an Iranian nuke will undermine its nuclear monopoly in the region.

Since Netanyahu became Israel’s prime minister for the first time in 1996, his main foreign policy objective has been to get the United States to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities and prevent the Islamic Republic from achieving nuclear power parity vis-à-vis Israel.
