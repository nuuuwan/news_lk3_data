“It is not possible to develop a country without the moral development of man. Let us develop the country along with moral development (of man)” So pronounced Most Ven Madihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Thero. This translation from Sinhala is by Ven Vajiraramaya Nanaseeha Thera – previously Deshabandhu Olcott Gunasekera – who was one who assisted the venerable bhikkhu to establish the Dharmavijaya Foundation in 1977. The Foundation later adopted this truth as its mission statement. Moral development connotes character building.

The thought about the quirks and misdemeanours of most Sri Lankans which ultimately tarnish the wellbeing and image of the country has long been in mind and discussed frequently when we older generations meet and grow nostalgic of how things were back then. We most definitely had a much better life, though sans TV and all these advances, since peace and general goodness prevailed.

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.

Two Sri Lankan fishing vessels that were recently apprehended in Indian waters while transporting a large consignment of crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as ‘Ice’, along with the suspects on board, were escorted ashore to the Colombo Port today (02).

One of the trawlers was found to be carrying about 400 kilograms of ‘Ice,’ while the other was assisting, according to Sri Lanka Navy.

The Indian Navy had arrested the Sri Lankan suspects and seized the vessels on November 24 and 25.

Dudley Senanayake in the short Parliament of March to July 1960

Family and background had been central in Dudley Senanayake’s case too. Greatness had literally been thrust on him when he had been appointed prime minister on the death of his father D S, in 1952. That had been a time of intrigue and maneuvering which had soured the relations between Sir John, his close relative and him.

Sir John had struck back with the Premier Stakes which he later denied having any connection with. So Dudley had been anxious to win his spurs for himself through the hustings as early as possible. And he had proved his legitimacy by winning the 1952 elections handsomely, helped by the sympathy vote created by the death of his father. But his first stint as prime minister did not last long. Plagued by illness, chronic gastritis and the hartal of August 1953 which resulted in police firing and some civilian deaths, Dudley resigned.
