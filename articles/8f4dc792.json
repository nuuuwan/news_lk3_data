    "Calls on voters in Jaffna to become part of broad national movement for change being demanded by all communities in SL",
    "Urges them to support NPP and not vote against positive change sought by entire country",
    "Emphasises need for unity and national cohesion, promising to establish Govt. that treats all citizens equally and does not engage in transactional politics",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) presidential hopeful Anura Kumara Dissanayake made a direct appeal to voters in Jaffna on Thursday, urging them to support the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) and join the broader national movement for change. \u201cPeople around the country, including Sinhalese, Muslims, and Tamils, are demanding a transformation,\u201d he said.",
    "He criticised the Tamil National Alliance\u2019s decision to support Sajith Premadasa, claiming it was against the desire for change expressed by the electorate in the South.",
    "Dissanayake made these comments while attending a rally held in Jaffna on Thursday. He also addressed public gatherings in Kilinochchi and Vavuniya on the day.",
    "Dissanayake emphasised the need for unity and national cohesion, promising to establish a Government that treats all citizens equally under the law and does not engage in transactional politics.",
    "He urged the people of Jaffna to not vote against the positive change sought by the entire country. \u201cWe will win the elections. We will win in the South by millions. Jaffna must be a part of the victory,\u201d he concluded, promising a new era of political cooperation and development for all Sri Lankans.",
    "Dissanayake called for an end to what he described as \u201cthe politics of deceit\u201d and criticised President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa for their roles in previous Governments. He claimed that both leaders had betrayed the promises made in earlier elections and were continuing a corrupt and divisive political legacy.",
    "\u201cThe old politics that Sajith and Ranil represent is based on stoking racist sentiments,\u201d he said, pointing out that many members of the former ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have now aligned themselves with either Wickremesinghe or Premadasa. \u201cThe only party that opposed racism was the NPP. Will you choose those who represented racists or those who fought against racism?\u201d he asked the crowd.",
    "Dissanayake also highlighted his party\u2019s commitment to establishing a corruption-free Government. He accused both Wickremesinghe and Premadasa of being associated with corrupt practices; including the Central Bank bond scam and misuse of funds from the Central Cultural Fund. He promised that an NPP Government would punish corrupt persons and seize properties acquired through fraudulent means.",
    "Addressing the issue of national assets, he condemned his opponents for supporting the privatisation of public assets and failing to develop productive capacities in key industries. \u201cAre you going to choose the path of selling national assets, or will you choose us, who will protect and promote sovereignty?\u201d Dissanayake asked, mentioning recent attempts to sell lands in Mannar.",
    "The NPP candidate further accused his rivals of turning a blind eye to the country\u2019s growing drug problem, which he claimed was facilitated by politicians protecting drug lords. He promised that an NPP Government would eradicate the drug trade and ensure everyone is treated equally under the law.",
    "Dissanayake concluded by urging voters to reject the status quo and choose a new path that promises political, economic, and social change for the entire nation. He called on the people of Jaffna to be part of this transformation and to help build a future of unity and development for all Sri Lankans."
