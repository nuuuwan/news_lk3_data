    "The recent courtesy visit by The Colombo Plan to the Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary K.D.S.

    "Funded by the US State Department with support from the US Embassy in Sri Lanka, the MAP aims to upskill and reskill SLPA officials over a three-year period, commencing in 2024. The program will focus on enhancing the technical expertise of SLPA employees, particularly in managing smart ports and adopting modern port management practices.",
    "The comprehensive capacity-building program will encompass a variety of training methods, including technical exchanges, workshops, conferences, and port study exchange tours. Peer advisory missions will be conducted, featuring both local and international experts who will contribute to these initiatives. Their guidance will assist SLPA officials in enhancing client services and providing value-added services to the shipping community.",
    "The US Government\u2019s commitment to financing these activities is part of its ongoing support for Sri Lanka\u2019s training environment, with a focus on boosting the productivity and competitiveness of Sri Lankan ports. This will help position Sri Lanka\u2019s ports as key regional hubs in South Asia, aligning with the goal of modernising the nation\u2019s port infrastructure and services."
