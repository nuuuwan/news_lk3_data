    "As the Presidential election campaign draws to a close, the focus must shift from electoral competition to the urgent challenges facing the country. While the election outcome remains uncertain, what is clear is that the next President will inherit a country grappling with economic instability and deep-rooted problems of impunity and corruption. A pressing challenge that also needs to be at the forefront of the Government that is formed is the need to resolve the long-standing ethnic conflict through a sustainable political solution based on the devolution of power. The new President must prioritise this issue to bring lasting peace and unity to the country.",
    "Since independence, the failure to govern a multi-ethnic society with fairness and inclusion has led to decades of war and terrorism. These divisions have drained the country\u2019s economic and human resources, leaving scars that continue to hinder progress. A genuine political solution that acknowledges the aspirations of all communities is essential to rebuild trust and foster a sense of national belonging.\u00a0 In any political solution, the incoming President should ensure that the Malaiyaha Tamil Communities do not fall between the cracks, which they have endured since Sri Lanka gained independence seven decades ago.",
    "The three leading candidates have each demonstrated their ability to lead in various ways. However, to move the country forward, they must commit to addressing the ethnic conflict without putting the issue on the backburner. The new President, regardless of who wins, must demonstrate leadership by advancing a power-sharing arrangement that empowers Provincial Councils and ensures equitable representation for minority communities. Without political stability and ethnic harmony, the country will continue to struggle to attract the foreign investment and international partnerships it desperately needs.",
    "The next President needs to work across political, ethnic, and class lines to forge a new social contract that prioritises devolution, accountability, and inclusion. Only then can Sri Lanka move towards the future its people deserve \u2014 one marked by justice, equality, and lasting peace. The solution to the country\u2019s challenges lies not just in economic reform but in building a political framework that respects the rights and aspirations of all its citizens. Resolving the ethnic conflict through devolution is not just about governance but is also about economic recovery. The international community and all Sri Lankan citizens must support this effort."
