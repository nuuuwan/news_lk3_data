### Voting objectively on 21 September

*2024-09-13 05:14:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Voting-objectively-on-21-September/4-766705) · `en`

As the nation faces the task of electing a new President at a very crucial time among four leading candidates, all of whom have controversial pasts—whether due to own criminal acts, indirect involvement in criminality in the past, or by association with criminals within their own—decision is fraught with difficulty for the people. Hence, voters must weigh these candidates’ pasts against the hope for a better future. Unlike previous elections, if the wrong choice is made this time, voters themselves could share responsibility when the country faces another economic collapse.

### Election promises: Where’s the money?

*2024-09-13 05:09:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Election-promises-Where-s-the-money/4-766704) · `en`

Before you vote, consider how the promises in the manifestos will be

“Show me the money!” – Tom Cruise in the movie Jerry Maguire

The bottomline is money. How will the Government pay its bills: manage the debt mountain that has been accumulated; pay the salaries and pensions of the bloated bureaucracy and armed forces; and not least, the cost of the many new programs that are being promised as part of the bidding war that we call the Presidential election?

For example, both the SJB and the NPP are promising major housing initiatives, such as low-interest and long-repayment loans and official residences for State employees. Low-interest loans may be given by commercial or State banks, but the subsidy element will have to be borne by Government. Housing for State employees will have to be fully paid by the Government.

### Shallow manifestos and the 12-point economic challenge

*2024-09-13 05:05:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Shallow-manifestos-and-the-12-point-economic-challenge/4-766703) · `en`

Irrespective of who becomes President, implementation of any of these manifestos, as usual, would be impossible – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Election manifestos of all main contenders are out, and by and large it has followed the precedence over the last so many decades. Increase salaries for the public sector, lower PAYE tax, and long lists of prosperity. There is little indication as to how all these would be achieved, how much funds would be allocated to accomplish each task and how these funds would be obtained, etc.

There is a more recent tendency to show lengthy 200, 300 page manifestos to give the impression of a detailed study. On the contrary, although the problems are complex, a truly detailed analysis should result in a short, concise and simple action plan which is implementable. Complex, lengthy solutions are unlikely to be implemented and what could be achieved in a period of five years is limited (remember the infamous lengthy Budget speech of 2015?).

Excessive money printing is harmful to the economy as it could fuel inflation caused by too much money chasing too few goods, and destabilise the economy

An evaluation one year into implementation of Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act

Printing money to finance Government budget deficit (also called monetary financing) has been a major concern in recent years in Sri Lanka

The fiscal consolidation program, initiated under the IMF-EFF arrangement in 2023, has supported to improve Government financing, and carry out Government functions without monetary financing

There is a growing market in the Maldives for Lankan products, particularly in the tourism, agriculture, food processing, textiles, and construction materials industries, but local exporters faced various constraints in tapping into this, a trade body has said.

The two Indian Ocean island nations are heavily reliant on tourism and foreign exchange earnings.

“We all recognise that Sri Lanka needs foreign exchange, but the current situation feels like squeezing a patient’s neck and asking them to breathe,” Sri Lanka-Maldives Business Council President Sudesh Mendis said.

### Exterminators 352% increase in profit before tax

*2024-09-13 04:19:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Exterminators-352-increase-in-profit-before-tax/34-766685) · `en`

Exterminators PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier pest management and environmental technology company, has remarkably demonstrated financial resilience during FY24, achieving notable profitability despite prevailing economic challenges. The company reported a staggering 167% increase in net profit and an extraordinary 352% rise in profit before tax, alongside a 143% growth in operating profit compared to the previous fiscal year. Notably, while overall sales dipped by 7%, revenue from service activities saw a modest increase of 3%. This commendable performance, however, was not without its hurdles. A significant decline of 85% in revenue from international brands can be attributed to stringent import restrictions and diminished consumer purchasing power, primarily due to economic instability. The impact of increased corporate tax, along with the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) and (SSCL), further exacerbated the challenges.

“There was one daily newspaper in the Ivory Coast, at least, only one came my way. It was called Fraternite’ Matin. Every day on its front page, in the top left -hand corner, it carried a ‘thought” of the President’s. The thoughts were mainly about development and the economy; and so were big front- page stories” – The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro – VS Naipaul

Of all the extra-parliamentary convulsions that have happened all too regularly in this country since independence, the mass protest movement which occurred two years ago, commonly referred to as the ‘aragalaya’ (struggle?), is certainly unique.

The ‘aragalaya’ was primarily against a popularly elected President, who was relatively new in office then. That fact alone is not exceptional in this troubled country, in our recent history there have been several large scale uprisings against elected governments, even new governments, the 1971 April insurrection being one example.
