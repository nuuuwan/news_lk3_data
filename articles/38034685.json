    "In the early 1990s, as the General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) and its Catering Company, which handled all event catering at Sri Lanka\u2019s national convention centre, the BMICH, I found myself deeply immersed in sales and promotion. I worked closely the sales team to drive the hotel\u2019s success. Together, we developed strategies to boost room sales, group bookings, and special events, ensuring that MLH remained a top destination in the country.",
    "The hotel industry is all about creating unique experiences, and I made it my mission to promote MLH\u2019s food festivals, stage productions, and other special events. I took the lead in media briefings and public relations campaigns, forming close working relationships with advertising agents to get the message out. My efforts extended to reimagining the iconic \u201cLittle Hut\u201d nightclub, which quickly became the most popular night club in Sri Lanka during the early \u201990s.",
    "As Managing Director of the International Hotel School (IHS), I also managed the school\u2019s public relations and strengthened our connections with international partners and accreditors. Every year, I visited leading institutions such as:",
    "The Hotel and Catering International Management Association (HCIMA) in the UK,",
    "I was fortunate enough to be a Visiting Professor at IMI in 1991 and 1992, and I also lectured as part-time summer faculty at Schiller. These international collaborations helped put IHS on the map, giving our students access to a world of opportunities.",
    "My time with MLH was busy but rewarding. I worked closely with three key colleagues\u2014Chairman Sanath Ukwatte, Front Office Manager Kevin Siebel, and Sales Manager Ranjaka de Mel\u2014on room sales and group bookings, both in Sri Lanka and across Europe. Every year, I joined the Chairman at three major travel trade shows in Europe, which were essential for securing MLH\u2019s annual contracts with tour operators. These were:",
    "World Travel Market (WTM) in London in November \u2014 since 1980, one of the most influential travel and tourism event globally,",
    "Borza Internazionale de Turismo (BIT) in Milan in February \u2014 since 1980, the largest tourism fair in Italy,",
    "Internationale Tourismus-B\u00f6rse (ITB) in Berlin in March \u2014 since 1966, the largest travel trade show in the world.",
    "These travel trade shows were not just about business\u2014they were about building relationships. Sanath Ukwatte, my boss, was a generous leader with an impressive network of travel industry decision-makers. After long days of negotiations, we would join our Sri Lankan colleagues from the travel and hotel sectors for lively evenings in London, Milan, and Berlin, fostering camaraderie and celebrating our shared successes.",
    "While work was intense, I made sure to carve out time to explore the cultural riches of Europe. After the travel fairs, I would often take a few days to revisit other cities like Rome, Florence, Munich, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Zurich, Luzern, Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge. These trips gave me a chance to connect with old friends and immerse myself in Europe\u2019s rich history and culture.",
    "In 1993, I received an unexpected invitation that became one of the highlights of my career\u2014a chance to attend a session of the British House of Commons from the visitor\u2019s gallery. This invitation came from Betty Boothroyd, a friend I had made years earlier while hosting her at The Lodge Habarana in 1985. By 1992, Betty had made history by becoming the first female Speaker of the House of Commons.",
    "I sent her a congratulatory message, and she graciously invited me to visit her at Westminster. The following year, during a trip to England, she hosted me for lunch at the House of Commons. It was a day I will never forget.",
    "Upon my return to Sri Lanka, news of my visit to the House of Commons reached the Chairman of Galle Face Hotel, Mr. Cyril Gardiner. He was so impressed by the experience that he invited me, my wife, and my son to stay at his hotel for a break from my busy schedule at MLH. Mr. Gardiner made sure we were treated like royalty, offering us the best suites and waiving all charges. During one of our conversations, he said, \u201cChandana, if you ever decide to leave MLH, I would like to hire you to manage the Galle Face Hotel.\u201d It was a flattering offer, to say the least.",
    "Around the same time, another surprising opportunity arose from an old school friend, Imthiaz Bakeer Marker, who had become a Member of the Sri Lankan Parliament. Imthiaz asked me, \u201cChandana, it is great that you got an opportunity to visit the House of Commons in England. Have you ever visited the Sri Lankan parliament?\u201d When I said that I haven\u2019t he was disappointed. He invited me to lunch and to attend a session of Parliament from the visitor\u2019s gallery\u2014a rare chance that I was excited to accept.",
    "These experiences, while unrelated to the day-to-day responsibilities of running a hotel, shaped my understanding of leadership and international relations. They also connected me with individuals whose influence would ripple through my professional journey.",
    "One of the most memorable international connections I made was with Tony and Mignonne Fernando, who were part of the legendary band The Jetliners. In 1991, they were the resident band at the Regent Hong Kong, which had just been ranked the best hotel in the world. During their visit to Sri Lanka, I hosted them to dinner at MLH, and they were impressed by my international work and my stints as a management observer at top hotels. Tony surprised me with an incredible offer: a two-week management observer opportunity at the Regent Hong Kong. I didn\u2019t hesitate to accept.",
    "My time at the Regent was invaluable. I attended management meetings and shadowed various departments, gaining insights into the meticulous operations of a world-class hotel. I also accompanied Tony and Mignonne to meetings with event planners and catering managers, where they coordinated the entertainment to match the theme of each event. It was inspiring to see how music and hospitality were seamlessly intertwined to create unforgettable guest experiences.",
    "At Westminster with Betty Boothroyd Speaker of the House of Commons",
    "Following my time in Hong Kong, I travelled to the Philippines and stayed at the iconic Manila Hotel. There, I had the opportunity to observe the hotel\u2019s operations and was introduced to several talented Filipino musicians. This led to negotiations to bring some of them to perform at MLH. The Manila Hotel experience also indulged my love for chess, as I witnessed a major chess tournament being held in the hotel\u2019s banquet hall. It was a rare treat to watch the moves of chess champions displayed on a giant wall, with hundreds of fans following the action.",
    "I also attended the Food Asia trade show in Singapore, the largest food and hospitality event in Asia. The show, which included the prestigious Culinary Challenge, was a great way to stay updated on the latest industry trends. Singapore\u2019s efficiency and organization impressed me, and I enjoyed visiting Sentosa Island during my stay.",
    "Another learning opportunity came from the Bangkok Hilton in Thailand. My wife and I frequently visited Thailand, and during one trip, I arranged to spend five days as a Management Observer at the hotel. Their General Manager graciously allowed me to attend morning briefings and observe operations in various departments. This experience provided me with fresh ideas and perspectives on hotel management.",
    "As my global travels continued, I realized that one key destination had eluded me\u2014the United States. Encouraged by the General Manager of the Bangkok Hilton, who was American, I finally made plans to visit the USA and Canada. In 1993, my wife, son, and I spent six weeks exploring cities across both countries, marking yet another chapter in my journey of discovery and professional growth.",
    "Each of these experiences, from London to Hong Kong and beyond, shaped my understanding of the hospitality industry and broadened my global perspective. These travels were not just about business\u2014they were about forging connections, seizing opportunities, and learning from the best in the world.",
