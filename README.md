The program is spearheaded by Akshata, which is the first brand in Sri Lanka to acquire and master the technology to produce fortified rice kernels efficiently and cost-effectively.

### Trump’s transparency and opportunities for Global South

*2024-11-28 02:58:23* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Trump-s-transparency-and-opportunities-for-Global-South/4-769794) · `en`

One of the main challenges of a Trump presidency is the prospect of a strong and sustained rally for the US dollar. This would naturally place inflationary pressures on import-dependant countries like Sri Lanka, while driving interest rates up due to the institutionalisation of an inflation-targeting Central Bank. Most worrying is that a stronger dollar will impact Sri Lanka’s foreign debt burden, making raising revenue to repay debts much more challenging

In 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad quipped that Donald Trump was the best US President, “not because his policies are good, but because he’s the most transparent president.” In some ways, it is better to have a foe who dispenses with the pretences of human rights and democracy, and says outright: “We want the oil”, “America first”.

### Price of inaction: Sexual harassment’s toll on Sri Lanka’s economy

Companies need to make institutional policy changes in order to ensure that their workplace is conducive for women to enter and advance in the workforce

Tackling workplace harassment in Sri Lanka is not just a social responsibility but an economic imperative. To secure future economic growth, the Government and employers must cooperate to enact and enforce policies that address harassment comprehensively. Change is only effective if meaningful. This is why we need clear legislative reform, employer-driven measures, and effective policies. The cost of inaction measured in lost productivity, turnover, and absenteeism—is simply too high for Sri Lanka’s economy to bear

### Domestic abuse in Sri Lanka: Hidden epidemic

*2024-11-28 02:44:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Domestic-abuse-in-Sri-Lanka-Hidden-epidemic/4-769792) · `en`

It’s also important to recognise that abuse isn’t always physical. Emotional and financial abuse are often the most insidious forms, leaving scars that can’t be seen but take the longest to heal. Emotional abuse erodes self-esteem and isolates victims, while financial abuse traps them by controlling resources, making it nearly impossible for them to break free. These forms of abuse thrive in silence, perpetuating a cycle of control and helplessness

Domestic abuse is not new to Sri Lanka, but in recent years, it has spiralled into an undeniable crisis. Globally, domestic violence surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Sri Lanka saw a significant spike too. The Women and Child Development Ministry reported over a 35% increase in complaints to the 1938 Women’s Helpline in the early months of the pandemic. Yet these numbers barely scratch the surface of the true scale of abuse happening behind closed doors.

The NPP won three of the six seats in Jaffna described as the cultural capital of the Sri Lankan Tamils. The November 14 electoral verdict indicated that this  Tamil nationalist fort has been breached and even overwhelmed by a Sinhala dominated nationalist party for the first time in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history.

### The Tamil people had no other choice but to turn to the NPP because there was no political force among them that could lead them on a practical and sensible political path as an alternative to the Tamil parties.

*2024-11-28 00:54:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=85138) · `en`

Among the many historic ‘firsts’ that the November 2024 Parliamentary Elections witnessed, two achievements by the National People’s Power (NPP) have evinced the most attention.

The NPP’s landslide victory marks the first time since the introduction of the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system in Sri Lanka that a single party or alliance has won a two-thirds majority in Parliament.

The NPP has won all but one of the 22 electoral districts in the country. What is particularly noteworthy about this victory is that the NPP has won more seats in all five electoral districts in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, except Batticaloa. The same is true in districts where  Malaiyaha (hill country) Tamils live in large numbers.

For the first time, a Sinhalese-majority political party has won most of the seats in the districts of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, including the Jaffna District, which was considered a ‘fortress’ of Tamil nationalist politics.

Under a single policy interest rate mechanism, it is easier for the Central Bank to communicate its monetary policy stance to financial markets, the public, and other stakeholders

The Central Bank formally announced its transition to a single policy interest rate mechanism, effective 27 November 2024. This marks a significant milestone in the evolution of monetary policy in Sri Lanka. A single policy interest rate mechanism enhances the clarity of the Central Bank’s monetary policy stance by establishing a clear target for overnight interbank call market interest rates. Under this mechanism, the Central Bank introduced the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) as its primary monetary policy tool to signal and operationalise its monetary policy stance. This transition is expected to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of monetary policy signalling and transmission to the financial markets and the broader economy.

The Aragalaya can now be declared over. What some elements of the population sought to do – bulldoze Parliament – has been achieved via the popular vote

Sri Lankans say they have short memories. But the 2024 elections show otherwise

The Aragalaya or the struggle started in March 2022 and ended in November 2022 with the ouster and resignation of then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It was the result of deep and unprecedented public anger at the events of the previous year when in 2021 there was a complete breakdown of the economy, fuel and electricity and cooking gas were not available and people were in dire straits due to high double digit inflation. Sri Lanka then declared bankruptcy and till Indian assistance came in form of a much needed dollar infusion plus a good word with the IMF, Sri Lanka seemed to be on the brink.

### Political sociology of JVP-NPP avalanche, establishment collapse and Opposition free-fall

The most memorable visual image of Sri Lanka’s new Parliamentary session, the first to be opened by newly-elected leftwing President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was also the moment that best symbolized the primarily progressive character or aspect of his presidency and the JVP-NPP victory. It is when he opened his car door unaided, stepped out of it in the same outfit he wore as an MP, and beamed. That, and dispensing with religio-cultural rituals that always precede or accompany such occasions here, though not in any legislature of a Republic anywhere else, extended the promise of the first fully modern Sri Lanka presidency and administration.
