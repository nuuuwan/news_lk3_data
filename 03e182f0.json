  "original_body_lines": [
    "The United Nations Human Rights Council on Wednesday approved a disputed resolution on religious hatred in the wake of the burning of a Quran in Sweden, prompting concern by Western states who say it challenges long-held practices in rights protection.",
    "The resolution, introduced by Pakistan on behalf of the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), calls for the U.N. rights chief to publish a report on religious hatred and for states to review their laws and plug gaps that may \u201cimpede the prevention and prosecution of acts and advocacy of religious hatred.\u201d",
    "It was strongly opposed by the United States and the European Union, who say it conflicts with their view on human rights and freedom of expression. While condemning the burning of the Quran, they argued the OIC initiative was designed to safeguard religious symbols rather than human rights.",
    "An Iraqi immigrant to Sweden burned the Quran outside a Stockholm mosque last month, sparking outrage across the Muslim world and demands by Muslim states for action.",
    "The vote\u2019s outcome marks a major defeat for Western countries at a time when the OIC has unprecedented clout in the council, the only body made up of governments to protect human rights worldwide.",
    "Twenty-eight countries voted in favour, 12 voted against, and seven countries abstained. Representatives of some countries clapped after the resolution passed.",
    "Marc Limon, director of the Geneva-based Universal Rights Group, said the outcome showed \u201cthe West is in full retreat at the Human Rights Council.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re increasingly losing support and losing the argument,\u201d he said.",
    "Michele Taylor, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said the United States\u2019 concerns about the initiative \u201cwere not taken seriously.\u201d",
    "\u201cI believe with a little more time and more open discussion, we could have also found a way forward together on this resolution,\u201d she said.",
    "After the vote, Pakistan\u2019s Permanent Representative to the U.N. in Geneva, Khalil Hasmi, accused the West of \u201clip service\u201d to their commitment to prevent religious hatred.",
    "\u201cThe opposition of a few in the room has emanated from their unwillingness to condemn the public desecration of the Holy Quran or any other religious book,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThey lack political, legal and moral courage to condemn this act, and it was the minimum that the Council could have expected from them.\u201d"
