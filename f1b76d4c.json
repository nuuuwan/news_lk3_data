    "Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to support Sweden\u2019s bid to join Nato, the military alliance\u2019s chief Jens Stoltenberg says.",
    "He said the Turkish leader would forward Sweden\u2019s bid to parliament in Ankara and \u201censure ratification\u201d.",
    "Meanwhile, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said: \u201cI am very happy, it is a good day for Sweden.\u201d",
    "Turkey had previously spent months blocking Sweden\u2019s application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants.",
    "As one of Nato\u2019s 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group.",
    "Reacting to the news, US President Joe Biden said he welcomed the commitment by President Erdogan to proceed with \u201cswift ratification\u201d.",
    "\u201cI stand ready to work with President Erdogan and Turkey on enhancing defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Kristersson and Sweden as our 32nd Nato ally,\u201d a White House statement said.",
    "German Foreign Minister Annalen Baerbock tweeted: \u201cAt 32, we\u2019re all safer together.\u201d British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Sweden joining would \u201cmake us all safer\u201d.",
    "Mr Stoltenberg announced the agreement late on Monday following talks between the Turkish and Swedish leaders in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius.",
    "The Nato chief described it as a \u201chistoric step\u201d, but stressed that a \u201cclear date\u201d could not be given for when Sweden would join the military alliance - as this relied on the Turkish parliament.",
    "Sweden and its eastern neighbour Finland - both nations with a long history of wartime neutrality - announced their intention to join Nato in May last year, several months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland formally joined in April.",
    "Mr Stoltenberg said Turkey and Sweden had addressed \u201cTurkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns\u201d and as a result Sweden had amended its constitution, changed its laws, expanded its counter-terrorism operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party) and resumed arms exports to Turkey.",
    "Turkey and Hungary are currently the only two Nato members yet to ratify Sweden\u2019s membership application.",
    "Asked about opposition from Budapest, Mr Stoltenberg said that \u201cHungary has made it clear that they will not be the last to ratify\u201d.",
    "Earlier on Monday, President Erdogan had also appeared to link Turkish support for Sweden\u2019s Nato bid to the EU re-opening frozen membership talks with Ankara.",
    "EU officials were quick to reject the demand, saying those were two separate issues.",
    "But in a statement after the deal was announced, Nato said Sweden would actively support efforts to \u201creinvigorate Turkey\u2019s EU accession process\u201d and this would include \u201cmodernisation of the EU-T\u00fcrkiye customs union and visa liberalisation\u201d.",
    "Turkey first applied to join the EU way back in 1987, but its drift towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan brought the accession process to a halt.",
    "However since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Mr Erdogan has also played a unique role as a Nato leader with influence in Moscow.",
    "He helped broker last year\u2019s Black Sea Grain Initiative, which enables Ukraine to export agricultural products from its ports.",
    "Turkey has helped the keep the deal alive, despite frequent Russian threats to withdraw.",
    "But Turkey has also angered the Kremlin by supplying armed drones to Ukraine.",
    "Russian officials were also furious at the weekend when Turkey, in a surprise move, allowed five former commanders of the Ukrainian garrison at Mariupol to fly back to Kyiv at the end of a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",
    "Under the terms of a prisoner exchange last year, Russia expected the men to remain in Turkey until the end of the war.",
    "The two-day Nato summit kicks off in Vilnius on Tuesday and Ukraine\u2019s membership bid will be high on the agenda.",
    "All alliance members agree that Ukraine cannot join the bloc during the war - amid fears this would lead to a direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.",
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself said he does not expect membership until after the war - but he wants the summit to give a \u201cclear signal\u201d on Ukraine\u2019s bid.",
    "Several Nato members in Eastern Europe are pressing for a fast-track membership for their neighbour but others, including the US and Germany, are seen as more hesitant.",
    "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday warned that Ukraine\u2019s membership of Nato would have \u201cnegative consequences for the entire security architecture, which is half destroyed as it is in Europe\u201d.",
    "Ukrainian membership would \u201crepresent an absolute danger, threat to our country, which will require of us a quite firm and clear reaction\u201d, Mr Peskov said."
