  "original_body_lines": [
    "In connection with the \u201cBait of ruble and shadow of war: Sri Lanka\u2019s mercenary scandal\u201d publication by Roy Denish in the \u201cWeekend Financial Times\u201d on 26 July 2025, the Russian Embassy would like to point out the following.",
    "The said article is evidently of a contract nature and is likely to be lavishly remunerated by foreign donors. It includes a number of false statements. Sri Lankan volunteers taking part in the Russian Special Military Operation were informed on all terms, conditions and privileges of the service while signing contracts with the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.",
    "The Russian Federation treats with deep respect the heroic feat of Sri Lankan citizens fighting against the Nazism supported by the West. Our country completely fulfils and will continue to fulfil its commitments in relation to the military men and their families.",
    "The Embassy also noticed that the article\u2019s author\u2019s photo is published on the background of the Ukrainian flag colours. By this R. Denish fully disgraced his opus exposing himself as an accomplice of the terrorist Kiev regime. In this connection it would be interesting to read in the same newspaper an article on those Sri Lankan citizens who fight for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That would confirm the impartiality of information of the said newspaper.",
    "Regarding the unscrupulous local recruiters the Embassy assumes that the activity of such structures must be regulated by the Sri Lankan legislation and its violations must be investigated by Sri Lankan law-enforcement agencies."
