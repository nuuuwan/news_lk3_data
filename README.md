The Nepal Army has advised all foreign nationals who are stranded or require assistance in Nepal to contact nearby security personnel or authorities.

A semblance of normalcy returned to Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, today (10) after two days of massive protests that turned violent following the deaths of 19 people, mostly youth, on Monday.

The Nepal Army then took charge of security, with military personnel deployed across the capital. Over the past two days, protests in Nepal escalated quickly into violence and the storming of government buildings.

The Army said in a statement, ‘Hotels, tourism operators, and other organizations hosting foreign nationals are also requested to coordinate and facilitate any rescue or support efforts as needed.’

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism requested all Sri Lankan nationals in Nepal to remain vigilant and adhere to the advice of local authorities in view of the prevailing situation.

Donald Trump has called on the European Union (EU) to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% to force Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials on Tuesday discussing options to increase economic pressure on Russia, a source familiar with the discussions has told the BBC.

Trump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on “day one” of becoming president, is struggling to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv and as Russia’s strikes on Ukraine intensify.

Separately, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he plans to talk to Putin on a call this week or early next week.

China and India are major buyers of Russian oil, which helps to keep the country’s economy and war machine afloat.

Last month, the US imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, which included a 25% penalty for its transactions with Russia.
