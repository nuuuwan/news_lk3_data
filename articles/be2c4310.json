This certification, which reflects a commitment to regenerative agriculture practices, signifies a paradigm shift in the way tea is produced, consumed, and perceived on the global stage.",

    "He added: \u201cWe regularly assess this biodiversity and monitor the health of the environment, including rich catchment areas for major rivers, natural forests within the plantation landscape, and a mix of crop varieties with forest reservations. To witness with evidence, referring to the recent scientific data and research findings, approximately 90% endemic bird species identified within plantation landscape of KVPL and more importantly about 85% of endemic bird species can be identified in Halgolla.\u201d",
    "\u201cOf the 251 floral species and 310 faunal species identified from research by IUCN- SL, approximately 36% and 39 % are endemic species, respectively. There is a lot more scientific evidence on threatened, critically endangered floral and faunal species found within a landscape of a 200 ft to 3500 ft elevation which is a unique feature to explain the rich biodiversity of Halgolla.\u201d",

    "Senior Policy Advisor-Agriculture, embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands \u2013 Sri Lanka, Nishan Dissanayake told The Island Financial Review that regenerative agriculture prioritizes environmental health and sustainability over high yielding mono cropping agriculture. \u201cThis is therefore a different value chain. This is not the traditional tea value chain. The main challenge for these emerging eco based value chains is under-developed markets. And lack of market connections due to poorly developed policies, he said.",
    "\u2018Fortunately, I see that EU has taken many measures to tackle these issues and the EU market is becoming an attractive market for these environmentally value added products. In December 2023, EU legislators reached a provisional deal on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). This law require large businesses to identify and address their impacts on people and planet. There is a process to follow to ensure human rights and environmental due diligence. This is the most ambitious legislation in the world so far to oblige bigger companies, both inside and outside of the EU, to take responsibility for the impact of their activities on human rights and the environment. Ultimately, this law will create and facilitate the market in the EU for the products produced in environmentally sustainable ways, Dissanayake said.",
