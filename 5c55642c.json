    "After the altercation between Australian players and spectators in the Lord\u2019s Long Room during the fifth day of the 2nd Ashes Test, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has suspended three members who will not be permitted back at the venue pending an investigation into their alleged behaviour.",
    "Cricket Australia had complained after visuals of Australian cricketers Usman Khawaja and David Warner exchanging words with the members at the Long Room emerged. CA called for an investigation following which MCC released a statement condemning the incident.",
    "\u201cMCC can confirm it has suspended three Members identified from earlier today,\" a spokesperson said. \u201cThey will not be permitted back to Lord\u2019s whilst the investigation takes place and were informed of this by MCC Chief Executive, Guy Lavender, this evening.\"",
    "\u201cWe maintain that the behaviour of a small number of Members was completely unacceptable and whilst there was no suggestion by Pat Cummins in the post-match press conference that there was any physical altercation, it remains wholly unacceptable to behave in such a way, which goes against the values of the Club. MCC condemns the behaviour witnessed and once again we re-iterate our apology to Cricket Australia.",
    "The dismissal of Jonny Bairstow in the morning session seems to have sparked the incident with fans at the venue booing Australian team.",
    "A CA spokesperson earlier said the team management has requested MCC to investigate \u2018several incidents\u2019 involving spectators in the Long Room during the lunch break as Australian players were returning to the dressing room.",
    "\u201cAustralian management has requested the Marylebone Cricket Club [MCC] investigate several incidents involving spectators in the members area during lunch on day five of the Lord\u2019s Test. It is alleged players and staff from the Australian team were verbally abused, with some being physically contacted, as they made their way to lunch through the members area,\" CA said.",
    "Before suspending the members, MCC had issued an apology to the Australian team for the behaviour.",
    "\u201cThe Long Room is unique in world cricket and the great privilege of players passing through the pavilion is very special. After this morning\u2019s play, emotions were running high, and words were unfortunately exchanged with some of the Australian team, by a small number of members,\" MCC said in a statement.",
    "\u201cWe have unreservedly apologised to the Australian team and will deal with any member who has not maintained the standard we expect through our disciplinary processes. It was not necessary to eject anyone from the ground and I am pleased to say that there was no repeat of this as the players resumed the field for this afternoon\u2019s session,\" it added.
