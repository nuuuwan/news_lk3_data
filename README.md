The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the ongoing operation with the media.

Marketing “Laxapana” dry cell batteries and ‘De Alwis’ was our advertising agency. When we launched “Fuji” batteries, as a very young marketing professional, strategic level advice received by visionary leader ‘Renton’ was unmatchable.
