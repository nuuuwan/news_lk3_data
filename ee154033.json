    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial banks, whose stocks soared after the government announced a domestic debt restructuring (DDR) programme, must bring down lending rates and pass on the benefit to entrepreneurs and others, opposition legislator Harsha de Silva said.",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP told reporters on Sunday July 09 that, as a result of the banks being left out of the DDR programme, bank shares traded in the stock market surged by 20 to 25 percent immediately after the plan was announced.",
    "\u201cShareholders of these banks gain massive profits. They have a duty to pass on some relief to entrepreneurs who obtain credit from these banks,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "\u201cIf banks don\u2019t bring down interest rates, the central bank must intervene. They can\u2019t earn profits unfairly,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s stock surged around 4.5 percent in the first hour of trading last Tuesday July 04 as markets opened after the DDR excluded banks and other bondholders besides the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF). Banks stocks led the surge.",
    "The MP, who also chairs the parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (COPF), said banks were \u201ctotally left out\u201d of the DDR programme with no burden on them whatsoever because banks \u201capparently had various things to do\u201d.",
    "It would be extremely unfair of the shareholders alone to be the beneficiaries of the move, he said.",
    "After the central bank cut policy interest rates by 200 basis points 12.00 percent and 11.00 percent last week, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe has said that the banking and financial sector must pass on the benefits of the reduction of policy interest rates thus far and the reduction of interest rate risk premia to businesses and individuals without delay.",
    "If the reduction by banks was deemed inadequate and sluggish, the central bank said it will consider taking \u201cappropriate administrative measures to ensure the timely and adequate passthrough of accommodative monetary policy\u201d.",
    "MP de Silva said the opposition expects the central bank chief to carry through his promise of regulatory action.",
    "\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, we, on behalf of all entrepreneurs, will take this into our hands. We will not allow any injustice in this regard,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP also reiterated his party\u2019s position that it was opposed to the DDR laying a heavier burden on the EPF and ETF, a move that Governor Weerasinghe has defended.",
    "\u201cThere is no better solution that is fair by everyone,\u201d Weerasinghe said, speaking at the central bank\u2019s monthly monetary policy review press conference last Thursday July 06.",
    "The governor added that the majority\u2019s existing bank deposits also have to be taken into consideration.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re a member of the EPF, is it important to you to protect your existing funds to live now or to protect your future pension? To protect your pension, you have to live now,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIf there was a bank run, everyone including EPF members would lose what they currently have as well as their EPF,\u201d he added.",
    "The government\u2019s DDR plan, as it exists now, balances these two scenarios and strives to protect the assets of all citizens, according to Weerasinghe.",
    "\u201cYou have to consider the entire picture. Anyone is welcome to make alternative proposals, but we have so far not seen any other equitable proposal.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for anyone to nitpick and mislead the public. That\u2019s all I have to say,\u201d he said.",
