  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Speaker and Member of Parliament Asoka Ranwala emphasized that the government can only provide proper benefits to the society and beneficiaries if successful businessmen pay taxes properly.",
    "Speaking during an event held yesterday (Jan.1), he also explained that the government faced a serious crisis in the past due to the inability to collect tax revenue. He further added that businessmen who use their own money for welfare activities should be praised.",
    "\u201cOnly when successful businessmen contribute their fair share of tax can society truly benefit. However, we have experienced a significant tragedy in the past due to the inability to collect these taxes,\u201d he stated.",
    "Referring to the country\u2019s financial struggles, the MP continued, \u201cEveryone knows that our treasury was nearly depleted. During that time, the President made a strong effort to provide school books and uniforms to children. Yet, when this matter was raised in Parliament, it was met with distractions and chaos. This brought the entire Parliament into a very poor situation.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf the members of Parliament had not acted with great discipline at that time, these books and uniforms would not have been provided to the children this year. In such a situation, when the government was trying to provide school uniforms and books to children, we should commend a private businessman from Biyagama for sacrificing his personal wealth for social needs,\u201d he added."
