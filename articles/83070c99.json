This event was designed not only to recognize the achievements of these students but also to provide them and their families with guidance and reassurance as they prepare to embark on a new chapter of their lives.",

The event featured a series of informative and engaging sessions focused on helping students navigate the practical and emotional aspects of international relocation.",
