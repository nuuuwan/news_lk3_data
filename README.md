That may come as a surprise, for, contrary to popular belief, same-sex relationships were culturally acceptable in the South Asian region and is not a Western concept points out Ruhaan Joshi, a Public Policy Practitioner from India.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Booms and air raid sirens sounded across Israel early Sunday after Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in an unprecedented revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. In Washington, President Joe Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down “nearly all” the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response.

The attack, less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in Syria that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building, marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Condemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France saying Iran “is risking a potential military escalation,” Britain calling the attack “reckless” and Germany saying Iran and its proxies “must stop it immediately.”

Since gaining independence, Sri Lanka has navigated a turbulent political landscape, swinging between left and right-wing ideologies until the early ’90s. Since then, the nation has largely sought a middle path. The prolonged  war, spanning nearly three decades, hampered development and progress but benefitted a segment from the nature of war economy.

However, 2009 marked a turning point with the war’s end, heralding an era of peace and offering Sri Lanka a golden opportunity to ascend to the ranks of developed nations. Country missed the bus, not necessarily due to known reasons but also the refusal to accept the fact the universal law ‘no one wins in a war’ and ‘All must benefit from peace’. This is history now.

Future potential thereafter has been overshadowed by a myriad of challenges.

Colombo, April 13 (Daily Mirror) -As the Sinhala and Tamil festive season approaches, environmentalists in Sri Lanka have sounded the alarm on the detrimental impact of fireworks on pets and wildlife.

According to Environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella, research indicates that fireworks not only disturb the peace of humans but also have profound effects on wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, including dogs and cats.

The loud explosions can cause birds to abandon their nests in fear, disrupting their habitats.

According to studies, animals have a far more acute sense of hearing than humans, making them particularly sensitive to the deafening blasts of fireworks.

With explosions reaching up to 190 decibels—far surpassing the threshold for human hearing damage at 75 decibels—the sound can induce anxiety, confusion and panic in animals.

Furthermore, researches suggest that up to 50 percent of dogs experience fear or anxiety during fireworks displays.
