    "The two aircraft undergoing C-checks will finally return to operations next week, a statement from SriLankan Airlines said.",
    "C--check is done to check the serviceability of the aircraft.",
    "The airline said once that is done, the current crisis will be eased off to a certain extent. It said more positive changes will be in the way of a short-term lease extension for an aircraft that was supposed to be returned, four replacement engines for Airbus A320 neo-aircraft on ground and the arrival of a newly leased Airbus A330, all of which would bump the SriLankan Airlines\u2019 fleet to about 20 aircraft.",
    "\u201cSriLankan Airlines has been managing with a reduced fleet of 15 as opposed to the intended 18 aircraft over the last two months, which has unfortunately impacted the airline\u2019s flight schedule and on-time performance. The good news is that this situation is expected to ease off by mid-July 2023.",
    "SriLankan had forecasted an aircraft shortage factoring in scheduled lease expirations, but the actual shortage was worsened by several unforeseen events. This includes the prolonged time being taken to complete annual \u2018C\u2019 checks on two SriLankan Airlines\u2019 aircraft due to the unavailability of components locally and the ongoing short supply of engines for Airbus A320neo aircraft in the global marketplace, the latter of which has caused 350 aircraft to be grounded worldwide. The airline also had had to delay the procurement process for new leases, due last year, in view of the country\u2019s economic situation."
