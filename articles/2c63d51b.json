    "Experts see major global growth potential for Sri Lanka\u2019s gem industry through targeted innovation, with China emerging as promising market for coloured gemstones",
    "South Asia\u2019s premier precious stone showcase, Gem Sri Lanka, is set to make a dazzling return from 7 to 10 January next year at the Cinnamon Bentota Beach, with a goal of taking the country global.",
    "Organised by the Chinafort Gem and Jewellery Traders Association (CGJTA), Gem Sri Lanka has become a significant platform to connect international buyers with Sri Lankan traders. Gem Sri Lanka 2025 is the second edition of the exhibition, with a diverse line-up of buyers from the USA, Europe, Russia, China, and across Asia.",
    "Gem Sri Lanka Chairman Hilmy Cassim said that unlike typical gem exhibitions, Gem Sri Lanka was a platform for Sri Lanka to demonstrate its mastery, production, and craftsmanship of fine gemstones to the global gem industry. This was to reinforce Sri Lanka\u2019s position in the global gem market, building it as a centre and hub for gem cutting and production, while elevating the exhibition to be above other fairs, he explained.",
    "\u201cOur first event this year was a resounding success and for the next year, we have seen remarkable growth. The number of booths has doubled with an impressive influx of new buyers showing interest. This reflects the rising global recognition of Gem Sri Lanka as an internationally acclaimed fair, particularly with Beruwala serving as a cutting centre for all kinds of coloured stones that come from every corner of Sri Lanka and across the globe.\u201d",
    "As the exhibition continues to attract a global audience, it also serves as a vital avenue to promote the tourism industry in Sri Lanka, inviting visitors to experience the island\u2019s rich culture and natural beauty alongside its renowned gemstone heritage.",
    "A key moment at the launch event was the introduction of the GSLFAIR application, a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind app in South Asia, created by the CGJTA\u2019s IT segment. This tool aims to streamline the trade process and connect buyers and sellers efficiently, reflecting the CGJTA\u2019s commitment to pioneering advancements in the gem industry.",
    "Speaking at the launch event, Western Province Governor Hanif Yusoof said that with current political and economic shifts, new opportunities were emerging for the gem industry to expand and position itself at the centre of the global market.",
    "Guild Institute of Gemology President Andy Lucas expressed similar views, explaining that the gem industry had potential to expand with the right practices and innovation. \u201cWhile our industry is small in terms of luxury products and in terms of the diamond industry, the kind of strength that we can create through cooperation, social media, and innovation can grow this industry in a huge way.\u201d",
    "Lucas explained that China was an interesting market to consider in growing Sri Lanka\u2019s gem and jewellery sectors globally. He highlighted the power of the large market of China and the influence it could have on the value of a stone, using examples like aquamarine and spinel that have fast become huge sellers in China.",
    "\u201cIn 2021, China surpassed the United States and India as the number one consumer of jewellery and watches. But coloured stones are only around 4.5% of that market. We can have a tremendous amount of growth, especially when you consider that many of what they think of as small cities in China have maybe 4 or 5 million people. Many of those cities in China really have no awareness of coloured gemstones yet. That is something that we can change together.\u201d",
    "He added that by building trust and confidence among consumers through collaboration, science, and research, the Sri Lankan gem industry could take advantage and conquer potential markets like China. Moreover, traders could also work together to change the attitudes towards certain gems that are already popular, such as royal blue gemstones, to promote other gemstones as well.",
    "\u201cAs we know, diamonds have faced a setback in the market and it has left a vacancy in natural gemstones. We can move into this vacancy, promoting sapphire and ruby for engagement ring stones, for tokens of love,\u201d he also suggested.",
    "Other notable speakers of the event include Trade, Commerce, Food Security, Cooperative Development, Industry, and Entrepreneurship Development Ministry Secretary M.M. Naimuddin, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ambassador to Sri Lanka Khalid bin Hamoud Alkahtani, and Russian Federation Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Levan S. Dzhagaryan.",
    "The successful launch of Gem Sri Lanka 2025 signals an exciting future for the country\u2019s gemstone industry, reinforcing Sri Lanka\u2019s status as a global leader in the gem trade and ensuring sustained momentum with future events scheduled into 2027."
