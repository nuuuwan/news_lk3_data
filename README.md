ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation is expected to be below 3 percent up to the first quarter of 2025 the central bank said, after maintaining inflation around the same levels in the past several months, breaching the lower level of a 5 percent inflation target.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has proposed a 5 percent inflation target, plus or minus two percent to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has apparently accepted it without question.

The agency now projects inflation, giving baseline forecasts and probable projected inflation.

“Given that the quarterly average inflation recorded during Q2-2024 was also below the target by more than 2 percentage points, the projections imply a possible breach of the inflation target, as stipulated in Section 26(5) of the CBA, on the downside in Q3-2024 for the first time, as inflation would have been below the target by more than 2 percentage points during two consecutive quarters,” the central bank said.

India faces significant challenges in navigating political upheavals across South Asia, highlighted by events like the overthrow of governments in Myanmar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. These events underscore the need for India to adopt a more nuanced diplomatic approach, engaging with a broader range of political actors and avoiding alignment with specific factions. Lessons learned include the importance of understanding local dynamics, supporting democratic processes, and maintaining relationships with all political stakeholders, regardless of their stance towards India. Additionally, India must balance its geopolitical interests with its commitment to regional cooperation and avoid being drawn into conflicts between larger powers.

Since the beginning of this decade, India has been shocking together after its abroad events.

The conspiracy in Myanmar in 2021 and the reign of the Taliban again in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Imran was overthrown in Pakistan in 2022. President Gotabhaya Rajapakse was chased away from power due to the agitation of the people in Sri Lanka.

The fall of the coalition government in Nepal had the same impact, while the President Soli government defeated the Maldivian elections with close ties with India.. Prime Minister Olayi's government, which has the lowest friendship with India.

Next, the Bangladesh People's Rebellion has suddenly chased Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from office. He has fled to India. Based on how India has been greatly confident on the Hasina government, India can realize the shock of India.

India has stumbled on how to have ties with those who take office after Hasina.

He was speaking to the media after the nomination papers held on Thursday (15) at the Elections Commission.

Tamil general candidate P. Ariyaderan is contesting in the Sangu symbol. The presidential election should be thought of on behalf of the Tamil people without thinking. This is a must.

### Harry Jayawardena: Hardnosed businessman with the softest heartbeat

Almost 20 years ago, I received a call from Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena. Of course, at the time I knew him as ‘Harry Jayawardena’ as did many SriLankans, especially in business circles. I was in England, veritably forced into exile by political circumstances which included the abduction and torture of the deputy editor of ‘The Nation,’ a newspaper published by Rivira Media Corporation, of which I was at the time the Managing Director, and a brutal attack on Upali Tennakoon, the editor of our sister newspaper in Sinhala. These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickrematunge implored me to leave the countryand not too long before he himself was killed.

It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didn’t give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didn’t count Harry among them.

### Elections, regime shift, and transformation of the State

The resulting battles will thus to a large degree continue to determine the ultimate significance of any regime that emerges in the immediate aftermath of the election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Elections offer an opportunity to measure the re-composition of social forces. New coalitions are tested, new alliances become possible, and ultimately there is a period of policy convergence. Under ideal circumstances, this process results in the consolidation of a new regime capable of governing over the long run. In a parliamentary democratic system, such a hegemonic bloc can accommodate the rotation of parties in and out of power. The clearest examples in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history, of course, are the ‘intermediate regime’ from 1956 to 1977 and the neoliberal ‘open economy’ that has characterised policy making from 1977 up to the present.
