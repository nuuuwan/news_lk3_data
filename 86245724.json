Baur & Co. (Pvt) Ltd, also more widely known as Baurs has been doing exactly the same uninterruptedly ever since its founder Alfred Baur stepped into this beautiful nation. Baurs are now a legacy with a presence in Sri Lanka for over 125 years and with an appetite to only grow stronger and more resilient than ever before.",
    "Amidst the numerous challenges and evolving contexts over the many decades, Baurs has been contributing tremendously to the sustainable growth and wellbeing of the nation, going through the agri, industrial and knowledge-era together. Owned by its parent, a foundation, Alfred et Eug\u00e9nie Baurs back at Geneva, Switzerland and with its values deeply rooted in its Swiss traditions, Baurs is truly Sri Lankan in every other way possible.",
