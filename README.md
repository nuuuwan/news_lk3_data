### The 1956 election landslide and SWRD BandaranaikeтАЩs tenure (1956 тАФ 1959)

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar, memoirs of  Bradman Weerakoon)

My acquaintance with S W R D Bandaranaike was only through the press reports of his election campaign. That was before he came to the prime ministerтАЩs office in the Fort (now housing the foreign ministry at Republic Square), on an April morning, after the swearing in of his Cabinet at QueenтАЩs House. His eloquence as a speaker, especially his Independence Day speech in 1948, was deeply imprinted in my mind.

Throughout a gruelling campaign he had shown extraordinary skills of perseverance in the face of severe odds, and the ability to persuade large masses of ordinary people to believe in his cause. I wondered how he would be to work with after I had experienced the rather easy going style of Sir John. There was also the serious business to be faced of how soon he would be able to make his election slogan of `Sinhala OnlyтАЩ as the official language in 24 hours come true?

The wrath of a nation can be a fearful thing. In 2022 we saw its evolution and culmination in our own тАЬAragalayaтАЬ, which sent the then president, a so called тАЬbattle hardenedтАЭ war veteran and тАЬwarrior-statesmanтАЭ, first in to exile and then to precipitate retirement.

We saw it again, just a couple of weeks ago, in the election of Sri LankaтАЩs ninth executive president, a villager from deeply rural Tambuttegama, the son of a surveyorтАЩs assistant. That he was the first student from Tambuttegama Central College to gain university entrance, is another factor which attests to the absence of privilege and personal resources. His election is also an extension of the тАЬAragalayaтАЭ, and a logical evolution of that movement, but without the drama and histrionics and, instead, that energy, that anger, legitimately channeled in to a quiet civic purpose.

In the last presidential election, Gajanayake pointed out that Abeysekera had joined a group of retired police officers who actively campaigned for the national People's Power (NPP) of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

He added that the upcoming parliamentary elections have been appointed only after the announcement of the upcoming parliamentary elections.

Gajanayake urged him to announce his appointment only after the first session of the new parliament after the general election, though he was considered a talented officer while in the service of Abeysekara.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs construction sector non-performing loans which peaked at 17.1 percent after a currency collapse, has eased to 14.1 percent despite a contraction in credit, according to the central bank data in a Financial Stability Review.

Construction investment credit is usually one of the big beneficiaries when central banks print money to target inflation or growth and collapse as soon as a тАШstabilization crisisтАЩ starts as inflation ceases to accelerate.

Central banks typically тАШcut ratesтАЩ by printing money through open market operations, buying back government bonds from banks, allowing them to give loans without deposits.  The exercise tends to worsen loan to deposit ratios.

In the last crisis however some foreign banks, sharply curtailed all credit, including interbank lending due higher risk perceptions including on government debt, where an actual default or induced artificial default from debt restructuring was feared.
