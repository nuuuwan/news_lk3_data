    "On Thursday (Jan.25), the Deiyandara Magistrate ordered that the 55-year-old named Saman Kumara be detained until tomorrow for further interrogations. Based on the information divulged by the suspect during questioning, the investigating officers managed to locate a motorcycle and a van linked to the perpetrators.",
