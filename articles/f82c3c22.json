    "Security has been tightened outside actor-politician Vijay\u2019s residence in Chennai after a stampede at his rally in Karur left 39 people, including 10 children and 16 women, dead on Saturday.",
    "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin described the incident as one of the state\u2019s worst tragedies in recent times and announced a judicial commission of inquiry led by retired High Court Justice Aruna Jagadeesan. He also chaired an emergency meeting of senior officials in Chennai to review the situation.",
    "The stampede occurred around 7.30 pm as thousands of people, who had been waiting since afternoon, surged forward while Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Vijay was addressing them from atop his campaign vehicle. Several people fainted due to heat, dehydration, and suffocation as they waited for hours in the sun for a glimpse of their favourite star. Videos from the spot showed boys breaking into huts and climbing out of their roofs in a frantic search for escape routes.",
    "Vijay had to halt his speech midway and later posted a statement on X, saying he was \u201cheart-broken\u201d and in \u201cunbearable pain\u201d over the Karur tragedy.",
    "In a message to his supporters on Sunday, Vijay said he was \u201cdeeply weighed down with sorrow\u201d and announced a compensation of Rs 20 lakh each to the families of those who died and Rs 2 lakh each to those injured. Calling the loss \u201cirreparable,\u201d he said no amount could ease the pain but assured that the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam would stand by the victims\u2019 families and extend all possible assistance. Vijay also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.",
    "Karur District Police have filed separate FIRs against Anand, the party\u2019s general secretary and considered the second-in-command, and Nirmal Kumar, the joint general secretary of TVK. Authorities have launched investigations into the role of the party leaders in the tragedy, which occurred as thousands of supporters surged forward during the rally.",
    "President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi expressed condolences. The Union Home Ministry has sought a report from the state government, while Shah spoke to Governor R N Ravi and CM Stalin, assuring all possible central assistance.",
    "Stalin, who visited Karur to meet the families of the victims and the injured, said, \u201cIn the history of our state, never has such a large number of people lost their lives in a program organised by a political party, and such a tragedy should never happen in the future either.\u201d He also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the families of the victims and Rs 1 lakh to those injured.",
    "President Murmu expressed anguish over the tragic loss of lives in the incident and extended her deepest condolences to the bereaved family members.",
    "PM Modi, condoling the deaths, said: \u201cThe unfortunate incident during a political rally in Karur, Tamil Nadu, is deeply saddening. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. Wishing strength to them in this difficult time. Praying for a swift recovery to all those injured.\u201d"
