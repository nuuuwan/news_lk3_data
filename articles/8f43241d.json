    "Former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, currently being held on remand over a scam where the Health Ministry procured a large stock of fake immunoglobulin on his watch as the Minister of Health, has been in arrears with house rent for four months, according to media reports. He has reportedly been occupying the official residence of the Central Province (CP) Chief Minister in Kandy since the arson attack on his private house in 2022. It has been reported that the rent for the Provincial Council property was deducted from Keheliya\u2019s ministerial salary and sent to the CP by the Ministry Secretaries, but there is no official to do as he has ceased to be a minister.",
    "The CP administration reportedly brought the situation to the notice of Parliament, seeking its intervention to recover the rent in arrears, only to be informed that it was not in a position to effect any deductions to the MPs\u2019 salaries by way of rent for houses that were not under its purview.",
    "Rambukwella\u2019s response to the allegation at issue was not immediately known, but there is no reason to doubt the veracity of the media reports because they are reportedly based on a letter the CP has sent to Parliament. So, how does the CP propose to recover what Rambukwella is said to owe it, nay the public? Does it give such kid-glove treatment to others who have defaulted on rent for its properties? Usually, a tenant is sued for the arrears of rent, and why this procedure has not been followed in respect of Rambukwella is the question. The CP ought to resort to legal action to recover the rent with arrears without further delay. The loss caused by the nonpayment of rent for the CM\u2019s house must not be passed on to the public.",
    "It must also be determined whether the rent Rambukwella agreed to pay for the CM\u2019s official residence is commensurate with the value of the property, which is prime real estate.",
    "Who granted permission for the CM\u2019s house belonging to the CP to be rented out to an MP? The onus is on the official who did so to ensure that the rent for it is recovered. The Governor of the CP owes an explanation to the public, for it would not have been possible to let or lease the house at issue without his permission.",
    "Parliament postponed elections to the Provincial Councils (PCs) indefinitely in 2017 in the most despicable manner. The PCs have since been without elected representatives, and President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been controlling them through the provincial Governors appointed by him. As if that were not enough, a ruling party MP has been allowed to move into a Chief Minister\u2019s official residence and be in occupation of it without honouring contractual obligations.",
    "If Rambukwella has not paid rent for the CM\u2019s house for several months, as alleged, he must be made to realise that his stay in remand prison is not a licence for him to default on house rent.",
    "Meanwhile, all those who were responsible for the spate of barbaric arson attacks on the SLPP MPs\u2019 houses, numbering about 75, in 2022, must be brought to justice. They are a danger to society. They will not hesitate to resort to such acts of violence, again, if an opportunity presents itself, and nobody will be safe. Similarly, it should be found out whether the victims had previously declared the gutted houses, etc., as their assets.",
    "Curiously, both the government and the Opposition have maintained silence on this vital issue, and the latter has not cared to ask in Parliament whether compensation has been paid for the MPs\u2019 properties destroyed by violent mobs and whether the owners thereof had declared them as assets prior to the last general election.",
