    "The Court of Appeal (CA) has dismissed a petition, in limine, which sought an injunction to prevent Western Province Local Government Commissioner Sarangika Jayasundara from conducting elections by secret ballot to the posts of chairman and vice chairman of the Seethawaka Pradeshiya Sabha.",
    "The CA decision is based on the existing election laws that provide for the Local Government Commissioners\u2019 discretion in conducting elections to the posts of chairpersons/mayors and deputy chairpersons/deputy mayors of the hung local councils. The NPP lost no time in welcoming the CA decision.",
    "In a country like Sri Lanka, there should be no legal provision for the discretion of public officials where elections to local council heads are concerned, for the government in power exerts pressure on state employees to do its bidding to further its political interests, or some public officials sell their souls to politicians.",
    "The existing laws should be amended to make open votes mandatory in elections to top posts in all political institutions. Preferably, they should be roll-call votes or show of hands. The people have a right to know how their elected representatives vote in view of very serious allegations of bribery and corruption against the MPs, provincial councillors and local government members. Quite a few newly-elected Opposition local councillors are accused of having taken bribes to vote against their own parties. Secret ballots have stood these elements in good stead. No room should be left for secrecy in elections to top posts in the local councils.",
    "One may recall that in 2007, following an abortive attempt by the then UNP-led Opposition to defeat Budget 2008 presented by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government at the height of the Eelam War IV, Dullas Alahapperuma, who was a minister at the time, disclosed, at a media briefing, that some MPs of the ruling UPFA had taken bribes to vote against the budget, as part of a conspiracy to topple the government and derail the war; they had been found in five-star hotels with foreign prostitutes, Alahapperuma said, claiming that it had been quite a battle to prevent them from doing what they had taken bribes for. The Rajapaksa government managed to win the budget vote. Alahapperuma stopped short of revealing how that task had been accomplished, but there is reason to believe that the Rajapaksas outbribed their opponents.",
    "The ongoing dispute over secret ballots in hung local councils has bolstered arguments for amending the local government election laws, which are riddled with flaws. Ambiguities in laws, especially vague wording, conflicting rules and discretionary enforcement, breeds public distrust and disillusionment and undermines the legitimacy of the electoral process. A set of ministerial guidelines prepared to dispel confusion in respect of elections to the posts of heads and deputy heads of hung local councils has been deep-sixed, to all intents and purposes, allowing state officials to do as they please. This is not a healthy state of affairs, and the LG laws must be rid of flaws that successive governments have exploited to further their interests with the help of pliant state officials.",
    "While on the subject of public officials\u2019 discretion regarding the election of heads and deputy heads in no-majority local councils, there is a far more serious issue that has gone unaddressed all these years\u2014discretion given to the leaders of political parties to manipulate the National List (NL). The Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act provide for undermining the people\u2019s franchise where the NL is concerned! As we have pointed out in previous editorial comments, Article 99A of the Constitution allows \u2018the persons whose names are included in the lists submitted to the Commissioner of Elections \u2026 or in any nomination paper submitted in respect of any electoral district by political parties or independent groups at that election\u2019 to be appointed to Parliament via the NL. But in 1988, the then UNP government introduced Section 64 (5) of the Parliament Election Act, inter alia, as an urgent Bill, eroding the essence of the constitutional provisions pertaining to the NL appointments. It has now been revealed that in 1988, the J. R. Jayewardene government surreptitiously inserted a section into the Parliamentary Elections Act by having an amendment Bill changed, after its ratification, to allow political party leaders to engineer NL vacancies and appoint persons of their choice to Parliament. This provision has made a mockery of Article 99 (A) and Article 101 (H) of the Constitution. Moreover, in 2017, the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government smuggled a slew of sections into the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill at the committee stage to postpone the provincial council elections indefinitely though Article 78 of the Constitution says \u2018any amendment proposed to a Bill in Parliament shall not deviate from the merits and principles of such Bill\u2019. Interestingly, all political parties\u2014the UNP, the SLFP-led UPFA including its pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa faction called the Joint Opposition, the JVP, the SLMC and the TNA unflinchingly backed that rotten Bill, helping postpone the PC polls indefinitely. (The TNA is now demanding that the PC polls be held expeditiously!) No legal remedy is currently available because laws cannot be challenged in courts after their enactment. Hence the need for a constitutional amendment to enable post-enactment judicial review of legislation.",
    "Bad laws not only make the public lose trust in the legal process but also give a turbo boost to anti-politics, which is on the rise.",
