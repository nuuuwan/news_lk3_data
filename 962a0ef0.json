    "Sri Lanka is trying to attract Arab visitors by promoting the travels of the famed 14th-century explorer Ibn Battuta, Colombo\u2019s envoy to Riyadh said on Saturday.",
    "The famed Moroccan explorer\u2019s ship arrived in the northwestern port of Puttalam from the Maldives in September 1344. At that time, Puttalam was under the rule of the king of Jaffna, who received him with honors.",
    "He spent a few days there, entertaining the king who, as he recalled in his \u201cTravels,\u201d understood Persian and was interested in his voyages and stories about the rulers of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia whom he had met since starting his journeys in 1325.",
    "Ibn Battuta then went on a pilgrimage to Adam\u2019s Peak, a 2,243-meter tall conical sacred mountain located in central Sri Lanka, which is venerated by Muslims as the site of the footprint of the first man and prophet, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
    "The king gave him a palanquin and sent men to accompany him.",
    "From Adam\u2019s Peak, he took a southern route to Dondra, a southern coastal town, which was a rich temple port town complex. It was destroyed by the Portuguese in the 16th century.",
    "From Dondra, Ibn Battuta went to Galle and Colombo, and from there, he went back to Puttalam and sailed to the coast of Tamil Nadu.",
    "Sri Lanka, whose economy is highly dependent on tourism, is now hoping to attract visitors from Arab countries by evoking the memory of his travels.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s important to refresh the memories of this historic visit and project it among the Arabs,\u201d P.M. Amza, ambassador of Sri Lanka to Saudi Arabia, told Arab News.",
    "\u201cIbn Battuta is a celebrated traveler \u2026 We believe such a celebrated traveler\u2019s connection with Sri Lanka will be of definite attraction to the tourism sector of Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Earlier this week, the embassy in Riyadh inaugurated the Ibn Battuta Trail as part of the Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Ministry\u2019s economic diplomacy program in the Kingdom.",
    "The trail package follows the footsteps of the famed traveler to Adam\u2019s Peak with highlights including cultural attractions, wildlife, nature, adventure activities, and cuisine.",
    "Amza was hopeful that it would contribute to increasing arrivals of Saudi travelers, which have dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "\u201cWe used to attract over 35,000 Saudi tourists to Sri Lanka annually before 2019 and it has significantly dropped since 2019,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNow there is a renewed interest, and we would like them to explore Sri Lanka\u2019s beauty, beaches, waterfalls, rich culture, hospitality, nature and adventure.\u201d"
