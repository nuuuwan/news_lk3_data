### 2019 වසරේ තිබුණ ආර්ථිකයට 2026 දී ළඟාවෙන්න පුළුවන් - ජනපති

*2025-09-26 07:55:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/215020) · `si`

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ආර්ථික අර්බුදයකට ලක්වීමට පෙර 2019 වසරේ තිබූ තත්ත්වයට ලබන වසරේ දී යාමට හැකිවනු ඇති බව ජනාධිපති අනුර කුමාර දිසානායක මහතා පවසයි.

එක්සත් ජාතීන්ගේ මහා මණ්ඩලයේ 80 වන සැසිවාරයට එක්ව සිටින ජනාධිපතිවරයා අමෙරිකාවේ වෙසෙන ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයින් නිව්යෝර්ක්හිදී හමු වූ අවස්ථාවේ දී මේ බව පැවසීය.

මෙහිදී ජනාධිපති අනුර කුමාර දිසානායක මහතා පවසා සිටියේ, 2022 වසරේ දී නිල වශයෙන් බංකොළොත් රාජ්‍යයක් බවට වූ ශ්‍රී ලංකාව, අද එම අර්බුදය වේගයෙන් සමනය කරගත් රාජ්‍යයක් බවට පත්ව ඇති බවයි.

"ජනාධිපතිවරයෙන් ලබාගත් ජයග්‍රහණයට විශාල සහයෝගයක් විදෙස් ගත ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයන් ඉටුකළා. මූල්‍යමය ලෙස උදව් කළා. ඒ දායකත්වය ජයග්‍රහණ ලබාගන්න හේතු වුණා.

අපි 2019 මැතිවරණයේ දී 3%කට ආසන්න ඡන්ද ප්‍රතිඵලයක් හිමිව තිබූ ව්‍යපාරයක්. නමුත් 2024 ජනාධිපතිවරණයේදීත්, පසුව පැවති මහ මැතිවරණයේදීත් ලංකා ඉතිහාසයේ වැඩිම මන්ත්‍රී ධුර සංඛ්‍යාවක් හිමිකරගනිමින් ජයග්‍රහණය කරන්න ලැබුණා.

2022 අප්‍රේල් 12 වනදා එවක ශ්‍රී ලංකාව නිල වශයෙන් ප්‍රකාශයට පත්කළා අපි ණය ගෙවන්නේ නෑ. බංකොළොත් රාජ්‍යයක් බවට පත්වුණා කියලා.

A classmate’s sister contacted me about three years ago, to say that she was finding it difficult to get a visa to Israel, and that she had heard that I knew the Honorary Consul. I responded immediately. Despite much difficulty, I managed to track the then Honorary Consul down in a country he was taking up residence in. We recalled the many Israel National Days he had invited me to, then taking kindly to the many repeated WhatsApp reminders I sent him, he intervened and through his counterparts in India got her the visa.

### Fitch assigns Hayleys Fentons first-time national rating of ‘A+(lka)’; outlook stable

*2025-09-26 05:36:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Fitch-assigns-Hayleys-Fentons-first-time-national-rating-of-A-lka-outlook-stable/34-782195) · `en`

Fitch Ratings has assigned Hayleys Fentons Ltd., (HFL) a National Long-Term Rating of ‘A+(lka)’. The outlook is stable.

The rating reflects HFL’s leading market share in domestic rooftop solar panel sales and installation, which drove cash flow in the financial year ending March 2025 (FY25), alongside slowing growth amid regulatory risks. Diversification into power generation over the next few years carries execution risk but could enhance revenue visibility, subject to the weak credit quality of the sole offtaker, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable).

HFL’s A+(lka) rating comprises its standalone credit profile of ‘a(lka)’ and a one-notch uplift for support from its stronger parent, Hayleys PLC (AAA(lka)/Stable), reflecting moderate operating incentives but low legal and strategic incentives.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas pledged at the United Nations on Thursday to work with U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, France and the United Nations on a peace plan for Gaza overwhelmingly backed by the world body.

The 193-member U.N. General Assembly earlier this month overwhelmingly endorsed a seven-page declaration that aims to advance a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians and end the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants.

The declaration emerged from an international conference at the U.N. in July - hosted by Saudi Arabia and France - on the decades-long conflict. The United States and Israel boycotted the event and have rejected the international efforts.

Separately, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Wednesday that Trump had presented a 21-point peace plan for the Middle East and Gaza during a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries on the sidelines of this week’s U.N. General Assembly.

The harm they have been doing is diabolical, and yet, they expect you to believe they are the victims. Invoking a long-forgotten holocaust and screaming discrimination, they expect you to suspend fundamental human reason to believe that the daily sniping of children with so called “kill shots” to the head or chest and the bombing of entire neighbourhoods that bury families alive and wipe out whole bloodlines is self-defence and just.

It is a tragedy that we still follow the line expounded by the carbon emitters and polluters of the environment. We have accepted a high debt and fossil dependency scenario as the indicator of ‘Economic Development’. Our concerns with adaptation to the ongoing climate changes brought about by our own actions, seem to be minimal. The current disasters of fishermen getting caught in an sudden, random, wind events, are a foretaste of things to come. Sudden violent downpours that strip and erode the soil or delays in rain bearing winds that create harsh drought conditions, will become more frequent. The ‘climate affected’ population will grow with every event. We are witnessing the thin edge of the wedge.

### Sri Lanka exporters urge govt to delay SVAT removal until proper refunding system in place

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka exporters collectively have urged the government to delay the removal of SVAT, a tax they have to pay up front when they export before they receive the money from buyers.

The exporters will have to pay interest on cash flow given to the state as a result of charging value added tax on local inputs, following the scrapping of the so-called SVAT scheme, which is a tax payment system based on vouchers.

The government has said the existing SVAT will be removed from October 1.

“The government’s argument that they want to remove SVAT is that some leakages are happening. What we are telling them is if there are leakages happening, don’t carpet bomb all of us. You deal with that. That’s the job of the IRD (Inland Revenue Department),” Shiham Marikkar, Secretary General/CEO at National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCESL).

“That’s their problem. They have to deal with that. You cannot carpet bomb all of the exporters.”

Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was sentenced to five years in jail on Thursday (Sep 25) after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy over efforts by close aides to procure funds for his 2007 presidential bid from Libya during the rule of late dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

Sarkozy was acquitted by a Paris court of all other charges, including corruption and receiving illegal campaign financing.

But the ruling means the former president will spend time in jail even if he appeals, a sentence much harsher than many expected.

Sarkozy, who has always denied the charges, was accused of making a deal with Gaddafi in 2005, when he was France’s interior minister, to obtain campaign financing in exchange for supporting the then-isolated Libyan government on the international stage.
