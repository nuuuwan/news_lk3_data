    "Says unnecessary to invite views to implement what is already part of the constitution",
    "Asks 13A to be implemented in its original form with land, police, finance and administrative powers",
    "A coalition of Tamil political parties in a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe have expressed their dissent against his appeal for parties to submit their views and proposals on the implementation of the 13th amendment.",
    "The alliance consisting of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO), Democratic People\u2019s Liberation Front (DPLF), Eelam People\u2019s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), Tamil National Party (TNP) and the Democratic Crusaders Party (DCP) noted that the 13A has already been incorporated into the constitution in 1988 with a majority in the Parliament.",
    "\u201cSince then Provincial Councils have been established in the entire country, elections held and functioned until dissolved for holding elections,\u201d they said.",
    "\u201cTherefore it is not necessary to invite for views to implement what is already available and part of the constitution,\u201d the group added. The alliance noted that while certain Provincial Council powers vested under 13A have systematically been withdrawn periodically from time to time, they proposed those powers withdrawn from Provincial Councils be reinstated and the 13A be implemented in its original form with land, police, finance and administrative powers."
