    "Implausible excuses and unbelievable claims are the stock-in-trade of Sri Lankan politicians and their lackeys in the public service. They remind us of folk stories about the legendary King Kekille, whose monumental stupidity was such that in every case heard by him, the innocent party was invariably found guilty and punished, while the culprits went free. When one hears senior Customs officers giving lame excuses for having released two shipping containers with kudu (narcotics) concealed in them, one wonders whether King Kekille was real and his descendants are in the Sri Lanka Customs.",
    "Following the detection of crystal methamphetamine or ICE in 17 out of 20 samples taken from a consignment of chemicals recently unearthed in Middeniya, where it had been taken in two freight containers, which were reportedly released after inspection, the Customs has concocted what can be described as a Kekille theory in a bid to cover up their serious lapses.",
    "In our front-page lead news item yesterday, we quoted a Customs officer as having said that the equipment provided by the UN had failed to detect crystal methamphetamine concealed in the aforementioned containers which had been inspected following a tip-off received by the Police Narcotics Bureau. Thus, he has questioned the integrity of the equipment received from the UN!",
    "The Customs and the police are obviously trying to deflect criticism by blaming the drug detecting equipment for their failure to find the stock of methamphetamine, despite a tip-off. How did the Customs detect narcotics hidden in containers before receiving the drug detection equipment from the UN? If the Customs and the police had been confident that their information was reliable, they should not have released the containers; instead, they should have carried out a thorough physical inspection of the cargo without relying solely on scanners, etc. It is not clear from media reports whether they did so.",
    "It defies belief that a stock of narcotics in the two containers went undetected despite actionable intelligence and a thorough inspection. One may recall that in 2013, the Customs were able to detect about 131 kg of heroin concealed in many cans of grease in a shipping container that a coordinating secretary to the then Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne sought to have cleared on a priority basis by issuing a letter to the Customs to that effect. Thankfully, the container underwent a proper inspection.",
    "The police and the Customs have claimed that the two containers believed to have been used to smuggle narcotics found in Middeniya were not among the red-flagged ones released via the green channel at the Colombo Port in January. They can\u2019t be expected to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth for obvious reasons. They repeat what their superiors and government politicians say lest they should face reprisal. The incumbent Customs Chief himself has said the 323 containers released without inspection in January did not carry anything illegal. Curiously, neither he nor anyone else in the Customs has seen what those containers carried!",
    "Are our Customs officers blessed with extrasensory perception to know what is inside containers without scanning or opening them? If so, why couldn\u2019t they detect the narcotics in the Middeniya-bound containers?",
    "As for the mystery crystal meth stock that went undetected, there are several possibilities. The banned substance was concealed in the two containers, but the Customs did not conduct a proper inspection and therefore could not find it. Alternatively, the containers did not carry anything illegal, and the stock of crystal meth was transferred to them after they were released by the Customs. It is also possible that the consignment of narcotics came in two of the 323 containers released without inspection allegedly at the behest of the government in January 2025.",
    "One can only hope that the crystal meth issue will be investigated from all angles without being politicised. The possibility of many other hauls of narcotics having found their way into the country in containers cannot be ruled out. Those at the helm of the police, the Customs and other state institutions tend to go out of their way to help further the interests of the powers that be, making it extremely difficult to get at the truth.",
