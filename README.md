This widespread dependence underscores a critical issue: public transport, particularly on private buses, is the source of significant physical and mental strain for many. The reality is stark; private bus services are marked by a host of problems that contribute to a deteriorating passenger experience.

The challenges are multifaceted and impact every aspect of bus travel. Boarding and alighting from buses can be a stressful experience with passengers often battling overcrowded conditions and poorly designed bus entry and exit points. Once on board, the issues continue.

### Unveiling the Code of Life: A Look into Genetics

*2024-08-10 23:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/unveiling-the-code-of-life-a-look-into-genetics/) · `en`

Genetics, a captivating branch of biology, delves into the core of what defines us. It explores genes, the microscopic instructions encoded in our DNA, and how these instructions are transmitted from parent to offspring. Beyond inheritance, genetics examines the symphony of genes, their variations, and their interplay with the environment, shaping everything from our physical traits to our susceptibility to diseases.

The story of genetics begins with Gregor Mendel, a 19th-century monk who experimented with pea plants. Through careful observation and breeding experiments, Mendel uncovered the fundamental principles of heredity, now known as Mendelian genetics. He proposed that traits are inherited through discrete units, later called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring in predictable patterns. This groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern genetics.

“Nature builds no machines,” wrote Marx in a famous passage in the Grundrisse. They are “products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature.” Fundamentally, Marxism is the (socialist) theory and practice of industrial societies. Marx’s insights on the logic of automation is now drawing the attention of technology watchers who are both excited and concerned by the current phenomenon of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the complex environment of human labour, labour-created, labour-saving and labour-replacing machinery and automation, and the mostly uneven industrial society at large, engineering education and research are a critical medium providing training to human resources and technical mastery over material resources.

### The final minutes of Sheikh Hasina as a hateful authority ..........

*2024-08-10 21:52:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190755) · `ta`

In the face of escalating protests and violence, Sheikh Hasina, the Bangladeshi prime minister, faced a tumultuous end to her tenure. Despite calls for peace and attempts to negotiate with security forces and military officials, the situation spiraled out of control. Faced with overwhelming public opposition and internal conflicts within the government, Hasina eventually decided to flee her official residence. This decision came after a series of events including violent clashes, rising death tolls, and a failed attempt to secure her safety. Ultimately, the pressure from both the public and the military proved too great, leading to Hasina's departure from Bangladesh.

🟩

Sheikh Hasina called on the security forces to end the violence in Bangladesh on Sunday, and she was not in the process of accepting that his time was over as prime minister.

But in the next few hours he was beaten by the power of the people.

His son told the BBC that his family's consultation had left him out of Bangladesh rather than the security forces in the end.

Hasina made the decision to leave at the right moment-he fled and entered his official residence in a few hours.

Sheikh Sina was invited to a meeting of the National Security Council on Sunday morning.

From the time Ranil  Wickremesinghe returned to the seat of  power as Prime Minister  and later as President,   false narratives have been  concocted and circulated e by his opponents, adeversaries, critics and detractors about him.

Unable to confront this reality,Ranil’s foes now comfort themselves saying “wait and see will you,he will do something before the election”.

### The Tiger Moth Story

*2024-08-10 19:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-tiger-moth-story/) · `en`

In my fifty-plus years of association with aviation, the best aeroplane I ever flew was undoubtedly the De Haviland Tiger Moth. As a young student pilot, I used to regularly fly the ‘Tiger’, operating off the old grass strip which was the runway we used to take-off and land. The reason for using the grass for the operation was simply a matter of safety. The ‘Tiger’ had two wheels like in a handcart and instead of a rear wheel to complete a triangular undercarriage, it had only a tail-skid with tough leather covering. The ‘Tiger’ had no brakes, the dragging tail-skid was what stopped it after landing. As for the take-off, we opened the Gypsy Major engine and it powered a long beautiful wooden propeller and with the gathering of speed, the tail lifted, and the Tiger Moth rolled majestically to reach its lift-off speed of 55 knots.
