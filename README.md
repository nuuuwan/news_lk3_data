Colombo, April 13 (Daily Mirror) -As the Sinhala and Tamil festive season approaches, environmentalists in Sri Lanka have sounded the alarm on the detrimental impact of fireworks on pets and wildlife.

According to Environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella, research indicates that fireworks not only disturb the peace of humans but also have profound effects on wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, including dogs and cats.

The loud explosions can cause birds to abandon their nests in fear, disrupting their habitats.

According to studies, animals have a far more acute sense of hearing than humans, making them particularly sensitive to the deafening blasts of fireworks.

With explosions reaching up to 190 decibels—far surpassing the threshold for human hearing damage at 75 decibels—the sound can induce anxiety, confusion and panic in animals.

Furthermore, researches suggest that up to 50 percent of dogs experience fear or anxiety during fireworks displays.

(AP) — Norway’s health minister resigned Friday, the second Norwegian government member to step down this year amid allegations they plagiarized academic works.

Ingvild Kjerkol resigned a day after a probe by Nord University in Bodoe in northern Norway, where Kjerkol, handed in her master thesis in 2021, concluded that “there is a not insignificant amount of plagiarism in her master’s thesis.”

“We have come to the conclusion that Ingvild should resign as minister,” Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told a press conference. He said the probe had concluded the plagiarism was “intentional.”

Kjerkoll said she and a co-author “did not intend to plagiarize other people’s assignments.”

“Although it hurts not to be believed, we have to deal with the fact that (the university) is of a different opinion,” she said at a joint press conference with Gahr Støre.
