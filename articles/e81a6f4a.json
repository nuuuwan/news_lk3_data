    "National Catholic Mass Communications Director Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha urges immediate criminal prosecution against Jayawardena",
    "Suggests larger, hidden force may be behind bombings, beyond Zahran Hashim\u2019s group",
    "Accuses former Presidents Sirisena, Gotabaya and Ranil of protecting Jayawardena for past six years",
    "Calls on Govt. to expose full truth and ensure accountability at all levels",
    "The Catholic Church of Sri Lanka yesterday welcomed President Anura Kumara Disanayake\u2019s decision to terminate the services of former Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) Nilantha Jayawardena, while calling for swift legal action against all those found responsible for the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "Speaking to the media, National Catholic Mass Communications Director Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha extended his gratitude to President Disanayake for taking steps to sack Jayawardena.",
    "On 19 July, the National Police Commission (NPC) announced that it had officially terminated the service of Jayawardena, following a disciplinary inquiry related to the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. Jayawardena, who headed the State Intelligence Service (SIS) at the time of the attacks in 2019, has long faced accusations of failing to act on crucial intelligence that could have averted the tragedy.",
    "Rev. Fr. Krishantha also urged the President, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Inspector General of Police, and Attorney General\u2019s Department to immediately initiate criminal proceedings against Jayawardena. \u201cThe findings are clear. There is no need to delay any further,\u201d he said.",
    "He raised serious suspicions about former President Maithripala Sirisena, who was also serving as Defence Minister during the attacks.",
    "He also questioned the timing of Sirisena\u2019s sudden departure to Singapore prior to the attacks, without naming an Acting Minister, despite the existence of advance intelligence warnings.",
    "\u201cWe have deep concerns. Was the former President being influenced or controlled by a more powerful force? It is very clear now that these attacks were not simply the work of Zahran Hashim and his group, but that there was a larger and more sinister plan at play,\u201d Rev. Fr. Krishantha said, suggesting what he described as an \u201cunknown force\u201d behind the tragedy.",
    "He went on to accuse three former Presidents\u2014Maithripala Sirisena, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and Ranil Wickremesinghe of protecting Jayawardena despite widespread allegations and public outrage during the past six years. \u201cThere is a strong feeling that these three leaders had something to hide and they used Jayawardena\u2019s continued presence in the Police to do just that,\u201d he alleged.",
    "Rev. Fr. Krishantha called on the Government to take bold steps in exposing the full truth. \u201cThe new Government has a duty to uncover what those in power tried to hide. The people deserve to know the truth. The victims deserve justice,\u201d he asserted.",
    "He insisted that justice must be served irrespective of rank or political status. \u201cWhether it is a former President or a senior officer, anyone responsible must be held accountable in a Court of law. No one is above justice,\u201d he added.",
    "Rev. Fr. Krishantha called for the harshest possible punishment for those convicted of direct or indirect involvement in the Easter Sunday bombings on 21 April 2019 which targeted churches and hotels across Sri Lanka, killing over 260 people and injuring hundreds more.",
    "\u201cIn my opinion, even a life sentence is not enough. For a crime of this magnitude, the death penalty is what justice demands,\u201d he said, expressing the depth of the Catholic Church\u2019s continued grief and demand for accountability.",
    "The coordinated Easter Sunday suicide bombings remain one of the deadliest terrorist incidents in the country\u2019s post-war history."
