    "Fund Based & Non- Fund Based Income The Bank achieved a profit before tax of Rs. 40.3 billion, driven by a significant 15% increase in interest income. However, despite this growth, a sharp rise in interest expenses resulted due to lag effect in repricing the time deposits mobilized at higher rates. Accordingly, net interest income decreased by 28% YoY. Moreover, net fee and commission income experienced a growth of 8%, primarily due to increase in card transactions, improved remittance, and greater adoption of digital banking services in retail banking. The Bank experienced approximately a 49% increase in worker remittances, accompanied by a rise in the number of remittances.",
    "Impairment Reversal for Loans and Advances and Other Financial Instruments",
    "From the emerging of the economic turmoil the Bank implemented proactive measures to mitigate the credit risk by applying management overlays to identify risk-elevated industries, reassessing exposures to high-risk borrowers and implementing stringent monitoring mechanisms. Under Expected Credit Loss model the Bank provided considerable level of impairment provision in previous years and by beginning of the year 2023, the Bank had maintained provision coverage of 60% for stage 3 loans. As a testament to these efforts, the Bank witnessed a noteworthy net reversal of impairment provisions for loans and advances amounting to Rs. 2.7 billion during the year. This positive outcome was attributed to the synergy of various factors, including robust business revival activities, rigorous credit monitoring practice, and the favorable appreciation of the LKR against USD.
