    "At COP29 in Baku, Prof. Mohan Munasinghe delivered a compelling keynote, emphasizing a paradigm shift towards sustainability rooted in economic equity and environmental responsibility.",
    "Prof. Munasinghe\u2019s address featured the necessity of global collaboration, particularly between the Global South and emerging economies like China, to address interconnected crises of climate change, poverty and inequality.",
    "Munasinghe introduced the Sustainomics Framework, integrating three core dimensions: economic prosperity, environmental protection and social equity. At its heart lies the principle that sustainable development is unattainable without economic strength to uplift the impoverished, environmental strategies to mitigate degradation and inclusive policies to distribute benefits equitably.",
    "This triad reflects the essence of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which he describes as humanity\u2019s \u201clast chance.\u201d A failure to act decisively risks not only environmental collapse but also the destabilization of global economies.",
    "Informed observers added: \u2018China\u2019s economic transformation serves as a model for balancing growth with ecological responsibility. Over the past four decades, China achieved an unprecedented average growth rate of 10% and lifted 800 million people out of poverty. More recently, it has decoupled carbon emissions from economic expansion, showcasing that rapid development need not come at the cost of environmental harm.",
    "\u2018The Yangtze River Delta exemplifies this success. Contributing USD 8 trillion to GDP in 2022\u2014outstripping the economies of Japan and Germany\u2014this region transitioned from a pollution-heavy industrial hub to a beacon of low-carbon development. Policies focused on reducing air and water pollution demonstrate the feasibility of Prof. Munasinghe\u2019s Balanced Inclusive Green Growth (BIGG) model.",
    "\u2018The economic dominance of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) represents a pivotal shift toward a multipolar world. Collectively, BRICS nations contributed 32% to global GDP in 2023, surpassing the G7\u2019s 29%. This growth signals the emergence of an economic bloc capable of challenging traditional Western hegemony.",
    "\u2018Key to this transformation is \u201cde-dollarization\u201d\u2014the gradual move away from the U.S. dollar as a universal reserve currency. BRICS nations advocate for peaceful economic partnerships and equitable trade, fostering mutual prosperity while championing the SDGs.",
    "\u2018Despite these advances, global financial support for sustainability lags alarmingly behind. For instance, contributions to the COP28-approved Loss and Damage Fund\u2014a mechanism to compensate developing nations for climate-related impacts\u2014total of a mere USD 700 million, dwarfed by the USD 2 trillion annual military expenditure globally.",
    "\u2018China leads by example, directing nearly USD 700 billion toward clean energy in 2023 alone. By prioritizing infrastructure, renewable energy, and cross-border partnerships under initiatives like the Belt and Road, China continues to solidify its position as a sustainability leader.",
    "\u2018The global economy faces mounting threats: from climate change and technological disruption to geopolitical instability. Yet, as Prof. Munasinghe argues, these challenges also offer opportunities for innovation, cooperation, and equitable growth.\u2019",
