    "BBC viewers were in for a great surprise when the main news bulletin at 6 pm on Friday 22nd went straight to a video of Kate, Princess of Wales, without the customary mention of news headlines. Dressed in a long-sleeved white top with narrow black bands across and light blue jeans, seated on a bench in the +-Windsor Castle with spring blooms in the background, what she told whilst nervously moving her fingers and faltering voice at times, shocked the nation. Many an eye would have been wet by the time she finished her two-minute statement wherein she explained that following the planned surgery she had in mid-January, a cancer had been detected unexpectedly and she is in the early stages of having preventive chemotherapy. She added:",
    "\u201cThis of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok. As I have said to them; I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits.\u201d",
    "It would have taken enormous courage to declare to the whole world that she is being treated for cancer at the age of 42 but it would have been even more difficult for Kate to explain to their three young children aged 10, 8 and 5 years that she is afflicted by a disease that usually affects much older people. The public announcement coincided with the start of the Easter break in schools, which may have been done purposely to protect the three young royals. There was a tremendous outpouring of public sympathy not only because of her predicament but also for the graceful manner in which she delivered her message. Many thoughts that her staff may have written the message but it transpired later that she had written the message herself and the recording had been done in one-go by BBC studios.",
    "She won the hearts of many families affected with cancer as she ended her message with the following: \u201cAt this time, I am also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone. \u201c",
    "At the time of a great personal tragedy, thinking of others similarly affected showed the great humane qualities of the Princess and it becomes even more significant considering the horrible period she went through.",
    "On 17 January, it was announced that the Princess of Wales had undergone planned abdominal surgery for an undisclosed medical condition that was not cancer, at The London Clinic and that she had postponed all of her public engagements and duties until after Easter. Around the same time, King Charles was admitted to the same hospital for planned prostatic surgery and it was later announced that an unrelated cancer had been detected during the procedure. As the King was to have a course of treatment for this, he too was forced to withdraw from public duties but he continued to conduct the affairs of state including the weekly meetings with the prime minister. The absence of two of the most senior royals from public duties piled the pressures on Queen Camilla and Prince William.",
    "On 27 February, a thanksgiving memorial service was held for King Constantine II of Greece, the last monarch of the country and godfather to Prince William, at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle where Prince William was due to give a reading but he withdrew at the last moment citing \u2018an urgent family matter\u2019. Rumour mills went to overdrive to explain all these and conspiracy theories abounded. In addition to extensive media attention, social media were full of inuendoes.",
    "To calm the waters, a photograph taken by Prince William showing Princess of Wales embraced by her three children was released on Mother\u2019s Day, 10 March, but it was a disaster, mostly due to an overreaction on the part of news agencies. As the photograph seem to have been edited, they issued a \u2018kill\u2019 notice in spite of many commentators pointing out that almost all royal photographs released since the time of Queen Victoria have been edited! Wonder whether there was a secret hand behind this action!",
    "To her credit, Princess of Wales, who is a keen photographer issued an immediate apology admitting that she, like many amateur photographers, \u201coccasionally experiments with editing\u201d. But it was not enough to stem the tide in the sewer of social media and Kate had no choice but to come out with the statement which, hopefully, would make conspiracy theorists leave her in peace for recovery from a major unexpected illness.",
    "Associate editor Camilla Tominey\u2019s comment in the front page of The Daily Telegraph of 23 March on this is hard to better:",
    "\u201cWe already knew that social media was a sewer, occupied by faceless rats intent on infecting others with their disease of hatred. But their cruel treatment of Kate since it was announced she was undergoing abdominal surgery in January has been sickening beyond belief. From the peddling of hurtful conspiracy theories to the propagation of unsubstantiated lies, the keyboard warriors have inflicted an unnecessary amount of suffering on a woman now undergoing chemotherapy after a major operation. Shame on them.\u201d",
    "Whilst Kate received numerous messages of support from ordinary folk as well as world leaders, perhaps the best being from President Macron, the message from her estranged brother-in-law and his American wife is most intriguing: \u201cWe wish health and healing for Kate and family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\u201d",
    "In addition to increased awareness of prostatic problems and cancer due to King Charle\u2019s illness, Kate\u2019s diagnosis has raised the issue of cancer in the young. Many experts are expressing the opinion that cancers in the young are on the rise and this may be due to environmental factors. I am sure, when she returns to active duties, Kate would actively support further research in to this issue, in addition to continuing her many charities.",
    "Our hearts go out to you Kate and we wish you a rapid and complete recovery!",
