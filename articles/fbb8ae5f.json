    "Colombo, May 7 (Daily Mirror) - Venerable Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera cautioned parliamentarians against returning to their villages to seek votes if they support the same-sex marriage bill in parliament.",
    "He urged them to refrain from political engagement if they vote for the bill and emphasized that Sinhala Buddhist national organizations, including the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, will oppose its legalization.",
    "Addressing the media, the Thera told the MPs not to visit them to receive blessings for their election campaigns.",
    "\"This bill must not be pass in parliament. If, by any chance it does, it will severely impact Sri Lankan culture and the family structure of the country. Once enacted, legalizing same-sex marriages will lead to acceptance, and legal repercussions will be taken against those who oppose them and their actions,\" the Thera said.",
    "\"No religion accepts same-sex marriages. While such acts might be accepted in Western countries with diverse cultures, we need not adopt them. Our culture, shaped by Buddhist philosophy, is unique and beneficial to our society and the future of our country,\" Ven. Nalaka Thera said.",
    "\"It is hard to determine whose interests are being served by these actions. There is suspicion that they may be driven either by powerful figures within the government or by Western influence.",
    "\"However, if this bill is passed in parliament due to any influence, it could seriously damage the culture and family structure of the country,\" he added."
