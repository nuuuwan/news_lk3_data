### General Election: VoterтАЩs index finger to be marked instead of little finger

*2024-11-11 12:17:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103325/general-election-voters-index-finger-to-be-marked-instead-of-little-finger) ┬╖ `en`

The Election Commission has announced a key measure for the upcoming Parliamentary Election scheduled for November 14, 2024.

Accordingly, voters will have their left handтАЩs index finger marked with an appropriate sign to prevent double voting and ensure transparency, the election regulatory body said.

This decision comes in light of concerns about possible confusion during the polling process for the Presidential Election 2024, which took place recently.

Meanwhile, if a voterтАЩs left index finger is unavailable, the mark will be applied to another finger, as suitable, according to the Election Commission.

### Spike in fever among children: Officials warn of rising viral fevers and Dengue risk

Dr. Deepal Perera, a paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, states that a recent rise in fever cases among children is observed, attributing this to a surge in viral infections as well as an uptick in dengue cases.

He emphasized that parents should closely monitor childrenтАЩs symptoms, especially if a fever lasts more than three days, as it may indicate a more serious infection.

According to Dr. Perera, many children are presenting with symptoms of viral fever, such as cough, cold, body aches, and occasional vomiting. He warned that some of these symptoms can mimic those of influenza, making it essential for parents to observe children carefully and seek medical attention if fevers persist. Additionally, he advised obtaining relevant blood tests to identify potential dengue infections.

тАЬDengue is a particularly concerning risk, as it can be fatal, with a 0.1% mortality rate,тАЭ Dr. Perera cautioned.

### MONKS IN CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS

Whether the participation of monks in representative politics is permissible (or proper), has been a matter of periodic discourse in the media.

The ordained ones have themselves chosen to enter the Community referred to collectively as тАЬThe (Maha) SanghaтАЭ They have voluntarily resolved to abandon the lay life and to observe the rules of conduct (more than two hundred), included in the Vinaya Pitaka.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the тАЬforest dwellerтАЭ (vanavasa) tradition prevails, where the monk lives alone, often in a natural cave, and devotes himself to continuous meditation and solitude, with minimum contact with others. In the commoner monastic tradition, a community of monks live together, with each engaging in his own spiritual practices.

Due to inclement weather, the service was halted from Thursday (7) last Thursday (7).

Sri Lanka - Indian Shipping Service Private Company Director. Niranjan Nandakopan said,

тАЬOn Friday (8), Saturday (9) and Sunday (10), the rainfall was unable to operate the shipping service.

The shipping service will be determined by the weather weather for the day (12). So we have not booked on November 16th.

Nearly 150 seats were booked before the shipping service suspended due to inclement weather.

The height of the ocean wave and the direction of the wind help plan shipping trips. We rely on Sri Lanka and Indian weather forecasts and processors such as Windy App to determine whether it is safe to transport passengers.

Moreover, the Department of Meteorology has said that the northeast monsoon will begin by the end of this month and that the low -lying low -lying area is being developed.
