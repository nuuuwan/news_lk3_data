    "President-elect Peter Pellegrini, an ally of Fico, called the assassination \u201can unprecedented threat to Slovak democracy. If we express other political opinions with pistols in squares, and not in polling stations, we are jeopardizing everything that we have built together over 31 years of Slovak sovereignty.\u201d",

    "Slovakia\u2019s major opposition parties, Progressive Slovakia and Freedom and Solidarity, canceled a planned protest against a controversial government plan to overhaul public broadcasting that they say would give the government full control of public radio and television.",
    "\u201cWe absolutely and strongly condemn violence and today\u2019s shooting of Premier Robert Fico,\u201d said Progressive Slovakia leader Michal Simecka. \u201cAt the same time we call on all politicians to refrain from any expressions and steps which could contribute to further increasing the tension.\u201d",
