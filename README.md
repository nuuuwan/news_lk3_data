Madagascar’s president has said he will dissolve his government, following days of youth-led protests over longstanding water and power cuts.

“We acknowledge and apologise if members of the government have not carried out the tasks assigned to them,” Andry Rajoelina said in a televised national address on Monday.

The so-called Gen-Z protests have seen thousands of predominantly young demonstrators take to the streets in cities across Madagascar since Thursday, under the rallying cry: “We want to live, not survive”.

The UN’s human rights chief condemned the “unnecessary force” used by security forces to quell the unrest, saying that at least 22 people have been killed and 100 others injured.

Madagascar’s foreign ministry has rejected the UN’s figures, alleging the data is “based on rumours or misinformation”.

Protests first started in the capital Antananarivo, but have since spread to eight cities across the country.

### Gold hits fresh record above $3,800 on US shutdown fears

Gold edged higher to a fresh record as the prospect of a looming US government shutdown clouded the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy path ahead of next month’s interest-rate decision.

Bullion briefly touched an all-time high of $3,839.52 an ounce on Tuesday. Gold rallied in the previous session as a meeting between top congressional leaders and US President Donald Trump ended without a deal on short-term funding. That’s fanned fears of a shutdown, which could hinder the release of economic reports — depriving investors of crucial data needed to assess the US economy.

Gold has soared more than 45% this year, setting successive peaks on central-bank demand and a resumption of interest-rate cuts by the Fed. Prices are on track to close out a third consecutive quarterly gain, with holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds at the highest since 2022.

State University lecturers across the country have launched a one -day identity workshop on Tuesday (30).

The University Teachers' Association has launched a number of demands, including salary conflicts, shortage of lecturers and the failure of the government to take action to address the shortcomings in the university structure.

The Secretary of the Federation of University Lecturers Associations, Selva Lecturer Sarutta Ilangasinghe said at a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (29) in Colombo.

One year has passed the government came to power. But the crises in state universities have not yet been resolved. Currently, state education is in decline and is facing severe crisis.

The shortage of university professors is currently in severe state. About 200 professors have left the University of Peradeniya last year alone.

He said there is a risk that universities will be affected by educational activities, including exams.
