### ADIC raises concerns over Excise chief’s proposal on illicit alcohol

*2024-12-25 12:19:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104487/adic-raises-concerns-over-excise-chiefs-proposal-on-illicit-alcohol-) · `en`

The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) has issued a statement regarding the proposal by the Commissioner General of Excise to introduce alcohol at a lower price.

The ADIC argues that the proposal aims to increase alcohol consumption among the population by reducing its price under the pretense of reducing illegal alcohol sales, thereby creating a favorable situation for alcohol companies.

The statement references the World Health Organization (WHO), which advocates for increasing taxes on alcohol and cigarettes as an effective method for controlling consumption.

The ADIC supports this stance, asserting that raising excise taxes is a scientifically confirmed strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and minimize new alcohol users. The WHO and other research institutions have long supported this approach, it said.

உலக அளவில் மிக முக்கிய சுற்றுலா தலங்களில் ஒன்றாக விளங்கும் பிரான்ஸ் நாட்டின் பாரிஸ் நகரில் அமைந்துள்ள ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தில் செவ்வாய்க்கிழமை(24)  தீ விபத்து ஏற்பட்டது. இதையடுத்து அங்கிருந்த சுமார் 1200 சுற்றுலா பயணிகள் பாதுகாப்பாக வெளியேற்றப்பட்டனர். தொடர்ந்து தீயணைப்பு படையினர் தீயை அணைத்தனர்.

எல்லோருக்கும் பிரான்ஸ் அல்லது பாரிஸ் என்றதும் கம்பீரமாக நிற்கும் ஈபிள் கோபுரம் தான் சட்டென கண்முன் வந்து செல்லும். உலக அளவில் அனைவரும் அறிந்த அடையாள சின்னமாக இருக்கும் ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தை நாள்தோறும் உள்நாடு மற்றும் வெளிநாடு என சுமார் 25,000 மக்கள் பார்வையிடுவது வழக்கம். இந்த சூழலில் தான் அதில் தீ விபத்து ஏற்பட்டது.

ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தில் உள்ள லிப்ட் ஷாஃப்டின் கேபிளில் ஏற்பட்ட அதீத வெப்பம் தான் தீ விபத்துக்கு காரணம் என்ற தகவல் வெளியாகி உள்ளது. தீப்பற்றியதை அடுத்து சுற்றுலா பயணிகள் வெளியேற்றப்பட்டனர். தொடர்ந்து தீயணைப்பு படை வீரர்கள் போராடி தீயை அணைத்தனர். இதற்கு முன்னர் கடந்த 1956-ல் ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தில் தீ விபத்து ஏற்பட்டுள்ளது. அப்போது ஏற்பட்ட பாதிப்புகளை சீர் செய்ய ஓராண்டு காலம் பிடித்தது குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.
