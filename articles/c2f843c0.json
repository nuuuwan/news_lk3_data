    "The minister further stated that the egg prices have suddenly dropped by Rs. 6 and that he will thoroughly look into this by obtaining reports from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).",
    "He expressed concerns stating that if an egg cannot be sold for at least Rs. 40, they would have to import eggs from India. He pointed out that during the festival season in December, cake manufacturers will also be purchasing a large quantity of eggs.",
