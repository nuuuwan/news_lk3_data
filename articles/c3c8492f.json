    "Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Jaffna district MP M.A Sumanthiran on Tuesday denounced what he termed the \u201cblatant hypocrisy\u201d of Western nations and accused them of turning a blind eye to Israel\u2019s actions despite their professed commitment to human rights.",
    "Addressing the Adjournment debate on the Palestine issue Sumanthiran underscored the urgent need for international scrutiny, drawing stark parallels between the conflict in Palestine and Sri Lanka\u2019s own tumultuous history of violence.",
    "Sumanthiran painted a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis in Palestine, emphasising the disproportionate toll the conflict has taken on innocent civilians, particularly women and children. He lamented the complicity between Hamas and the Israeli Government, likening it to the political machinations that unfolded during Sri Lanka\u2019s own dark chapter of violence.",
    "Sumanthiran challenged the narrative perpetuated by some supporters of Israel, asserting that scriptures urge compassion and fairness toward all inhabitants of the land. He condemned the hypocrisy of those who espouse human rights yet remain silent in the face of injustice.",
    "Furthermore, Sumanthiran linked the ongoing commemoration of the Mullivaikkal massacre in Sri Lanka to the struggle for justice in Palestine, emphasising the importance of international recognition and remembrance.",
    "\u201cTo stop a commemoration of that nature itself exposes the face of the State and that is what happened 2 days ago in Sampur, where few women were commemorating this event by cooking kanji and distributing, remembering their own dead in Mullivaikal during those times,\u201d he said.",
    "He decried the suppression of such commemorations by local authorities, calling it a blatant violation of fundamental rights.",
    "In a call to action, Sumanthiran urged Sri Lanka to uphold its commitment to justice and accountability, both domestically and on the international stage. He stressed the imperative of addressing human rights violations and ensuring accountability for all parties involved in conflicts, regardless of political affiliation or power dynamics.",
    "The TNA MP reiterated the importance of signing the Rome Statute and embracing international standards of justice. He urged Sri Lanka to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine and to actively work towards a just and peaceful resolution to the conflict."
