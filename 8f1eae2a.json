    "Teachers will not be recruited for a three-year teaching diploma course at National Colleges of Education (NIE) in the future, but they will be assigned to a university established to produce teachers for a four-year degree, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.",
    "While participating in a programme to educate the principals on the development of education quality in the North-Western Province today (11) at the Sudesha Theater in Chillaw, he said all the 19 NIEs in existence now will be converted into a teacher training university and related faculties in the future.",
    "He said these NIEs will be kept under the purview of the Education Ministry with the approval of the University Grants Commission (UGC).",
    "No permission will be given to form trade unions because these universities will only accept teachers who pass out.",
    "The minister emphasized that it is the basic requirement to produce a disciplined group from this university, and a graduate teacher will be produced from this. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrma)"
