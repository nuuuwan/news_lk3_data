  "original_body_lines": [
    "The state-level data in the US shows that the country is \u201con the edge of recession\u201d, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody\u2019s.",
    "According to Zandi, who was among the first economists to predict the 2008 financial crisis, the states that make up nearly a third of the US gross domestic product (GDP) are currently either in recession or at high risk of entering one.",
    "\u201cBased on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,\u201d he wrote on social media platform X.",
    "Further, in an interview with Newsweek, Zandi said: \u201cFor the average American, that risk shows up in two ways. It means higher prices at the store, and it means job disruption across industries tied to food, goods, and transportation.\u201d",
    "\u201cPrices are already rising; you can see it in the data, but they\u2019re going to rise to a degree that it will be impossible for people to ignore. They will see it clearly in the things that they\u2019re buying on an everyday basis,\u201d he added.",
    "The economy is very close to a recession, based on data about spending, jobs, and manufacturing, he said, adding that he is worried about US tariffs hurting American companies\u2019 profits and ongoing troubles in the US housing market.",
    "Zandi also predicted that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7 per cent, will rise above 3 per cent and near 4 per cent by this time next year.",
    "States experiencing recessions are spread across the country, but the broader DC area stands out due to government job cuts, Zandi said.",
    "His analysis showed that southern states are generally the strongest, but their growth is slowing. California and New York, which together account for over a fifth of U.S. GDP, are holding their own, and their stability is crucial for the national economy to avoid a downturn",
    "Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were some of the states at recession risk.",
    "US consumers\u2019 spending in 2025 until July has barely budged from last year\u2019s end - worse than any year since 2008-09, indicating an economy on the brink of a recession, he noted."
