### எல்பிட்டிய தேர்தல் முடிவுகள் அபாயகர நிலைமைக்கான ஒரு முன் அறிவிப்பு - ஹிருணிக்கா

*2024-11-01 17:17:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197656) · `ta`

எல்பிட்டிய தேர்தல் முடிவுகள் அபாயகரமான நிலைமைக்கான ஒரு முன் அறிவிப்பாகும். தற்போதைய அரசாங்கத்துக்கு இது ஒரு சிறந்த முன்னறிவிப்பு இல்லை என்பது மாத்திரம் தெளிவாகிறது.

எதிர்க்கட்சியின் உறுப்பினராக இருந்த போது கூறிய விடயங்களை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவது எந்தளவு கடினமானது என்பதை ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திஸாநாயக்க தற்போது புரிந்து கொண்டிருப்பார் என முன்னாள் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் ஹிருணிகா பிரேமசந்திர தெரிவித்தார்.

கொழும்பிலுள்ள ஐக்கிய மக்கள் கூட்டணி அலுவலகத்தில் வெள்ளிக்கிழமை (01)  இடம்பெற்ற ஊடகவியலாளர் மாநாட்டில் இதனைத் தெரிவித்த அவர் மேலும் குறிப்பிடுகையில்,

எல்பிட்டிய தேர்தல் முடிவுகள் அபாயகரமான நிலைமைக்கான ஒரு முன் அறிவிப்பாகும். பிரதேசசபைக்கான தலைவரை தெரிவு செய்தல், வரவு - செலவு திட்டம் உள்ளிட்டவற்றை நிறைவேற்றிக் கொள்வதில் ஆளுங்கட்சி சவால்களை எதிர்கொள்ள வேண்டியேற்படும்.

ஓரிரு வாக்குகளால் இவை தீர்மானிக்கக் கூடிய சக்தியாக அமையும். எனவே தற்போதைய அரசாங்கத்துக்கு இது ஒரு சிறந்த முன்னறிவிப்பு இல்லை என்பது மாத்திரம் தெளிவாகிறது.

*2024-11-01 17:05:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197651) · `ta`

ஆட்சிக்கு வந்தவுடன் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியத்தின் செயற்திட்டத்தை மறுசீரமைப்பதாக  குறிப்பிட்ட ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவின் பொருளாதார கொள்கையை எவ்வித மாற்றமுமில்லாமல் தொடர்கிறார்.

ஆட்சிமாற்றத்தை ஏற்படுத்திய மக்கள் ஏமாற்றமடைந்துள்ளார்கள் என ஸ்ரீ லங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் தேசிய அமைப்பாளர் நாமல் ராஜபக்ஷ தெரிவித்தார்.

கொழும்பில் வெள்ளிக்கிழமை (01) இடம்பெற்ற ஸ்ரீ லங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் தொகுதி அமைப்பாளர் கூட்டத்தில் உரையாற்றுகையில் மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டார்.

அரசியல் ரீதியில் பல சவால்களை எதிர்கொண்டுள்ளோம். ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் போது எம்முடன் இருந்தவர்கள் குறுகிய அரசியல் தேவைகளுக்காக எம்மை விட்டுச் சென்றார்கள். அவ்வாறு சென்றவர்கள் இன்று அரசியலில் பாரிய நெருக்கடிகளை எதிர்கொண்டுள்ளார்கள்.

ஆகவே பாராளுமன்றத்தில் பிரதான எதிர்க்கட்சி பதவியை பொதுஜன பெரமுனவுக்கு வழங்குவார்கள் என்ற நம்பிக்கை உள்ளது.
