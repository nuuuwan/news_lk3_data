    "With global competition intensifying and domestic challenges mounting, the country\u2019s university system must evolve into a dynamic, innovation-led, industry-integrated ecosystem",
    "In an era where both academic and professional landscapes are evolving rapidly, it is increasingly important to examine how education systems adapt to emerging societal and industry needs. This article brings together two professionals with shared academic roots but distinctly different career trajectories, offering a unique lens through which to view educational reform.",
    "Both authors graduated from the University of Moratuwa in 1987. Since then, their paths have diverged in ways that enrich this dialogue. One author has built a distinguished academic career and now serves as a professor of wireless communication at the University of Oulu in Finland. The other has pursued a career in multidisciplinary civil engineering and asset management, currently contributing to the Australian Local Government Sector.",
    "Bringing together their collective experiences, this collaboration aims to explore reforms in higher education. One author will act as a facilitator, helping to extract and contextualise academic insights from the co-author\u2019s expertise.",
    "This article is the first in a three-part series. The next instalment will focus on vocational training reforms and will include input from an expert in the globally recognised corporate sector. Together, these contributions will highlight alternative pathways into para-professional careers and entry into university-level education, broadening the conversation around inclusive and adaptive education models. The final article focuses on human resource management strategies designed to support the successful delivery of education reforms across the public sector workforce.",
    "Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal moment in its educational journey. With global competition intensifying and domestic challenges mounting, the country\u2019s university system must evolve into a dynamic, innovation-led, industry-integrated ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from India\u2019s National Education Policy (NEP 2020) and its sweeping reforms, this blueprint outlines a bold, actionable strategy to reposition Sri Lanka\u2019s higher education sector as a driver of national development, talent retention, and foreign investment.",
    "To transform Sri Lanka\u2019s university system into a globally competitive, innovation-driven, and industry-aligned ecosystem that nurtures talent, attracts investment, and accelerates national progress.",

    "Make international collaboration a KPI: Senior academics must maintain active global research partnerships. Prioritise ties with institutions in India, Australia, the US, UK, EU, Canada, Japan, Korea, and Finland.",
    "Build a national research talent pool: Engage diaspora experts as adjunct faculty and visiting scholars. Offer competitive stipends to attract top-tier talent.",
    "nReform the Board of Investment (BoI): Appoint performance-driven leadership and set quarterly FDI targets in education, research, and high-tech sectors.",
    "nLink university reform to FDI strategy: Position university modernisation as a magnet for global companies offering co-location, research partnerships, and talent pipelines.",
    "nLaunch a national innovation mission: Inspired by India\u2019s Atal Innovation Mission, fund university incubators, student startups, and cross-disciplinary innovation hubs.",
    "End seniority-based promotions: Introduce performance-based evaluations across government institutions. Require English, IT, and finance certifications for SLAS recruits.",
    "Set time-bound institutional targets: Assign KPIs to all public institutions. Enforce accountability through leadership changes when targets are unmet.",
    "Promote a national service ethos: Launch a campaign from the highest levels of government: \u201cWorking for Sri Lanka is a privilege.\u201d Celebrate high-performing public servants and educators through a national honours system.",
    "Expand double degree programs: Strengthen collaborations with IITs and leading universities in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, and Asia. Develop joint PhDs, faculty exchanges, and shared research labs.",
