Who is the leadership of the Tamil party?I recently raised a question. Sumanthiran has answered that. In his reply, that is between our candidates in Vanni and Emilkanthan. He has given a response as if he did not descend to that level.

You are the one who entered politics through the National List of the National List. Sumanthiran does not need to get down for the problems in Vanni. That would not be a big deal for him.

Those who are unable to meet the needs of the people send their second -level members as candidates and subtle them subtle subtle success through them.

But in 2015, the Good Governance Government got 16 seats. We also get the post of Opposition Leader. In the Eight Administrative Districts in the North and East, the post of Chairman of the Development Committee in the North and East is the compliance politics and the development of the Tamil National Alliance?

### World beyond island borders

*2024-11-04 23:49:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/World-beyond-island-borders/4-768834) · `en`

Sri Lanka is an island. Such a geographical feature comes with good and bad. Physical isolation or not having a boundary shared with a neighbouring country gave us peace of mind on border conflicts. However, it did not prevent us from getting invaded by the nations with naval powers. Further, it allowed us to create unique cultural habits blended with the natural environment. We have our own Lepidoptera, birds, and flora and fauna. Free flow of people across the borders would have challenged our ethnic identities. In such a connected country, the competition among migrants for limited resources would have been high, causing tensions among people to win their fair share.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is deceiving people. Former parliamentarian Nimal Lansa said he was one of the speaking of the election platforms and a man who was sitting in the presidential seat.

He further stated at a public meeting held on Monday (4) in Katana area.

We are working to build a strong opposition party. It is unconventional that the winner has visited the Katana area for the failed party, not to Anuragumara Dissanayake.. Those who win the election should not think that they will win the next election. Success in the parliamentary election cannot be expected without fulfilling the promises made to the people.

The curse of seventy -five years, the people believed that the ministers had stolen, defrauded and corrupted.. But currently that hope has been lost. President Anura knows that the promises made on the election platform cannot be fulfilled.

### No change has been made by the government. False promises, people should not be fooled by false disguises

*2024-11-04 23:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197904) · `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



David Navaratnaraj warns against false promises. No real changes by government. Ranil Wickremesinghe supported, economy improved under him. Current campaign borrowing heavily. Police capable of handling crimes, no need for president intervention.

🟩

No change has been made by the government. David Navaratnaraj, who is contesting as the primary candidate in the UNP's elephant symbol in the Jaffna electoral district, said that the people should not be fooled by false promises and false disguises.

Yall. He said this during a media briefing held at the Media Center on Monday (4).

If he became president in 2005, he voted for Ranil Wickremesinghe and would not have been destroyed. Many people think he is furious. We do not think that politics is an error. It was because of the furious character that the country was restored from the economic downturn.

Today, many who have stood with Ranil Wickremesinghe have split for their own selfishness.Even the JVP continues to carry out the programs launched by Ranil Wickremesinghe. They were unable to carry out new jobs.

Egg prices, rice prices and coconut prices are high today. Ranil Wickremesinghe has now begun to rise again. The regime will go and topple within six months.

Claims Anura Kumara Government will also face similar repercussions like Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government if they have a parliament with immature politicians

Reveals poverty, education, housing and floods still need more attention to develop Colombo

I do not believe that there should always be experienced politicians in the parliament. There are two sides of the experienced politicians as some of them are capable of genuinely serving to fulfil people’s aspirations but others are capable of stealing public money. I think there should be a combination where experienced and budding politicians represent people at the parliament. Remember, we can’t rule a country with inexperienced parliamentarians

### “Cocoon” around heads of state: Is there one around President Anura Dissanayake already?

*2024-11-04 22:33:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Cocoon-around-heads-of-state-Is-there-one-around-President-Anura-Dissanayake-already/14-768828) · `en`

It is necessary to break this cocoon by appointing a council of economic advisers. The council must listen to the alternative perspectives specially based on research, empirical analysis and data. Then council members are required to submit an individual report in writing to the President based on which the President would have an enlightened discourse on the subject. The same principle of Continuous Improvement Process can be applied here by stopping the prevention of the flow of information to the top

The “cocoon” around heads of state refers to the insulating layer of advisors, staff, and bureaucrats who control access to the leader, sometimes filtering or distorting the flow of information. This phenomenon can prevent heads of state from receiving accurate, unfiltered information and limit their exposure to diverse perspectives. This is especially true when it comes to economic governance, the most crucial part of governance.

*2024-11-04 17:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197880) · `ta`

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's program lacks significant changes despite being in power for a month. His "prosperous country" vision contrasts with Ranil Wickremesinghe's "enabled Sri Lanka" plan. The government hasn't discussed IMF agreement amendments publicly. There's concern about transparency in international talks and the president's absence from key conferences. The opposition questions the need for an opposition party under Dissanayake's leadership.

🟩

There is no change in the government's program even after the end of a month's arrival in power. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's program is a prosperous country, or Ranil Wickremesinghe is a Sri Lankan.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the New Democratic Front's election office in Colombo.

A month has passed since the Anuragumara Dissanayake came to power and there is no change in their program.

So the prosperous country of the national people's power has not yet been implemented in the program of beautiful life manifesto.. If so.

What is the Cellulum Program with Anuragumara Dissanayake?Is the prosperous country a beautiful life program or Ranil Wickremasinghe's enabled Sri Lanka program?

But the government is looking at Ranil Wickremesinghe's program like that.

They said they would amend the agreements that the last government was doing with the International Monetary Fund.

### The NPP: A Month in Power

*2024-11-04 15:41:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-npp-a-month-in-power/) · `en`

It has been a month since Anura Kumara Dissanayake assumed the presidency, a month since the NPP claimed its place in history as the first party from outside of the political establishment to win a presidential election in Sri Lanka. Two weeks from now, the NPP will face another election, this time parliamentary. Depending on the results it gets, we will know whether the people approve of the NPP’s actions over the last four weeks and if they want it to continue. The NPP’s call for a powerful government is, in itself, not alarming: no government can survive without a majority in parliament. Yet it will need to convince Sri Lankans that it is the party they need – the party not of power, but of change.

### WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?

*2024-11-04 15:26:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/what-is-wrong-with-us/) · `en`

We are convinced (or conditioned to believe,) that we are an under-developed country and are destined to ever remain so. Should it really be such? Importantly, what should we do to erase this patronizing and degrading label? This mental complex has led us to be a cynical, despondent people. The past seven decades of Independence have driven us into the depths of despair. The worst part of this is that we have so driven our thoughts, to make this fear to become our reality.

We have failed to utilize our potential – be it in climate, human resources or other “development criteria”. This clearly needs to change. Perhaps, we are not the cat’s whiskers, nor certainly are we everybody’s chronic “dog’s body”.
