    "The order was made under the Online Security Act, which has been contested by democratic forces in Sri Lanka.",

    "The restraining order, which prohibits making and publishing false and hateful statements which would mislead the public against Thoradeniya, was issued by Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Ratnayake.",
    "After considering the submissions made by Senior Counsel Sudath Jayasundara instructed by K. Kanshayogan on behalf of the complainant Major General Ashoka Thoradeniya under Section 24 of the Online Security Act, No. 9 of 2024 against former North Central Provincial Council Member Indrananda de Silva, former Attorney General and President\u2019s Counsel Sanjay Rajaratnam and Attorney Sudath Jayasundara presented evidence before the Court on behalf of the complainant.",
