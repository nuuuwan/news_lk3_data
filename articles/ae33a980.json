    "It\u2019s a well-known fact that with Christmas comes some kind of chaos. The build-up tends to be a blur of gift buying, party prepping and worryingly high workloads; it\u2019s understandably difficult to find, let alone make, the time for yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s important that you do\u2026to make your skin healthier this Christmas",
    "Drinking plenty of water is always important. Dehydrated skin can look dry and flaky, with more visible fine lines and wrinkles. Water also rids the body of toxins, which is especially useful if you are having those Christmas drinks and eating more processed foods than usual.",
    "Remove dullness and reveal your inner radiance with a gentle exfoliating scrub. Opt for natural ingredients, like brown sugar, oats, or even coffee grounds mixed with honey. Massage in circular motions, focusing on areas like your nose, chin, and forehead. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat your skin dry.",
    "Fill a bowl with hot water, drape a towel over your head, and lean in for a relaxing five-minute steam. This opens your pores, allowing for deeper cleansing and better absorption of your skincare products.",
    "There\u2019s no substitute for a good night\u2019s sleep when it comes to healthy, glowing skin. Aim for 7-8 hours of uninterrupted rest to allow your skin to repair and rejuvenate itself. Create a relaxing bedtime routine with dimmed lights, calming music, and a good book to drift off to sleep peacefully.",
    "Christmas is a time for indulgence, but don\u2019t forget to nourish your skin from within. Load up on fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants and vitamins that will give your skin a natural healthy glow. Think berries, leafy greens, oranges, and sweet potatoes.",
    "Exercise is a natural mood booster and skin beautifier. Get moving with a brisk walk, a yoga session, or even dancing to your favourite Christmas tunes. The increased blood flow will leave your skin radiant and healthy.",
    "By following these simple tips, you can achieve a natural, healthy glow that will make you shine brighter than the Christmas lights. Yes, get ready to radiate confidence and joy!",
