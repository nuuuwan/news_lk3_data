Mannar: Multiethnic, multilingual, multireligious protests against ecological and livelihood destruction

Two former Navy chiefs whose wartime background was in naval intelligence, are incarcerated. The Government insists that it doesn’t decide to arrest anyone and that any such decisions are not taken by the political authorities but have been and are being taken quite independently by state authorities, i.e., state machinery that has been newly rendered independent by the NPP government.

If so, isn’t it a little odd that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made the following announcement to an audience of Sri Lankans in New York City?

‘…President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday bomb attacks are continuing and advancing and that one or two former Army officials are expected to be arrested over the incident…

…”Several former military officials are to be arrested soon and investigations are both continuing and advancing.”…’

The Israeli navy has intercepted boats carrying aid to Gaza and detained the activists aboard, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry said several vessels that form part of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) had been “safely stopped” and that those aboard were being transferred to an Israeli port.

It added that the navy had told the vessels to change course as they were “approaching an active combat zone”.

The GSF described the interception as “illegal” and “not an act of defence” but “a brazen act of desperation”.

The group has alleged that one vessel within the flotilla was “deliberately rammed at sea” and said additional boats were hit by water cannons.

“It clearly reveals the extreme lengths to which the occupier will go to ensure Gaza remains starved and isolated,” GSF wrote on social media.

“They will attack a peaceful civilian mission because the success of humanitarian aid means the failure of their siege.”

### Fitch confirms Sri Lanka CCC+ sovereign rating

*2025-10-01 22:14:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/fitch-confirms-sri-lanka-ccc-sovereign-rating-242525/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka’s CCC+ sovereign rating saying external finances are stable, and growth is resuming despite US tariffs.

“We expect full-year growth at 4.4 percent, with 3.8 percent in 2026 and 3.6 percent in 2027,” the rating agency said.

“US tariffs will be a growth headwind, but the revised reciprocal tariff rate of 20 percent is now in line with peers, reducing risks to exports.

“We see low average inflation, but to rise gradually to 5 percent in 2027, in line with the CBSL’s inflation target.”

Sri Lanka’s macro-economists created a series of currency crises with its 5 percent inflation target, ousted two elected administrations and triggered a sovereign default using inflationary open market operations and buy-sell swaps to inject money, critics have said.

### Actor Vijay’s statewide tour called off days after 41 died in Karur rally stampede

Actor-politician Vijay’s party, TVK, has suspended his statewide tour for two weeks after a stampede in Tamil Nadu’s Karur claimed 41 lives and triggered massive outrage.

The TVK announced the decision to suspend Vijay’s tour through its official X handle. “In this situation where we are in pain and sorrow over the loss of our loved ones, the public meeting programme of our party leader for the next two weeks is being temporarily postponed. New details regarding these public meetings will be announced later,” a post read.

This was expected as Vijay is yet to meet the families of the 41 victims, although he announced a relief of Rs. 2 million for each family. Yesterday, in a recorded video, Vijay said he would meet the families soon. The stampede has also triggered a sense of fear among the party cadre and the public. The police, too, would look at the venues more closely, and a lot needs to be done by both sides to restore public confidence.
