Over the past decade, CEAT has built a strong agricultural portfolio, and with CAMSO\u2019s expertise in compact construction equipment tracks and tyres, the combined strengths open doors to over 40 global OEMs and premium international OHT distributors. Michelin will exit from activities related to compact line bias tyres and construction tracks.",

India has been the largest source of FDI in Sri Lanka in recent years and I am delighted to see that trend continue. The deepening of the investment-led partnership between the two countries has been catalyzed by the leadership of both countries. It supports their vision of building a future of shared prosperity for our peoples. With India\u2019s private sector investing in Sri Lanka, I\u2019m confident that the economic and commercial relationship between the two countries will continue to strengthen.\u201d",
