    "Prosecutors also said the Adanis and another executive at Adani Green Energy, former CEO Vneet Jaain, raised more than $3 billion in loans and bonds by hiding their corruption from lenders and investors.",
    "According to the indictment, some conspirators referred privately to Gautam Adani with the code names \u201cNumero uno\u201d and \u201cthe big man,\u201d while Sagar Adani allegedly used his cellphone to track specifics about the bribes.",
    "The Adani Group has not responded to requests for comment on the indictment.",
