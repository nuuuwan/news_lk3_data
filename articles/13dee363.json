    "I write this because I love travelling by train and am very sad about the condition of Sri Lanka Railways and train travel in this beautiful island. In recent times, several of my planned train trips had to be cancelled causing great inconvenience due to sudden train service disruptions, including derailments, breakdowns and cancellations.",
    "Train travel is both cheap and environment friendly. Trains carry a large number of passengers and hence cause lower Carbon emissions per capita than do cars. Public Transport, in general is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly for a country in a Debt trap and IMF austerity program.",
    "Rather than rushing to buy expensive Electric Vehicles (EVs), for a costly Green Energy Transition promoted by various United Nations Agencies and Greenwash Corporations, the GOSL should urgently make Public Transport, particularly, investing in and upgrading the Sri Lanka Railways a top development priority at this time.",
    "Several studies have shown that labour force participation, particularly of women, increases when there is good public transport available. Of course, the Sri Lanka Railways that started operating in the 1850s still carries out a valuable service to the nation but it could be far more efficient, effective, modern, and passenger friendly.",
    "There is an urgent need for a reliable train service to better serve passengers, whether occasional travelers or daily commuters, in addition to upgrading and maintenance of many stations with a high volume of passengers, such as the Colombo Fort station.",
    "The Colombo-Jaffna Yal Devi Train has not been running since January this year due to purported construction of the Railway line between Mahawa and Anurdhapura. Passengers are forced to take private coaches instead.",
    "The Maho-Anuradhapura stretch constitutes 67 killometers of the 405 Km Colombo-Jaffna trip. Should this railway line upgrade, which just one sixth of the entire Colombo Jaffna route, take so long and are they now using the absolutely predictable arrival of the South West Monsoon Rains in May to further delay this construction and the operation of the Yal Devi?",
    "Last year when a friend and I tried to take the early morning train from Batticaloa back to Colombo it was suddenly cancelled. We discarded the tickets and hired a car for our trip back to Colombo.\u00a0 So too, last year, my one and only train journey on the Kandy Intercity Express train from Colombo to the University of Peradeniya had to be aborted when a lorry purportedly got stuck across the train tracks and the Intercity express train was delayed by 4 hours. I was unable to reach the meeting on time.",
    "High Number of Incidents, Erosion of Public Trust, a Push to Privatization?",
    "Given the incredible list of seemingly small and random train accidents and incidents (listed below), in the past few months that appeared in major newspapers, the question arises do these amount to a pattern?",
    "Are there subtle attempts to sabotage the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR), damage passenger confidence, reduce the number of passengers and the SLR\u2019s profits and then privatize it?\u00a0 Sri Lanka National Railway has extensive and valuable lands.",
    "In the wake of the economically devastating two years of Covid-19 Lockdown and Economic Meltdown when the Railways was shut down and infrastructure crumbled, there appears to be (hybrid) attempts to sabotage train travel, reduce passenger volumes and privatize Sri Lanka Railways. SLR also has a lot of valuable state lands that are being targeted in the IMF fire-sale?",
    "Recall that the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), project which was aborted in 201r had targeted the Sri Lanka Railways, also with a proposal for a train track from the BIA International Airport in the Southwest of strategic Sri Lanka to the Trincomalee Harbour on the North East Coast.",
    "Disruption of Sri Lanka Railways at this time appear be both internally and externally driven: These include strikes and labour union activities and actions or inaction of other railway employees. There have also been apparently random incidents of lorries running into train infrastructure or trees falling across railway lines, as well as, staged climate \u2018disasters\u201d.",
    "Given the high number of disruption in the Railway services which appear to form a pattern, it is incumbent on the Minister of Transport to conduct an inquiry and analysis of the entire railway system and infrastructure in a systematic fashion.\u00a0 So too, should not the head of SLR take note of and act upon the regular disruptions and delays of the Sri Lanka Railways, also given the inconvenience caused to Passengers?",
    "Please see below a random sample from the national newspapers of incidents that have caused delay and disruption of Sri Lanka Railway services in the past months and make your own assessments.",
