    "The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has achieved a significant milestone in environmental governance and service quality with its recent ISO 9001:2015 certification, awarded to eight of its provincial offices by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution, said CEA Director General P.B. Hemantha Jayasinghe.",
    "Jayasinghe said that the Northern, Eastern, North Central, Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Southern and North Western Provincial offices now uphold this international standard, ensuring that quality management processes are in place across various environmental services.",
    "He also said that in a bid to further enhance institutional performance, the CEA\u2019s Head Office and Western Provincial Office also initiated steps to obtain ISO 9001:2015 certification earlier in 2023. This achievement aligns with the authority\u2019s broader goals of quality assurance and continuous improvement, as outlined in its Quality Management System (QMS) framework, which is designed to address numerous service areas, including pollution control, waste management, air quality monitoring, environmental assessments and public engagement.",
    "The ISO 9001:2015 certification reflects the CEA\u2019s dedication to service excellence and strengthens its role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Established under the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, the CEA\u2019s regulatory framework and internal guidelines are reinforced by this QMS, ensuring robust environmental conservation and management practices throughout Sri Lanka.",
    "The CEA formally informed Prabath Chandrakeerthi, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Wildlife, Forest Resources, Water Supply, Plantations and Community Infrastructure of its landmark achievement recently. The event saw the participation of key ministry officials, including Additional Secretaries Mrs. Padma Abeykoon and P.K.S. Subodhani, as well as senior CEA officers. Among them was Director General P.B. Hemantha Jayasinghe, whose initiative led to the establishment of the QMS, and Deputy Director General N.S. Gamage, responsible for overseeing environmental management and evaluation.",
    "With this certification, the CEA is well-positioned to deliver better services and promote environmental sustainability, reinforcing its commitment to environmental protection and the well-being of Sri Lankan communities.",
