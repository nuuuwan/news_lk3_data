    "The 1.6-mile (2.57 km) long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, USA collapsed in the early hours of Tuesday after a container ship hit it, and as many as seven people may be in the water, officials said.",
    "A live video posted on YouTube showed a ship hitting the bridge, after which several of its spans collapsed into the Patapsco River. Unverified videos posted on social media X also showed the impact and collapse. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.",
    "The Baltimore City Fire Department described the collapse as a mass-casualty incident, and said workers were searching for seven people in the river.",
    "\u201cWe received several 911 calls at around 1:30 am, that a vessel struck the Key Bridge in Baltimore, causing the collapse. This is currently a mass casualty incident and we are searching for seven people who are in the river,\u201d Kevin Cartwright, director of communications for the Baltimore Fire Department told Reuters.",
