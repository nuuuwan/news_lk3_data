    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Western Province had increased its share of gross domestic product to 43.4 percent from 42.6 percent in 2022, when the country suffered the worst currency crisis in the history of the central bank.",
    "The steepest falls in shares were seen in the East and the North.",
    "The Western province has more services and industries allowing more value to be added.",
    "\u201cThe strong presence of the Western province is visible in most of the economic activities, especially in Services and Industry sectors,\u201d the central bank said.",
    "The North Western province had increased the share to 11.2 percent in 2022 from 11.1 percent and Uva to 4.9 percent from 4.8 percent.",
    "The Eastern Province\u2019s share fell to 5.2 percent from 5.5 percent, the Northern Province to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent, Southern to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent, Sabaragamuwa to 7.1 percent from 7.2 percent.",
    "\u201cServices activities predominantly contributed to the economies of all the provinces. Accordingly, Southern (59.9 per cent) and Western (58.5 per cent) provinces recorded the highest Services shares,\u201d the central bank said.",
    "\u201cRegarding the Industry activities, the highest concentration was observed in Western province (34.4 per cent), followed by North Western province (32.0 per cent).\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank compiled the provincial share from nominal national (with inflation) GDP estimates made by the Department of Census and Statistics.",
    "Nominal GDP grew to 24.1 trillion rupees from 17.6 trillion a year earlier as the currency collapsed from 200 to 360 to the US dollar, spurred by a surrender rule (strong side convertibility) in a failed attempt to float (suspend convertibility).",
    "Sri Lanka suffered a series of currency crisis after the end of a 30-year war, due to deliberate rate cuts enforced with inflationary open market operations blowing holes in the balance of payments without a war.",
    "After 2015 the process of printing money for growth or macro-economic policy got formalized as targeting \u2018potential output\u2019 as the IMF taught the central bank to calculate a supposed potential output which can be bridged by printing money.",
    "Sri Lanka was hit by the worst bout of deliberate macro-economic policy from 2020 when rates were cut with printed money and taxes were also cut, blowing the biggest holes in the BOP seen in the history of the central bank, as well as some of the worst trade and exchange controls since the 1970s."
