    "Rotary has been a beacon of hope in the fight against breast cancer, working hand-in-hand with the Ministry of Health for 20 years since 2004. This partnership with the National Cancer Control Programme has been instrumental in addressing breast cancer, which remains the leading cause of death among women aged 40 to 55 years.",
    "Rotary\u2019s journey began 20 years ago with the sole focus on screening and early detection and prevention to fight the rising incidence of cancer. Together with NCCP they set up a dedicated Cancer Screening and Early Detection Centre focused on breast cancer, first in Colombo and then extended to other cities to ensure no woman is left behind. These regional Breast Cancer Early Detection Clinics will bring lifesaving services closer to those who need them most.",

This machine provides highly accurate screenings for breast cancer, five days a week, entirely free of charge. This represents Rotary\u2019s unwavering commitment to ensuring early detection, which is key to improving breast cancer survival rates.",
