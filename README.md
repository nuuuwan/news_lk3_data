Daily Mirror has decided to take action to publish a gazette notification, as more than 200 experts are at risk of retirement in the wake of the unrest and uncertainty of not being released in the retirement age of doctors.

Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa has submitted a new note on the issue, with the Appeal Court's decision to continue the retirement age of doctors who specialize in state hospitals, as in effect from 2018, has been issued by the Court of Appeal.

The delay in publishing the circular or gazette has threatened more than 200 special doctors in Sri Lanka at risk of retirement.

Despite the decision of the Court of Appeal to extend the retirement age of special doctors in government hospitals to 63 and the Cabinet approval on June 19, 2024, the Ministry of Public Administration has delayed the implementation of the decision in the form of an official circular or gazette.

### Sri Lankan jailed for 37 years for killing wife with axe in front of teenage children

A killer has been jailed for 37 years for murdering his wife with an axe in front of their teenage children, in what a judge has described as a brutal and horrific attack.

Dinush Kurera, 47, blinked and looked straight ahead as Victorian Supreme Court Justice Amanda Fox handed down his sentence today.

Kurera claimed he was acting in self-defence when he repeatedly stabbed his wife Nelomie Perera with an axe and knife at her Melbourne home on December 3, 2022.

But a jury rejected his story and in August found him guilty of murder after only three hours of deliberations.

Justice Fox described the fatal attack as brutal and horrific, saying Kurera had clearly been in a rage.

“You were motivated by anger and saw everything of the prism of entitlement and ownership,” she said in her sentence.

“In your mind, Nelomie deserved to be killed for leaving you, excluding you from your house and seeing other men.”

### Sri Lanka rupee depreciates to 292.70/293.00 to US dollar, bonds up

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee depreciated steeply to 292.70/293.00 to the US dollar in the spot market, from 291.25/50 to the US dollar the previous day, while bond yields were up, dealers said.

Analysts had warned that if excess liquidity was allowed to build up, including from acquisition of dollars, the currency will weaken when they are used for imports as domestic prices are pushed up from higher demand.

If domestic demand and credit is pushed up from liquidity from central bank dollar rupee swaps the same consequence will happen as there was no commitment to defend the currency against excess liquidity under a so-called flexible exchange rate.

Flexible exchange rates, coupled with money printed to reach high cost of living targets, have triggered social unrest and also sovereign default in reserve collecting central banks.

A bond maturing on 15.09.2027 was quoted at 9.75/80 percent.

A bond maturing on 15.02.2028 was quoted at 10.10/15 percent.

ඉස්ලාම් දහමට අපහාස කළේ යැයි ගොනුකර ඇති නඩුවක විත්තිකරුවකු ලෙස නම්කර සිටින බොදු බල සේනා සංවිධානයේ මහලේකම්  පූජ්‍ය ගලගොඩඅත්තේ ඥානසාර හිමියන් නඩුව කැඳවූ අවස්ථාවේ අද අධිකරණයේ පෙනී නොසිටීම හේතුවෙන් මෙලෙස වරෙන්තු නිකුත් කෙරුණි.

මෙම නඩුවේ තීන්දුව අද (දෙසැම්බර් 19 වැනිදා)  ප්‍රකාශයට පත් කිරීමට නියමිතව තිබිණි.

උන්වහන්සේ මේවන විට ශ්‍රී ජයවර්ධනපුර රෝහලේ  නේවාසිකව ප්‍රතිකාර ලබන බවත් මෙම නඩුව සඳහා වෙනත් දිනයක් ලබා දෙන ලෙසත් නීතිඥවරයා අධිකරණයෙන් ඉල්ලා සිටියේ ය.

ඉදිරිපත් වූ කරුණු සලකා බැලූ කොළඹ අතිරේක මහේස්ත්‍රාත් පසන් අමරසේන විසින් නඩු තීන්දුව ප්‍රකාශ කිරීම 2025 ජනවාරි මස 09 වනදා තෙක් කල් තබනු ලැබීය.

ඒ අනුව ඥානසාර හිමි අත්අඩංගුවට ගෙන අධිකරණයට ඉදිරිපත් කරන ලෙස මහේස්ත්‍රාත්වරයා නියෝග කළේය.

Scars from bullying in schools are permanent, some are on medications, and it has led to a very poor quality of life

Bullying is when someone repeatedly and on purpose hurts someone else who is usually weaker than them. As a society we have repeatedly pointed fingers at the political class for their poor behaviour. Recent election results suggest we decided to do something about it. Few have had the courage to look at a more sinister problem staring them straight in the face. Most people either have first-hand experience or witnessed bullying during their time in school and have chosen to ignore or supress those memories.

### Children first: Proposal for protection and promotion of child rights submitted to President

Child protection has become a national crisis in our paradise island

Stop Child Cruelty Trust (SCCT) and Child Protection Alliance (CPA) comprising 13 credible organisations committed to protect and promote the rights of children have appealed to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to elevate child welfare to the heart of national governance ushering a new dawn firmly focusing on the true beneficiaries of the future, our children first.

The ‘Summary proposal for the protection and promotion of child rights – A dawn of a new era’ highlights that citizens under the age of 18 years constitute 25% of Sri Lanka’s population. Although Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1991, child protection has become a national crisis in our paradise island. The proposal defines the objectives that GOSL should focus on as short-term (0-6 months), medium-term (6 months-2 years) and long-term (2-4 years).

The Christmas season is a special time filled with joy, excitement, and giving. However, this year, the festive season occurs during a period of global complexity, including the cost-of-living crisis and the absence of peace in many regions. Parents might use this time to teach children about empathy and kindness as an alternative approach to the joy of giving. It is meaningful to remind younger individuals that giving takes many forms—kindness, listening, perspective, and joy. While many children eagerly await gifts from the North Pole, it is important for them to recognise that the season encompasses much more than wrapped presents.

### Lessons from Bangladesh’s foreign power purchases

Why are these countries scrambling for dollars to pay for essential electricity?

The core question all energy-importing countries face is dependence. Modern societies cannot function without electricity. The cost of not having electricity is almost always higher than even the cost of buying emergency power. How can a government allow such matters to be controlled by foreign companies or governments?

“Did you hear that Adani is refusing to supply Bangladesh with electricity?” a friend asked me recently. I knew it was a loaded question, my friend being a nationalist. “You recall we had no power because we couldn’t pay for shiploads of fuel and coal just a few years back?” I asked back.
