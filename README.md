I often wonder whether our nation’s founders ever paused to reflect before adopting the foundational principles of Democratic, Socialist, and Republic to define the country. A nation’s self-identification shapes not only its domestic policies but also its relationship with its people and its place in the world. Misinterpreting or inconsistently applying these terms risks deep conflict, ideological, institutional, and social, which we have adequately experienced. Before judging the merits of this identity, we must return to the fundamentals of democracy: does it serve some of the people some of the time, or all of the people all of the time?
