    "Certain media reports which try to spread the news that SriLankan Airlines has lost its essential workers due to a recent retirement scheme (VRS) is completely inaccurate and without basis, the national airline said yesterday.",
    "The airline, like many other local organizations across industries, is facing a talent drain in the wake of the economic crisis, and this is not in any way linked to a VRS, it said.",
    "\u201cSriLankan Airlines has not initiated a VRS in the past two years. The Airline has created a unified workforce that has made many sacrifices and contributions along the way to ensure seamless operations. The airline has further taken new measures to retain skilled employees in all areas of the organization with necessary training and tools to cover for any temporary shortfall in human resources. The Airline is also continuing to work with the Government of Sri Lanka on the restructuring process,\u201d it said.",
