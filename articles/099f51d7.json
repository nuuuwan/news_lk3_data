    "(This article was first written in 2018  for the \u201cSpotlight\u201d column in the \u201cDaily Financial Times\u201d to commemorate the 30th death anniversary of popular actor-politician Vijaya Kumaratunga. It was subsequently posted on my blog. The article is being re-posted without any changes to denote the 37th  death anniversary of Vijaya on Feb 16th 2025)",
    "Popular film actor- politician Vijaya Kumaratunga was shot dead in cold blood on  February 16th 1988. He was standing near the front gate of his Kirulapone residence on Polhengoda road and talking to an acquaintance when the assailants on a two-wheeler struck. Vijaya was shot twice in the back and fell on the ground.The gunman then got off the motor cycle pillion and walked up to  Vijaya lying motionless  and pumped more bullets into his head and face. Thus ended the life of a charismatic leader  who may very well have altered the destiny of this nation if he  were not cruelly killed at the age of 42.",
    "Thirty-seven  years have passed since the brutal assassination of Vijaya Kumaratunga but the handsome filmstar-politico remains evergreen  in the collective memory of his numerous fans and followers. In his thespian career of  more than two decades , the dashing and debonair Vijaya enthralled millions of film goers with his scintillating screen performances. He acted in 114 films in all. Several of his films were released after his death. Almost all of his films were financial successes. Due to the political machinations in the cinema sphere, Vijaya was seldom bedecked with laurels for his acting skills but as far as the film going masses were concerned , he was their popular idol. Vijaya starred mainly in \u2013 run of the mill- movies that entertained  but he did act in  some films that were different and made a difference  too. Like  Sinhala cinema\u2019s Super Star  Gamini Fonseka, Vijaya Kumaratunga too was commercially valued and artistically acclaimed as  a film actor.",
    "Acting was his accredited profession but politics was Vijaya Kumaratunga\u2019s chosen vocation.Possessing left-leaning views  and also being closely related to Prof.Carlo Fonseka , Vijaya was involved with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party(LSSP) in his youthful days. He later  joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) and  became it\u2019s  Katana organizer. Vijaya contested the Katana constituency unsuccessfully against Wijepala Mendis  in 1977. He married into the first family of the SLFP  in February 1978 by wooing and winning the hand of Chandrika Bandaranaike.",
    "Vijaya plunged zestfully into SLFP politics and was the livewire behind the Island -wide campaigns protesting the deprivation of Mrs. Sirima Bandaranaike\u2019s civic rights in 1980 and the Presidential campaign of Hector Kobbekkaduwe in 1982. He was unjustly victimised by the JR Jayawardene regime and locked up as a suspected \u201cNaxalite\u201d for months without a trial. In May 1983 Vijaya contested the Mahara electorate  for the SLFP in a by -election and lost by a narrow margin.",
    "In 1984 he broke away from the SLFP along with Chandrika and others like TB Ilangaratne and Ratnasiri Wickramanayake  to form the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya(SLMP). The SLMP had a broad,refreshing political perspective. Its advent on the Sri Lankan political horizon was like fresh rain pouring on dry, parched earth.  in 1986 Vijaya contested the Minneriya by-election on behalf of the newly formed SLMP.The UNP  won but  Vijaya came second pushing the SLFP to third place.",
    "Vijaya Kumaratunga  had an accommodative approach towards the long festering ethnic crisis. He led a delegation to meet Tamil militant leaders in Tamil Nadu in 1985 and also chief minister M.G.Ramachandran.He also went to Jaffna in 1986  when the peninsula was dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) and met with Tiger leader Sathasivampillai Krishnakumar alias \u201cKIttu\u201d and his spokesperson Srikumar Kanagaratnam alias \u201cRahim\u201d. Vijaya also welcomed the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 thereby incurring the wrath of the Rohana Wijeweera -led Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP). He was killed by the JVP  just four days before his tenth wedding anniversary on Feb 20th. As I stated earlier the history of Sri Lanka may have been entirely different had not Vijaya Kumaratunga been cut down so cruelly in the prime of his life.",
    "This weeks \u201cSpotlight\u201d shines on Vijaya Kumaratunga to  both denote his 30th death anniversary and  also to pay tribute to this illustrious and noble son of Sri Lanka . Since the \u201cSpotlight\u201d column is  mainly devoted to films, film personalities and film related matters, the article will  avoid the political dimensions of Vijaya Kumaratunga\u2019s life and instead focus  more on his many -splendoured  cinematic career. It must also be noted that Vijaya\u2019s surname  was originally spelled as \u201cKumaranatunga\u201d.It was as Vijaya Kumaranatunga that he blazed a trail on screen. Subsequently the name was modified to \u201cKumaratunga\u201d. I shall be referring to him as Kumaratunga in this article though he was actually  known as Kumaranatunga for the greater part of his life. Also his name has been spelled as both \u201cWijaya\u201d and \u201cVijaya\u201d. I shall refer to him as Vijaya.",
    "It was in 1975 that I saw Vijaya Kumaratunga in the flesh for the first time.  I had not entered journalism then. He was coming out through the gates  of a private hospital on High Street (WA De Silva Mawatte) in Wellawatte in a red car.Clad in a tee-shirt and trousers,Vijaya  was in the driver\u2019s seat with strongman actor Piyadasa Gunasekara by his side. A bunch of girls going along the road had seen Vijaya in the car and surrounded the vehicle. Soon others including myself gathered around.",
    "The giggling girls entered into good-humoured bantering with him. Vijaya gave back in style cracking jokes effortlessly. A few got his autograph. After what seemed an eternity , Vijaya got the permission of his fans to leave. The crowd parted and Vijaya drove away waving and smiling. The girls who mobbed him were delightfully dazed.One of them remarked loudly\u201dAney Bonikka vaage ney\u201d( Oh! like a doll, no?). \u201cPirisudhu Muhuna\u201d(pure face) said another I had seen many of his films before but this was the first time I had seen him off \u2013 screen. I was impressed by his simplicity, aaccesibility and cheerful rapport with his \u201cunknown\u201d fans.",
    "The next time I saw Vijaya was on the night of July 21st 1977. It was election day and I as a cub reporter on the  Tamil Daily \u201cVirakesari\u201d was at the main  counting centre and returning office at Royal College. The results were trickling in. Vijaya dressed in white came inside along with  another Sinhala film actor (Either Boniface Fernando or Roy de Silva). Vijaya was the SLFP candidate for Katana. He walked around with a smile and then seeing us journalists came over to exchange pleasantries.",
    "1977 was the year when Tamil Nadu actor M.G.Ramachandran(MGR) was tasting political success in India as the founder-leader of the All \u2013 India Anna -Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (AIADMK). I introduced myself and asked Vijay whether he was the MGR of Sri Lankan politics. He laughed loud and said he wished he were MGR and replied that he had a long way to go before he could ever be compared to MGR.",
    "As is well known the SLFP was utterly routed by the UNP at the 1977 polls. Wijepala Mendis who was the Katana sitting MP defeated Vijaya Kumaratunga by a majority of  4212 votes.  Wijepala  polled  23,950 to Vijaya\u2019s 19,738. When the Katana result was announced Vijaya had left but a triumphant Wijepala Mendis remained. After congratulating Mendis I asked him what it felt like to defeat Vijaya Kumaatunga the MGR of Sri Lankan politics. Mendis guffawed and said \u201cAiyo,  What is his  experience in politics compared to me? Who is this fellow born day before yesterday?\u201d. Wijepala Mendis was right then but as the years progressed Vijaya Kumaratunga not only established himself as a film hero but also played a heroic role in politics achieving great stature. In later years I got a few opportunities to meet and converse with Vijaya Kumaratunga. He was always open,frank, amiable and courteous.",
    "Kovilage Vijaya Anthony Kumaratunga was born in Seeduwa on October 9th 1945 to Roman Catholic parents.His father Kovilage Benjamin Kumaratunga as well as his paternal grandfather Mudaliyar Jayagris Kumaratunga served as village headmen of Seeduwa. Vijaya\u2019s mother Clara Beatrice Perera hailed from Madahamulla a village between Minuwangoda and Divulapitiya.",
    "Vijaya had his early schooling at Kandana and then enrolled at St.Benedict\u2019s College,Kotahena. Vijaya excelled in singing,drama and   oratory during schooldays and won gold medals frequently. He also led the College Sinhala debating team. When the SLFP Government of 1960-65 nationalised  private schools in 1961, the Catholic Church running hundreds of schools throughout the Island protested vehemently. Vijaya however belonged to a progressive school of thought among Catholics that welcomed the schools take-over, This created problems for Vijaya at St.Benedicts.So in 1962  Vijaya  left St. Benedict\u2019s College and joined De Mazenod College in Kandana  where he completed his secondary education.",
    "Young Vijaya\u2019s first love was not to act on screen but to don a khaki uniform. He wanted to become a sub-inspector of Police. From childhood Vijaya had wanted to be a Policeman but his family notably his mother objected strongly. Nevertheless he remained steadfast in his ambition and applied for a Sub-Inspector post.He was selected  for an interview but the tears and wails of his beloved mother resulted in him abandoning the idea reluctantly.",
    "Vijaya now began to think of a career in acting. He made contact with the \u201cApey Kattiya\u201ddrama group of Sugathapala de Silva and made himself available. He went to see almost every performance  of the group. Vijaya also enrolled at the Serendib Art Centre run by Shesha Palihakkara to learn dancing. Shesha Palihakkara had co- produced several films like  \u201d Ran Muthu Duwa\u201d, \u201cGetawarayo\u201d and \u201cSarawita\u201d. Palihakkara wanted to produce a film about the legendary warrior Puran Appu who rebelled against the British. This was many years before Lester James Peries made \u201cVeera Puran Appu\u201d in 1979.",
    "Palihakkara picked  Vijaya Kumaratunga to play Fransiscu Fernando/Puran Appu and Wally Nanayakkara to act  as Gongalegoda Banda/King David in his film. Vijaya was highly excited and went to fellow Benedictine and reputed stuntmaster cum action star Robin Fernando to learn fighting techniques and horse riding. But Palihakkara\u2019s \u201cPuran Appu\u201d never saw the light of day. Vijaya was sorely disappointed but was consoled when he got an offer to act and sing in a musical drama \u201cSithijaye\u201d for which the words were  written by T.Kuruwita Bandara  and the music composed by  Premasiri Khemadasa. The music maestro Khemadasa Master was highly impressed by Vijaya.",
    "It was the Khemadasa master connection which  enabled Vijaya to get his first break in  films.  The well -known film editor T. Bawanandan was directing a film called \u201cManamalayo \u201c.  The film starring Tony Ranasinghe,Joe Abeywickrema and Shiranee Kurukulasuriya had Khemadasa  composing music. Bawanandan was looking for some new faces to  act in minor roles. Khemadasa master recommended Vijaya who was given a small part. Finally Vijaya got his first break in films. \u201cManamalayo\u201d  was released in March 1967. This was Vijaya Kumaratunga\u2019s first screen role.",
    "Vijaya kept on trying to act in films.Once he heard that Lester James Peries was looking for a young man to act in his next film.  The film was \u201cAkkara Paha\u201d based on a novel by Madawala S.Ratnayake. Lester needed someone to play the male protagonist Sena. Vijaya made his way to Lester\u2019s residence  very early in the  morning and seated himself on the Verandah. When Lester was awake, the director was  told that a young man was seated in front for more than an hour for an interview with him. Peries went out  to speak to this \u201coutstandingly handsome young man\u201d( in Lester\u2019s own words). Unfortunately for Vijaya, Lester had already signed up Milton Jayawardene to play the lead role Sena. Peries told Kumaratunga that he would have certainly cast Vijaya  in the role but  he had already signed on another actor and it was too late now. The director asked Vijaya to keep in touch with him and promised that he would consider him for another role in a new film.",
    "Relating  the incident in the book of interviews \u201cLester on Lester\u201d compiled by Kumar de Silva, the doyen of Sinhala film directors says \u2013 \u201d The young man happened to be Vijaya Kumaratunga who went on to become the greatest icon in Sri Lankan cinema\u201d. Lester goes on to say \u201cIn life you have things that simply slip through your fingers. I regretted not having given him (Vijaya) even a small part even to massage my ego in saying that I \u2018discovered\u2019 Vijaya. But it is that I did not have the luck to  provide him with that breakthrough role\u201d.",
    "So Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost film maker Lester James Peries was not destined to \u201cdiscover\u201d Vijaya Kumaatunga and cast him in a  distinctive role. That honour went to two directors who cast Vijaya almost simultaneously in their films which were released almost together. One director was  Sugathapala Senerath Yapa who made  \u201cHantane Kathawa\u201d with Tony Ranasinghe and Swarna Mallawarachchi. The other was G.D.L. Perera who  made \u201cRomeo Juliet Kathawak\u201d with actors like Rukmani Devi, Douglas Ranasinghe,Joe Abeywickrema and Piyadasa Gunasekara. But Lester himself was to utilise Vijaya Kumaratuga\u2019s acting skills for three of his films.",
    "The first  in 1975 was for  \u201cThe God King\u201d  Lester\u2019s historical film about Kassapa of Sigiriya. The Eastman colour film in English produced by Dimitri de Grundwald had western actors like Leigh Lawson, Oliver Tobias and Geoffrey Russell playing the main roles of Kassapa,Migara and Dhatusena respectively. But Sri Lankans such as Ravindra Randeniya, Iranganie Serasinghe, Joe Abeywickrema, Douglas Wickremasinghe and Mano Breckenridge played the other roles. Vijaya Kumaratunga acted the part of Lalith in \u201cThe God King\u201d which was  the only English film that he has acted in.",
    "The second of Lester\u2019s films in which Vijaya acted was \u201cAhasin Polowata\u201d released in 1978. The film was based on a novel written by Eileen Siriwardene, a teacher who later became the principal of Visakha Vidyalaya in Colombo. Eileen was the wife of DBIPS Siriwardene one of Sri Lanka\u2019s finest civil servants and an accomplished  linguistic scholar with a double doctorate. The film had Tony Ranasinghe in the lead with Sriyani Amarsena and Vasanthi Chathurani. Vijaya Kumaratunga played second lead in the role of a Doctor friend. The film was shot in 23 days.",
    "The third and last  Lester James Peries film in which Vijaya Kumaratunga acted in was \u201cBeddegama\u201d  the  Sinhala film version of  the Leonard Woolf novel \u201cThe village in the jungle\u201d. The colour film was released in 1980. \u201cBeddegama\u201d had artistes like Joe Abeywickrema,Malani Fonseka, Henry Jayasena,Trilicia Gunawardena, Nadeeka Gunasekara  and Tony Ranasinghe starring in it. Vijaya Kumaratunga played  the character of Babun which was in a sense the lead role. Peries in \u201cLester on Lester\u201d had this to say \u2013 \u201d Vijaya Kumaratunga played Babun.There was the famous seduction scene which is really rape by consent, which Iknew that Vijaya and Malani would do.Although that particular scene was badly cut here,it was really played with hardly any clothes on.\u201d",
    "These then were the three films of Lester that Vijaya acted in. Even though the opportunity of being launched in films by Lester James Peries was missed by Vijaya, his career did take off after the releases  in 1969 of \u201cHantane Kathawa\u201d and \u201cRomeo Juliet Kathawak\u201d. Vijaya acted in many entertainment oriented, commercially successful \u201cformula films\u201d as well as critically praised artistic films.",
    "Directors with different film making sensibilities like Sugathapala Senerath Yapa, GDL Perera, Lester James Peries, Vasantha Obeyesekere, Dharmasena Pathiraja, Sunil Ariyaratne, Tissa Abeyesekera and  Titus Thotawatte  along with directors like Neil Rupasinghe, Lenin Moraes,Timothy Weeraratne, Yasapalitha Nanayakkara and a host of others helped make a successful star out of Vijaya Kumaratunga.",
    "Movies of  different genres such as \u201cAhas  Gawwa,\u201d Diyamanthi\u201d, \u201cEya den Loku Lamayek\u201d, \u201cPara Dige\u201d, \u201cBambaru Avith\u201d, Maruwaa Samaga waase\u201d, \u201cKadapathaka Chaya\u201d as well as those like \u201cHathardenama Soorayo\u201d, Thushara\u201d, \u201cPembara Madhu\u201d,\u201dSangeetha\u201d and  \u201cMonarathenna\u201d contributed in different ways to create the brand name Vijaya Kumaratunga.",
    "Gamini Fonseka was the super star of Sinhala cinema  fr many years. After Gamini came Vijaya.  Both were appreciated and loved by the discerning film goer as well as the average film fan. Nuwan Nayanajith Kumara writes of this phenomenon thus -\u201cPrior to the arrival of Vijaya on the silver screen,Gamini Fonseka,the superstar of Sinhala cinema had constructed the image of a brave and passionate young hero. As an alternative, Vijaya invented a carefree,debonair, romantic lover. Sinhala cinema -goers warmly embraced them both\u201d.",
    "Vijaya Kumaratunga blazed a successful trail in  Sinhala cinematic skies for two decades. The story of the romantic action hero\u2019s meteoric rise to fame and stardom interspersed with an account of the Chandrika- Vijaya  storybook romance will be related in these columns next week.",
