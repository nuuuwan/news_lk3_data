  "original_title": "Success of Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) at  the  North-Eastern  Local Govt Elections Vindicates  Party Secretary  M.A. Sumanthiran.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) led National People\u2019s Power(NPP) recorded a landslide victory at the Parliamentary elections held in November 2024. The personal popularity of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake embodied in the form of an electoral wave described as the \u201cAnura Ralla\u201d was deemed responsible for the JVP led NPP winning 159 seats in a 225 member Parliament.",
    "Island wide Local  Government elections held on May 6th was perceived as a twin  test to gauge whether the NPP/JVP Govt still retained it\u2019s popularity and whether the Anura wave had lost its vigour or not. The results showed that the Anura wave  was somewhat ebbing  while the NPP was losing its sheen. Nevertheless  the Local authority elections  proved clearly that the  JVP led NPP was still the top political party in Sri Lanka and that the Anura wave had not receded completely yet.",
    "The NPP  polled 4 ,503,930(43.26%)votes in the Local authority polls and finished on top in 265 local councils. 3,926 councillors were elected from the NPP to the Municipal,urban and Divisional councils. When contrasted with the 2024 parliamentary poll in which the JVP led NPP polled 6,863,186(61.56%0 votes, the Local poll result shows a huge vote  drop in just 6 months.",
    "However when  compared with the JVP performance in the 2018  local poll results, the 2025  local govt election results are a gigantic leap for the party. In 2018 the JVP polled only 710,932(5.75%) votes obtaining 434 councillors. It failed to capture a single council.",
    "If the Island wide local authority polls on a national scale could be regarded as  the major battle, the local govt polls in the Tamil areas of the northern and Eastern provinces  could be described as a minor battle. The local govt elections in the Tamil areas of the North and East were a test to ascertain whether the JVP led NPP was yet a force to be reckoned with in the North \u2013 Eastern Tamil areas.",
    "The NPP  tied with the Ilankiai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) in electing the highest number of Sri Lankan Tamil MPs from the northern and eastern provinces in 2024. Both parties elected seven  Tamil MPs each from the north and east. The NPP got three Tamil  MPs in Jaffna and two in the Wanni. It also got a Tamil MP each from the Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts. The ITAK got three MPs  in Batticaloa and one each from the Wanni, Jaffna, Amparai and Trincomalee  electoral districts.",
    "After the 2024 Parliamentary poll, the JVP has been triumphantly proclaiming that the North-eastern Tamils  have rejected the traditional Tamil nationalist parties and opted for the \u201cThisaikaatty\u201d  or compass.  The 2025 local polls provided an opportunity to confirm or disprove this claim .",
    "As such the local polls afforded  the Tamil nationalist parties another chance to get the  better of the JVP-led NPP . Even though the JVP-NPP won several MP  seats in Tamil areas, it was a fact that the Tamil parties were deeply divided in the 2024 Parliamentary poll.. Their votes were fragmented. Tamil parties have stated later that  their comparatively poor showing at the 2024 parliamentary poll was due  to this disunity in Tamil ranks.",
    "Arithmetical arguments have been propounded that if the votes polled by different Tamil parties and independent groups were heaped together, that would  have exceeded  double the number of  JVP/NPP votes in the north and east. Some even said that Tamil voters punished them for their lack of unity by voting for the Compass in 2024.",
    "In spite of their assertion that disunity was the cause of their decline in 2024, the Tamil parties were unable to form a singular, united front for the local elections. The  ITAK known in English as the Federal Party (FP),  faced  the local polls alone under its House symbol. The ITAK/FP position was  that given the voting system of 60% directly elected  Ward members  and 40%  members based on Proportional representation, it would be better for political parties to contest separately. The Tamil parties could unite after polls to either form a stable administration or prevent  the JVP/NPP from forming an administration. The ITAK/FP said it was keeping its  options open for  inter-party unity  in a post-election scenario.",
    "Two broad alliances were formed by significant non -ITAK Tamil nationalist parties.One was  the Democratic Tamil National Alliance(DTNA) contesting under the Sangu or Conch symbol. The other was the Thamil Theseeya Paeravai contesting under the Ahila Ilankai Tamil Congress(AITC) Symbol of Cycle. The DTNA consisted of parties like the EPRLF, TELO, PLOTE, Crusaders for Democracy and Samathuvak Katchi. The Tamil National People\u2019s Front-led Thamil Theseeyap Peravai constituted  parties like the  Thamil Theseeyak Katchi, Pasumaith Thaayaga Iyakkam and Jananaayagath Thamil Arasuk Katchi.",
    "In addition to the ITAK and the two  alliances, several other   political parties and independent groups  also  plunged into  the electoral fray. Among these were the  Eelam Peoples Democratic Party,Thamil Makkal Koottamaippu, Kizhakku Thamizhar Koottamaippu and some Independent groups",
    "Under these circumstances, the local authority polls in the Tamil areas of the North and East  transformed into  an arena where two sets of electoral battles  were being   fought. In one, the JVP led NPP was pitted against Tamil nationalist parties and groups.  In the other, Tamil political parties   competed  among themselves to be recognised as the numero uno among Tamil nationalist parties.",
    "In the tussle between the NPP and the Tamil nationalist parties, the results were a mixed bag. As in the case of the Parliamentary elections, the combined votes of the Tamil nationalist parties  was much greater than what the NPP garnered. In fact the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK), Democratic Tamil National Alliance(DTNA)   and the  Thamil Theseeyap Paeravai(TTP) almost doubled the votes they got at the parliamentary elections. In contrast the NPP got less than the number of votes it polled in the parliamentary hustings.",
    "The main competition in the North -east was between the NPP and the ITAK. As mentioned earlier, both the NPP and ITAK got seven Tamil MPs in the 2024 Parliamentary election. The NPP got five in the north and two in the East. The ITAK on the other hand got five in the east and two in the north. Interestingly it was only the NPP and ITAK whose  nominated candidate lists for North-eastern local councils were accepted in full   by the election department officials. Most of the other party lists were rejected at least in some areas. Even the ITAK list in a Pradeshiya Sabha in Mannar was rejected  first but subsequently accepted.",
    "The  electoral performances of the NPP and the ITAK in the eight districts of the Northern and Eastern provinces was interesting. The ITAK polled the highest in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitheevu and Batticaloa The NPP polled the most in the districts of Vavuniya,Mannar, Amparai and Trincomalee. Thus both parties were even  winning four districts each.",
    "What is noteworthy in this is that the NPP obtained votes from the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities of both provinces while the ITAK relied mostly on Tamil votes. Tamils are  more than 70 % of the population in the district of Batticaloa and all five districts in the North. In districts like Jaffna and Kilinochchi they are more than 90%. However in the  districts of Trincomalee and Amparai, Tamils are only 26 % and 19% of the population respectively.",
    "Viewed against this backdrop the ITAK topped in Jaffna with 88,443 (31.95%)votes. Altogether the ITAK got  135 councillors elected in the 17 local authorities of Jaffna. The NPP on the other hand got 56,615 (20.45%) votes and had 81 councillors elected. The ITAK came first in 12 Councils in Jaffna.",
    "In Kilinochchi the ITAK polled 29,173 (48.80%) and elected 36 members of local  govt councils. The NPP polled 10,552 (17.65%)votes  and  got 12 councillors.",
    "In Batticaloa the ITAK polled 91,818 (32.25%)votes and got 85 members . 85 ITAK councillors were elected in Batticaloa. The NPP in Batticaloa polled 53,002 (18.62%)votes with 44 councillors.",
    "In Mullaitheevu district the ITAK obtained 20,080 (37.83%) votes.26 councillors were elected. The NPP got 9,534 (17.96%) votes and 12 councillors.",
    "Mannar district saw the NPP coming out on top. The NPP got 14,133 (21.09%) votes and had 19 councillors. The ITAK came third (SJB was 2nd) with 11,056 (16.50%) votes and 18 councillors",
    "The NPP was first in the Vavuniya district also. The NPP got 17,984 (22.24%) votes  with 26 councillors. The ITAK polled 13,385 (16.55%) votes and got 16 councillors.",
    "The NPP  topped the multi-ethnic Trincomalee and Amparai districts. In Trinco the NPP got 52,569 (24.34%) votes and 68  councillors. The ITAK  polled 31,394 (14.53%) votes and got 36  councillors.  In Amparai the NPP polled 92,579 (29.24%) votes and got 114 councillors. The ITAK polled 22,308 (7.95%)votes with 25 councillors. As stated earlier the Tamil population in Amparai and Trincomalee is 19% and 26% respectively.",
    "It could be seen therefore that the direct electoral fight in the North and East was between the NPP/JVP and the ITAK/FP. The NPP polled 307, 968 votes in the local authority elections held in the Northern and Eastern provinces.  The ITAK polled 307,657 in both provinces just 341 less than the NPP. The number of councillors elected from the NPP in the various municipal,urban and divisional(pradesheeya/Piradesa) councils are 376. The number of councillors elected from the ITAK in the North and east is 377 just one more than the NPP.",
    "The NPP  polled the highest  number of votes in four (Vavuniya,Mannar, Amparai, Trinco)of the eight  districts  in the North and East. The ITAK got the largest amount of votes in the other four districts  namely Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu).  The NPP has  won the most number of members in 18 councils in the North and East. The ITAK however has done much better in this respect by coming out on top in 35 councils from both provinces.",
    "A \u201dproblem\u201dthat has emeged in most councils in the North and east as well as the other seven provinces is that of forming a viable administration. Parties may have topped  the polls but do not have an absolute",
    "Majority in many councils. Hence the NPP is trying to woo small parties and independent groups into supporting them in the councils.",
    "Likewise the ITAK too  has entered into discussions with some political parties and independent groups with the intention of forming viable administrations commanding a majority . The ITAK has an absolute majority of its own in only six of the thirty-five councils it has won.",
    "Preliminay discussions have resulted in both the Democratic Tamil National Alliance(DTNA) and the Thamil Makkal Koottani agreeing to support the ITAK in all councils where the ITAK has come first. The situation however is still fluid.  The success or failure of these discussions will be known definitely only when the newly elected councils hold their inaugural sessions  on June 2nd. It appears that the Tamil nationalist Parties will unite to prevent the NPP from administering a  Tamil majority council in the north and east",
    "It is indeed clear that the ITAK has  once again demonstrated through the local authority electionsd that it is the premier political party of the Tamils of the northern and eastern provinces. The ITAK in general and its General Secretary M. A. Sumanthiran in particular were severely attacked by  many Tamil parties and media organizations. It was propagated that the ITAK would fare very poorly in the elections because the Tamil people supposedly hated Sumanthiran. It was even said that Sumanthiran was a curse afflicting the ITAK and that the party would fare poorly at the polls. The results have proved these critics wrong.",
    "Sumanthiran was the mainstay of the ITAK election campaign.  He played a big role in selecting appropriate candidates in consultation with party stalwarts and MPs from the different districts.  He  formulating  election strategy and directed  propaganda. Sumanthiran travelled the length and breadth of the north and east and addressed numerous meetings in all districts except Kilinochchi.  Some  rival Tamil politicians  criticized and attacked  Sumanthiran more than the NPP His detractors portrayed him as a political liability to the ITAK.The poll results are a personal triumph for Sumanthiran who has been  vindicated  in a big way.",
    "After the 2024 Parliamentary election, the JVP led NPP said their success in Jaffna was the jewel in their victory  crown. The JVP with nearly 25 % of the votes got three out of six MPs in Jaffna. The ITAK got only one in the Jaffna electoral district comprising the administrative  districts  of Kilinochchi and Jaffna.",
    "The NPP went to town with the Jaffna district results.  JVP secretary Tilvin Silva  as well as several other JVP stalwarts crowed about the Jaffna victory as their  crowning achievement.  It was even said that the JVP led NPP had liberated the people of Jaffna from racism.",
    "When the local authority elections were impending, the NPP boasted that the party would repeat its success in Jaffna. In fact Fisheries minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar said that the NPP would win all 17 local authorities in Jaffna district. When the election campaign unfolded the NPP government  gave top priority to Jaffna. Apart from a widespread ,intense grassroots campaign,  high level leaders like President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and Leader of the House Bimal Ratnayake addressed mass meetings in Jaffna. The NPP tempted Jaffna voters with promises of allocating funds for the local councils, if the NPP was elected.",
    "Despite this powerful election campaign the JVP led NPP was unable to \u201cCapture\u201dJaffna as planned.  The \u201cHouse\u201d triumphed over the \u201cCompass\u201d  in the battle for Jaffna. The  ITAK got the most number of votes. The NPP came second. In the 2024 Parliamentary poll,  the NPP  polled 80,830 votes in Jaffna and Kilinochi districts. The ITAK garnered 63,327  votes in 2024. In the 2025  local polls the ITAK got 117,616 votes in both districts. The NPP tally in both districts  in the 2025 local poll was 67, 167.",
    "The Anura \u201cAlai\u201d(wave)engulfed Jaffna in the 2024 Parliamentary poll. Why did the tide turn against the NPP in the 2025 Local elections?The main reason for this was the hiatus between pledge and performance. The NPP in general and AKD in particular made several pledges during the parliamentary election campaign. Some of these were \u2013  Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was to be abolished, all Tamil political prisoners were to be released, the issue of enforced disappearances was to be addressed, private lands seized by the armed forces were to be returned to the rightful owners, security force camps and checkposts were to be reduced, places and roads declared as high security areas were to be reduced.",
    "None of these promises  were kept. A few checkposts were removed, one or two camps closed, and a few roads made open to the public. Nothing substantial was done. There has been practically no forward movement on issues like the release of political prisoners, enforced disappearances, return of seized lands, etc. On the question of political prisoners, it is now said that there are no political prisoners. The Govt also stated that the PTA will not be abolished.",
    "These then are the reasons for the NPP\u2019s 2025 poor performance in Jaffna when compared to 2024. The ITAK has struck back and got the better of the NPP in Jaffna. It is however  important not to be  misled  by the optics. The NPP  Jaffna victory in 2024 was blown up disproportionately.  Now  in 2025 it is being down graded disproportionately.",
    "It must be acknowledged that the NPP has done better than Tamil nationalist parties -with the singular exception of the ITAK- in Jaffna and other Tamil areas. Tamil politics will no longer be an intra-Tamil nationalist party affair. It will be a Tamil nationalist  party versus national party exercise. The JVP led NPP has come to stay in the Tamil political realm. The NPP/JVP is going to be a permanent powerful  player in  North -eastern Tamil politics in the future..",
