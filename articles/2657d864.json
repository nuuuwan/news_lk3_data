    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will visit China from January 14 to 17, the Cabinet Spokesman announced on Tuesday (January 7, 2025), confirming the Sri Lankan leader\u2019s second state visit abroad, a month after he visited India.",
    "President Dissanayake will be accompanied by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism Vijitha Herath, and Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation Bimal Rathnayake, Cabinet spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa told media. Debt treatment and bilateral development cooperation are among key issues expected to be discussed in Beijing.",
    "Mr. Dissanayake\u2019s visit to China marks his second major bilateral engagement after he rose to the country\u2019s top office in September. In November, his National People\u2019s Power [NPP] coalition swept the polls with an unprecedented two-thirds majority and soon after, Mr. Dissanayake undertook his first state visit abroad to India.",
    "The NPP\u2019s chief constituent, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP or People\u2019s Liberation Front), which Mr. Dissanayake leads, has Marxist-Leninist roots and a history of opposing India, prompting many to describe it as a pro-China party.",
    "However, the JVP has sought to refashion itself in the last decade, in a bid to widen its appeal while retaining its traditional base.",
    "Further, Mr. Dissanayake and the NPP have pledged to follow a non-aligned foreign policy that prioritises Sri Lanka\u2019s national interests. Regardless of the party in power in Sri Lanka, all past governments have maintained cordial and close ties with China, widely seen by Sri Lankans as a long-term ally, both in bilateral cooperation and at multilateral fora including UN bodies.",
    "Meanwhile, addressing Colombo-based media on Tuesday (January 7, 2025), Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha said India opened the year \u201cbeing extremely positive and buoyant\u201d about its Sri Lanka partnership. President Dissanayake\u2019s recent visit added \u201crenewed vigour\u201d to ties, and deliberations have put the relationship on a \u201chigher plane\u201d, he said.",
    "Outlining highlights of the Sri Lankan President\u2019s December visit to India, including ongoing discussions on possible collaboration in the energy sector and connectivity, he said with India\u2019s recent move to convert some of its earlier loans to Sri Lanka into grants, the total grant assistance stood at $ 780 million.",
    "Asked if India held any further discussion with the Sri Lankan government on Chinese research vessels, after Colombo\u2019s moratorium on foreign research ships expired, and following Mr. Dissanayake\u2019s visit, Mr. Jha said: \u201cWe have not had any further discussions.\u201d Pointing to President Dissanayake\u2019s \u201ccategorical\u201d statement in India, as well as the NPP\u2019s election manifesto, the Indian High Commissioner said: \u201cWe take Sri Lanka for its word\u2026 we completely trust Sri Lanka to take the right actions in that regard.\u201d",
    "Following his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 16, 2024, President Dissanayake had said in a statement to the media in New Delhi: \u201cI assured the Indian leader that Sri Lanka will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India as well as towards regional stability,\u201d reiterating the NPP\u2019s position. Sri Lanka \u201cattaches great importance to the continuous development and deepening of cooperation with India\u201d, he had said.",
    "New Delhi has remained highly sensitive to the visit of Chinese research vessels that it believes are essentially spy ships and, on multiple occasions, raised concern with Mr. Dissanayake\u2019s predecessor government, prompting Colombo to introduce a moratorium. The Dissanayake government has said it will address the matter diplomatically and take decisions on a case-by-case basis.",
    "Days after he returned from India last month, President Dissanayake met with Qin Boyong, vice-chairperson of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).  Ms. Qin stated that \u201cthere are plans to restart maritime research activities, which were temporarily halted for various reasons\u201d, the Presidential Media Division said in a statement then."
