  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a significant move to improve the living conditions of those residing in estate housing areas, the Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved directing the Legal Draftsman to drafting a new Bill aimed at converting estate housing areas into villages.",
    "The move aims to ensure that residents of estate line rooms receive the same level of services and dignity as those living in villages.",
    "\u201cCurrently, residents of estate houses and line rooms in estate areas are not adequately provided with rural-level services by State institutions. The new law seeks to amalgamate these estate houses and line rooms into villages, thereby ensuring they are treated with dignity and respect,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "Once implemented, the new law will facilitate the integration of estate housing areas into the broader community, enabling residents to benefit from improved infrastructure and services. He said the initiative is part of the Government\u2019s broader efforts to address the socio-economic disparities faced by estate workers and their families, providing them with better living conditions and access to essential services.",
    "The proposal to this effect presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."
