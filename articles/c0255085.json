  "original_body_lines": [
    "The growing prospect of the return of Donald Trump to the White House despite the weaponized Department of Justice (DOJ) orchestrating a plethora of court cases against him has unnerved the establishment in Washington,\u00a0D.C., afraid that he will \u2018drain the swamp\u2019. The moguls controlling the media in cahoots with those in the Democratic Party who are calling the shots in the White House in the context of a cognitively impaired Joe Biden have gone on overdrive to demonize Trump. Quite often Biden is literally not aware of his surroundings or what he is saying.",
    "Corporate honchos have now become major donors of the Democratic Party. They ensure that threats from even within the party from people such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are neutralized. It is crystal clear there is a two-tier justice system \u2013 one for Trump and another where the judicial system looks the other way\u00a0 when it comes to credible allegations of corruption against Biden and his son Hunter and Biden\u2019s cognitive impairment visible to the whole world.",
    "The basis of most legal cases against Trump is his alleged \u2018Big Lie\u2019 that the 2020 presidential election giving victory to Biden is unlawful/flawed. From what follows below, any unbiased person will conclude that Trump was spot-on to reach this conclusion.",
    "Readers can decide from Biden\u2019s obvious cognitive impairment publicly revealed just 6 months into his presidency whether any RATIONAL person would have voted for him at the 3 November 2020 presidential election let alone the claimed 81 Million? Trump obtained 74 Million votes.",
    "Readers can log into Biden\u2019s \u2018Man on the Moon\u2019 gaffe at the CNN Town Hall held on 21 July 2021 (6 months into his presidency) which left even the pro-Biden interviewer Don Lemon embarrassed. Biden\u2019s inauguration was on 20 January 2021.",
    "Another example is a confused Biden looking for dead congresswoman Jackie Walorski.",
    "It is widely known that Biden during the 2020 presidential election campaign for the most part operated below the radar often referred to as the \u2018basement\u2019.",
    "Referring to the ongoing 2024 presidential election campaign, even former special advisor to President Obama \u2013 Van Jones was constrained to state (i) \u201cIf I were Biden, I would stay hidden\u201d (ii) \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you why: He doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\u201d",
    "Another canard is that Trump instigated his supporters to protest violently on 6 January 2021 against the unlawful/flawed election. His detractors ignoring his exhortation to protestors to \u201cpeacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\u201d have mischievously characterized the emotional protest that controversially went wrong as an \u2018insurrection\u2019.\u00a0 It is noteworthy that every single investigation eager to \u2018nail\u2019 Trump has also glaringly omitted this exhortation.",
    "It is obvious that \u2018mail-in\u2019 voting is less transparent than \u2018in-person\u2019 voting and is far more susceptible to abuse. What boggles one\u2019s imagination is that at the 2020 presidential election held in the midst of the Covid crisis, the vast preponderance of mail-in votes was for Biden. Are we to assume that Covid is selective and mainly affects Biden\u2019s voters?",
    "Pew Research Center had this to say about the 2020 presidential election:",
    "\u201cA majority of Biden voters said they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election (58%). By contrast, about a third of Trump voters (32%) voted by mail.\u201d",
    "\u201cTrump performed much better among voters who cast their ballots in person on Election Day (65% for Trump vs. 33% for Biden). These shares were reversed among absentee and mail-in voters: 65% of absentee voters said they voted for Biden, compared with 33% who voted for Trump.\u201d",
    "i) An example of the weaponization of the DOJ (Department of Justice) and the justice system is the credibility of the case relating to Trump\u2019s alleged Georgia election interference in the context of the alleged romantic involvement of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis with Nathan Wade she handpicked to be special prosecutor allegedly for $650,000/= There are also allegations which need to be probed (i) Wade\u2019s competence to handle this case since his experience is said to be on \u2018personal injury/traffic law\u2019 (ii) White House meetings (iii) vacations with Fani Willis paid for by Wade.",
    "ii) Even on the \u2018classified document\u2019 case the DOJ has gone on \u2018overdrive\u2019 alleging wrongdoing by Trump relating to documents while he was president while soft-pedalling on presidential documents from the Obama administration\u00a0 allegedly stashed by Biden in his \u2018garage\u2019 in Delaware.",
    "iii) Things have been so staged managed that women have come out of the woodwork on the eve of the 2024 presidential election to resuscitate alleged improper conduct by Trump. This includes cases filed by porn star Stormy Daniels and journalist E. Jean Carroll in New York State having a Democratic Party Governor and Attorney General.",
    "It is outrageous that E. Jean Carroll who reportedly waited 24 years to accuse Trump of alleged rape which was rejected by the jury was awarded an unprecedented $ 83.3 Million in a New York court for defamation. The link given below demonstrates the flagrant abuse of the law:",
    "Biden\u2019s cognitive impairment visible to the whole world makes it clear he is unable to organize even a\u00a0\u2018piss-up in a\u00a0brewery\u2019! Aided by media tycoons his handlers/proxies who are enjoying power in his name are doing their damndest to keep him in office for a second term. This includes minimizing his public appearances and giving him \u2018cheat sheets\u2019. \u00a0 He even messes-up simple teleprompter instructions.",
    "Biden cheat sheet shows he had advance knowledge of journalist\u2019s question",
    "This writer is not holding a brief for Donald Trump who is controversial and far from faultless. All he is attempting is to set the record straight in the context of Trump being demonized by most of the US mainstream media and the same media giving a free pass to Biden.",
    "These networks downplay Biden\u2019s deteriorating mental state by merely referring to his age! Recently CNN and MSNBC even cut in mid-air or refused to air Trump\u2019s victory speech after his landslide victory at the Iowa Republican primary where their preferred candidate Nikki Haley was pushed to third place.",
    "Given the unprecedented crisis on the southern border, economic crisis impacting the kitchen table, deteriorating law and order and worsening world instability under the watch of Biden, it is believed that Trump\u2019s popularity extends beyond the Republican Party to include even a section of \u2018independents\u2019.",
    "The claim of Biden being the standard bearer of democracy wears thin because (i) his winning of the presidency in 2020 does not stand democratic scrutiny (ii) anti-democratic features galore in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election which include media disinformation on Trump and ignoring Biden\u2019s cognitive impairment and failures (iii) Biden\u2019s competitors such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. being kept out of the Democratic Party primaries.",
    "I close with what one of the most influential persons in the global financial industry, Jamie Dimon \u2013 Chairman/CEO, JP Morgan Chase said to some visibly embarrassed CNBC presenters in Davos:",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re voting for Trump because of his family values. If you just take a step back and be honest, he was kind of right about NATO, kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well, tax reform worked and he was right about China.\u201d",
    "All this logic and ground reality can come apart if there is a repeat of what took place in the run-up to and in the aftermath of the highly flawed 2020 US presidential election. The forces against \u2018outsider\u2019 Trump are powerful and relentless and transcend party lines and may even include people such as Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell."
