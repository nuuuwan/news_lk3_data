    "\u201cI don\u2019t take on things that are not a good use of my forte and time\u201d",
    "Professionalisation of all operational activities of Cargills PLC has been a critical characteristic in gaining the trust and confidence of all its stakeholders, Ranjit Page, Deputy Chairman of Cargills PLC told The Island Financial Review.",
    "\u2018Cargills was an old building which needed new energy, and we gave it oxygen for revitalization at the right time. We didn\u2019t look at our business from a self-serving interest of growing our bottom line. We took a holistic view and embraced the interests of all our stakeholders. That\u2019s how we have been able to make Cargills a thriving and robust platform where everyone can mutually benefit from. That reliability, integrity and agility have elevated Cargills to be a truly professionalized entity today,\u201d he said.",
    "The corporate leader with great business acumen and insights made these remarks when The Island had a brief interview with him at the 20th \u2018Cargills Village to Home\u2019 SME empowering programme, held on 29th July at Cargills Food City Delkanda.",
    "When asked to reveal the formula behind Cargills\u2019 success, Page who prefers to use brief, succinct answers said, \u201cPassion, hard work and our teamwork.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have worked very hard to bring Cargills to the point where it is today. The Company has provided clarity on its principles, direction and purpose. I don\u2019t say one thing and do another. I lead by example. It is up to the next leaders and their colleagues to take the Company forward with the same degree of passion and commitment,\u201d he said.",
    "When asked about the risks and pressures the food industry is facing currently due to low margins, supply-chain disruptions and fierce competition, he said,\u201d Cargills is not affected by blood pressure, cholesterol or any other pressures because of the way the company has been operating since it was founded. I am not risk averse, but I don\u2019t take on things that are not a good use of my forte and time. For example, if somebody asked me to enter politics, I wouldn\u2019t because I am not good at persuading people to vote for me,\u201d he said laughing.",
    "Talking about his business philosophy, Page said,\u201d Cargills believes in the future of Sri Lanka and the opportunities it offers for the hard-working young people to have a fair share of its prosperity. You see, Sri Lanka has given this opportunity to Cargills, so we shall continue to serve Sri Lanka keeping the best interests of our people at heart.\u201d",
    "Revealing a bit about his life at home he said,\u201d Mrs. Page and I have been married for 40 years. She runs the family affairs and I run the business. I never take unfinished work home so that I can make the best time at home with my wife and two children.\u201d",
    "The business magnate who has created multiple lines of enterprise keeps himself in fantastic shape, takes an occasional glass of red wine and is concerned about eating right and sleeping well.",
    "When asked what makes him happy, he said,\u201d \u201cDuring the day, I get energy from seeing the positive impact of our teamwork on the farmer community, employees, SME entrepreneurs, consumers and the society at large through our CSR programmes. In the night, that soothing feeling puts me into a good night\u2019s sleep. 100% of my happiness is derived from seeing others succeed with the help Cargills provides.\u201d",
