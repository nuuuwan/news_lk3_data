    "In a major security breach coming on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament attack, two men entered the Lok Sabha chamber on Wednesday and opened canisters that emitted a yellow-coloured smoke, Indian media reported.",
    "They were seated in the visitors\u2019 gallery and they took out canisters from their shoes. Television footage showed them jumping from desk to desk, and appeared to be headed towards the Well of the House.",
    "Members present inside the House told reporters later that they (the protesters) were chanting slogans such as \u2018tana shahi nahi chalegi\u2019 (dictatorship won\u2019t be accepted). They have been detained.",
    "Two more protesters, a man named Amol, from Latur (Maharashtra), and a woman named Neelam, from Hisaar (Haryana), were held from near Transport Bhavan, which is in close proximity to the Parliament complex. The identity of the two who entered Lok Sabha is yet to be disclosed by security agencies.",
    "BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal, who was presiding over the House proceedings said that he saw one person falling from the visitors\u2019 gallery, and simultaneously, another man was jumping on the desks.",
    "\u201cOne of them took something out of his shoes that was emitting smoke. The security personnel caught them, and it remains to seen who they are, what was their objective and what organisation are they associated with,\u201d he added.",
    "Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury: \u201cTwo young men jumped from the gallery and something was hurled by them from which gas was emitting. They were caught by MPs, (and) they were brought out by security personnel. The House was adjourned till 2 pm. This is certainly a security breach because today we observed the death anniversary of people who sacrificed their lives in 2001.\u201d",
    "Congress MP Karti Chidambaram said that the canisters were emitting yellow smoke, and raised concerns that it could have been \u201cpoisonous\u201d. \u201cSuddenly two young men around 20 years old jumped into the House from the visitor\u2019s gallery and had canisters in their hand. These canisters were emitting yellow smoke. One of them was attempting to run towards the Speaker\u2019s chair. They were shouting some slogans. The smoke could have been poisonous. This is a serious breach of security especially on December 13, the day when Parliament was attacked in 2001.\u201d"
