    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has told visiting Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe that India expects Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment to the constitution to ensure a life of \u201cdignity and respect\u201d for the island nation\u2019s Tamil community.",
    "The Chennai-based The Hindu reported on Friday July 21 that Prime Minister Modi had informed President Wickremesinghe that both sides have held talks on a number of infrastructure projects that can ensure greater connectivity between the two countries and announced a development assistance package for the Tamils of Indian origin who are marking 200th anniversary of their arrival into the island nation.",
    "\u201cWe took up the issue of reconstruction and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe presented his inclusive point of view to me. We hope that Sri Lanka\u2019s government will fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people. We expect that Colombo will take forward the process of reconstruction for ensuring equality, justice and peace. We hope that Sri Lanka will fulfil its commitment to implement the 13th Amendment and to hold provincial elections,\u201d Modi was quoted as saying in Hindi.",
    "\u201cWe hope Sri Lanka\u2019s government will ensure a life of respect and dignity for the Tamil people of the country,\u201d said PM Modi, the Hindu reported.",
    "The newspaper quoted President Wickremesinghe as saying that his plan will \u201cbenefit all segments of Sri Lankan society\u201d adding, \u201cI have set Sri Lanka firmly on the path of economic reform and that Sri Lanka is already witnessing the stabilising outcomes of these measures and the revival of confidence internally and externally in the progress of the country.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe said he has invited leaders of all political parties to come forward to work towards \u201cconsensus\u201d.",
    "On Tuesday July 18, ahead of Wickremesinghe\u2019s visit to India, legislators representing Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil-majority northern and eastern provinces and President Wickremesinghe were unable to reach a consensus on the inclusion of police powers in the full implementation of an India-backed devolution mechanism.",
    "At a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran said excluding police powers in the implementation of the 13th amendment to the constitution would not amount to a meaningful devolution of power.",
    "Responding to the MP, President Wickremesinghe said while he agrees with Rajapaksa that there should be full implementation of the 13th amendment, there was an outcry when Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration had proposed the same.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment would see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more nationalist-oriented parties including sections of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). In February, sections of Sri Lanka\u2019s Buddhist clergy took to the streets against the proposed full implementation of the constitutional amendment.",
    "A statement from the President\u2019s Media Division said Tuesday evening quoted Wickremesinghe as saying that he had already put forth a \u201ccomprehensive proposal to address the problems faced by the people in those regions and it is up to the Tamil parliamentarians whether to take it forward or not\u201d.",
    "\u201cUltimately, the president underscored that the full enforcement of the 13th amendment can only be achieved if all party leaders in the parliament agree to a comprehensive devolution of powers,\u201d the statement said. (Colombo/Jul21/2023)"
