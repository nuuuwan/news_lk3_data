### China

*2024-11-10 15:10:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198310) · `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



China expands operations in Sri Lanka after coup. Provides 100% school uniforms, builds low-income housing. Chinese contractors oversee projects. China strengthens Anuragumara Dissanayake government influence. US regime change aids China's expansion strategy in Sri Lanka.

🟩

Following the coup in Sri Lanka, China has begun to expand and accelerate its operations.

China's involvement with the Sri Lankan government has increased since Anuragumara Dissanayake, who was described by the Western media as the President of the Marxist.

In 2025, China has announced that it will provide the entire uniform cloth to schoolchildren.

After the economic crisis, China offered to provide uniform clothes to Sri Lankan students.

In 2023, China gave 70 percent uniform cloth. The Sri Lankan government paid the remaining 30 percent.

80 percent uniform fabric was donated by China in 2024. The remaining 20 percent was resolved by the Sri Lankan government.

Even when Ranil Wickremesinghe was in power- even when the Sri Lankan economic crisis was at its peak, China had not come before the 100 per cent uniform cloth to the students.

China was acting in the tone that should be given and not to be fully given.

It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza.

Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas’s political office in Doha “no longer serves its purpose” were “inaccurate”.

“Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,” a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.

“Qatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.”

### GLIMPSES OF COLONIAL CEYLON (1935 – 1947)

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical anecdotes by LC Arulpragasam)

This is not meant to be a history of the colonial years, but rather a cherry-picking of childhood memories for their quaintness rather than for their historical truth, for socio-cultural insights rather than for historical facts. I can only touch on some cultural oddities of the English-speaking middleclass of those times, since I knew no other. Likewise, I can write only of the last years of colonial rule, since I lived through no others. I write as ‘an old man in a hurry’, because at the age of 88 years, I doubt that there will be others left to recount these tales.

Senior public officials have often to act as buffers between ministers, other important political actors, and other stakeholders in society. On many occasions, one had to absorb a significant degree of shock and act as a facilitator, mediator or referee. A rousing example of this side of one’s responsibilities came by courtesy of Mrs. Vivienne Goonewardene, the LSSP Member of Parliament for Dehiwela-Galkissa and wife of Mr. Leslie Goonewardene, Minister of Communications.
