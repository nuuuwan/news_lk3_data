    "Last Tuesday, one of the most consequential elections in the history of the United States was concluded, with the people deciding, according to the constitution of the nation, to abandon the ideological system of governance defined by that very constitution. The living ideology of democracy, in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, of a \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people and for the people\u201d has been replaced by an authoritarian kleptocracy.",
    "The archaic Constitution of the United States written over two centuries ago will be updated, replaced by a document created by the conservative Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 \u2013 Mandate for Leadership, to reflect the traditions and ideology of pre-World War II Germany. The Good Old Days of Jim Crow and Segregation.",
    "The inexorable progress towards a diverse democracy has given way to a society dominated by Christian white supremacists, where the movement towards a Socialist Democracy, started by the introduction of a social safety net with the New Deal of President Roosevelt in the 1940s, including Social Security and Medicare, may be curtailed, even reversed.",
    "Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, became the first convicted felon to be elected to its Presidency at last week\u2019s contest. The election was conducted without a trace of post-election accusations of election fraud. The Democratic candidate, Vice-President Kamala Harris, conceded defeat to Trump a few hours after the result was called in Trump\u2019s favor. A conversation that took a little longer than expected, as it was difficult to convey the meaning of a word, concede, which was not in the President-elect\u2019s vocabulary.",
    "There will be no attempts to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power, and Donald Trump will be duly inaugurated as the 47th and possibly the last President of the United States, on January 20, 2025. Vice-President Harris, who, in her capacity of President of the Senate, will make the final certification of Trump\u2019s presidency on January 6, 2025. She will carry out her constitutional duty without the slightest danger of being hanged.",
    "\u201cCorporate greed and Christian white supremacy will not vanish into thin air with Trump\u2019s defeat. Project 2025 will simply be renamed Project 2029.",
    "\u201cHowever, if Trump wins the presidency in November, he will be gently eased out of the White House after a couple of years, on the eminently valid grounds that he has reached full-blown lunacy. He has served his purpose. The exercise of the 25th Amendment to oust him will be a legal and medical formality. 40-year-old Vice-President Vance will take over as president. With the two-term limit of the 22nd Amendment overturned by a suppliant, corrupt Supreme Court, Vance will begin a long reign as the President of the United States of America for Life, obediently carrying out the instructions of the dark money, billionaire class\u201d.",
    "Vance has proved to be a worthy successor to Trump, younger, smarter and an even more facile liar.",
    "The demise or departure of Trump will not change the movement that was started by that segment of Christian white nationalists which has always resented the existence of the descendants of African-American slaves and recent brown-skinned/colored immigrants. Racism has been an endemic feature of North American society for centuries.",
    "White Americans \u201csettlers\u201d have always recognized that the free labor of two centuries of slavery, and starvation wages paid to illegal immigrants, have made the United States the economic powerhouse of the world. They also appreciate that mass deportation of illegal immigrants may cripple the greatest economy of the world.",
    "However, they do insist that these second-class citizens cannot enjoy the same privileges the original white European settlers/marauders have been enjoying since they committed the virtual genocide of the original natives of the continent more than four centuries ago, which led to the creation of the United States of America.",
    "The dark money billionaire class has now emerged in the open, with the richest men in the world backing Donald Trump. They were horrified when the administration of Barack Obama accelerated the path initiated by FDR in the 1930s towards a Socialist Democracy, on the lines of governance practiced in every other developed nation in the world. Nations in Northern Europe and Australasia, where there are few homeless in abject poverty, but fewer billionaires; with a social safety net available to all, even the most vulnerable. This was not the \u201cwoke\u201d, \u201cCommie\u201d future envisaged by the growing breed of billionaires for the richest country in the world.",
    "Elon Musk funded Trump\u2019s current campaign with tens of millions of dollars. Trump, in turn, has offered Musk a senior position in his administration, if re-elected, as a \u201cSecretary of Cost-Cutting\u201d, an advisory role that could give him influence over national and international policies. That such an appointment would further assist his own business ventures like Tesla, X and Space X is an anticipated bonus. Other billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Rupert Murdoch and many others have already gotten into the act, and will control most sectors of the US economy and the media during Trump\u2019s administration. The largest tax cut in history benefiting these billionaires and corporations is imminent.",
    "This movement of white supremacy and totalitarianism triumphed not because of Trump, rather in spite of Trump. As Trump was showing increasing signs of paranoid dementia, especially during the last few months before the election, the corporate giants, headed by Elon Musk, decided to openly show their support, finance his re-election and resuscitate the movement.",
    "While Trump was spewing hate speech against the illegal immigrant \u201cvermin poisoning the blood of the people\u201d, they recognized the fact that there was just one issue that would decide the presidency: the economy. People were totally dissatisfied with their experience during the first few years of the Biden/Harris administration, of rampant inflation and high prices, of an economy when many were unable to pay their rent or put food on the table, especially when the minimum wage hadn\u2019t seen an increase in decades.",
    "True, there were concerns about immigration, reproductive freedom, LGBTQ rights, gun violence; but they paled by comparison with the difficulties caused by the economy, which ironically, had recovered to be the \u201cenvy of the world\u201d by the time the election came along. Unfortunately, these improvements do not bring immediate relief, and people are still suffering under the burden of inflation.",
    "Musk and other corporate leaders will play a leading role in the new Trump administration. Although Trump\u2019s misstated economic policies for the future, especially on tariffs, have been denounced by economists, his supporters will rely on the most successful entrepreneurs in the world to get the country out of its current financial woes. Especially as the spadework has already been made by the Biden administration to rescue the near-recession they inherited from the criminal post-Covid management of Trump\u2019s first term. They will also be assisted in their task by the imminent removal of regulations and controls, all the while making Trump and themselves richer than God.",
    "Trump is determined to \u201ckeep promises made\u201d. He will end the Russian/Ukraine war before he is inaugurated, with a total surrender of the Ukrainians; he will encourage Israel\u2019s Netanyahu to complete the genocide of the Palestinians, once and for all. The US will withdraw from NATO and Trump will associate himself with the strongmen he admires, his mentor, Russian President Putin, Viktor Orban of Hungary, his erstwhile lover, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un. He has promised to begin the largest mass-deportation program ever of illegal and even legal immigrants. He has also vowed to ban \u201csanctuary cities\u201d. He will pardon the January 6 insurrectionists, who in his eyes are fellow patriots and \u201chostages\u201d. He will instruct his Justice Department to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate into the greatest crime family in US history, the Bidens; he will also start the process of investigating and jailing his political opponents, the \u201cenemy within\u201d. He will enact a nationwide ban on women\u2019s reproductive freedom, endangering the health of all women in the USA.",
    "He will force the Education Department to stop the teaching of Critical Race Theory and other subjects which denigrate the lily-white history of the nation. And of course, as a direct descendant of our Saviour Jesus, the Bible (preferably his own leather-bound, God Save the USA Bible, made in China, soon to be available at the White House Gift Shop at the bargain-basement price of $59.99 per copy) will be required reading in every classroom in America.",
    "All this, and more, will happen. And when it does, are the Democrats going to let them get away with it, or are they going to fight to save democracy?",
    "The world has coped with such madmen before. And survived. What the planet will not survive is Trump\u2019s policy on Climate Change. He has vowed to enhance exponentially US reliance on, and the drilling for, fossil fuels (\u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d), again calling Climate Change a \u201choax\u201d, against virtually every scientific opinion in the world.",
    "The United States, and the rest of the world, will be assailed with natural disasters of every type, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes and all the weapons in nature\u2019s fearful arsenal. Perhaps we have already passed the tipping point, and we will continue to be so assailed with increasing frequency that will cause irreparable destruction of the planet.",
    "This may well be the ultimate legacy of Trump\u2019s presidency, and conclusive evidence of the cataclysmic stupidity of the decision made by \u201cthe people\u201d on November 5, 2024.",
    "On a personal note, I had planned to publish a selection of articles I have written to the Sunday Island over the past 15 months, which was to end with a triumphant account of Trump\u2019s ignominious defeat in last week\u2019s election, and his subsequent conviction and imprisonment on 91 felonies, including Incitement of an Insurrection, Sedition, Espionage and Obstruction of Justice.",
    "Alas, it was not to be. So I have decided that the final essay in my book will be an abject admission of my complete failure to understand the psyche of a country which gave me a second chance, and welcomed me with open, if long-delayed and investigatory arms. A country which has changed beyond recognition with the advent of Trumpism.",
    "I have to thank my old friend and schoolmate, the editor of the Sunday Island, for providing me with something to do in my old age. Venting my hatred for the most evil man in living memory gave me the sort of occupational therapy which went against the wisdom of all those religions that preach hatred is an evil emotion which only causes personal harm. Hating Trump has done me a power of good.",
    "My many Sri Lankan friends and admirers of Trump now are having the last laugh on me. Sadly, we will all be sharing the grief when we see the depths to which Trump and his Christian, white supremacist minions will drag the most beautiful country in the world. Soon.",
    "I will take a few months off till I get over my distress as to where the home of my children is headed, with a prayer that they will continue to prosper.",
