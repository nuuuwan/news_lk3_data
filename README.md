### இலைதழைகள் மட்டும் தான் சாப்பாடு: ஆனால் சிக்ஸ்பேக்

*2025-09-26 16:57:10* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/இலைதழைகள்-மட்டும்-தான்-சாப்பாடு-ஆனால்-சிக்ஸ்பேக்/175-365339) · `ta`

இன்றைய காலகட்டத்தில் நிறைய பேர் சாப்பிட, தூங்க நேரமில்லாமல் பிஸியான வாழ்க்கை வாழ்ந்து கொண்டிருக்கின்றோம். குறிப்பாக, ஐடி போன்ற துறைகளில் ஷிப்ட் வேலைக்கு செல்கிறவர்கள் இரவு நேரங்களில் ஜங்க் உணவுகளை அதிகளவில் சாப்பிடுவதால் உடற்பருமன், ரத்த அழுத்தம் போன்ற பல்வேறு உடல்நல பிரச்சினைகளுக்கு ஆளாகி வருகின்றனர். அவர்களுக்கு மருத்துவர்கள் கூறும் ஒரே அறிவுரை சரிவிகித உணவுகளை சரியான நேரத்தில் எடுத்துக் கொள்ள வேண்டும் என்பது தான்.

இப்படியான சூழ்நிலையில் மரங்களிலும், மலைகளிலும் ஏறி அங்குள்ள கீரை வகைகளை மட்டுமே சாப்பிட்டு, இயற்கையான நீரோடைகளில் இருக்கிற தண்ணீரை மட்டுமே குடித்து ஒருவர் பல ஆண்டுகளாக உயிர் வாழ்கிறார் என்றால் நம்ப முடிகிறதா? ஆம், கர்நாடக மாநிலத்தைச் சேர்ந்த இளைஞர் ஒருவர் இப்படிப்பட்ட ஒரு டயட்டை மட்டுமே பின் பற்றி சிக்ஸ் பேக், ஃபிட்னெஸ் என அசால்ட்டாக வலம் வந்து மருத்துவர்களையே ஆச்சர்யத்தில் ஆழ்த்தி வருகிறார்.

யார் இந்த இளைஞர்? அவருடைய வாழ்க்கை முறை எப்படி இருக்கிறது? என்பதை தெரிந்து கொள்ள ஈடிவி பாரத் குழு அவரை தேடிச் சென்றது.
