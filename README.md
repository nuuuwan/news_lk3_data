“If an additional 20% tariff is applied on top of the existing average tariffs for all countries, estimates show that Sri Lanka’s exports to the US are expected to suffer a significant negative impact.

“For example, wearing apparel, Sri Lanka’s major export sector will experience a loss of USD 187.9 Million. As a percentage, this is a contraction of 8.1% from the base year, 2022.”

### The Rhythms Of Karma

*2024-11-18 09:00:59* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-rhythms-of-karma/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s political and historical landscape is rich with profound events, many of which seem to be inexplicably connected through dates, numbers, and circumstances that resonate deeply with the country’s cultural, political, and spiritual journey. The deaths of pivotal figures and significant political victories or defeats align in ways that compel us to explore the workings of karma, numerology, and the inherent energy of reality. By analysing these patterns, we begin to perceive a deeper rhythm underlying the unfolding of events in Sri Lanka.

The remarkable alignment of events suggests that dates carry an inherent energy, influenced by karma and numerology. This year, 2024—a year governed by the number 8 in numerology (2+0+2+4=8)—presents a particularly transformative moment, with the historic General Election victory by National People’s Power (NPP) on 14 November 2024.

### Reimagining Independence Day 2025: From Oppression To Honoring Freedom Struggles In All Communities

The historically unprecedented multiethnic vote for the National People’s Alliance in November 2024 should not be reduced to a superficial celebration of “we are all Sri Lankans” or an invitation to forget the past and move on. Such an approach ignores the deep historical injustices symbolized by Independence Day celebrations, which cannot be undone by merely electing a new government. Instead, our vote must express our collective willingness to fundamentally free history from its injustices—a call to rethink and transform the meaning of independence into a day of making history that we can meaningfully celebrate.

### MTI Consulting recommends Cabinet  restructuring with a ‘start-up’ mindset

*2024-11-18 03:09:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/MTI-Consulting-recommends-Cabinet-restructuring-with-a-start-up-mindset/14-769360) · `en`

Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions

Post watershed election that has the potential to transform Sri Lanka socio-economically, MTI Consulting has recommended a radically different approach to restructuring the Cabinet of Ministers.

How nations, both developed and developing, structure their cabinets is often based on legacy practices with incremental, ad-hoc changes. There is very little ground thinking, first principles, and future-proofing (which are considered effective in organisational structuring) that goes into such a process.

In this backdrop, Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions, even considering rationalisation and consolidation where needed.

### Super mandate and sobering reality

*2024-11-18 02:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/super-mandate-and-sobering-reality/) · `en`

Following their stunning victory in last week’s parliamentary election, the JVP/NPP leaders must still be pinching themselves to make sure that they are not dreaming. Their mammoth majority is sure to go down in Sri Lanka’s history. However, the bigger the majority, the greater a government’s responsibility and the higher the possibility of the public expecting miracles and becoming frustrated. Above all, the Actonian truism that absolute power corrupts absolutely has stood the test of time. Giving politicians, especially untested ones, steamroller majorities could be just as much a recipe for disaster as keeping teenagers, alcohol and car keys together.

🟩

"I will accept the confidence of the party and dedicate the service to the people of this area," Parliamentarian P. Sathalingam said.

He said this while commenting to the media after the National List seat of the TNA.

A massive responsibility has been imposed on me. When I was a member of the Provincial Council I had made many development plans. But people rejected me for something. There is many reasons for that.

Opposition parties and rivals presented fake campaigns against me. It was a cause of failure. My career is not politics. I am a doctor. If the party did not give this post, I was in the intention of acting as a state official again.

Wanni Having is a territory where the systematic genocide is taking place. So the party has provided this seat to know the need for a Member of Parliament who can perform it.

I will accept the confidence in me and dedicate my service to the people of this area. Thanks to the people who did not vote in that way. Thanks to the party.

### Sajith's weakness is the cause of the fall of the United People's Power - Sarath Fonseka

*2024-11-18 02:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199026) · `ta`

Sajith Premadasa's weak leadership caused United People's Power's downfall, says Sarath Fonseka. Party members left due to informal management. Without a strong leader, people chose National People's Power instead.

🟩

The situation is due to the failure of Sajith Brahmedasa formally managing the leadership of the United People's Power.. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Sajith Premadasa did not act properly as the leader of the United People's Power but also the leader of the opposition.

I quit because of the weakness found in the leadership of Sajith Premadasa. As well as many senior members left the party. The two positions he held did not engage in formal administration.

So if the other members of the party want to choose Harsha de Silva as the leader. They cannot act as a strong opposition party led by Sajith Premadasa.

Due to the lack of an alternative, the people have chosen national power. Even those who voted for the cylinder in the last presidential election have chosen national people's power this time. He said the United People's Power should now fulfill its responsibility.

At the General elections held last week, voters from all over the country have overwhelmingly selected the candidates fielded by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake or AKD as legislators to frame laws for a five-year term. In his journey to presidency, AKD’s supporters sang the theme song of which an appropriate rendering in English will be, ‘Today the whole nation in a single file will hand the country over to Anura to usher prosperity to people’. But the election results showed that it was not in a single file but without the support of the marginalised citizenry from the upcountry, and the north and the east. Like a true statesman, delivering his victory speech at the Elections Secretariat, AKD admitted that he had been endorsed by some sections in society but there are those who had not voted for him. He said that he will serve all the people without any division or discrimination as their President[1].
