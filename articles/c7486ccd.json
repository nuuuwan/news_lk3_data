By leveraging international best practices and collaborations, the party aims to equip farmers with advanced tools, ensuring the sector\u2019s resilience and contribution to economic growth.",
    "Central to the NPP\u2019s agricultural vision is the empowerment of farmers. The party aims to bridge the technological gap by providing farmers with access to information, market insights, and modern tools. This empowerment is not only a commitment to the sector\u2019s growth but also a step towards elevating the livelihoods of those at the heart of Sri Lanka\u2019s agricultural landscape.",

By emphasising Research and Development and technology integration, the party positions Sri Lanka to not only climb the ranks in the Global Innovation Index but also to cultivate a resilient and technologically advanced agricultural sector.",
