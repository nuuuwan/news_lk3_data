    "Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror) - Those who ruled the country, those who are currently ruling the country, and those who intend to rule the country in the future have no plan on how the country should be developed, Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake said.",
    "While opening his party office at Kirulapona today, he claimed that the government is making a decision not to settle the loans and the loan interest according to the tune of the IMF to obtain the IMF loan. This practice will lead the people of the country to bankruptcy, he said.",
    "\"To overcome the current bankruptcy of the country, the politicians bankrupted the people first by imposing huge taxes on them while increasing the prices of food and beverages,\" he said.",
    "\"Due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of the politicians, we lose sight of the ways of restoring the country. First of all, the country's economy should be uplifted, but these politicians have no plans to strengthen the country economically. If the current and traditional 225 parliamentarians are elected again as the leaders of the country, no one will ever be able to restore the country,\" he said.",
    "\"During the past five years, the revenue of the country has been reduced by Rs. 30 billion, and the people in the country are not responsible and have nothing to do with that. But all the past and present politicians must bear the responsibility. They did not have proper plans for that, and they are not planning to uplift the country's economy by 2048,\" Ratnayake said.",
    "\"Last year's economic depression was three percent. In 2022, the economic depression was five percent, and these politicians are talking about one percent economic growth. A country like us cannot gain 10 percent economic growth. If economic growth goes to two or three percent, the country's economy cannot be restored until 2200,\" he said.",
    "Nearly 50 percent of the people in the country suffer from massive food scarcity, and we should take measures to rectify this scarcity, Ratnayake said.",
    "\"According to the Keynesian Economics Theory, in the future, in our government, the prices of 20 very essential food items, including rice, wheat flour and sugar, will be stable for five years,\" he added."
