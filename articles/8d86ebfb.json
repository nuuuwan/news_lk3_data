For the vegetables, try eating carrots, broccoli, and tomatoes. If you don\u2019t love eating fruits and vegetables, these can also be consumed in the form of a delicious smoothie.",
    "If you have dry skin, the reason might be that you are not drinking enough water. After all, your body requires a lot of water to function normally. To keep your skin cells hydrated, you need to supply them with fresh water every single day. You are recommended to drink at least 08 glasses of water each day.",
    "Sleep is an easy but powerful beauty tip for glowing skin. Be sure to get eat least 08 hours of sleep each night. While we sleep, the damaged cells of our body are repaired, replaced, and replenished. If you don\u2019t sleep enough, your skin cells will be tired and look dry all the time. A lack of sleep will catch up with you quickly, forming dark circles under your eyes and exacerbating other skin conditions.",
