    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Lanka Pay, Sri Lanka\u2019s cheque clearing and payment platform operator, said it was introducing two new payment tools for online retail transactions; JustPay Web \u2013 a browser-based online payment tool, and PayMe \u2013 a secure messaging service that generates universal payment links.",
    "JustPay Web is an alternative internet payment gateway (IPG) that allows customers to make direct payments via bank accounts on browser-based applications.",
    "\u201cWith JustPay Web you do not have to download an app for each provider and clutter your phone,\u201d LankaPay CEO Channa de Silva said. The tool is accessible across most devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.",
    "\u201cWe have embedded several stringent security features into JustPay Web to safeguard customer data.\u201d",
    "The other payment app, PayMe, is a messaging service that generates universal payment links, allowing customers to make payments via any PayMe-enabled mobile or web application, de Silva said.",
    "According to De Silva, a survey done by LankaPay shows that 27 per cent of the Sri Lankan population purchase online at least once a month. The survey found that 53 per cent of those who shop online do so for reduced prices from cards, while 24-25 percent do so because of the availability of product varieties.",
    "Sri Lanka has seen growth in online payments in 2023. Total transactions had grown 43.8 according to the payments bulletin of the central bank.",
    "However, De Silva noted that there has been a reluctance to enter the banking system and do online payments. (Colombo/Feb26/2024)"
