    "\u201cI have officially notified the Election Commissioner that the election should proceed as scheduled,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the President\u2019s Media Division.",
    "Wickremesinghe also told the Chief Prelate that back in 2015, he had proposed reducing the President\u2019s term in office from 6 years to 5 years.",
    "The President visited the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya headquarters this afternoon (05) in Alvitigala Mawatha, Narahenpita. There, he had a brief discussion with the Chief Prelate of the Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Most Ven. Makulewe Wimala Nayaka Thero, the PMD said.",
    "During the visit, Most Venerable Makulewe Wimala Thero chanted \u2018Seth Pirith\u2019, bestowed his blessings upon President Ranil Wickremesinghe and presented him with a commemorative gift.",

    "\u201cAdditionally, we have secured a grace period of 4 years for loan repayment, extending the repayment timeline until 2043.

With strategic planning and actions over the next two years, we can position the country to avoid the need for further loans.",
    "Thailand, a Buddhist country, has developed a robust economy today through its open economy policy. In 1950, Thailand was twice as indebted as Sri Lanka. However, it has since built a thriving economy driven by exports. In 1991, the Vietnamese Minister of Industry sought advice from me on attracting industries and investments to Sri Lanka. Today, the roles are reversed, and I find myself seeking similar advice from Vietnam.",
    "I have officially notified the Election Commissioner that the election should proceed as scheduled. Back in 2015, I proposed reducing the President\u2019s term from 6 years to 5 years. Today, our nation faces economic challenges, prompting the government to initiate relief programs such as \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 aimed at easing the burden on our citizens.\u201d"
