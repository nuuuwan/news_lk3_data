    "\u201cAnd U.S. has signed on to the GFN (gross financing need) at their time limits (in a debt sustainability assessment done with the IMF), which means they must help us now.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey are in breach of the agreement. They are preventing all that, from us repaying repay the bondholders.",
    "\u201cWe have to tell the IMF tell the bondholders to go to the U.S. and collect the money.\u201d",
    "Without only promising to \u201cbuy Coca-Cola\u201d or gas, Sri Lanka should push home the point that the US signed on to the OCC, he said.",

    "Official and private creditors accepted the debt sustainability assessment and targets and gave relief on the basis that they were reasonable and achievable.",

    "President Trump is now reversing free trade and a global rules based order.",
    "He is moving towards an anti-globalization utopia asked for by many in Sri Lanka and elsewhere who oppose consumer sovereignty and propose a domestic production economy and self-sufficiency by pushing up prices.",
    "Trump is facing push back from some businesses who are now integrated to the world with at least one former ally threatening to take away his razor thin majority in the Senate in particular and make him a lame duck President.",
    "Sri Lanka controls trade and denies economic freedom to the people in part to \u2018save foreign exchange\u2019 because macro-economists have rejected classical economics and print money to cut rates.",
    "After cutting rates \u2013 usually with printed money \u2013 or re-financing private or government credit, various restrictions are placed on imports by the central bank or exchange controls are tightened.  (Colombo/July18/2025)"
