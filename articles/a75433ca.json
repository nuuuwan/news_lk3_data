    "The rise of AI and soon AGI, is truly amazing. The investments that have poured into AI in all areas in AI, is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Given the unprecedented rise in market cap of companies like NVIDIA until recently, the markets took a second look and decided this is crazy and the AI stocks even took a tumble. But why are mainly private investors pouring so much gasoline on AI? The following might give some perspectives.",
    "The present global GDP is about $ 110 trillion. Of which about 55% is in labour, about 15% is in technology and so on. Over the next 10 years, if growth stays similar, GDP will grow to about $ 120 trillion \u2013 $ 130 trillion. 20% of that will be about $ 25 trillion, which is what technology (including AI) is aiming to grow into. That is about $ 10 trillion more from present levels. Which parts of the global GDP will shrink as a percentage for technology to make these gains? The belief is that it will be from labour. \u201cIn the Industrial Revolution, we made human strength irrelevant, now we are making human intelligence irrelevant\u201d \u2013 Geoffrey Hinton, Father of AI.",
