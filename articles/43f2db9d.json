    "Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - Former President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Upul Jayasuriya PC said the President should not make the Constitutional Council a puppet of the executive but let it function independently on its own.",
    "He said the President had made statements on several recent occasions indicating that the Constitutional Council was part of the executive and that it should function under the purview of the latter.",
    "\u201cWe would like to remind the President that the Constitutional Council was established to control certain executive powers of the executive, thus it should not behave like a puppet,\u201d he said.",

If a second person from the same family wishes to join politics, that person has to wait until the first member retires.",
