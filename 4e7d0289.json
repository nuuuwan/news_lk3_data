    "Monks, politicians, and environmentalists often exhibit a tendency to extend their passion beyond rational boundaries. Their focus has shifted from the revered Toque Monkey in Fauna to the appreciation of Flora, particularly Crudia zeylanica. While their dedication [albeit politicos] to environmental causes is admirable, it is crucial to evaluate the economic implications that may arise from their actions. Rs 15 billion rupees saved by cutting the tree could be allocated towards either procuring essential medicines or conducting the postponed LG elections.",
    "Crudia, commonly known as the Sri Lanka legume, is a native plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. Initially discovered and named in 1868, this flora was deemed extinct after its last reported sighting in 1911. However, in 2019, three research scientists rediscovered the species near the Daraluwa Railway Station, surprising the botanical community. Subsequently, the Department of Wildlife Conservation has identified several locations in the Gampaha District where this plant is present. Despite its critical endangered status, recent events have sparked concern among environmentalists.",
    "On July 11, 2023, the Crudia zeylanica tree situated near the Daraluwa Railway Station in Gampaha was deliberately cut down. This action was taken as part of the construction of the four-lane Kadawatha to Meerigama expressway. The purpose behind this decision was to avoid the expenditure of approximately fifteen billion rupees that would have been required to divert the expressway.",
    "In February 2021, Devani Jayathilaka, the Gampaha Divisional Forest Officer, who gained prominence for emphasising the value of oxygen to a Pohottu politician, visited a construction site where the expressway was being built. During her visit, she discovered a Crudia zeylanica plant and promptly intervened to prevent the workers from destroying it. The involvement of monks in such situations is not uncommon in Sri Lanka. In this case, on 10 February 2021 they took action and even performed a ceremonial [or mythological] ordination of the tree, adorning it with a saffron robe. [a practice hitherto reserved for both the corrupt and uncorrupt politicians visiting the Sri Mahabodhi].",
    "This peculiar incident did not come as a surprise, having previously witnessed monks scaling the steel gate of the University Grants Commission, adorning the gate with their robes before swiftly departing the scene, bare-bodied.\u2014 The cutting down of the Crudia zeylanica tree highlights the ongoing challenges of balancing development and environmental conservation. Efforts to protect endangered species like Crudia zeylanica are crucial for preserving biodiversity and the natural heritage of Sri Lanka.",
    "Reflecting on my old botany textbook, \u201cTextbook of Botany\u201d by Susan George Pulimood, used in English medium schools in the early 1960s, I came across various flora names that highlighted feminine charm in botanic terminology, ending with \u201c...NICA.\u201d Examples include the Japanese flowering shrub Rose-Kerria japo-nica, the Spanish shrub Hyacinthoides hispa-nica similar to the Canadian glauca Co-nica, that rhyme with local feminine names like Ruwi-nika, Me-nika, or even Mo-nika.",
    "The lovely name Crudia zeylanica, according to qualified Botanists, does not hold the significance of being the sacred tree deserving veneration, the species is now being cultivated in the Botanical gardens at Peradeniya, and Hingurakgoda showcasing efforts to preserve it. The Department of Wildlife Conservation has also identified the presence of this species in multiple locations within the Gampaha District, which has raised concerns among environmentalists regarding the necessity of preserving this plant.",
    "It suggests that efforts to conserve and propagate the Crudia zeylanica are not only limited to a single location, but also extend to different botanical gardens, expanding the potential for its preservation. This development emphasises the importance of understanding and protecting the diverse plant life present on the island.",
    "Finding resources is crucial for organisations, including NGOs. However, there is limited research on NGOs\u2019 organisational environment. NGOs typically operate in resource-dependent or resource-scarce environments. Managing resource providers is essential for NGO managers. Acquiring necessary resources is a primary concern. For example, Naturalia\u2019s leader mentioned that fundraising consumes most of their time.",
    "Identifying suitable funders is a common interview question. Understanding the impact of resource providers on NGO structure is important. Investigating why they struggle to expand their support base is worthwhile. Institutional resources may compromise NGO independence. Unfortunately, existing answers to these questions lack clarity. The resource dependency perspective offers a promising starting point for understanding the NGO resource environment.",
    "Religions like Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism care for the environment, which is different from how Western religions often exploit it. The green movement, which focuses on our duties to future generations and nature itself, promotes a balanced and sustainable approach. It also discusses the conflicts that can arise between environmentalism and economic liberalism and suggests that by understanding the importance of nature and the urgent environmental issues we face, both sides can work together for fairness and a healthy planet. Ultimately, it encourages us to think about their beliefs and how religion and ethics can shape how we take care of the environment.",
    "An environmentalist\u2019s goal is to protect and preserve the environment. They promote interacting with nature and using natural resources through research and lobbying, may even protect endangered species and prevent environmental threats, such as deforestation. Some environmentalists do make money through affiliation with NGOs. Protesters from \u2018Just Stop Oil\u2019 in London last month received almost $1 million from the Climate Emergency Fund, helping to cover allowances paid for 40 organisers.",
    "In the US, there are several jobs as an environmentalist that will pay you well over $80,000 annually. For starters, environmental lawyers, engineers and solar energy consultants usually make above $87,000 per year. Recent years have seen an explosion of non-governmental organisations with a task to help redress various environmental problems, but the success of these organisations in carrying out their specified goals is rarely evaluated or critically examined. It has become more and more clear, however, that these organisations vary significantly in their level of capability and professionalism. Many of them are ineffective, and in some cases they may even aggravate the problems they embark on to resolve.",
    "Recent reports have revealed that some misguided monks attempting to excavate the area in search of traces of the Crudia. This unwise act, combined with the attention-seeking, disgruntled politicians who rushed from Kurundi in Mullaithivu to Daraluwa in Gampaha, and a few genuinely passionate environmentalists, among majority of their \u201cFor a few dollars more\u201d type colleagues who may have overlooked the consequences in their pursuit, has raised legitimate concerns and sparked questions about the outcome of their extremist behaviour.",
    "It is crucial to reflect on the potential negative consequences of such rebellious movements. In order to safeguard the interests of both the economy, environment and the community, it is imperative to prioritise transparency and maintain integrity throughout conservation efforts."
