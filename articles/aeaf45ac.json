    "Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The surge in the support for the National People's Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka can be attributed to the weakness of the Opposition, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.",
    "The primary opposition should be prepared to assume governance. However, this opposition prepared prematurely.",
    "Therefore, the emergence of a third party became prominent as uncertainty loomed over the effectiveness of the opposition.",
    "As a result, the main opposition's only course of action may be to collaborate with the ruling party. If they choose not to unite without careful consideration, several key leaders from the main opposition may opt to join the government.",
    "However, the selection of the common opposition or the President will be made by the Members of Parliament based on their personal opinions, but there is no relevance to being in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or any other political party.",
    "\"Meanwhile, the ongoing misunderstanding between the United National Party (UNP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) needs resolution by the leaders of both parties, and the time for that is now,\" he added.",
    "Addressing the media, he said that there is no difference between the UNP and the SJB. The members of the SJB are the people who worked with the UNP. Therefore, there is no difference between those parites.",
    "The President accepted the country in a situation where no one accepted during the crisis, and we respect him for that, Minister Harin Fernando said."
