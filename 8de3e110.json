    "What the teacher writes on the black board of life can never be erased",
    "Two groups of past students of Bishop\u2019s College, Colombo \u2013 the 1980 and 1981 batches \u2013 expressed their gratitude to teachers who had guided them by inviting them to tea very recently. Almost 20 long retired teachers and Bishopians of each group, very many having arrived from around the globe, met to reconnect after half a century. Teenage kids of then were now women \u2013 poised yet effervescent; wives, mothers, successful professionals, but united in celebrating reunion, appreciative of their teachers and reinforcing their commitment to their school. Each group was poised to enjoy several events organized, but one is sure the most earnest planning went to the felicitation of their teachers. One group even delegated pairs of them to visit teachers\u2019 homes to personally hand over invitations.",
    "Heartfelt welcoming hugs, kisses, namastes and exclamations of pure joy met each teacher as she entered the hotel restaurant to meet those who had left BC in 1980 and in the KG Hall in the college premises to enjoy high tea with the BC 1891 Group. A mix of joy and gratitude was the commonly felt emotion: the invitees to know they were not forgotten and the students exhibiting the finest of human qualities \u2013 gratitude. They voiced this in their welcoming addresses: \u201cWe were influenced and moulded by you, our teachers\u201d; \u201cWe are what we are because of you who taught us and were an example to us\u201d. Individually teachers were reminded of mischievous behavior which often went unpunished; favourite lessons taught and \u201cwe waited to see what you wore each day \u2013 always elegant with matching jewellery.\u201d Reminiscences warmed the teachers\u2019 hearts; returning to the BC premises brought on bouts of nostalgia.",
    "Teachers remembered their pupils\u2019 pranks, naughtiness, lack of attention during lessons, homework undone, but never ever any meanness or rudeness. There were none of these negatives. A class once almost caused yours truly a heart attack. I never could maintain complete silence in the classes I taught. Yes, admittedly I was lenient, but the kids preferred to have me teaching them math rather than the co-teacher of the subject who was a disciplinarian. One day Grade 8 was perfectly silent and more than ready for a math lesson. Strange, I said to myself; Maybe AJ (Principal) passed this way. No chalk in sight. Asking for it I was told it would be in the teacher\u2019s desk. I flipped open the top to have a snake shoot up with cobra hood extended. Sense told me it was a rubber reptile but by then my scream had shattered the peace of the Bawa building with the bishop\u2019s statute on the ground floor.",
    "I was also told by one young woman at the recent felicitation that her friends vowed I would be her mother-in-law; they had investigated and ferreted out the fact I had a teenaged son. Girls will be girls! One gimmick I smile over still is how with the ringing of the last bell and final chant for the day, most students would wriggle out of their mandatory under skirts, chuck them in their desk drawers to don the following morning.",
    "We teachers remembered Principal\u2019s we had worked under. I recalled with affectionate respect Ms Anabelle Jayasuriya and Vice Principal, adored Brenda Jayasinghe. Just as the girls were respectful and often scared of us teachers, we teachers were also the same with regard to AJ as we fondly shortened Ms A C B Jayasuriya\u2019s name. We hardly ever asked for leave, realizing our students paid fees and we had the advantage of long school holidays.",
    "Each of last week\u2019s evenings was meticulously planned and filled with group photographing, videoing, music, singing, a game or two, even tripping the light fantastic with students lovingly supporting the older teachers coaxed to shake and wiggle. A delight it was to meet the Principal and Vice Principal of the school \u2013 so very young and elegant.",
    "The two very happy and joy filled evenings did not end with teachers feted with food, love, gratitude and appreciation. No. The groups gifted each a large, full to the brim bag of goodies. Oh goodness! There were so many things stuffed in: cards expressing thanks, gift vouchers, toiletries, soups and congee packets, chocolates and biscuits, even a finger oximeter, and cash in an envelope. A group-member-composed poem was in one bag; quoted here:",
    "The quote at the beginning of this piece was on one group\u2019s invitation, while the other group had this to say in their thank you card in their takeaway gift bag.A good teacher can inspire hope; ignite the imagination and instill a love of learning!",
    "We teachers who were welcomed to two afternoons of delightful reunion, fellowship and love, appreciation and gratitude, thank each and every young woman of the Bishop\u2019s College Groups of 1980 and 1981. We loved you as our students and bless you now as grown, successful, happy women with keen sensibilities and kindness in your hearts.",
