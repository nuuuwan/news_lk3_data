  "original_body_lines": [
    "Gaza saw its deadliest day yet for aid-seekers in over 21 months of war as at least 85 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach food on Sunday, the territory\u2019s Health Ministry said.",
    "There was new alarm as Israel\u2019s military issued evacuation orders for parts of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated with ground troops and where many international organizations trying to distribute aid are located. One group said several offices were told to evacuate immediately.",
    "The largest death toll was in devastated northern Gaza, where living conditions are especially dire. At least 79 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel, Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the Health Ministry\u2019s records department, told The Associated Press.",
    "The U.N. World Food Program said 25 trucks with aid had entered for \u201cstarving communities\u201d when it encountered massive crowds.",
    "A U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to comment on the incident to the media, said Israeli forces opened fire toward crowds who tried to take food from the convoy. Footage taken by the U.N. and shared with the AP showed Palestinian men running as automatic gunfire was heard.",
    "\u201cSuddenly, tanks surrounded us and trapped us as gunshots and strikes rained down. We were trapped for around two hours,\u201d said Ehab Al-Zei, who had been waiting for flour and said he hadn\u2019t eaten bread in 15 days. He spoke over the din of people carrying the dead and wounded. \u201cI will never go back again. Let us die of hunger, it\u2019s better.\u201d",
    "Nafiz Al-Najjar, who was injured, said tanks and drones targeted people \u201crandomly\u201d and he saw his cousin and others shot dead.",
    "Israel\u2019s military said soldiers shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties. But it said the numbers reported by officials in Gaza were far higher than its initial investigation found. It accused Hamas militants of creating chaos.",
    "More than 150 people were wounded, some in critical condition, hospitals said.",
    "Al-Waheidi said Israeli gunfire killed another six Palestinians in the Shakoush area, hundreds of meters (yards) north of a hub of the recently created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.- and Israel-backed group, in the southern city of Rafah. The GHF said it was not aware of any incident near its site. Witnesses and health workers say several hundred people have been killed by Israeli fire while trying to access the group\u2019s aid distribution sites.",
    "Separately, seven Palestinians were killed while sheltering in tents in Khan Younis in the south, including a 5-year-old boy, according to the Kuwait Specialized Field Hospital, which received the casualties.",
    "The new evacuation orders cut access between the central city of Deir al-Balah and Rafah and Khan Younis in the narrow territory. The military also reiterated evacuation orders for northern Gaza.",
    "Palestinians were startled to see the orders for parts of Deir al-Balah, a relative haven. \u201cAll of Rafah is under evacuation, and now you have decided that half of Deir al-Balah is under evacuation. Where will we move to?\u201d asked resident Hassan Abu Azab, as others piled everything from bedding to live ducks onto carts and other vehicles. Smoke rose in the distance, with blasts and the sound of a siren.",
    "The United Nations was in contact with Israeli authorities to clarify whether U.N. facilities in the southwestern part of Deir al-Balah are included in the order, according to a different U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media. The official said that in previous instances, U.N. facilities were spared from such orders.",
    "The Medical Aid for Palestinians group said several humanitarian organizations\u2019 offices and guesthouses had been \u201cordered to evacuate immediately\u201d and nine clinics, including the MAP one, had been forced to shut down. It was not immediately clear what other groups were affected.",
    "Military spokesman Avichay Adraee called for people to head to Muwasi, a desolate tent camp with little infrastructure on Gaza\u2019s southern coast that Israel\u2019s military has designated a humanitarian zone.",
    "The announcement came as Israel and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks in Qatar. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted that expanding Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza will pressure Hamas in negotiations.",
    "Earlier this month, Israel\u2019s military said it controlled more than 65% of Gaza.",
    "Gaza\u2019s population of more than 2 million Palestinians are in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, now relying largely on the limited aid allowed into the territory. Many people have been displaced multiple times.",
    "Ambulances in front of three major hospitals in Gaza sounded their alarms simultaneously Sunday in an urgent appeal as hunger grows. The Health Ministry posted pictures on social media of doctors holding signs about malnourished children and the lack of medication.",
    "Hamas triggered the war when militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Fifty remain in Gaza, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.",
    "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed more than 58,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t say how many militants have been killed but says over half of the dead have been women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas government, but the U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
    "The Hostages Family Forum, a grassroots organization that represents many families of hostages, condemned the new evacuation order and demanded that Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s military explain what they hope to accomplish in central Gaza.",
    "\u201cEnough! The Israeli people overwhelmingly want an end to the fighting and a comprehensive agreement that will return all of the hostages,\u201d the forum said. On Saturday night, during a weekly protest, tens of thousands marched in Tel Aviv to the branch of the U.S. Embassy, demanding an end to the war."
