    "It\u2019s, indeed, encouraging to see our entertainers shining bright in the Middle East, as well.",
    "A few weeks ago, I highlighted the band Seven Notes, performing in Dubai.",
    "This week the spotlight is on The Exit, doing their thing in Doha, Qatar.",
    "In fact, I\u2019m told that the Qatar entertainment scene is packed with musicians from Sri Lankan.",
    "Leel Perera, who is based in Doha, mentioned this to me: \u201cI have chatted with you about Qatar and Sri Lankan entertainers. Even if you give one full page in The Island that will still not be enough to highlight everything that Sri Lankan entertainers are doing at this end.\u201d",
    "The band The Exit is a Sri Lankan pop/rock band, formed in 2017, in Doha Qatar.",
    "The seven-member band comprises Tiron Ismet (lead vocals), Isuru Santiago (rhythm guitar/vocals), Asanka Mihijaya (keyboards), Nuwan Chanaka (lead guitar), Iqbal Assan (bass), Nisala Perera (drums), and Rukvinda Madushan (percussion).",

    "A recent video clip, on social media, of the band doing the Queen hit \u2018I Want To Break Free\u2019, was well received by viewers, with Russel Kleyn saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been entertained by these guys for a while now; they are super awesome and know how to draw a crowd.\u201d",
