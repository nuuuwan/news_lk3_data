*2024-12-10 02:14:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/200848) ┬╖ `ta`

National Coordinator opposes allowing big businesses to control rice production in Sri Lanka, citing high profits and potential market shortages.

ЁЯЯй

The National Coordinator of the People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has urged the government not to allow the government to make rice producers' production of rice production in Sri Lanka, which is at a very high level of recession among children.

He said this while participating in a media briefing organized by the Lions Club in Colombo on Monday. There he added:

We have seen President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the issue of rice. But there is no rice in the market. The amount of rice is not sufficient for the present one of the reasons for the shortage of rice. But based on statistics, we have produced more rice than need in the past years. In the meantime, there is a shortage of rice.

Big rice manufacturers have planned rice. Through it they tend to make more profit. According to the Consumer Authority of Sri Lanka, it is a punishable offense. But now the law is not properly implemented. Manufacturers, therefore, are engaged in such improper activities.

### NPPтАЩs pragmatism and the political economy

*2024-12-10 01:44:37* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/NPP-s-pragmatism-and-the-political-economy/4-770281) ┬╖ `en`

By implementing reforms to strengthen governance, improve public institutions, and foster economic self-reliance, the Government can mitigate some of the risks posed by the agreements

Sri Lanka finds itself at a pivotal moment as President Anura Kumara Dissanayake announced that the country aims to complete its debt restructuring agreements by December 2024, with plans to resume loan repayments in 2028. The National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) Government has inherited an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Government burdened the country with which is potentially deleterious. Within that context the timeline is ambitious to navigate the complex web of economic recovery, social protection, and political consolidation. Despite the serious shortcomings of these agreements, the Government needs to take calculated measures to stabilise the nation in pragmatic ways.

### To not sweat the small stuff in education: Decentralise and delegate responsibilities

*2024-12-10 01:37:36* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/To-not-sweat-the-small-stuff-in-education-Decentralise-and-delegate-responsibilities/4-770280) ┬╖ `en`

The larger problem is that there are no certification requirements for teachers in Sri Lanka

Rice shortages and the Maaveerar celebrations in the north and reporting of the same in the south are issues that took centre stage last week. These are issues that shape a practical ideology for the new Government as it transitions from election promises to the reality of governing. As for rice shortages, it is time for the Cabinet to put its heads together and learn about the limits of State intervention in the marketplace and adopt appropriate responses. In the second case, the Government can use the situation as an opportunity to form a new narrative on our race relations.

### Sri Lanka electricity sector growth: Challenges ahead

Harnessing RE resources offers energy security and creates avenues for investment with skilled job opportunities opening for management, financial and technical specialists

Some of the factors that discourage investment flow and impede rapid development are the current sovereign credit risk ratings, state of the economy, risks associated with the principal sector player тАУ the CEB, uncertainties associated with ongoing power sector reforms, cumbersome regulatory framework and seeming ineffectiveness of the regulator тАУ PUCSL, expressions of environmental concern and geopolitics that influences project financing and development

I was an attendee at the International Conference on тАЬReimagining of the Electricity Industry for the FutureтАЭ held on 28 November 2024 organised by the Sri Lanka branch of The Institution of Engineering and Technology. The event was well attended and enlightening. My sincere thanks to the organisers for staging this impressive event.

### America has two presidents as the world braces for another Trump term

The election of Donald Trump as US President for yet another term has sent many world leaders scurrying for cover. Especially in the West. But even China is concerned. In the US itself, the longstanding maxim that there can only be one president at a time is being put to the test every day. Joe Biden, the outgoing president, is scrambling to salvage his legacy after a disastrous last year that has diminished all his achievements over the first three years on the domestic front.

Externally, BidenтАЩs presidency has been a monumental failure, from the impulsive withdrawal from Afghanistan that kickstarted it, to the hopelessly painful stalemate in Ukraine and the relentless mass devastation in Gaza that are dragging out its end. With the pardoning of his son Hunter Biden, the outgoing president has ceded even the little moral hump that he had over Trump.

### TongaтАЩs prime minister quits moments ahead of no-confidence motion in parliament

TongaтАЩs Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned in parliament on Monday ahead of a planned no-confidence vote in his leadership, capping a period of fraught relations between his government and TongaтАЩs king.

Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.

His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between TongaтАЩs monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010.

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-09 13:18:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) ┬╖ `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.
