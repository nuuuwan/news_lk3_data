    "The Minister also noted the imperative of trapping tax evaders in the tax net to ensure the country\u2019s continued status as a welfare state. In this regard, a program is slated for implementation this year to enhance tax compliance.",

    "The Minister stressed that as politicians, they have the authority to make diverse decisions. Nonetheless, it is the citizens of this country who must shoulder the resulting burdens. To propel the nation beyond its current challenges, it must attract new investments and foster job creation. It is imperative to integrate the creative youth community into the job market. It is noteworthy that this year\u2019s budget has been formulated with these objectives in mind, particularly with a forward-looking perspective.

Among the countries above us are Haiti, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria.",
    "To address this, the focus should be on identifying and apprehending those attempting to evade taxes, with an emphasis on restoring transparency. The implementation of a dedicated program for this purpose is planned to commence this year. These measures are essential not only to ensure free education, healthcare and other facilities at an elevated standard but also to alleviate the burdens on the people.",
    "It is crucial to recognize that there are no quick fixes for the economic crisis in the country. A viable way forward involves the implementation of a comprehensive, long-term targeted program."
