    "At least 36 people have died as fast-moving wildfires tear through the Hawaiian island of Maui, officials say.",
    "The deaths in the resort city of Lahaina, the island\u2019s main tourist destination, came as strong winds from a distant hurricane fanned the flames.",
    "The fire there is one of several ongoing blazes that have burnt entire neighbourhoods to the ground.",
    "Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes and a state of emergency has been declared.",
    "A huge search and rescue operation is under way, with some people still unaccounted for.",
    "\u201cWe barely made it out in time,\u201d Kamuela Kawaakoa, who fled to an evacuation shelter on Tuesday with his partner and six-year-old son, told the Associated Press.",
    "\u201cIt was so hard to sit there and just watch my town burn to ashes and not be able to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was helpless.\u201d",
    "Five evacuation shelters have been opened on Maui and officials earlier said they were \u201coverrun\u201d with people. The island is a popular tourist destination and visitors have been urged to stay away.",
    "\u201cThis is not a safe place to be,\u201d Hawaii Lt Governor Sylvia Luke told reporters. \u201cWe have resources that are being taxed.\u201d",
    "Firefighters are still battling active fires, with helicopters dropping water on the blazes from above.",
    "\u201cAs the firefighting efforts continue, 36 total fatalities have been discovered today amid the active Lahaina fire,\u201d the Maui county government said in a statement on Wednesday.",
    "Dozens of people have been injured since the fires began burning on Tuesday and hospitals on the island are treating patients for burns and smoke inhalation.",
    "Lahaina has been devastated by the fire and video showed the blaze tearing through the beachfront resort city.",
    "\u201cWe just had the worst disaster I\u2019ve ever seen. All of Lahaina is burnt to a crisp. It\u2019s like an apocalypse,\u201d resident Mason Jarvi told Reuters. He showed the news agency images of the city\u2019s destroyed and blackened waterfront.",
    "Mr Jarvi said he suffered burns after riding through the flames on his bike to save his dog.",
    "The fires earlier drove people to jump into the city\u2019s harbour to escape the flames and smoke. Fourteen people were rescued after jumping in, officials said.",
    "On Wednesday, the strong winds caused by passing Hurricane Dora eased slightly meaning pilots were able to view the full scale of the damage.",
    "Images taken from above showed burnt cars littering the streets and smoke rising high above piles of rubble.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying. I\u2019ve flown here 52 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything come close to that,\u201d helicopter pilot Richard Olsten told the Associated Press. \u201cWe had tears in our eyes.\u201d",
    "Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.",
    "The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions."
