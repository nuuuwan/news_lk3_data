    "UoM\u2019s Town and Country Planning Students Gain Insight into Human-Elephant Conflict",
    "In October 2024, third-year students from the University of Moratuwa\u2019s Department of Town and Country Planning embarked on an immersive learning experience at the Elephant Knowledge Walk Centre in Udawalawe, hosted by Dilmah Conservation, a Dilmah news release said.",
    "\u201cThis unique session aimed to broaden students\u2019 perspectives on human-elephant conflict (HEC), elephant conservation, and land-use strategies, by bringing together seven leading experts who shared deep insights into innovative approaches for tackling a persistent challenge that has impacted Sri Lanka for over 70 years,\u201d it said.",
    "The event marked a significant opportunity for students to re-imagine and contribute fresh solutions to the long-standing issue of HEC. Following an initial presentation from the students\u2014highlighting their analyses and use of the Land Use Conflict Identification Strategy (LUCIS) model\u2014the session expanded to discussions led by experts who encouraged the students to think beyond traditional methods.",
    "This innovative platform mirrors the philosophy of Dilmah Founder, Merrill J. Fernando, who often championed the need to think outside the box and break conventional approaches to create more effective solutions. Similarly, this session encouraged students to consider the complexity of HEC from a holistic and multi-disciplinary perspective, breaking away from rigid paradigms.",
    "Expert Insights on HEC The session continued with insights from distinguished experts who shared their knowledge across multiple facets of HEC:",
    "Dr. Malaka Abeywardana, a veterinary surgeon from the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and the Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home (ETH), provided a veterinary perspective on HEC, illustrating the vast impact of gunshots, snares, and jaw bombs on over 1,500 elephants annually, resulting in medical costs exceeding Rs. 50 million.",
    "Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya , former Director General of the DWC, emphasized the shortfalls of past HEC mitigation efforts, which have often prioritized human protection over elephant welfare, leading to a fundamental conflict of interests. He pointed out the limitations of protected areas, which have reached their carrying capacity, calling for more adaptable and inclusive approaches.",
    "Dr. S. Wijeyamohan , Senior Lecturer at the University of Vavuniya, reinforced the need for evolving solutions. He noted that temporary measures like palmyrah trees, chilli fences, and trenches only work until elephants adapt to them, stressing that co-existence should not come at the cost of altering natural elephant behavior.",
    "This rich exchange of ideas underscored the need for bold, innovative thinking\u2014a principle central to Dilmah Conservation\u2019s philosophy and its commitment to addressing issues beyond the conventional scope. By engaging a diverse group of experts, Dilmah Conservation offered students a comprehensive view of the complexities involved and the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving meaningful change.",
    "Public Interest and Conservation The discussions highlighted the significance of public interest, tourism, and policy support in maintaining elephant conservation efforts.  Prof. Enoka Kudavidanage, Professor in Conservation Biology at the Sabaragamuwa University noted that elephants remain a prominent figure in Sri Lanka\u2019s conservation landscape, their charisma continuing to draw public admiration and support. Senior Wildlife Ranger Mr. Anil Vithanage discussed the adaptability of highland elephants, unique for their ability to climb hills, underlining the importance of protecting elephants across diverse habitats.",
    "Adding an economic perspective, Mr. Srilal Miththapala, Past President of The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), highlighted the substantial tourism value elephants bring to the country, making a strong case for their protection both as ecological and financial assets.",
    "A Call for Change The session closed with Researcher Mr. Sameera Weerathunga\u2019s thought-provoking remarks on the root causes of HEC, often stemming from poorly timed interactions and heightened stress on both sides. He advocated for a balanced approach, noting, \u201cIf we protect people, the elephants will be protected too.\u201d",
    "The comprehensive learning session provided students with a deeper understanding of the real-life challenges involved in elephant conservation, inspiring them to develop novel, adaptive solutions. Dr. Chethika Abenayake and the lecturers from the University of Moratuwa expressed their gratitude to the speakers and Dilmah Conservation for orchestrating this valuable experience, underscoring the importance of thinking beyond convention and drawing on a wealth of knowledge to craft impactful solutions for the future.",
