    "The year just ending \u2013 2024 \u2013 most certainly was exceptional and will make its mark in the history of Sri Lanka. The reason is political: a drastic change in systems of governance and those wielding power, and consequently ushering a change in the economic and social condition of the nation and its people. The collective psyche of most Lankans too changed from moods of hopelessness and apathy in the face of obvious corruption and rot, to optimism. And thus my chant \u2018auld lang syne\u2019 for \u2018days gone by\u2019, \u2018times past\u2019 and \u2018for the sake of old times.\u2019",
    "This newspaper will carry many articles dissecting the past year and analyzing what could be expected from the new to be born in three day\u2019s time. So I decided to go back to beginnings to find out the origins of a couple new year customs",
    "Various calendars designated different days as the start of a new year and connected them to astronomical, religious or agricultural celebrations. The oldest recorded celebration of a new year dates back to 4000 BC in Mesopotamia which we know was the first western civilization that evolved between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates. I recall we learnt this fact of its being the very first civilization and not being made aware of the more ancient civilizations of China and the Indus Valley. Our textbooks long ago were western published and our education system British colonial. And so our education then was Euro-centric.",
    "However, to get back to ancient Iraq, the festival was called Akito and celebrated at the first moon after the spring equinox and lasted for about 12 days. It fell in March. China has a 3,500 year history of celebrating new year on the second new moon following the winter solstice which was in late January.",
    "The Julian Calendar as introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC with the advice of astronomers, mathematicians and possibly soothsayers, selected January 1 as the beginning of the new year. The month is named for Janus, the two faced god who symbolically looked backward at the ended year and forward to the new. The Romans offered sacrifices to him and promised good conduct in the coming year. However, the calendar showed snags due to leap years and difficulty in determining when Easter was. Thus Pope Gregory XIII introduced a revised calendar in 1582 which solved the problem of accommodating leap years of 366 days. The Gregorian calendar had January 1 as New Year\u2019s day. Protestant and Orthodox nations were slow to adopt it thus UK and the US accepted it as late as the 1750s. Until then new year was on March 25 in these countries.",
    "In 1740, the English clergyman, John Wesley, founder of Methodism, created the Covenant Renewal Service held at dawn of New Year\u2019s day. Called watch night service, it was solemn with prayers and hymn singing. This service is held in most of our churches too where those in prayer are supposed to recall the past and anticipate the future year. Maybe some regret past mistakes and resolve to be better.",
    "In Sri Lanka January 1 is accepted as the start of a new year, though there is a perception among Sinhalese that New Year celebrations are due mid-April when the planets undergo a change in their configuration and affect humans, as pronounced by astrologers. Most non-Christians also however, mark January 1 as auspicious and start the day and year with religious observances: worship in temples and kiribath being a must for breakfast. I well remember being woken up very early as a child and Mother guiding me to set eyes on a Jak tree in the compound below our home down Peradeniya Road in Katukelle. It was propitious to see a tree which oozes \u2018milk\u2019. I don\u2019t know whether papaw and rubber qualify for this honour. Our family walked to the Dalada Maligawa in pre-dawn gloom. The Maligawa was always crowded on January 1, and it must be more so now",
    "Festivities start on 31st night. In Colombo, Galle Face Green is chock-a-block with people waiting to greet the New Year. Fireworks is a must. Ships in port sound their sirens and the loud music from hotels and other spots add to the joyous medley. While some Christians are at solemn midnight mass, others \u2013 mostly young ones and of all religions \u2013 are at dinner dances. And thus the first greeting for the New Year are hugs and kisses. And then, or later, auld lang syne will be sung. Champagne is quaffed or a less expensive drink is taken as toast to the new beginning.",
    "is a Scottish song meant to be sung as farewell to a departing year. Now it is sung at the end of any party celebration with the holding of crossed hands. It is also sung at funerals and graduation ceremonies.",
    "The text is a Scots language poem written by poet Robert Burns in 1788, based on an earlier folk song. In 1799 it was set to a traditional pentatonic tune which is now standard. Auld Lang Syne translated to English can mean \u2018old long since\u2019 or \u2018long long ago.\u2019",
    "Dropping the ball at midnight in Times Square in New York is the most significant symbol for New Year in America. Crowds estimated at thousands gather to see it dropped and more than a billion watch it on TV. The custom dates back to 1907, started by the then owner of the New York Times, Adolph Ochs, to promote Times Square building\u2019s status as the headquarters of the newspaper. The ball drop replaced the annual series of New Year Eve fireworks displays. The metal and wood ball was designed by Jacob Straus aka Artkraft Straus, Ukranian immigrant metal worker. The ball was lowered down the building\u2019s flag pole.",
    "Now it is a crystal inlaid ball that is dropped from the top of One Times Square building and along a specially designed flagpole at exactly 11.59 pm, December 31. In 2007, for the 100th anniversary of the Times Square Ball Drop tradition, a spectacular LED crystal ball was created, the incandescent and halogen ball of the past century being replaced by state-of-the art LED lighting technology that enhanced the colour and brightness of the ball. This inspired the building owners of One Times Square to install at the top of its skyscraper a permanent Big Ball weighing nearly six tons and twelve feet in diameter, with 2000 and more crystal triangles illuminated by 32000 LEDs. It sparkles year round for all to see.",
    "I googled \u2018new year resolutions\u2019 not expecting any feedback. I was surprised at how much info was available on this subject. So here goes.",
    "New year resolutions, I was informed, started with the Babylonians 4,000 years ago. More currently, it is Christian in origin, since John Wesley started Watch Night Service Mass to be a prayer session when, together and individually, those at prayer look back on the fast dying year and one\u2019s actions in it, and to the future being born with resolution to be better. However, resolution making is more secular now, and global. Promises are not made to a god or gods, but to oneself; the focus being self-improvement and giving up bad habits as identified when soul searching.",
    "According to recent research 45% Americans say they make New Year resolutions. Only 8% successfully keep them till year end. I was an avid, avowed resolution maker starting in my teens with simple ones like I won\u2019t be envious of other girls\u2019 good looks, popularity etc. Then it progressed to controlling temper and being more careful with money. Soon enough I felt it was useless me making pious resolutions if the husband went on with his style of spendthrift living. More significantly I had to be honest and admit the resolutions made were diluted or thrust aside before three months were gone. At this advanced age there are none needing to be made. No call to even resolve to \u201cbear any misfortune with equanimity\u201d; \u201cI will not fear death\u201d. Religions teach practical living. The basics of Buddhism if followed, make for a life of ease of mind and actual joy in living.",
    "I feel strongly and thus gladly that Sri Lanka is very much on the threshold of a good year. We Lankans can surely look to 2025 with hope. We will not be assailed with rumours of corruption and have to bear constantly recurring instances of the rule of law being rendered asunder. These transgressions will be severely curtailed. Poverty will surely be reduced. We won\u2019t have to listen on TV to persons whom we dislike because of their pomposity, their evil doings and worse, their coating themselves lily white.",
    "We got more than our bellyful of murderers, chain snatchers, rapists, fraudsters, in high places. Instead we now have persons whom we like to see, and know full well are concerned about the country and its people, and not themselves. We have implicit faith in the President, Prime Minister, and Minister who constituted the interim Cabinet prior to the general election. Their sincerity of purpose and determination to do good by the country and its people are obvious.",
    "We have faith that the disparity between haves and have-nots will be reduced and luxury living for some on government charity will be slashed. As an afterthought, I make bold to slip in the advantage we are sure to enjoy in 2025 \u2013 no violent strikes and no constant protests. You know why!",
    "Nan wishes everyone a good year of serenity and well-being and the new leaders a very good year of making Sri Lanka a land of peace, improvement and joy for all.",
