    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar has sought to address an issue that is expected to figure in talks between President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shortly. Dissanayake is scheduled to leave for India tomorrow on a state visit. Minister Chandrasekar is reported to have said the longstanding fisheries dispute between Sri Lanka and India could be resolved only if the Indian fishers stop bottom-trawling. Indian fishermen are notorious for employing internationally banned fishing methods, which must be stopped. But that alone will not help solve the vexed issue.",
    "A prerequisite for solving any problem is to identify it properly. The issue Sri Lanka has been struggling to tackle is poaching by the Tamil Nadu fishers in its territorial waters. Bottom trawling is only one aspect of that problem, which has remained intractable because India is wary of reining in the Tamil Nadu fishermen responsible for illegal fishing.",
    "What needs to be addressed is the entire problem of illegal fishing and not a part of it. Poaching is essentially a legal issue and there cannot be a diplomatic solution to it. No foreigners must be allowed to fish in Sri Lankan waters, and all those who do so must be arrested and made to face the full force of the law. Similarly, Sri Lankan fishers must be told in no uncertain terms that if they fish in India\u2019s or any other country\u2019s territorial waters, they will do so at their own risk.",
    "Interestingly, the Tamil Nadu fishers let out howls of protests when Sri Lanka dumped discarded vehicles in its territorial waters, in June 2021, as part of a programme to create artificial reefs. They claimed those submerged contraptions would damage their nets and affect their livelihoods! It was an admission on their part that they fished illegally in Sri Lankan waters and used banned methods. We argued in an editorial comment that more such end-of-life vehicles should be dumped into the sea to disrupt the Tamil Nadu fishermen\u2019s bottom-trawling operations.",
    "There is more to the issue of illegal fishing than economic costs and threats to local fisherfolk\u2019s livelihoods. Smugglers, especially drug traffickers, use fishing craft to carry out their illegal operations, as evident from the huge hauls of narcotics frequently found in trawlers. Therefore, illegal vessel movements in a country\u2019s territorial waters must be stopped at any cost. Smuggling operations also pose a serious threat to a nation\u2019s national security. Sri Lankan criminals resort to boat escapes and carry out gun-running operations with the help of rogue fishers, both local and foreign. A strategy to stop these illegal operations consists in tackling the poaching issue.",
    "It has been revealed that some Tamil Nadu politicians are behind poaching in Sri Lankan waters. Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, as the Fisheries Minister in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, pointed out that most of the Indian vessels involved in poaching belonged to Tamil Nadu politicians, who rented them out on the strict condition that they be used for fishing in Sri Lanka\u2019s territorial waters. Those politicians are driven by an ulterior motive, and therefore illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu fishers at the behest of their political leaders could be considered a willful infringement of Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty.",
    "It is hoped that the NPP government will tread cautiously in addressing the issue of illegal fishing, without leaving any room for India to opt for piecemeal remedies instead of preventing the politically-backed Tamil Nadu fishers from blatantly violating Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign right to control and manage its marine resources.",
