    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board\u2019s re-structuring faces execution risk, Fitch Ratings said, while confirming its \u2018BB+(lka) rating on expected state support.",
    "\u201cThe new Electricity Act includes provisions to unbundle CEB\u2019s generation, transmission and distribution into separate entities,\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cWe believe the unbundling will improve CEB\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness. The utility is already preparing separate financials, maintains separate bank accounts and is in the process of allocating assets and liabilities for the three units.",
    "\u201cHowever, we believe the restructuring faces execution risk and may be contingent on the outcome of Sri Lanka\u2019s general election on 14 November.\u201d",
    "A deviation from cost reflective tariffs is risk to the CEB\u2019s balance sheet.",
    "\u201cCEB has operated on a cost-reflective tariff mechanism since June 2023, which is revised quarterly to ensure operating costs are covered,\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cOur base case forecast assumes the tariff framework will remain in place, as any deviation is a key risk to CEB\u2019s balance sheet.",
    "\u201cThe quarterly tariff revision due in September 2024 has yet to be finalised, pending regulatory approval. Tariff revisions in the preceding four quarters were implemented within one-month of the quarter-end.\u201d",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 11 Nov 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ceylon Electricity Board\u2019s (CEB) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018BB+(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch also affirmed the National Long-Term Rating of CEB\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured debentures at \u2018BB+(lka)\u2019.",
    "CEB\u2019s ratings are equalised with the Sri Lankan sovereign rating (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating CCC-) under Fitch\u2019s Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria. This is based on our assessment that there is a very high likelihood that CEB, the country\u2019s monopoly electricity transmitter and distributor, would continue to receive government support.",
    "\u2018Very Strong\u2019 Incentive to Support: Fitch believes that a default by CEB would lead to severe service disruption, with CEB accounting for about 73% of generation capacity at end-2023. A default would also make it difficult for CEB to source feedstock used for power generation, such as heavy oil and coal, which are imported. Independent power producer (IPP) agreements \u2013 about 27% of generation capacity \u2013 will also be affected.",
    "These are external arrangements with no clear alternatives and most of them use imported oil in their operations.",
    "A non-payment by CEB would dampen the state and its related entities\u2019 ability to raise debt, as CEB\u2019s project loans are also the state\u2019s obligations. Some of these loans are provided by bilateral and multilateral agencies and channeled through the government to develop the country\u2019s power infrastructure. Thus, a default on these project loans could be tantamount to a government default. We expect support to continue, despite the state\u2019s weak financials, as CEB fulfils an essential public service.",
    "\u2018Very Strong\u2019 Responsibility to Support: We expect state support to continue, as the government would want to ensure an uninterrupted power supply. The government fully owns CEB, appoints the board and decides investment strategy. Tariffs are set using a cost-reflective pricing method requiring regulatory approval. Previously, the utility set tariffs based on social objectives rather than commercial ones.",
    "Various Types of Support: Government support to CEB has included direct grants, two-step loans from multinational agencies (about 19% of CEB\u2019s outstanding debt), equity injections and guarantees on bank loans for some of the investment projects and working-capital requirements. The government converted CEB\u2019s outstanding payables to the IPPs and national oil supplier Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) into equity at end-2023.",
    "Lower Costs: Generation costs fell in tandem with the rise in hydropower to 31% of the generation mix in 1H24 (1H23: 23%), while thermal coal prices dropped by 32% yoy.",
    "Thermal coal fuels over 36% of the country\u2019s generation mix, and Fitch expects prices to fall by 20% in 2024 and 10% in 2025. CEB\u2019s financing costs will also fall amid lower interest rates. CEB has also reduced tariffs twice in 2024 by a cumulative 44.5%.",
    "Improved Profitability on Tariff Framework: CEB has operated on a cost-reflective tariff mechanism since June 2023, which is revised quarterly to ensure operating costs are covered. Our base case forecast assumes the tariff framework will remain in place, as any deviation is a key risk to CEB\u2019s balance sheet. The quarterly tariff revision due in September 2024 has yet to be finalised, pending regulatory approval.",
    "Tariff revisions in the preceding four quarters were implemented within one-month of the quarter-end.",
    "We estimate CEB\u2019s EBITDA to have improved to LKR180 billion in 2023, from a negative EBITDA of LKR65 billion in 2022, following the revised tariff framework. We forecast EBITDA will remain around LKR160 billion in the next two years under the tariff framework. We estimate cash flow from operations to have jumped to LKR30 billion in 2023, from negative LKR58 billion in 2022. However, we expect capex will require external debt funding, although leverage should remain around 2x in the next few years.",
    "CEB Restructuring Subject to Execution Risk: The new Electricity Act includes provisions to unbundle CEB\u2019s generation, transmission and distribution into separate entities. We believe the unbundling will improve CEB\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness.",
    "The utility is already preparing separate financials, maintains separate bank accounts and is in the process of allocating assets and liabilities for the three units. However, we believe the restructuring faces execution risk and may be contingent on the outcome of Sri Lanka\u2019s general election on 14 November.",
    "Indeterminate Standalone Credit Profile: We believe that CEB\u2019s Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) cannot be meaningfully determined in the near term, despite an improving financial profile. CEB is highly dependent on the government for funding access, with less than 3% of its debt stemming from domestic private-sector banks at June 2024. CEB\u2019s ability to meaningfully diversify funding away from state institutions, and achieve a degree of financial independence, rests on the current tariff framework.",
    "CEB has a monopoly in electricity transmission and distribution in Sri Lanka. It owns and operates the majority of installed power-generation capacity. CEB\u2019s rating is equalised with that of the sovereign, in line with our GRE criteria, as we assess linkages and support incentives as \u2018Very Strong\u2019 under each sub-factor score.",
    "Fitch\u2019s Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer:",
    "\u2013 Annual electricity demand growth to average around 6% over 2024-2027;",
    "\u2013 Generation mix to change to 45% thermal, 25% hydro and 30% other over 2024-2027;",
    "\u2013 Tariff to be adjusted every three-months to cover CEB\u2019s operating costs;",
    "\u2013 Capex to range between LKR105 billion and LKR125 billion annually from 2024 to 2027;",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "\u2013 A downgrade of the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR could result in corresponding action on CEB\u2019s National Long-Term Rating.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "\u2013 An upgrade of the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR could result in corresponding action on CEB\u2019s National Long-Term Rating.",
    "For the sovereign rating of Sri Lanka, the following sensitivities were outlined by Fitch in the agency\u2019s Rating Action Commentary on 25 September 2024:",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:",
    "\u2013 External Finances: Completion of the foreign-currency commercial debt restructuring that Fitch judges to have normalised the relationship with private-sector creditors would result in an upgrade of the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR.",
    "\u2013 Public Finances: A sustained decline in the general government debt/GDP ratio that is underpinned by the implementation of a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy and faster economic growth.",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:",
    "\u2013 The Local-Currency IDR would be downgraded if further restructuring or a default on local-currency debt becomes probable due to an unsustainable debt burden or inability to raise revenue.",
    "Improved Liquidity on Government Support: CEB had LKR83 billion in unrestricted cash at end-June 2024, against LKR90 billion in debt due in the next 12 months. More than 90% of the outstanding debt is for working capital, which we believe will be rolled over in the normal course of business.",
    "CEB received LKR126 billion in equity-funding in 2023 from the Ministry of Finance to settle its dues to the IPPs and CPC. Further liquidity support is not factored into the rating case, given our assumption of a continuation of the cost reflective tariff framework and resultant healthy operating cash flow. However, we believe the government would step in with support, if required, given CEB provides essential services.",
    "State-owned CEB is the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka and accounts for 73% of domestic electricity generation capacity through its network of hydro and thermal power plants.",
    "REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING",
    "The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.",
    "CEB\u2019s ratings are equalised with that of its parent, the Sri Lankan sovereign, in line with Fitch\u2019s GRE criteria.",
