    "Extremely talented, indeed, and, this is how my Chit-Chat with Hiruni went\u2026",
    "Well, I would say I\u2019m a motivated and ambitious individual who strives for excellence in both my personal and professional life.",
    "2. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?",
    "Cultivate more self-confidence that would enable me to have a strong belief in my abilities.",

    "No, I\u2019m not. My opinion is if we work hard we can achieve our goals, or else, there is no way.",
    "Someone who is trustworthy, reliable and respects my boundaries and values my opinions.",
    "My mother and father, of course. They have consistently shown me unconditional love and support throughout my life.

Incidentally, my father, Ruwan Fernando, is a guitar instructor, who earlier worked at Yamaha Music School.",
    "My musical instruments. When I\u2019m with these musical instruments, I feel relax.

It can be a source of comfort, joy, and a means to process and cope with emotions.",
    "12. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?",

    "Sri Lanka\u2019s natural beauty truly captivated me. The emerald tea plantations, in Nuwara Eliya, painted a picturesque landscape, and I delighted in the aroma of freshly brewed Ceylon tea. The misty mountains of Ella unveiled awe-inspiring views, and hiking through the lush greenery left me in awe of nature\u2019s wonders. Discovering the diverse wildlife in Yala National Park, from elephants to leopards, added a touch of adventure to my vacation. And, that is, I would say, is my kind of vacation.",
    "Rock and pop, classical and jazz. As a bass guitarist, I love to play and listen to rock and pop and jazz. As a pianist, I love to play and listen to classical music.",
