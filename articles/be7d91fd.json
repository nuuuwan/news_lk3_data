    "The SJB-led Opposition is given to selective amnesia, just like the NPP government, which has conveniently forgotten most of its election pledges. It turns a blind eye to the issues that are politically disadvantageous to it and takes up the ones it can flog to gain some political mileage. It has suddenly become concerned about devolution and remembered that the Provincial Council (PC) elections are long overdue!",
    "Addressing the media, SJB MP Dayasiri Jayasekera yesterday called upon the government either to hold the PC polls or to scrap the PC system. This is a classic example of a false dilemma/dichotomy, as logicians may say. The Opposition\u2019s call in question obviously has not stemmed from any concern for devolution or the people\u2019s franchise. The SJB and like-minded others seem to think that the government, struggling on several fronts, is not ready for another election. They are acting out of expediency rather than principle.",
    "The SJB is of the view that a minor amendment to the Provincial Council Elections Act will help clear obstacles to conducting the PC elections under the Proportional Representation (PR) system. The SJB seniors themselves are responsible for the unholy mess the PC system is in; the PCs have been without elected representatives for about eight years. The country has had four Presidents and three governments since the PC polls were postponed in 2017!",
    "There is no gainsaying that the PC polls should be held without further delay since no election should be postponed for political reasons. Parliament should pass an amendment to the PC Elections Act immediately to provide for conducting the PC polls under the PR system. Whether the PC system has become a white elephant and should be scrapped is an issue that should be addressed separately.",
    "Both the government and the Opposition find themselves in the dock where the indefinite postponement of the PC polls is concerned. They and all others who backed the UNP-led Yahapalana government (2015-2019) owe an apology to the public for delaying the PC polls. That administration consisting of the UNP-led UNF and the SLFP-led UPFA, and backed by the JVP, delayed the PC polls for fear of losing them. It passed what looked like a Christmas tree bill to amend the PC Elections Act to postpone the PC polls. A division was called in the House but there were no votes against that bad bill. The TNA/ITAK voted for it.",
    "This newspaper was among those who vehemently condemned the deplorable manner in which that amendment bill which was made out to be a move to guarantee a 30% quota for women was stuffed, at the committee stage, with sections changing the electoral system to delay the PC polls. What was passed by Parliament was vastly different from the bill examined by the Supreme Court.",
    "The vociferous SJB MPs who are calling upon the incumbent government to hold the PC polls were in the Yahapalana government. Nothing can be done about bad laws passed by Parliament in this country because there is no constitutional provision for the post-enactment judicial review of legislation. The need for a constitutional amendment to provide for judicial scrutiny of all laws after their passage cannot be overstated.",
    "The SBJ MPs, who are now on a campaign to pressure the government to hold the PC polls immediately, have demonstrated their hypocrisy. However, it is incumbent upon the government and the Opposition to amend the PC Elections Act in a transparent manner, expeditiously, enabling the Election Commission to hold the delayed PC polls.",
