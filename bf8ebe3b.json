    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has a right to summon any government official to be questioned but not at a parliamentary committee meeting of which he is not a member, according to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.",
    "The speaker and opposition leader had a war of words in parliament Wednesday June 05 morning over the former\u2019s turning up at a Committee on Public Finance (COPF) meeting on June 29 where Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt optimisation (DDO) plan had been taken up for discussion.",
    "Government members of COPF had strongly objected to Premadasa\u2019s active participation at the meeting, eventually agreeing to let him only observe the proceedings. COPF is chaired by MP Harsha de Silva who represents Premadasa\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party.",
    "\u201cAs opposition leader, do I not have the right to go to the committee and question the officials?\u201d he asked.",
    "Speaker Abeywardena responded somewhat impatiently that the opposition leader does have the right to summon and question any government official to his office \u201cwithout going and sitting in committees\u201d.",
    "Premadasa can convene any meeting outside the COPF, said Abeywardena, where he may question any government official.",
    "\u201cOkay. Thank you very much. I will do that. But one thing: don\u2019t listen to instructions from the executive or the president and try to block it,\u201d replied Premadasa.",
    "If any government official refuses to abide by his summons, said the opposition leader, it would be considered a breach of his parliamentary privileges.",
    "\u201cNo, not a committee. You can summon them,\u201d replied the speaker.",
    "COPF endorsed the DDO proposal on Friday June 30 with majority support though opposition members had voted against it.",
    "The SJB and a number of other opposition parties voted against the DDO in parliament on Saturday July 01. (Colombo/Jul05/2023)"
