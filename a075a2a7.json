    "India on Tuesday (12  Sep 2023)  said the progress made by Sri Lanka, on its commitment to fulfill the Tamils\u2019 aspirations, was \u201cinadequate\u201d and urged the island nation to \u201cwork meaningfully\u201d to keep its promises.",
    "\u201cWe have taken note of reaffirmation by the Government of Sri Lanka on implementation of its commitments. However, progress on the same is inadequate and we urge the Government of Sri Lanka to work meaningfully towards early implementation of its commitments to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected,\u201d India\u2019s representative told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva at its ongoing 54th session.  The position was consistent with New Delhi\u2019s remarks last year, that voiced concern over the \u201clack of measurable progress\u201d.",
    "India\u2019s intervention at the \u2018Interactive Dialogue\u2019, comes in the wake of the latest report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on \u2018Promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka\u2019. Fourteen years after the civil war ended, Sri Lanka is far from reconciling the ethnic conflict that triggered it.",
    "If the country\u2019s past is troubled, its present is marred by last year\u2019s devastating financial meltdown that has left over half its population vulnerable. The High Commissioner\u2019s office sought to highlight both the challenges. Addressing the Council on Monday, Nada Al-Nashif, the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights said one year after the \u201cremarkable protest movement\u201d \u2014 the Janatha Aragalaya that ousted the Rajapaksas as the island\u2019s economy crashed dramatically \u2014 demanding deep political and democratic reforms, the transformation \u201chas still not materialised\u201d.  Pointing to soaring poverty levels and the enduring impact of the crisis, she said an estimated 37% of households faced acute food insecurity.",
    "Further, the top UN official underscored the limits placed on citizen\u2019s political participation and free expression, owing to the delays in holding local government elections, and in reconstituting Provincial Councils under the 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution.",
    "India, too, reiterated its position on power devolution, citing its \u201ctwo guiding principles\u201d of support to the aspirations of Tamils for equality, justice, dignity, and peace; and to the unity, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Sri Lanka. \u201cWe hope that the Government of Sri Lanka will fulfill the aspirations of Tamils for equality, justice and peace and its commitment to implement the Thirteenth Amendment and conduct Provincial Council Elections to ensure a life of respect and dignity for Tamils in Sri Lanka,\u201d the Indian diplomat said.",
    "The UN official also highlighted escalating tensions in the island\u2019s north and east, due to land acquisition \u201cfor expansion of military installations, Buddhist heritage conservation at Hindu or Muslim sites, and forestry protection.",
    "At the ongoing session, the Council will not vote on a Sri Lanka resolution, but is reviewing the island\u2019s own commitments. While the High Commissioner\u2019s report said it \u201crecognises\u201d the Sri Lankan government\u2019s initiatives in regard to truth-seeking and reconciliation, it stressed that \u201curgent confidence building steps\u201d are needed for \u201cgenuine reconciliation and transitional justice process\u201d to succeed. The Sri Lankan government rejected the report, and termed earlier resolutions of the Council \u201cintrusive and polarising\u201d."
