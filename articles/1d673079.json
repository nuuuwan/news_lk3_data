    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB)\u2019s Mujibur Rahuman returned to parliament, replacing State Minister of Tourism Diana Gamage who was ruled illegible for parliament.",
    "Rahuman was sworn in as an MP before Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena Friday May 10 morning. He had resigned last year to contest the local government election which has been indefinitely postponed. Rahuman was the SJB\u2019s candidate for Colombo mayor.",
    "The Supreme Court made the verdict on Gamage on Wednesday May 08 when a petition filed against her was taken up for consideration.",
    "The petition was filed by civil activist Oshala Herath, in which he sought a ruling that Gamage was unqualified to serve as a Member of the Sri Lankan Parliament as she is a British citizen.",
    "Gamage entered parliament on the SJB ticket as a national list MP after the 2020 parliamentary election. She subsequently crossed over to the government of then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Following Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation, she has been serving as State Minister of Tourism under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Colombo/May10/2024)"
