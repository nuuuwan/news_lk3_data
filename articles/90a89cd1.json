    "Sri Lankan tourism, the third highest foreign exchange earner in the country, is seeing successes in tourism arrivals as never before, even comparable to pre pandemic levels. 2018 was considered one of the best years for Sri Lankan tourism in achieving tourist arrivals but the current year with upswelling tourist arrivals has made the tourism industry experience an increase in revenue besides creating more employment opportunities, a Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) press release said.",
    "The release adds: \u2018Increasing tourism attractions and initiatives implemented to encourage more tourists to Sri Lanka as one of the most renowned travel destinations in the world have resulted these accomplishments.",
    "\u2018With continuous promotional efforts by Sri Lanka Tourism and stakeholders, the tourism sector has seen a considerable growth in the recent times. The year 2023 was probably one of the best years in the Sri Lanka Tourism Calendar by reaching more than 100,000 tourist arrivals each month, except in May 2023, which was 83,309. December 2023 saw the highest number of tourist arrivals in a month to the destination which hit an astounding 210,352 arrivals, making 2023 a record year of 1,487,303 arrivals, which is a testimony to the tourism sector\u2019s future growth.",
    "\u2018This can be taken as an excellent outcome after Sri Lanka Tourism went through challenges and obstacles during the past few years, such as the COVID 19 pandemic, 2019 Easter attacks and the 2022 economic crisis. Despite these challenges Sri Lanka Tourism was determined to steer ahead by spreading the positive message all across the world that, \u2018\u2019Sri Lanka is ready and safe\u2019\u2019. It was indeed a strenuous task to cast off all the negative impressions circulating among some media about the destination. But with the promotional efforts done by Sri Lanka Tourism, it has reached a stage where tourists would now grab every opportunity to visit Sri Lanka to experience its amazing travel and holiday opportunities and exquisite attractions.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s Pekoe Trail was listed as the National Geographic\u2019s title of \u2018\u2019Best of the World for 2024\u2019. The Pekoe Trail, which starts from Kandy and ends up in Nuwara Eliya is an exclusive opportunity to witness Sri Lanka\u2019s beautiful central highlands by passing remote villages and lush tea estates spanning an area of approximately 200 miles.
