  "original_body_lines": [
    "Accuses Govt. of failing to implement a single revenue-generating program",
    "Claims the country\u2019s problems remain and people are being forced to make difficult decisions",
    "Stresses that history has proved that one man cannot rebuild Sri Lanka",
    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) spokesman MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday slammed the Government for its failure to implement any new revenue-making programs.",
    "\u201cThe IMF is not a panacea for the current crisis. It is only a form of assistance. The panacea is to create new revenue-making ventures. However, excessive taxes, hiked tariffs or fuel prices, selling off state assets or obtaining more loans are not revenue-making ventures,\u201d he noted.",
    "Marikkar opined that the Government must act as a regulator. \u201cWe must obtain loans to commence new businesses and not for sustenance. Show us one new venture initiated by the Government,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said the reality is far different to the development portrayed by the Government. According to him, though the long queues for necessities have disappeared, the real issues of the people have not. He pointed out that 7.5 million people have fallen into poverty. \u201cThe recent World Bank report has found that one-third of the population has become poor. If poverty has increased twofold since last year then how can we say the country has developed?\u201d he asked.",
    "Marikkar noted that people are being forced to make difficult decisions in relation to their lives due to the current situation. \u201cThough one plants news stories with photos of people swarming at malls in Colombo it does not mean the country has developed. The problems remain like burning embers,\u201d he noted.",
    "He also accused the ruling party of being keen on its internal issues and lack of ministerial positions rather than the issues faced by the country."
