  "original_body_lines": [
    "In view of this weekend\u2019s elections in Sri Lanka, I had decided to take the week off, as few would have any interest in American politics. In spite of the strangest \u201capparent\u201d assassination attempt on former president and current Republican candidate for the 2024 presidency, Donald J. Trump.",
    "However, some news items this Friday morning from the US bemused me so much that I decided to pen a few lines in an attempt to beat the deadline, especially, as they required little creativity and less controversy.",
    "The assassination attempt was made on the morning of last Sunday, September 15, when Trump was playing an unscheduled round of golf on his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida.",
    "I used the word \u201cstrangest\u201d because plans for this round of golf was not on the official schedule given the previous day to the secret service detail responsible for the security of a former president of the United States. The decision to play golf was made by Trump on the morning of that Sunday.",
    "In these circumstances, the secret service was unable to secure the entire perimeter of the course. Instead, they hurriedly organized the security measures implemented for a regular round of golf by Trump. Which, in addition to the usual detail around him while he was playing, included agents who walked ahead of the hole he was playing.",
    "While Trump was walking to the fifth green, the agent who was on the sixth tee noticed the barrel of a rifle in the bushes. He immediately fired at it, and heard a man running away. The suspected assassin fired no shots.",
    "Special Agent Rafael Barros said, \u201cIn the bushes where this guy was, is an AK-47-style rifle with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence that had ceramic tile in them and a GoPro camera\u201d, noting that the suspect was seemingly intent on filming the incident.",
    "The White House said that both President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris were briefed on the incident on Sunday afternoon.",
    "President Biden said in a statement, \u201cAs I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President\u2019s continued safety\u201d. In a separate statement, VP Harris said, \u201cI am glad Trump is safe. Violence has no place in America\u201d.",
    "Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, JD Vance, he of the \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d fame, said, \u201cthe big difference between conservatives and liberals is that no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months. And now, two people have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months\u201d, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and cut this crap out. Someone\u2019s gonna get hurt, and it\u2019s gonna destroy the country\u201d.",
    "I will leave it to the readers to figure out the frequency with which Vance\u2019s beloved leader has used violent rhetoric to incite his supporters. One prime example, which goes to predict Vance\u2019s fate if he goes against his Fuhrer, is when Trump had his mob threaten his predecessor, \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d, on January 6, 2021. That should jog his memory.",
    "Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s new best friend, who has been guaranteed to run a \u201cgovernment efficiency commission\u201d in Trump\u2019s administration, if re-elected, read: \u201cNo one is even trying to assassinate President Joe Biden or Vice-President Kamala Harris\u201d. A public incitement, hastily deleted.",
    "The to-be assassin has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, who was arrested less than an hour after he allegedly fled the crime scene. Routh has a long criminal record with multiple misdemeanors and one felony count of possession of a weapon of mass destruction. Although his criminal record is peanuts compared to that of Donald Trump, he has committed the unforgivable crime, deserving, according to Trump\u2019s 2025 agenda, of capital punishment, of having voted, in person, Democratic in the 2024 primary election in North Carolina.",
    "These two most puzzling \u201cassassination attempts\u201d, have resulted in the intended victim escaping with just an attractive era-piercing, millions of dollars richer in campaign contributions and the added reputation of a war-scarred martyr. His previous bone spurs are now a distant memory.",
    "I pray that the \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d will not be a third such assassination attempt.",
    "The main issues surrounding the coming election in November are Immigration, the Economy and Reproductive Freedom.",
    "Reproductive freedom has just jumped to the top of the list, after an incident in Georgia, which is the reason I decided to write this essay even at this last moment.",
    "As an ill-educated, still intellectually curious person, I have been confused by the various views propagated on the subject of Reproductive Freedom. The two battle lines drawn today, which are vague and indistinct in themselves, are those who are Pro-Life and others Pro-Choice. Both seem to be misnomers.",
    "The confusion begins as there does not seem to be any agreed conclusion as to when life begins. Some believe that life begins at conception, when the male sperm swims up the female vagina and fertilizes an egg in the Fallopian tube.",
    "I will discount the opinions of maniacs who (I hope) joke that life begins when the condom breaks, or even at erection!",
    "From this point of actual conception, there are three stages of prenatal development \u2013 germinal, embryonic and fetal. The earliest forms of human life \u2013 reflexive motions \u2013 begin between the ninth and twelfth week of gestation (the first trimester); the heartbeat grows stronger, body systems become further developed and the fetus increases about six times its size during the second trimester (16 weeks through 24). The earliest point at which life may be considered to begin is at the end of the second trimester (24 weeks or six months).",
    "The Pro-Life argument rages at which point life begins, when an embryo shows forms of human development. The extremists assert that life begins at six weeks, when the woman is hardly aware that she is pregnant. Others go from six weeks to 24 weeks, when the fetus develops a heartbeat and shows signs of human development.",
    "So the argument is not Pro-Life, it is Pro-Birth. Pro-Lifers do not care if the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, if the pregnancy will ruin her future life, if she is a 12-year-old forced to carry the fetus created by rape by her incestuous father, indeed if the fetus itself is defective and/or will threaten the life of the mother. The only intent of these misnamed ProLifers is that the embryo should be carried to birth. To hell with the life of the mother or the fate of the newly born baby during the years after birth. That is not their concern.",
    "A new report in ProPublica reveals the details of the excruciating final days and death of Amber Nicole Thurman in a Georgia hospital in the summer of 2022. Mother to a young son, Thurman, 28-years-old, learned she was pregnant with twins. She decided, as she was hoping to attend nursing school, \u201cshe needed to pursue her career ambitions and preserve her new-found stability\u201d, a decision only she can make.",
    "Three years earlier, the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law prohibiting abortion at six weeks. After the Republican controlled US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\u2019s constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, granting that right instead to state legislatures, Georgia\u2019s ban went into effect. At that point, Thurman\u2019s pregnancy had just passed six weeks.",
    "Thurman scheduled an appointment with a hospital in North Carolina, for the required, simple medical procedure of Dilation and Curettage. When traffic delayed her travel, the clinic \u2013 \u201cinundated with women from other states where bans had taken effect\u201d \u2013 could not meet her appointment. A clinic employee gave her legally obtained abortion pills to use instead. Pro-Publica reports, \u201cHer pregnancy was well within the standard care for that treatment\u201d.",
    "Unfortunately, on her return home, Thurman suffered a highly unusual complication, with increasing pain and heavy bleeding. The North Carolina clinic would have performed an immediate D&C as a free follow up, but it was too far away. Thurman went to a nearby Georgia hospital, whose doctors were prohibited under penalty of life imprisonment to administer any instrument& with the purpose of terminating a pregnancy. They were forced to delay the procedure for a day. By the time she was taken to surgery, it was too late, they watched her die. Her mother recalled her last words: Promise me youll take care of my son.",
    "The sole cause of Amber Thurman\u2019s death was the Republican-led criminalization of women\u2019s healthcare. It is what happens when political, religious zealots living in the middle-ages seize power. Georgia Governor, Brian Kemp famously said when he signed this iniquitous bill into law: \u201cGeorgia is a state that values life. We stand up for those who are unable to speak for themselves\u201d. But when Amber Thurman lay dying on a hospital bed, there was none of these \u201cPro-Life\u201d heroes there to speak for her, a vibrant, 28-year-old human being. They had already spoken for a couple of six-week-old zygotes.",
    "Vice-President Harris has vowed to bring back the protections of Roe v. Wade to women\u2019s Reproductive Freedom, when she is elected the President of the United States.",
    "The second item of news that hit the headlines was the JD Vance created (his word) story that illegal immigrants from \u201cHaitia\u201d (really the shithole nation that his boss called Haiti) were eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio, the pets of the residents of that idyllic little town.",
    "Springfield is a town of about 60,000 people, including 15-20,000 legal immigrants from Haiti. These immigrants are in the US legally, under the Immigration Parole Program. They have been of immense benefit to Springfield, a town which had a major labor shortage, and are considered to be hard-working, responsible legal residents.",
    "In early September, Republican Vice-Presidential candidate JD Vance, who is also a Senator from Ohio, spread a story on national TV, \u201craising the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio\u201d. He also made the baseless claim that these Haitian immigrants were stealing the pets, cats and dogs, and even the geese and ducks from the parks, and eating them. A veritable wild-goose chase.",
    "Following his running-mate\u2019s elevation of this rumor, Donald Trump stated during the recent Presidential Debate, that Haitian immigrants \u201cwere eating the cats, they\u2019re eating the dogs, they\u2019re eating the pets of the people who live there\u201d. A claim (now turned into a catchy ditty) that aroused the most attractive laughter of Debate rival Vice-President Harris, and had ABC moderator immediately state that he had checked this with a spokesman for the Town of Ohio, who had stated there were no credible reports of such activity. Ted Cruz, US Senator from Texas, posted, \u201cPlease vote for Trump so that Haitian immigrants don\u2019t eat us!\u201d",
    "Which now, I believe has become the slogan for the Immigration policy of the Republican Party.",
    "This story originated from a Facebook post of a lady in Springfield that her cat, Miss Sassy, had disappeared. This rumor had gone from a friend who heard it from another friend who heard it from an acquaintance, by which time Miss Sassy was found, safe in her owner\u2019s basement.",
    "Springfield has received more than 30 bomb threats since the circulation of this baseless rumor, which has required city troopers deployed to protect schools and hospitals. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said that if any candidates want to visit his town, it\u2019s going to be very, very, difficult.",
    "Trump is sticking to this pet-eating story in spite of all evidence to the contrary. He plans to visit Springfield within the next two weeks. Speaking at a campaign rally in Uniondale, Long Island, New York, Trump said he would be going to Springfield \u201cto escalate his demonization of Haitian immigrants in that city, He said he would follow up with a rally in Aurora, Colorado, a Denver, Colorado suburb with a large population of Venezuelan migrants.",
    "Trump has now openly declared his policy of incitement of violence to immigrants. He is lumping his lies about immigrants eating pets with his martyrdom in solving the Immigration policy. He said he is going to Springfield although he is well aware of the dangers of assassination.",
    "Said the hero, \u201cI\u2019m going to Springfield. You may never see me again, but that\u2019s okay. Got to do what I got to do\u201d. And Trump, asking and answering his own question:",
