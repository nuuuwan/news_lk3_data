    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)\u2019s former general secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara who was axed from the position wants back in, insisting that he can help rebuild the party.",
    "Commenting on the much-celebrated recent departure of Galle District MP and SLFP Senior Vice President Shan Wijyelala de Silva to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Jayasekara said other crossovers are also likely.",
    "\u201cHe left the SLFP because he felt he had no future in it. It started with Shan Wijelal. The others are gradually displacing to other places,\u201d said Jayasekara.",
    "The Kurunegala district MP said that for this not to happen, the SLFP should take him back in.",
    "\u201cBy taking me back to the party and allowing me to [carry out my duties], I believe I can build this party again,\u201d he said.",
    "The SLFP removed Jayasekara as the party\u2019s general secretary and has also suspended his party membership in September 2023.",
    "A letter dated September 05 and signed by party chairman and former president Maithripala Sirisena informed Jayasekara that he had been removed from the party and therefore he would cease to function as party secretary.",
    "Addressing the SLFP\u2019s 72nd anniversary celebration earlier that week, Jayasekara said a crisis situation exists in the party due to difference of opinion.",
    "\u201cWe are engaged in talks to resolve that crisis. Today we\u2019re in the middle of a massive geopoltical crisis.",
    "We must all come to one mind and we have to either do politics in the government or in the opposition. We have to choose one,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOur leader has brought us together with great difficulty. So there is no need to have problems between us,\u201d he added.",
    "Sirisena later said however that Jayasekara\u2019s suspension from party membership is only temporary and he may return to the fold on one condition.",
    "Speaking to reporters in Colombo on September 06, Sirisena said: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been removed. His duties have temporarily been suspended,\u201d said Sirisena.",
    "The former president is also facing a court case over the SLFP chairmanship, he said speaking to reporters at the SLFP headquarters, though he declined to elaborate.",
    "\u201cJayasekara can come back to the party without any problem. We\u2019ll take him back in any capacity other than secretary,\u201d said Sirisena.",
    "\u201cHis membership has been temporarily suspended, but that can be changed anytime if he comes to an agreement with us and stops the various things he\u2019s been doing,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jan03/2023)"
