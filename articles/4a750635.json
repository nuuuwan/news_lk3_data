    "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia will recognise a Palestinian State at the UN General Assembly in September, following similar moves by the UK, France, and Canada.",
    "Albanese said Australia received commitments from the Palestinian Authority (PA), including to demilitarise, hold general elections, and continue to recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist.",
    "\u201cA two-State solution is humanity\u2019s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering, and starvation in Gaza,\u201d he said yesterday.",
    "Israel, under increasing pressure to end the war in Gaza, has said recognising a Palestinian State \u201crewards terrorism.\u201d Since last Saturday, five people have died as a result of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, bringing the total number to 217 deaths, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. It also said that, in total, more than 61,000 people have been killed as a result of Israel\u2019s military campaign since 2023. Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on 7 October that year, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The PA, which controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, earlier said recognition of Statehood shows growing support for self-determination of its people.",
    "Albanese said the decision was made after his Government received commitments from PA President Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas would play no role in any future State. The move also comes after conversations with his counterparts in the UK, France, New Zealand, and Japan over the past fortnight, Albanese said.",
    "\u201cThere is a moment of opportunity here, and Australia will work with the international community to seize it,\u201d he told the media.",
    "Last Sunday, a pro-Palestinian protest drew tens of thousands of supporters who walked across Sydney Harbour Bridge, a day after a Court ruling allowed the demonstration to happen.",
    "The US has stated it will not follow suit and believes that recognising Palestinian Statehood would be rewarding Hamas. Over the weekend, US Vice President JD Vance reiterated the US had no plans to recognise a Palestinian State, citing a lack of functional government.",
    "At a press conference on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticised countries planning to recognise Palestinian Statehood. \u201cTo have European countries and Australia march into that rabbit hole, it is disappointing \u2013 and I think it\u2019s actually shameful,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know what they would do if, right next to Melbourne or right next to Sydney, you had this horrific attack. I think you would do at least what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
    "Israel has come under fire in recent days over its plans to take over Gaza City, with UN ambassadors condemning the move which Netanyahu says is the \u201cbest way\u201d to end the war.",
    "Last year, Spain, Ireland, and Norway formally recognised Palestine as a State, in the hopes it would encourage a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.",
    "The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN\u2019s 193 Member States.",
    "At the UN, it has the status of a \u201cpermanent observer State,\u201d allowing participation but no voting rights."
