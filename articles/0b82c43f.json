  "original_body_lines": [
    "Medical and Civil Rights Professional Association President Dr. Chamara Sanjeewa, has filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding yet another stock of alleged low-quality human immunoglobulin vials imported from India.",
    "The complaint was lodged yesterday, following revelations that the stock, deemed unfit for use, was ordered to be removed from use by the Health Ministry in September.",
    "Dr. Sanjeewa presented a document signed by the Health Ministry Director of Supplies indicating that a decision had been made to discontinue the use of the immunoglobulin due to quality issues. He revealed that during a meeting of the Health Ministry\u2019s Safety and Risk Committee, it was decided to withdraw the entire stock from use.\u00a0 He further noted that despite previous arrests, including that of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and at least 15 other officials, questions remain about how such low-quality medicines continue to enter Sri Lanka.",
    "Dr. Sanjeewa expressed concern over the lack of proper procedures and quality tests in place before registering these imports in Sri Lanka. He raised questions about accountability, stating that the relevant officials should be investigated, and the economic loss incurred by these failed medical imports should be recovered from those responsible.",
    "He also emphasised the need for those responsible for the importation of low-quality medicines to face legal action, as public health and safety continue to be at risk."
