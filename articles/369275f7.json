  "original_body_lines": [
    "As a Sri Lankan journalist exploring Malaysia\u2019s vibrant tourism landscape \u2013 from the futuristic city of Putrajaya to the historic charm of Melaka and the bustling energy of Kuala Lumpur \u2013 I was struck not only by the country\u2019s attractions but also by something deeper: the exceptional service culture in its star-class hotels.",
    "Staying at properties such as Pulse Grande, Birkin International Hotel, Ramada, and Ion Majestic, I witnessed firsthand how Malaysia\u2019s hospitality sector has mastered the art of guest satisfaction, employee empowerment as well as employee satisfaction.",
    "\u201cThe courteous, attentive, and highly professional service is no accident. It results from world-class training, capacity building, and teamwork,\u201d Simon Tan, General Manager of Birkin International Hotel in Melaka, told\u00a0The Island Financial Review.",
    "Wan Mohd Hadafy Bin Wan Mohd Khair, General Manager of Pulse Grande Hotel in Putrajaya, elaborated: \u201cMalaysia\u2019s hotel industry draws inspiration from global best practices while infusing local warmth. Many staff undergo rigorous training programmes, often benchmarked against international chains like Marriott, Hilton, and Shangri-La.\u201d",
    "When I noted how seamlessly Malaysian staff blend professional training with genuine hospitality \u2013 never appearing disengaged \u2013 he added: \u201cMany guests commend this trait. Humility, respect, and courtesy are innate qualities in our staff, making training even more effective.\u201d",
    "Employee training & teamwork\u00a0\u2013 Regular workshops on service excellence, conflict resolution, and cultural sensitivity ensure equitable respect for all guests.",
    "Proactive service\u00a0\u2013 Staff anticipate needs with politeness and presence of mind.",
    "Employee empowerment\u00a0\u2013 Valued employees deliver exceptional service as a positive feedback loop has been created.",
    "A fellow Sri Lankan guest at Pulse Grande shared his observations: \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s hotels, renowned for their scenic beauty and heritage, could benefit from Malaysia\u2019s systematic approach to human resource development. While Sri Lankan hospitality is naturally warm, structured training, performance incentives, and guest feedback mechanisms could elevate the experience further.\u201d",
    "He added: \u201cMalaysia\u2019s success proves that investing in employees translates to guest satisfaction. Sri Lankan hotels should explore partnerships with Malaysian hospitality institutes or etiquette trainers in hospitality to foster higher value of their human resource.\u201d",
    "Malaysia\u2019s hotels don\u2019t just accommodate guests \u2013 they delight them. Their secret? A relentless focus on both employees and visitors. For Sri Lanka, a country equally rich in culture and natural beauty, adopting similar strategic training and human-centric dynamics could be the key to competing globally.",
    "As I departed Malaysia, I carried back not just memories of stunning skylines and UNESCO heritage sites but also inspiration \u2013 a vision of what Sri Lanka\u2019s hospitality sector could aspire to become.",
    "Wouldn\u2019t it be remarkable if Sri Lankan hotel staff set the next benchmark for excellence in South Asia?",
    "The Sri Lankan guest I met at Pulse Grande had booked SriLankan Airlines for his family trip to Malaysia, which he said was his favourite airline.\u00a0According to\u00a0Sharuka Wickrama Adittiya, Manager for Malaysia at SriLankan Airlines, a total of 3,171 passengers traveled\u00a0from Sri Lanka to Malaysia\u00a0in May 2025,\u00a0with SriLankan Airlines carrying 1,830 of them.\u00a0Meanwhile,\u00a05,652 passengers traveled from Malaysia to Sri Lanka in the same month, of which SriLankan Airlines carried 2,311.",
