The announcement came as a federal judge in Portland, Oregon - another liberal city - temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying 200 troops there.

Judge Karin Immergut called Trump’s statements about conditions in Portland “untethered to the facts,” and said the move violated the Constitution.
