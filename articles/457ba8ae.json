    "Sri Lanka is set to celebrate World Tourism Day 2025 with one of the most ambitious and wide-ranging series of events the industry has seen in recent years. Organized under the global UNWTO theme of \u201cTourism and Sustainable Transformation,\u201d the programme reflects the country\u2019s determination to place its youth, SMEs, and academic excellence at the centre of tourism\u2019s future. From competitions in the provinces to international conferences at BMICH, this year\u2019s Expo marks not just a celebration but a reimagining of Sri Lanka\u2019s role in global tourism.",
    "The initiative is jointly organized by the Ministry of Tourism, the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management (SLITHM), the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), and the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), alongside the Alumni Association of Tourism Economics & Hospitality Management (AATEHM) and the Sustainable Tourism Unit of the University of Colombo. The collaboration itself is a reflection of the multi-stakeholder approach Sri Lanka is adopting to build resilience, promote innovation, and prepare the next generation of tourism leaders.",
    "The Sri Lanka Tourism Expo has become a recognized platform for showcasing the country\u2019s talent, creativity, and industry potential. Since its inception, it has combined professional competitions, knowledge-sharing, and business networking in ways that have left lasting impressions on both participants and audiences.",
    "The first Expo in 2021, held at One Galle Face Mall, set the tone by bringing the energy of the hospitality industry into a public space. Hoteliers from leading establishments took part in food and beverage competitions, testing their skills in cocktail-making, mocktail preparation, and live cooking contests. These events were not just spectacles; they highlighted the artistry and professionalism of Sri Lanka\u2019s hospitality workforce, drawing large crowds and engaging the public with the industry in a celebratory way.",
    "In 2022, the Expo returned with even greater ambition. Once again hosted at One Galle Face, it expanded its programme to include the Colombo Travel Mart, organized in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO). This marked a turning point, as the Expo began to serve not only as a stage for showcasing talent but also as a serious platform for business-to-business networking and industry growth. Travel agents, tour operators, and hoteliers connected with international partners, underlining Sri Lanka\u2019s potential to attract investment and build market linkages.",
    "The 2022 edition also featured panel discussions, where academics, policymakers, and private-sector leaders addressed contemporary issues in tourism. These dialogues set the groundwork for what has now become a central feature of the Expo \u2014 the recognition that tourism requires not only creative and operational excellence but also strategic foresight and collaboration across sectors.",
    "Together, the 2021 and 2022 Expos created a strong foundation. They demonstrated the value of bringing together competitions, fairs, business linkages, and policy dialogue under one umbrella. These experiences have directly informed the 2025 edition, which now integrates youth through school competitions, entrepreneurs through SME awareness programmes, and international expertise through the research conference and leaders\u2019 summit.",
    "By revisiting its past and scaling up its ambition, the Sri Lanka Tourism Expo 2025 carries forward this legacy, aiming to position Sri Lanka as a destination where talent, innovation, and collaboration converge to shape the future of tourism.",
    "The programme commenced on 1 September 2025 with the provincial rounds of the All-Island School Tourism Club Competitions. Conducted in partnership with SLITHM, these competitions brought together enthusiastic students from all nine provinces to showcase their talents in culinary arts, food and beverage service, housekeeping, and tourism knowledge. The venues spanned the island: SLITHM Jaffna for the Northern Province, SLITHM Kurunegala for the North Western, SLITHM Ratnapura for Sabaragamuwa, SLITHM Bandarawela for Uva, Mindada Hotel Ampara for the Eastern Province, SLITHM Kandy for the Central Province, SLITHM Koggala for the Southern Province, SLITHM Colombo for the Western Province, and SLITHM Anuradhapura for the North Central Province.",
