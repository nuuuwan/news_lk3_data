    "The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has already secured a two-thirds majority in Parliament after winning a total of 123 seats in the House in the 2024 General Election.",
    "NPP had confirmed its majority power in parliament, which it sought during the election campaigning, after winning a whopping 16 out of the 19 available seats in the Gampaha District.",
    "NPP polled a total of 898,759 votes (72%) to win the district while the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) placed second with 150,445 votes (12.18%).",
    "The NPP has thereby secured 16 seats in the district while the SJB has won the 3 remaining seats.",
    "This brings the party\u2019s tally of seats secured thus far to 123. It needed 113 seats in the 225-member house to secure a majority.",
    "NPP has so far polled a total of 6,842,223, which is 61.73% of the votes counted thus far.",
    "NPP leader and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called for snap parliamentary elections after winning the presidential poll, needs a clear majority to deliver his promise to combat corruption and restore stability after the country\u2019s worst-ever economic crisis.",
    "He had urged the public to provide the NPP government with the two-thirds majority it wants to be able to pass its ambitious reforms.",
    "In the previous parliament, which was dissolved by Dissanayake, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which now leads the NPP, had just three seats."
