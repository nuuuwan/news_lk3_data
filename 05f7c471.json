    "The Government agreed to some amendments proposed by the Opposition while some others were rejected.",
    "One of the major amendments proposed by the Opposition was that the legislation should be effective from the date the UN Charter on Corruption was approved by the member states. However Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapaksha argued that there is no provision in the Constitution to make a legislation effective from the date on whicn UN Charters are approved.",
