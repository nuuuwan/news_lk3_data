    "A Palestinian source familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC that Hamas officials have been given the White House\u2019s 20-point proposal.",
    "It demands that Hamas will have no role in governing Gaza, and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.",
    "Speaking at a news conference following talks at the White House, Trump called the plan \u201ca historic day for peace\u201d.",
    "But he said that Netanyahu will have US backing to do what he has to do if Hamas does not agree to the plan.",
    "Netanyahu then said Israel \u201cwill finish the job\u201d if Hamas rejects the plan or does not follow through.",
    "The Palestinian Authority, which governs the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has called the US president\u2019s efforts as \u201csincere and determined\u201d.",
    "In a statement published by its WAFA news agency, the authority said it \u201crenews its joint commitment to work with the United States, regional states, and partners\u201d to end the war on Gaza, ensure sufficient delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and the release of hostages and prisoners.",
    "The proposal, if followed, would begin with the immediate cessation of military operations. It also says existing \u201cbattle lines\u201d would be frozen in place until conditions are met for a staged withdrawal.",
    "Under Trump\u2019s plan, Hamas would lay down its arms and its tunnels and weapon production facilities would be destroyed.",
    "For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 dead Gazans, the plan says.",
    "The plan also stipulates that once both sides agree to the proposal \u201cfull aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip\u201d.",
    "The US also outlines its plan for the future governance of Gaza.",
    "It says a \u201ctechnocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\u201d will govern temporarily \u201cwith oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, called the Board of Peace, which will be headed\u201d by Trump.",
    "Former UK PM Sir Tony Blair will be part of the governing body alongside other leaders \u201cto be announced\u201d. Sir Tony called the plan \u201cbold and intelligent\u201d.",
    "British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan, saying, \u201cWe call on all sides to come together and to work with the US Administration to finalise this agreement and bring it into reality.",
    "\u201cHamas should now agree to the plan and end the misery, by laying down their arms and releasing all remaining hostages,\u201d Sir Keir added.",
    "European Council President Antonio Costa said he was \u201cencouraged by Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s positive response\u201d to the proposal. He added \u201call parties must seize this moment to give peace a genuine chance\u201d.",
    "French president Emmanuel Macron praised the proposal, saying: \u201cFrance stands ready to contribute\u201d to the efforts to end the war and release hostages.",
    "\u201cThese elements must pave the way for in-depth discussions with all relevant partners to build a lasting peace in the region, based on the two-state solution,\u201d said Macron.",
    "The plan adds that Hamas must have no role in governance, \u201cdirectly, indirectly, or in any form\u201d.",
    "Much of the plan is focused on what the US calls an \u201ceconomic development plan\u201d to rebuild Gaza. It also says \u201cIsrael will not occupy or annex Gaza\u201d and its forces will withdraw from the territory in stages over time.",
    "In a shift from Trump\u2019s earlier statements, Palestinians will not be forced to leave Gaza. Instead, the document said: \u201cWe will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.\u201d",
    "The plan also leaves the door open to an eventual Palestinian state.",

    "Asked about the group\u2019s weapons, the official said: \u201cThe weapons of the resistance are a red line as long as the occupation continues.",
    "\u201cThe issue of arms can only be discussed within the framework of a political solution that guarantees the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.\u201d",
    "The announcement of the plan comes just days after Netanyahu attacked the recognition of a Palestinian state by multiple Western countries during a combative speech at the UN General Assembly.",
    "Netanyahu labelled the recognition moves a \u201cmark of shame\u201d that sent the message that \u201cmurdering Jews pays off\u201d.",
    "Dozens of officials and diplomats staged a walk-out as he took to the UN podium, leaving large parts of the conference hall empty.",
