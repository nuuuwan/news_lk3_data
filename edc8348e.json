    "The restitution event will be open to the public and will comprise activities to educate young and old on the long-shared history of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands. The museum is also planning to host public lectures by experts, guided tours, and a panel discussion. The area surrounding the museum will have food stalls and there will be fun educational activities for children.",
