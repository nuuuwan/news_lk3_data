  "original_body_lines": [
    "President-elect Donald Trump is showing no sign of letting up in his desire for the US to acquire Greenland and the Panama Canal, calling both critical to American national security.",
    "Asked if he would rule out using military or economic force in order to take over the autonomous Danish territory or the Canal, he responded: \u201cNo, I can\u2019t assure you on either of those two.",
    "\u201cBut I can say this, we need them for economic security,\u201d he told reporters during a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.",
    "Both Denmark and Panama have rejected any suggestion that they would give up territory.",
    "Trump also vowed to use \u201ceconomic force\u201d when asked if he would attempt to annex Canada and called their shared border an \u201cartificially drawn line\u201d.",
    "The boundary is the world\u2019s longest between two countries and it was established in treaties dating back to the founding of the US in the late 1700s.",
    "The president-elect said the US spends billions of dollars protecting Canada, and he criticised imports of Canadian cars, lumber and dairy products.",
    "But outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there isn\u2019t \u201ca snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d of the two countries merging.",
    "The news conference was initially billed as an economic development announcement to unveil Dubai developer Damac Properties\u2019 $20bn investment to build data centres in the US.",
    "But the president-elect went on to criticise environmental regulations, the US election system, the various legal cases against him, and President Joe Biden.",
    "Among a variety of other things, he suggested renaming the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America\u201d and restated his opposition to wind power, saying wind turbines are \u201cdriving the whales crazy\u201d.",
    "His remarks came as his son, Donald Trump Jr, was visiting Greenland.",
    "Before arriving in the capital Nuuk, Trump Jr said he was going on a \u201cpersonal day trip\u201d to talk to people, and had no meetings planned with government officials.",
    "When asked about Trump Jr\u2019s visit to Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish TV that \u201cGreenland belongs to the Greenlanders\u201d and that only the local population could determine their future.",
    "She agreed that \u201cGreenland is not for sale\u201d, but stressed Denmark needed close co-operation with the US, a Nato ally.",
    "Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe and is home to a large American space facility. It also has some of the largest deposits of rare earth minerals, which are crucial in the manufacture of batteries and high-tech devices.",
    "Trump suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \u201call over the place\u201d.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m talking about protecting the free world,\u201d he told reporters.",
    "Since winning re-election Trump has repeatedly returned to the idea of US territorial expansion - including taking back the Panama Canal.",
    "During the news conference, Trump said the canal \u201cis vital to our country\u201d and claimed \u201cit\u2019s being operated by China\u201d.",
    "He previously accused Panama of overcharging US ships to use the waterway, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
    "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino has rejected Trump\u2019s claims and said there is \u201cabsolutely no Chinese interference\u201d in the canal.",
    "A Hong Kong-based company, CK Hutchison Holdings, manages two ports at the canal\u2019s entrances.",
    "The canal was built in the early 1900s and the US maintained control over the Canal Zone until 1977, when treaties negotiated under President Jimmy Carter gradually ceded the land back to Panama.",
    "\u201cGiving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake,\u201d Trump said.",
    "\u201cLook, [Carter] was a good man... But that was a big mistake.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s unclear how serious the president-elect is about adding to the territory of the\u00a0US, particularly when it comes to Canada, a country of 41 million people and the second-largest nation by area in the world.",
    "During the news conference, Trump also repeated a number of falsehoods and odd conspiracy theories, including suggesting that Hezbollah, the Islamist militant group, was involved in the US Capitol riot of 2021."
