    "The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) organises this flagship event annually and this time around with the theme \u201cEmbrace innovation and digitalisation\u201d. The event took place on 6 December at Shangri-La Colombo.",
    "This stands out as a remarkable achievement for Star amidst the various challenges faced in 2023 due to global market fluctuations.

    "Star exports apparel to globally renowned brands, promoting Sri Lanka as a go-to destination for ethical, high-quality apparel manufacturing. The company\u2019s strong export performance significantly bolsters Sri Lanka\u2019s annual apparel export earnings, which exceeded $ 4.5 billion in 2023, contributing a sizable portion of this by maintaining high export volumes and value-driven partnerships with top-tier global retailers.",
    "Today, Star has a strong workforce of over 10,000 associates and 12 production facilities in Sri Lanka with a capacity of producing approximately 1.6 million pieces per month. The group also announced its plan to build a large-scale apparel export manufacturing factory in West Africa\u2019s Togo region, through an IFC financing package. Star has achieved carbon neutrality across all its operations by implementing renewable energy projects like solar power systems and adopting waste-to-energy technologies. The Star Innovation Centre in Katunayake is the first LEED Platinum building in Sri Lanka to be certified under the latest LEED version 4 and is regarded as the first \u201cPassive House Design\u201d in Southeast Asia. These efforts align with Sri Lanka\u2019s vision of becoming a global leader in sustainable apparel.",
    "Star\u2019s cutting-edge textile technologies appeal to modern consumers demanding eco-friendly yet functional apparel, including minimising fabric wastage and shortening the development cycle by over 30 percent, driving innovation across the sector. Its collaborations in R&D to develop biodegradable garment tags and eco-friendly dyeing techniques for example has made it a pioneer in sustainable fashion, contributing to Sri Lanka\u2019s global competitiveness in R&D-driven manufacturing.",
    "Catering to world-class brands, Star, a Komar company, ensures Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel exports maintain a high-value proposition compared to other peers in the region. Star\u2019s social initiatives across the country includes efforts in mangrove restoration and supporting various impact-driven grassroots organisations. The group has also consecutively been ranked as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s best workplaces in manufacturing by Great Place to Work. Star said it will continue to consolidate and expand within Sri Lanka and internationally and be a key pillar in the country\u2019s apparel sector."
