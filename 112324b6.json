    "Governor of Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman who met with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, had requested to build a Tirupati temple in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Governor had made this request taking into consideration the large number of devotees who wish to visit the Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh (AP), India, but are unable to make the journey. The Governor noted that a considerable number of devotees who wish to make the pilgrimage are unable to do so due to their elderly age.",
    "Chief Minister Reddy responded to the request favourably, the Governor's office said. Governor Thondaman who is currently on an official visit to India also met with officials of the Andhra Pradesh Chamber of Commerce to discuss investment opportunities in Sri Lanka. The Governor also held discussions on bilateral cooperation with AP officials in areas such as agriculture and apparel sectors.",
    "During the discussions, the possibility of setting up an industrial park at the Trincomalee Port was also discussed. Special focus was also given to the possibility of setting up sugarcane and chilli cultivations, as well as establishing a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in Sri Lanka. (Kalani Kumarasinghe)"
