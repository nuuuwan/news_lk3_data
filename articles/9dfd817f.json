    "The hoi polloi have waged psychological warfare online \u2013 hat in hand, a PDA in the other \u2013 ever since the shock arrest",
    "The curious case of an ex chief executive\u2019s indictment has brought on a battery of psychiatric symptoms among denizens of the Demotic Social-media Republic of Sri Lanka. \u2018Demotic\u2019 in the sense of the common people and \u2018Social-media\u2019 is self-explanatory. The hoi polloi have waged psychological warfare online \u2013 hat in hand, a PDA in the other \u2013 ever since the shock arrest.",
    "Far more interesting to followers of social studies is the plethora of symptoms suggesting that there is something rotten in the web-side state of Denmark other than the political milieu we presently muddle through. The issue is mostly of the defence mechanism type. It was defined by the father of psychoanalysis Prof. Sigmund Freud as an unconscious psychological strategy used by the ego to manage internal conflict and reduce anxiety by distorting or denying reality. And the concept was refined by his equally influential prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Dr. Carl Jung as unconscious ways individuals avoid confronting distressing or disruptive material from their subconscious, such as instinctual urges, to protect the conscious mind.",
    "And suffice it to say that as with the heart, which has its reasons of which reason knows nothing, so with matters of the mind... If you don\u2019t mind too much that the propaganda wars on the internet in our fair to middling neck of the cosmic woods are mediocre at best and mindful of Machiavellianism at worst, it doesn\u2019t matter too much in the larger scheme of universal things.",
    "But read on ye brave for a sharp, short insight \u2013 intuition is a brief madness \u2013 into the mindsets of our armchair warriors, sofa-side social commentators and sundry citizens of a sunny isle clouded over for the nonce by a deeply divisive issue.",
    "ACTING OUT (behaving contrary to what one truly feels or thinks to hide the truth): Query: \u201cSurely you are not suggesting that doing one\u2019s job (he signed up to \u2018save\u2019 the country) entitles one to a free pass to abuse laws and regulations and raid the Treasury for personal gain?\u201d Reply: \u201cSince you are a friend of [the owner of the original post], I won\u2019t get into an argument with you.\u201d",
    "ALTRUISM (being particularly helpful to opponents to neutralise their argument):",
    "\u201cBail should have been granted at the outset. However, he has not been exonerated. Let the justice system play out without interference.\u201d",
    "\u201cCertainly, the justice system should work independently. Based on what evidence you have seen, do you say bail should have been granted at the outset?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo flight risk, that\u2019s it? Do you even know what the prosecution presented and the defence\u2019s argument for bail?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo speculation from me. On what basis did you conclude no flight risk? This is someone who travelled overseas on 22 occasions from 2022 \u2013 2024.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe always came back. RW knows that with the life he is accustomed to leading he cannot survive overseas. Give the man his due; unlike the Poxes, there is no indication that he has spirited away millions overseas. Allow him to preside over his Colombo 7 cronies, commune with his RC buddies, preside over the RoyTho tents, and let them all wallow in the sorrows until he is held to account by the courts.\u201d",
    "ANTICIPATION (foreseeing potential problems before they occur to prepare support): \u201cThis could well turn out to be a dangerous precedent that even the incumbent(s) may find hard to steer clear of... if and when similar questions are raised in the months and years ahead.\u201d",
    "AVOIDANCE COPING (avoiding stresses by avoiding stressors): \u201cLet\u2019s then go backwards to the ugliest events of the past \u2013 and forget about all else that ails this country we dearly love!\u201d",
    "COMPENSATION (over-achievement in one area to make up for failure in another): \u201cThe speed at which Ranil together with the Governor of the Central Bank was able to extricate Sri Lanka from the depths it fell [sic] economically, seems to have been forgotten at the same speed.\u201d",
    "CONVERSION (anxious un-dealt-with feelings are converted into physical ailments): \u201cI am not worried about him in prison. I am scared about the hatred. Reading comments make me feel so sick about this hatred. Where are we heading? I am so scared.\u201d",
    "DENIAL (avoiding anxiety by ignoring the reality of the situation): \u201cI don\u2019t know all the specifics of the case. It was just my opinion. But I still think that there are more pressing matters to be investigated in the country.\u201d",
    "DISPLACEMENT (redirecting impulses to a less threatening place): \u201cIt was all a scam! They have no case!\u201d",
    "DISSOCIATION (mild emotional detachment to severe mental disconnect to stay sane): In response to the comment below: \u201cI wish that can be told for the many Aragalaya activists who Ranil used and abused the Public Property Act and the PTA to put in remand for many, many months.\u201d",
    "FANTASY (retreating into the imagination to deflate tension): Statement: \u201cBail. Justice served.\u201d Response: \u201cJustice?\u201d Reply: \u201cYep.\u201d",
    "HUMOUR (decreasing anxiety by highlighting the funny or ironic): \u201cIt\u2019s the same as Barack and Michelle Obama using Air Force One to go on a date night. Or Modi using an Indian Air Force helicopter to visit his mother.\u201d",
    "IDENTIFICATION (adopting behaviours and values of persons who have power over us): \u201cWe are pretty much on the same page.\u201d This, in response to: \u201cThere are other more blatant crimes to be investigated and punished if you are looking to make a change. This seems to be making the point that no one is above the law. And this case became low-hanging fruit.\u201d",
    "INTELLECTUALISATION (using facts, logic and reason to dismiss uncomfortable feelings): \u201cWhy should we worry if any current leaders are punished for misdemeanour in future? Celebrate at last we are making politicians accountable!\u201d This, in response to: \u201cHatred seems to be the name of the game in our not so sunny isle. Meanwhile, the man who saved us from those long queues (that many of our friends seem to have forgotten) is now in ICU.\u201d",
    "INTROJECTION (internalising the beliefs and perspectives of others to feel safer): \u201cWhen a ruling party minister acknowledges that this episode was over a \u2018minor allegation\u2019 it isn\u2019t surprising that so many people feel this way.\u201d",
    "ISOLATION (compartmentalising anxious feelings from the ideas articulated): \u201cThat is what all the whining we have heard the last few days is all about... not really the love for Ranil, but self-preservation of the rest, who are fearing that the noose of the law [may be] tightening around they [sic] necks.\u201d",
    "PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR (indirect expression of anger through socially acceptable modes of action or communication): \u201cSome Aragalaya activists were hauled up during Ranil\u2019s tenure under the Public Property Ordinance for damaging the tar on the road in front of the Prime Minister\u2019s office.\u201d",
    "PROJECTION (attributing unacceptable feelings and thoughts to another person): \u201cSo your take is that what\u2019s good for the goose is not good for the gander... when the goose is RW.\u201d This, in response to: \u201cIf finally Ranil can be touched, no one else in the political sphere is safe.\u201d",
    "RATIONALISATION (cognitive distortion of the facts to make events less threatening): \u201cMisappropriation of public funds can happen on an official or private tour... i.e. lavish over-expenditure well above expected thresholds, without due diligence to taxpayers\u2019 money \u2013 for food, accommodation, entertainment, etc., for self and entourage. Without all the facts, it\u2019s just random speculation and irrelevant comparison.\u201d",
    "REGRESSION (reverting to an earlier stage of social, emotional or behavioural development): Statement: \u201cI meant the can of worms this episode has opened.\u201d Response: \u201cYes I know but that can has been opened and shut many times... for years if not decades, noh?\u201d",
    "REPRESSION (keeping threatening feelings from becoming conscious thoughts): \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for years so it is best we all move on \u2013 the cost of the most recent disruption may well exceed the claims that are being made if one were to factor in time costs, legal costs, and most of all the reputational cost at a time we need offshore investors. Just my take \u2013 I may well be wrong.\u201d",
    "SPLITTING (seeing everything in black and white and being unable to integrate polarities): A response to a thread in which this defence mechanism was evident: \u201cThis charge of misuse of state funds in my opinion falls very clearly into a grey area in terms of demands of the job vs. needs of the person.\u201d Another: \u201cI saw a comment earlier today suggesting that public officials switch between their official vehicles and Uber depending on whether their next move is \u2018public\u2019 or \u2018private\u2019! A can of worms this is.\u201d",
    "SUBLIMATION: (channelling negative impulses into productive behaviour): \u201cAll such matters are important, and investigations and proceedings have to start somewhere. Particularly start with the cases the Attorney General\u2019s office (if that\u2019s the right area) is confident that there is enough evidence to an allegation to charge someone.\u201d",
    "SUPPRESSION (choosing to ignore unpleasant sensations for the sake of peace of mind or sanity): \u201cThey [WRT to that above \u2013 investigations and proceedings] should not be subject to public\u2019s feelings about grey areas, or how important an office the alleged offender/s held in the past.\u201d",
    "REACTION FORMATION (reacting opposite to the way one is truly feeling): \u201cRW is bailed. However our society has refused the bail and embraced the self-imprisonment. Sad situ.\u201d",
    "Dear reader, all of this above is not merely a tongue-in-cheek idyll to while away the time that would have passed anyway. But rather, an amateur shrink\u2019s attempt to offer himself and his interlocutors no smidgen or iota of therapy in times when the healing touch is needed most...",
    "Hopefully, the pathos \u2013 as such if any you may find in it as found on these social media threads \u2013 will defray the greater cost if you were to undertake \u2018the talking cure\u2019... whether on Facebook or face-to-face with an FRCPsych.",
    "Let the sun shine again on our corner of a sultry southern summer. Not least because the solar orb is directly overhead until the 7th of September; but in order that a gentle knowing smile replace all those frowns, tears, lowered eyebrows and furrowed foreheads on social media these days...",
