    "His legacy, lasting impact, and the void have no substitutes. His loss is not mourned only by his family, relatives, or friends. The entire country does it. The entire population was his family. There are 1.5 million public servants in the country. Bradman was always the pinnacle and was among the few most respected public servants. His demise marks the end of an era. It marks a profound loss and an absence that leaves a lasting impact and cannot be easily replaced",
    "In Sri Lanka, demise of a person has lost news value, as every hour a Sri Lankan is facing death caused by this or another reason. But, the departure of Bradman Weerakoon marks a loss of many lives, many characters, and many facets. Bradman leaves a vacuum that cannot be filled.",
    "His legacy, lasting impact, and the void have no substitutes. His loss is not mourned only by his family, relatives, or friends. The entire country does it. The entire population was his family. There are 1.5 million public servants in the country. Bradman was always the pinnacle and was among the few most respected public servants. His demise marks the end of an era. It marks a profound loss and an absence that leaves a lasting impact and cannot be easily replaced.",
    "His absence is felt more than his presence, and for years to come. He was a man for all seasons and lived in many hearts. The cast, creed, race, status, and place were never in the vocabulary of Bradman Weerakoon. Whatever he was, wherever he was, he was ready to serve. It may be the head of the state, or it may be the poorest of the poor, Bradman Weerakoon was always available and accessible. He was ready to hear, ready to see, and ready to redress them. Bradman leaves behind a legacy of integrity, intellect, and unwavering dedication to public service.",
    "He served nine heads of state (Prime Ministers and Presidents). They were miles apart from each other. Their characters, intentions, ideologies, and political affiliations were far apart. But Bradman Weerakoon was the man wanted by all of them. None of them ever fell out with him. If a Head of the state, a Minister, or a fellow public servant faced a difficult situation, the last resort was Bradman Weerakoon. He was always ready with the solution and his never-fading friendly smile. In fact, the smiley face was his trademark.",
    "I was at the funeral parlour on Wednesday to join other mourners. I met a retired senior official. He told me that he was appointed to succeed Bradman as the Secretary to the Prime Minister. He was in primary school at the time Bradman joined the civil service in 1954. When he heard who his predecessor was his heart stopped. His breath was held up. He read the letter of appointment and said to himself, \u2018My God.\u2019 He was on cold feet. Then his desk telephone rang. He lifted the receiver with shivering hands. A voice came through the line: \u2018Hello, this is Bradman. He almost fainted. He was expecting thunder. But the voice was so calm and soft. It said Hello \u2026 (addressed by his first name)! Congratulations. When will you take over from me? I have prepared a six-page note comprehensively explaining what we have done and not done, and what\u2019s pending. My secretary has prepared a schedule of documents. I presume that\u2019s fine with you.",
    "The junior newcomer expected a thunder but flew a river of soothing words through the line. He could not believe his ears. The next morning, he went to assume duties. Who was at the entrance, Bradman himself. The newcomer almost lost balance. But warm hands held his hands and chaperoned him to the new office. Bradman has immediately called a meeting of the entire staff and introduced his successor. Wished him and collected his little bag, and left the office in his own car.",
    "This episode speaks volumes of a character of the great man, Bradman.",
    "Bradman was born during the colonial period. He was educated in schools established by colonials. His higher education was at the University of Ceylon, a colonial creature. He joined the civil service introduced by colonial rule. But, Bradman was the same Kalutara boy born on 20 October 1930 till his demise on 7 July 2025. His personality was such that he could stand erect in any storm. 20 October 1930 brought two Bradmans to Sri Lanka. One was brought by Edmund R. Weerakoon and his wife. That was Bradman Weerakoon. The other was brought on board a ship sailing from Australia. That was Don Bradman, the legendary Australian cricketer. Weerakoon\u2019s parents named their son after the legendary cricketer. They would have wished but never would have dreamt that their Bradman is going to be a legend of legends.",
    "We were fortunate to get groomed and blessed by a legend. Whether we did a thing right or wrong, he had some advice for us to get better. He encouraged us to forget our hardships and think of the hardships of other. We go to see him with a bagful of problems and return with an empty bag. He had a solution to any kind of problem for anybody.",
    "Today, we live in a society where ethics, manners, and honesty are disappearing. These were the very same virtues Bradman Weerakoon always had and promoted. God knew that the society was turning from bad to worse, making things difficult for Bradman. He was becoming a misfit by the day in such a deteriorated society. God had no other option but to call him to live with him. On 7 July the God murmured in his ears: Bradman, you are the last survivor of 330 million Gods (what we heard in bedtime fables related by our mothers) sheltered in this island. Come with me. So, this is God\u2019s wish. We lost a God\u2019s son with divine attributes inherited throughout a life of 95 years,",
    "We were blessed by your presence, spirit, advice, and exemplary life. We are lost today. We bless you with a happy stay with God!"
