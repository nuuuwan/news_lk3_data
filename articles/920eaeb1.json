After constructive discussions in Colombo, Mr. Breuer and Deputy Mission Chief Ms. Katsiaryna Svirydzenka issued the following statement:",

    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s ambitious reform agenda supported by the EFF is delivering commendable outcomes. The economy expanded on average by 4 percent y-o-y in the four quarters ending in June 2024. High-frequency indicators point to continued expansion across all sectors. Average headline and core inflation remained contained at 0.8 and 3.8 percent during the third quarter.

Public finances have strengthened following substantial fiscal reforms.",
    "\u201cProgram performance was strong, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets (IT) for end-June 2024 met, as well as the ITs for end-September 2024, except for the IT on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due before October-2024 were either met or implemented with delay; some benchmarks are delayed because of the election cycle.",
    "\u201cThe new government\u2019s commitment to the program objectives has enhanced confidence and ensures policy continuity. Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguarding the hard-won gains of the program and putting the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth. Since the crisis has affected Sri Lanka\u2019s entire population, it will be important to ensure that the benefits from economic growth are shared appropriately.",
    "\u201cMaintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring debt sustainability are key to securing Sri Lanka\u2019s prosperity and require persevering with responsible fiscal policy. Continued revenue mobilization efforts and spending restraint are needed to prepare the 2025 budget in line with program parameters. Revenue administration reforms and efforts to improve tax compliance will help to ensure that the burden stemming from the crisis is shared proportionately to taxpayers\u2019 ability to contribute. Avoiding new tax exemptions will help reduce fiscal revenue leakages, corruption risks and build much needed fiscal buffers, including for social spending and to support Sri Lanka\u2019s most vulnerable. Maintaining cost recovery in fuel and electricity pricing and resolving legacy debts will help minimize fiscal risks arising from state-owned enterprises.",
    "\u201cThe government has an important responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable at this difficult time. It is important to redouble efforts to meet the program\u2019s minimum spending target on social spending and to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets, particularly Aswesuma.",
    "\u201cWhile inflation has decelerated faster than expected, continued monitoring is warranted to ensure sustained price stability and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing global uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through strong reserves accumulation.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s recent Agreement in Principle with bondholders is an important milestone putting Sri Lanka\u2019s debt on a path towards sustainability. The critical next steps are to complete the commercial debt restructuring, finalize bilateral agreements with official creditors along the lines of the accord with the Official Creditor Committee and implement the terms of the other agreements. This will help restore Sri Lanka\u2019s debt sustainability.",
    "\u201cThe new government\u2019s mandate will reinvigorate governance reforms addressing corruption risks, rebuilding economic confidence, and making growth more robust and inclusive.",
    "\u201cThe IMF team held meetings with His Excellency President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Honorable Labor Minister and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Honorable Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Senior Economic Advisor Duminda Hulangamuwa, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P.
