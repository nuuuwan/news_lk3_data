  "original_body_lines": [
    "Post watershed election that has the potential to transform Sri Lanka socio-economically, MTI Consulting has recommended a radically different approach to restructuring the Cabinet of Ministers.",
    "How nations, both developed and developing, structure their cabinets is often based on legacy practices with incremental, ad-hoc changes. There is very little ground thinking, first principles, and future-proofing (which are considered effective in organisational structuring) that goes into such a process.",
    "In this backdrop, Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions, even considering rationalisation and consolidation where needed.",
    "Governmental organisational structures tend to suffer from the \u2018legacy\u2019 effect of structures that were put in place decades ago, at a time when the Government had a different operating model and a different set of challenges. Since then, these structures have been subjected to a series of incremental and tactical changes. It is much like each tenant in a rented house being allowed to make structural changes to the building to suit their tenancy period! The net result is a less-than-optimal structure that is unable to respond to contemporary global and local challenges.",
    "It is not just the structure; the same \u2018legacy\u2019 factor impacts the processes, performance management, and importantly, the culture of the organisation \u2013 the combination of which has a crippling effect on the organisation, in this case, the Cabinet. The bigger concern is that the entire government apparatus (which is the biggest employer in the country) is structured and shaped in the way the Cabinet is structured.",
    "Based on proven international and local experience and best practices, MTI Consulting has recommended a 10-step process that the Sri Lankan Government can follow. It requires bringing all stakeholders together and spending quality thinking time for strategising and structuring.",
    "Step 1: Go completely \u2018Ground Zero\u2019 \u2013 which means assume none of the current ministerial portfolios exist and avoid any reference to any current ministerial names, even later on in the process.",
    "Step 2: Identify the basis Portfolio Need Identification \u2013 which in the case of the Cabinet will cover 5 criteria (as diagrammatically illustrated below) i.e. People\u2019s Need, Enablers, Economy and Governance, Strategic and Financial and Contemporary Challenges.",
    "Step 3: Apply \u2018People\u2019s need\u2019 as the first basis of structuring \u2013 Governments exist only to serve/meet the needs of people. Therefore, in structuring the government, it should be based on the specific needs of the people. Starting with basic human needs, hierarchically exploring all types of physical, physiological, social, safety and economic needs.",
    "If the above is applied to the Government of Sri Lanka, the first-cut based on People\u2019s need will be as follows:",
    "Step 4: Identifying the \u2018Economy and Governance\u2019 based ministerial needs",
    "Beyond the people\u2019s needs, at a macro level the Government needs to manage the economy and ensure effective governance (including the effective management of all other ministries) \u2013 this then leads to the need for other ministries. In order to ensure and manage all portfolios identified (applying multiple criteria), what types of economic management and governance functions need to be undertaken? Accordingly the following has been identified as the \u2018first-cut\u2019 list.",
    "In identifying the ministries based on the \u2018People\u2019s Needs\u2019 and \u2018Economy and Governance\u2019, there is tendency for wide variation in the scope and scale of the ministries identified and therefore some key functions may not get adequate focus. Estimating the strategic and financial value of the portfolios (identified under each of the other modules) and then deciding which ones require further segmentation.",
    "Step 6: Contemporary national challenges \u2013 that demand ministerial focus",
    "The world we live in today confronts us with dynamic socio-economic and political challenges, which governments need to respond to and in some cases there needs to be institutions to manage/respond to these challenges. Evaluate all the current / emerging socio-economic and political challenges that the country encounters and decide if any of these warrant a dedicated portfolio. Accordingly, for Sri Lanka the following have been identified.",
    "Step 7: Ministries that are needed for the \u2018Enabling\u2019 role ( See Graph 5 )",
    "When identifying the ministries based on the criteria under Steps 2 to 5, the focus is on the front-end needs, consequently the enabling ministries (also known as back office or shared services functions) do not get captured. For each of the ministries identified thus far, examine the need for the enabler role, based on which the following has been identified.",
    "Step 8: Rationalise the 36 ministerial needs that were identified by applying the 5 structuring criteria",
    "Applying the 5 different criteria, we have arrived at 36 portfolios of varying scopes. While this is exhaustive, there is the possibility of over-laps and more importantly the need to rationalise and merge some of the portfolios \u2013 in the pursuit of ensuring a max of 15 Cluster Ministries (considered an optimal number).",
    "Step 9: Arriving at the final list of 16 \u2018Cluster Ministries\u2019 \u2013 by applying the following structuring principles: ( See Graph 6 )",
    "Strategic synergies \u2013 where more than one portfolio can be merged for strategic and link reasons",
    "Specialisation and Separation \u2013 where portfolios need to be kept very distinct \u2013 despite not justifying sufficient \u2018workload\u2019 and responsibility to match the other portfolios",
    "Use of contemporary terms that reflect the above and the \u2018end-user\u2019 expectations",
    "\u201cThis is only one example of the Ground-Zero model application \u2013 the end result depends on the quality of thinking and intellect that goes into the process. There could be several outcome possibilities and that\u2019s not an issue, as long as there is process integrity and rigour.\u201d",
    "Public Welfare is a cluster of public services, social welfare, national integration, religious practices and disaster management",
    "Enterprise Development has been added to Industrial Development \u2013 so that the former focuses on the SMEs, while the latter focuses on large scale industrial infrastructure development, including the vital logistics component",
    "International Relations (currently known as the foreign ministry) will also have responsibility for \u2018International Investments\u2019 (FDIs) \u2013 because when they have such an extensive network of foreign missions, why only use this for diplomatic and consular work? Hold them responsible for investment targets.",
    "Financial Services will be part of Economy, Planning and Governance",
    "State Enterprise Development can either fall under the relevant line ministry or under \u2018Economy, Planning and Governance\u2019 (which in any case will be responsible for the Governance of these SOEs)",
    "Tea and Rubber Plantation, by virtue of being largely for exports, will fall under Export Earnings, while the other could be under \u2018Food and Agriculture\u2019",
    "National Fitness aims to develop a fit and healthy nation \u2013 given its positive impact on national productivity",
    "Step 10: Each of the \u2018Cluster Ministries\u2019 are then further segmented into \u2018Sector Ministries\u2019 \u2013 using the same structuring principles as above. ( See Graph 7)",
    "Step 11: Set KRAs and KPIs \u2013 each Minister\u2019s performance appraisal to be presented to both the Parliament and the public. Then, apply the process down to the next level of Government departments and SOEs.",
    "The purpose of Deputy Ministers should be challenged \u2013 in favour specific Subject Ministers for well-defined portfolios with clear end deliverables.",
