    "SL FinTech Summit\u2019s mission to enable transformative change with coordinated ecosystem development",
    "In the bustling streets of Colombo, a small garment manufacturer still conducts most transactions in cash, despite owning a smartphone more powerful than the computers that once ran entire banks. Across the city, a FinTech start-up has developed innovative credit scoring algorithms but struggles to access the customer data that could make their solution transformative. Meanwhile, a major bank has invested millions in establishing secure digital infrastructure that while effective, still remains siloed mainly from the broader financial ecosystem.",
    "This is the paradox facing Sri Lanka\u2019s FinTech landscape: abundant individual capabilities existing within a fragmented system that prevents collective progress. The nation possesses all the foundational elements for digital financial transformation\u2014robust banking networks, accelerating smartphone adoption, a digitally literate youth population, and policy frameworks signalling digital ambition. Yet the ecosystem remains stubbornly disconnected, with each player operating in isolation rather than as part of a coordinated value creation network.",
    "Today, the average Sri Lankan completes fewer than 20 digital transactions annually, while citizens in India have surpassed 60 transactions per capita. Even smaller Southeast Asian economies are advancing rapidly on digital identity, open banking, and real-time settlements. What distinguishes these success stories isn\u2019t superior technology or larger investments\u2014it\u2019s the presence of functioning ecosystems where regulators, banks, start-ups, capital providers, and academia operate in concert rather than silos.",
    "The Sri Lanka FinTech Summit 2025, convening September 24\u201325 at BMICH Colombo, emerges from this recognition as something fundamentally different from traditional industry gatherings. Under the strategic leadership of HNB PLC Managing Director/CEO Damith Pallewatte and co-chaired by TECXA MD/CEO Dr. Kumudu Megasooriya, and FinTech Forum Sri Lanka Chairman Channa de Silva, the summit represents a paradigm shift from showcase to coordination mechanism\u2014a deliberate effort to build year-round momentum around a unified, accountable, and investable FinTech ecosystem.",
    "\u201cWe possess the data, platforms, and talent necessary for transformation,\u201d explains Damith Pallewatte. \u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is strategic alignment. This summit represents our collective opportunity to move beyond aspiration toward coordinated execution\u2014with clear ownership structures, measurable outcomes, and sustained continuity.\u201d",
    "This vision reflects a mature understanding of how digital financial ecosystems develop. For decades, Sri Lankan banks viewed FinTechs as existential threats\u2014lean, fast-moving entities poised to disrupt traditional finance. That adversarial relationship has evolved into something more sophisticated and ultimately more productive. Regulatory constraints, capital requirements, and public trust considerations have revealed the limits of what FinTechs can achieve independently. Simultaneously, banks have recognised that agility, innovation velocity, and customer-centric service delivery represent strengths the sector cannot afford to ignore.",
    "The synthesis creates unprecedented value. Traditional financial institutions contribute regulatory expertise, capital adequacy, compliance infrastructure, and established customer relationships. FinTech innovators bring technological sophistication, service delivery reimagination, and a willingness to challenge conventional approaches. Together, they can create systems that are simultaneously safe and transformative\u2014but only when collaboration has structure, accountability, and shared strategic direction.",
    "The summit\u2019s operational framework reflects this system\u2019s thinking approach. Rather than conventional panel discussions followed by networking sessions, each plenary feed directly into specialised workstreams addressing specific ecosystem barriers: SME access to finance, blockchain regulatory pilots, KYC interoperability, cross-border payments, and digital credit scoring integration.",
    "This structure ensures that conversations translate into actionable outcomes. Every strategic recommendation emerges with defined ownership, implementation timelines, and accountability mechanisms. Progress tracking occurs through public dashboards, creating transparency and maintaining momentum into next year\u2019s summit.",
    "\u201cWe have collectively built world-class core financial services infrastructure in the country for fast, secure and reliable digital payments in partnership with members of the Fintech Forum, Sri Lanka such as banks, NBFIs and fintech companies. The growth of digital payments has seen a significant increase over the years. But true transformation requires shared ownership and follow-through. This summit moves us from discussion to delivery, creating the structures needed to convert ambition into measurable outcomes that bring progress,\u201d Channa de Silva explained.",
    "Accordingly, the summit\u2019s strategic agenda will centre on five interlocking pillars designed to break down the barriers that have long held Sri Lanka\u2019s FinTech ecosystem in silos.",
    "1.The primary focus will be on accelerating SME financial inclusion through lending models that dispense with traditional collateral requirements, thereby opening new channels of growth capital for previously underserved businesses.",
    "2.Concurrently, regulators and industry leaders will discuss pilot blockchain programs and efforts to establish regulatory sandboxes\u2014carefully calibrated environments that encourage technological experimentation while safeguarding systemic stability.",
    "3.A third priority is the creation of a truly interoperable infrastructure, standardising KYC procedures and instituting real-time data-exchange protocols so that customer onboarding becomes seamless across banks, FinTechs and service providers.",
    "4.Fourth, the summit seeks to modernise Sri Lanka\u2019s cross-border payments by deploying efficient, cost-effective transaction systems that elevate Sri Lanka from peripheral player to regional financial hub.",
    "5.Finally, by integrating alternative data sources with AI-driven scoring mechanisms, organisers aim to expand credit access without diluting risk-management standards, ensuring that intelligence-driven credit becomes a reliable pillar of the national economy.",
    "\u201cOur goal is to inspire change, and implement tangible operational transformation. This summit initiates systematic problem-solving across institutional boundaries, creating sustained collaborative momentum that extends far beyond September,\u201d Pallewatte said.",
    "The most significant opportunity lies in human capital development. Currently, fewer than 10% of technology and finance graduates enter the FinTech or start-up sector\u2014a fundamental misalignment between educational outcomes and economic transformation needs. The summit will table a comprehensive academic-industry collaboration framework designed to bridge this gap through:",
    "Structured internship exchanges: Creating direct pathways between universities and FinTech organisations",
    "Industry-relevant certification programs: Bridging skill gaps through targeted professional development",
    "Regulatory laboratory placements: Providing practical experience in policy development and compliance frameworks",
    "This approach recognises that sustainable ecosystem development requires not just technological infrastructure, but human infrastructure\u2014professionals who understand both traditional financial principles and emerging digital possibilities.",
    "The summit\u2019s international dimension ensures Sri Lanka\u2019s development incorporates proven strategies from leading digital finance hubs. Over 150 speakers include Monetary Authority of Singapore Chief FinTech Officer Sopnendu Mohanty, alongside leaders from Africa\u2019s mobile money revolution, Southeast Asia\u2019s super-app ecosystems, and the Gulf\u2019s digital banking transformation.",
    "This global knowledge transfer prevents reinventing solved problems while ensuring local solutions address specific market characteristics and regulatory requirements. The goal isn\u2019t to copy international models, but to adapt successful principles to Sri Lankan realities.",
    "The summit\u2019s success metrics align with Sri Lanka\u2019s Digital Economy Strategy 2030, which envisions a $ 15 billion digital economy contributing 12% of GDP. Specific transformation indicators include:",
    "Financial inclusion expansion: Achieving 95% financial inclusion by 2030 through coordinated digital access initiatives",
    "Investment capital mobilisation: Attracting $ 100 million in near-term FinTech investment through improved ecosystem visibility and coordination",
    "SME digital adoption: More than doubling FinTech utilisation among small and medium enterprises",
    "Human capital development: Expanding FinTech sector employment among graduates from the current 10% to 25% through industry-academia collaboration",
    "These targets reflect an understanding that transformation occurs through accumulated systemic improvements rather than isolated breakthrough moments.",
    "The summit\u2019s ambition reaches far beyond reforming financial services; it aspires to catalyse a sweeping digital acceleration across Sri Lanka\u2019s entire economy. By achieving seamless interoperability between payment systems, enabling secure data exchange across institutions, streamlining SMEs\u2019 access to growth capital and extending universal financial inclusion, Sri Lanka can move from behind the pack to emerge as a regional lead in this ambitious global movement.",
    "Such transformation creates cascading benefits. Efficient digital payments reduce transaction costs for businesses. Improved access to credit enables entrepreneurship and expansion. Standardised KYC processes minimise compliance burdens. Cross-border payment efficiency attracts international business. Enhanced financial inclusion brings previously excluded populations into the formal economy.",
    "The garment manufacturer that still operates primarily in cash gains access to digital supply chain financing. The FinTech start-up\u2019s innovative algorithms find application across multiple financial institutions. The bank\u2019s digital infrastructure becomes part of an interconnected ecosystem that serves customers more effectively than any single institution could achieve alone.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s digital financial renaissance begins with recognition that transformation is not a destination but a process\u2014one that requires every stakeholder to see their success as inseparable from the ecosystem\u2019s collective advancement. The summit provides the framework. The real work begins the day after it ends,\u201d Dr.Kumudu Megasooriya said.",
    "The message is clear: the summit may set the stage, but progress depends on what we do next\u2014on decisions made in boardrooms, code written in start-ups, and partnerships forged across sectors."
