    "Gemunu commenced his hotel career in 1975 peeling onions, as a Kitchen Trainee at Hotel Neptune. He then continued with the same company for 43 years, slowly and steadily climbing steps, as Assistant Chef in 1978, Executive Chef in 1983, Corporate head of Food & Beverage in 1991, Director in 1998 and Vice President in 2010. In between, he gained experience as a Chef in Australia, and trained in USA. After his retirement from the company in 2018, he was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Aitken Spence Hotel Holding PLC. Today, he is the Chairman of Win-Stone Group, Deputy Chairman of Marino Leisure Holdings, and until recently he served as the Chairman of the Tourist Hotels Classification Committee.",
    "Just before Christmas in 1974, when Aitken Spence opened Hotel Neptune, it became the main \u201cfriendly\u201d competitor for Bentota Beach Hotel, which was the best resort hotel in Sri Lanka at that time. Hotel Neptune recruited U. C. Jayasinghe (UC) the Assistant Chef of Bentota Beach, as their first Executive Chef. That change, for my luck, created an opening for me to join Bentota Beach hotel as the Trainee Executive Chef. One of my batchmates from Ceylon Hotel School (CHS), Patrick Taylor joined Neptune as the Assistant Chef. We were all good friends and frequently met after dinner service for a chat, a drink and fun.",
    "One day in 1975, UC introduced Gemunu Goonewardena to me when I visited the Neptune kitchen. \u201cChandana, meet Gemunu, our new Kitchen Trainee. I am teaching him the ropes the hard way\u201d, UC told me with a cheeky grin. Having worked under UC at Bentota Beach Hotel during my CHS internship in 1973, I knew that he was a tough boss. I felt sorry for Gemunu when UC pushed him aggressively, to learn the trade. Gemunu is one year younger to me, and I identified him as a late developer, just like me. We became friends.",
    "Although Gemunu was occasionally upset with UC, he was determined to master culinary arts. Forty-eight years later I am convinced, that tough training he received in the mid 1970s, built Gemunu\u2019s character and laid a strong foundation for one of the greatest careers in the hotel industry of Sri Lanka, that commence peeling onions and ended with creating innovative visions at boardrooms for decades. I am immensely proud of Gemunu and very happy to call him my friend.",
    "Gemunu joined me as a panellist at a National Institute of Plantation Management (NIPM seminar I conducted for 25 senior plantation managers in 2023",
    "In 1981, when I left a senior management position at John Keells corporate office to join CHS as a Senior Lecturer, Gemunu had spent five years studying there while working at Hotel Neptune. Soon after that Gemunu graduated from CHS. In 1991, when I ran a series of management seminars as the Managing Director of the International Hotel School of Mount Lavinia Hotel. Gemunu was a regular at seminars. I then realized that he is a lifelong learner, and hungry for all types of knowledge. Our close friendship continued until I left Sri Lanka in 1994 to pursue my global career.",
    "After that from a distance, I occasionally heard the progress Gemunu was making in Sri Lanka. Gemunu is renowned for his innovative approach to gastronomy. He spearheaded the \u2018Heritance Cuisine\u2019 that combines local ingredients, traditional techniques, and international influences. His latest endeavor, \u2018Ceylon Food Trails\u2019, offers an immersive experience into Sri Lankan culture and authentic indigenous food in remote villages.",
    "Gemunu in the center with his leadership team at Win-Stone Culinary School",
    "In 2021, when I commenced my autobiographical Sunday Island newspaper column: \u2018Confessions of a Global Gypsy\u2019, Gemunu commenced calling me in Canada every Sunday after he read the latest episode of the series. Our Sunday discussions became longer every week, with the series motivating Gemunu to ask me various questions. Gemunu loved engaging in meaningful conversations. \u201cGemunu, please don\u2019t call me before 11:00 am, because I watch my favourite weekly TV program \u2013 The Global Public Square (GPS) with Fareed Zakaria, at that time.\u201d I gently pushed Gemunu\u2019s weekly calls on Sundays to after 9:30 pm Sri Lanka time.",
    "When Gemunu invited me to do some assignments for the International Tourism Volunteers Association (ITVA), I asked him, \u201cWhat is ITVA?\u201d he explained, \u201cthat it is a loosely formed association \u2013 more like a consortium of hospitality and tourism professionals to connect and pursue common activities or causes in a more relaxed environment.\u201d Gemunu is a good salesman, and I was convinced to give my time free, to speak, lead and moderate a few webinars. Global Hospitality Forum, which I lead, collaborated with ITVA, in those initiatives.",
    "When I casually informed Gemunu that I will spend seven weeks in Sri Lanka from mid-March 2023, Gemunu formally took charge of my itinerary. My intention of spending a relaxed holiday with the family had to be changed. Gemunu filled my schedule with various re-connection meetings with veteran hoteliers, excursions around the island with Gemunu, and a few innovative leadership seminars for various hotel management teams.",
    "A highlight of my seven-week visit to Sri Lanka in 2023, was gaining first-hand \u2018Ceylon Food Trails\u2019 experiences in Ahangama and Ingiriya. It was refreshing getting to know of Gemunu\u2019s passion on sustainable development of community tourism to showcase authentic cuisine of Sri Lanka.",
    "Gemunu\u2019s team simply facilitate and promote the concept, but it is the leaders from the village communities who run each operation and village service providers who benefit from each operation. Gemunu is keen that 70% of the income from Ceylon Food Trails operations remain within the villages. \u201cWe currently have 12 operations in different parts of the country. Our aim is to eventually help 100 villages\u201d, Gemunu shared his optimism with me. \u201cLet\u2019s do a colourful book with all these authentic village recipes, when you reach 52 \u2013 one per week\u201d, I planted a seed in his mind.",
    "As exploring human behaviour is a new hobby of Gemunu, I was invited to do a seminar on my concept of \u2018Personality Analysis\u2019 to his top leadership team of Win-Stone Group. Gemunu and his wife \u2013 Iyanthi who manages the Win-Stone Culinary School, honoured me by attending the whole seminar. After the seminar, I asked Gemunu 10 questions for this article.",

    "A: I deeply appreciate and admire the rich tapestry of historical and contemporary architectural wonders found across various nations. Among them, one gem that truly captivates my heart is the ancient city of Anuradhapura, dating back to the 5th century BC.

It is through these interactions that I continually learn and gain valuable insights from others, broadening my perspective and enriching my personal growth.",
    "Q: From your time studying and training in Sri Lanka, Australia and USA, which experience stands out as the most memorable?",
    "A: The most memorable experience occurred at Neptune Hotel in Sri Lanka. It involved an incident where a staff member of our hotel had an altercation with the senior village headman, resulting in the entire village surrounding us in search of the attacker. However, the elders of the village intervened and pleaded for our safety, highlighting the values of unity, community, and solidarity. The tactical and diplomatic way Mr. Mahinda Ratnayake handled this incident taught us the importance of working together with the local community, fostering mutual benefit rather than division. Through effective communication, we resolved the situation without further escalation. From a professional culinary standpoint, I gained memorable experience as a mature student at the Culinary Institute of America, New York.",
    "Q: During your early career, what was the most rewarding experience you had as a Chef?",

I was entrusted with the task of organizing a grand gala dinner for a staggering 500 guests, which occurred every fortnight over a period of six months. At that time, the hotel was equipped to accommodate and cater to only 100 guests, making this challenge quite formidable. However, under the guidance and support of Mr. Chandrajith, I eagerly embraced the opportunity. The entire experience was a mix of vivid memories\u2014rewarding, chaotic, and incredibly educational.",

    "Regarding the \u2018Heritance\u2019 brand, I played a pivotal role in establishing the Minimum Quality Standards (MQS) Manual. I approached the branding of Heritance in a distinctive and novel manner, differentiating it from other prominent brands in Sri Lanka and the region. The name \u201cHeritance\u201d itself, derived from the fusion of \u201cHeritage\u201d and \u201cInheritance,\u201d was chosen to embody the unique historical and cultural essence of each property and its surrounding environment.

Our team introduced localized standards that encompassed all four aspects of conservation, community, culture, and commerce, with the aim of positively impacting the well-being of the planet and its people. One of the key criteria we implemented was encouraging hotel properties to actively address biodiversity conservation through sustainable solutions. This involved carefully selecting products in the food and beverage sector and working closely with communities and producers who embraced biodiversity conservation in their production cycles. Through these initiatives, our objective was to foster a sustainable and responsible approach to tourism, where the natural environment, wildlife, local communities, and cultural heritage were respected, conserved, and celebrated.",
    "Gemunu during his time at the Culinary Institute of America in 1986",

To achieve this, I provide clear principles, values, and policies, and then empower them to take ownership of the project/work given to them. At the same time, if any mistakes or problem occur, I step forth and take the blame. My management approach revolves around inspiring my colleagues and associates to willingly engage in tasks by aligning their desires with the objectives I set forth. By creating a sense of intrinsic motivation, I encourage them to enthusiastically embrace their duties where they perform their best. Hence, my secret lies in a leadership approach centred on delegation and giving responsibility.",
