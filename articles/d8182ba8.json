  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) trade unions are set to begin the third stage of their industrial action against the proposed restructuring of the utility from midnight tomorrow, to run until 24 September.",
    "Union leaders described the forthcoming phase as critical, saying its outcome will shape the direction of future protests and have implications for the energy sector.",
    "The decision was announced by CEB Technicians\u2019 Association Chairman Kosala Abeysinghe.",
    "He said the move comes in response to what unions describe as the Government\u2019s refusal to address their concerns.",
    "\u201cWe have warned this Government to listen. This is a response to the arrogance of the Minister and the Director General in particular. But if the President continues to respond in the same way, we will be compelled to escalate matters further,\u201d Abeysinghe said.",
    "The union campaign started on 4 September with a work-to-rule action, followed by a sick-leave protest on 17 and 18 September.",
    "Earlier this week, Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody said that the Government\u2019s restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will not undermine employee job security or labour rights, despite trade union concerns and ongoing protest threats.",
    "Addressing the media, the Minister explaining the reforms noted that the CEB currently consists of four key institutions, Generation, Transmission, Distribution, and Systems Administration, staffed by around 23,000 employees and fully State-owned under the licencing and regulatory oversight of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).",
    "In addition, the CEB operates a retirement fund, the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and a separate funding company, where staff from the four core institutions are now being considered for redeployment.",
    "The Minister noted that all employees have been officially notified and invited to express their views within two months, stressing that the process is a legal requirement and not a move by the Ministry or the Government to pressure workers.",
    "Jayakody pointed out that as per the existing and approved Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) includes compensation capped at Rs. 5 million for senior employees and Rs. 2.5 million for others. However, he said the Government has opted to offer a more favourable package in line with employee preferences. \u201cAfter considering the new reforms, the Government has decided to extend the compensation with Rs. 5 million for all employees keen on the VRS, as all employees are equally important to us,\u201d he said.",
    "Although a past Cabinet decision to cut 12,000 jobs at the CEB remains on record, Jayakody clarified that this has not been included in the present reform package. Instead, the restructuring is aimed at reducing inefficiencies, cutting dependence on expensive liquid-fuel power generation, and positioning the CEB to attract international financing, particularly from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)."
