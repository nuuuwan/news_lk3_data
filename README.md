### Sri Lanka reports US$706mn current account surplus amid financial outflows

*2024-07-02 08:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-reports-us706mn-current-account-surplus-amid-financial-outflows-170433/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has recorded a 706 million US dollar current account surplus in the first quarter of 2024 as the financial account recorded a deficit amid private and official debt repayments and reserve collections, data show.

Sri Lanka has recorded current account surpluses, since the last quarter of 2022 when monetary stability is reached.

The current account is a mirror image of the financial and capital accounts, subject to errors and omissions.

The way external accounting is calculated, only the balance of payments surplus and deficit (as defined) can be accurately measured.

Whether there is a balance of payments deficit or surplus depends on the note-issue activities of the central bank.

When money is printed through reverse repo or standing facilities, regardless of a budget deficit or surplus, there are foreign exchange shortages, making it difficult to make foreign payments, especially in the capital account, leading to a run down of reserve and eventual default.

The news that the Tamil people of the Eelam Tamil people have been relentlessly for the rights of the Tamil people, who has been in the mood for the rights of the Tamil people to live with all the rights on this soil and live with dignity and security.

He came together in a long -standing democratic heritage and worked with the armed struggle during the armed struggle.

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka has signed only two out of three bilateral debt agreements, chief opposition whip Laksham Kiriella claimed.

Speaking to reporters outside parliament on Monday July 01, he said there would be no point debating the agreement since it was incomplete. He was responding to questions on why a debate scheduled for Tuesday July 02 on the debt deal was postponed.

“They said the agreements signed by the government would not be presented tomorrow. We noted that though the government said they had signed those agreements, they actually hadn’t. There are three agreements. Two of them have been signed. The third hasn’t been signed yet.

“There is no point having a debate without the third agreement, beacause it is the third agreement that reveals the whole picture,” said Kiriella.

“At the Treasury we are aware that the country is in a difficult place. But that difficulty is not visible on the surface. Fuel is available, electricity is available and public and private transportation is in place. As public servants, we got our salaries because the government didn’t impose pay cuts like in Greece during the bailout program of the International Monetary Fund. That’s a good thing.

Both opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and leftist National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have dismissed the announcement of Sri Lanka’s debt deferment agreement with bilateral creditors, pointing instead to negotiations still ongoing with commercial creditors.

### Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

*2024-07-01 23:21:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imputed-rental-income-tax-Gateway-to-corruption-on-a-massive-scale/4-763721) · `en`

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an “imputed rental income” on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of “imputed rental income” is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new “imputed rental income” is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

### When one thing leads to nothing

*2024-07-01 23:07:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/When-one-thing-leads-to-nothing/4-763718) · `en`

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, “To cross the river, feel for the stones.”

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, “Let the robber barons come.”

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the world’s factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.
