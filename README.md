We were surprised when we spoke directly with people. They are in frustration. Our goal was to come up with a strong opposition.

But now there is hope that parliamentary power can be seized. We expect that the people will make the right decision this time, without making decisions like the presidential election.

Although they informed the Criminal Investigation Division to come to my home and carry out the tests, they did not take action.. If so, why are false charges against us?

I am looking forward to legal action on the allegations made. Rohana Wijeweera's party member who fought for democracy on that day is now acting as anti -democratic.
