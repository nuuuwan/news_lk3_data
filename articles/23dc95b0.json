  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Attorney General informed the Supreme Court today that the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) will withdraw the gazette notification issued prohibiting supermarkets and shops from levying charges for polythene bags provided when purchasing goods.",
    "This was informed to the court by Deputy Solicitor General, Avanti Perera, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, when a fundamental rights petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice challenging the relevant gazette notification was taken up today (28).",
    "The FR petition was taken up before a three-member judge bench comprised of Justices S. Thurairaja, A.H.M.D Nawaz and Arjuna Obeysekera.",
    "In its petition, the Centre for Environmental Justice had stated that the plastic bags (shopping bags) provided by the stores to consumers when purchasing goods causes serious harm to the environment.",
    "The organisation therefore states that if a fee is charged for the bags, their use would be discouraged and the environmental damage caused will be reduced to a certain extent through that.",
    "When the petition was taken up today, the Deputy Solicitor General representing the Consumer Affairs Authority informed the court that the gazette notification which has been issued by the CAA prohibiting the levying of any charge for the polythene bags provided when purchasing goods from shops. Will be withdrawn.",
    "Accordingly, the petitioner party stated that they are satisfied with the decision and subsequently the hearing of the petition was concluded."
