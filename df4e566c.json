    "Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu has been rewarded for her superb recent form as she became the No.1 ranked batter on the latest ICC Women\u2019s ODI Batting Rankings.",
    "Athapaththu claims top billing from Australia opener Beth Mooney on the back of her excellent series against New Zealand that netted a total of 248 runs from three matches and included an amazing knock of 140 not out from just 80 deliveries that helped her side record an unlikely series triumph.",
    "It was the first time that Sri Lanka had beaten New Zealand in a bilateral women\u2019s ODI series and it was on the back of a mountain of runs from their inspirational skipper in Athapaththu.",
    "The 33-year-old hit an unbeaten 108 in the opening match of the three-game series and a first-ball duck in the second clash did little to temper the aggression of the confident left-hander heading into the series decider.",
    "Athapaththu smashed nine massive sixes during her quickfire knock, combining with teammate Nilakshi de Silva to record Sri Lanka\u2019s highest-ever partnership in women\u2019s ODIs when putting on 190 runs for the third wicket. She was also named the \u2018player of the series.\u2019",
    "It helped Athapaththu become the first Sri Lankan women to top the women\u2019s ODI rankings, joining male compatriot Sanath Jayasuriya as the only two players from the island nation to have held the No.1 spot in the history of the ODI rankings.",
    "There was some joy for New Zealand despite the series loss, with skipper Sophie Devine jumping six places to 13th overall on the list for ODI batters on the back of her 194 runs for the series and experienced seamer Lea Tahuhu moving up three spots to equal 14th on the ODI bowler rankings following her five wickets over the three matches.",
