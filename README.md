### Gaza women, children are nearly 70% of verified war dead, UN rights office says

*2024-11-09 08:28:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103269/gaza-women-children-are-nearly-70-of-verified-war-dead-un-rights-office-says) · `en`

The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70% of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.

The U.N. tally since the start of the war, in which Israel’s military is fighting Hamas militants, includes only fatalities it has managed to verify with three sources, and counting continues.

The 8,119 victims verified is a much lower number than the toll of more than 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the 13-month-old war. But the U.N. breakdown of the victims’ age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war.

This finding indicates “a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality”, the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report.

### Sri Lanka remittances $587.7mn in October, up 13.9-pct

*2024-11-09 06:26:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-remittances-587-7mn-in-october-up-13-9-pct-186696/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming from its overseas expatriate workers gained 13.9 percent to $587.7 million in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The total remittances in the first 10 months of this year also crossed $5.4 billion with a 11.7 percent gain compared to $4.7 billion in the same period in the last year, the latest Central Bank data showed.

Worker remittances are one of the top foreign exchange revenue earners for the island nation which is still recovering from an unprecedented economic crisis hit in 2022.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods.

### Towards Stability, Equity & Prosperity: Part V

As we have previously pointed out, though IMF programs appear to solely focus on development, they do not cater to or deal with matters that affect socio-economic justice and a fair go. Their only formula is one of liberalising markets for generating more profits for investors, with drastic cuts to social welfare benefits and expanding the tax base for increased revenue.

The IMF does not look into the socio-economic equity issues that are prevalent and predominant in most of the societies the world over, including in Sri Lanka. The theory of trickle-down economics[1] underpins their practice. However, nowhere has this theory once implemented been a success in terms of economic development, social stability, and an equitable sharing of the financial burden.
