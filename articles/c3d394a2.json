    "A word first used in 17th century England is gaining new currency in 21st century America. Kakistocracy, a Greek derivative per usual, means government administered by the worst group of citizens \u2013 in qualification, competence, experience and scruples. Kakistocracy is in full display in the US with the election of Donald Trump as president for a second term. America is returning to chaos not heeding Kamala Harris\u2019s warning against going back.",
    "In Sri Lanka, Rajapaksas epitomized Kakistocracy for nearly two decades before it imploded under Gotabaya Rajapaksa. After them came Ranil Wickremesinghe to clean up the economic mess left behind by the Rajapaksas. To his credit, Mr. Wickremesinghe did clean up the economic mess. But he also created a political mess, characteristically and superciliously",
    "The mess that Ranil made, heaped atop the mess that has been piling up for all the years of this century finally became insurmountable for the entire political establishment comprising the UNP, the SLFP, and their offshoots, the SJB and the SLPP. They have been sent packing by the people, unsung, unwept and unhonoured. There is an SJB rump but without a winning leader.",
    "Sri Lankans have turned the page and opened a new chapter. There is a new president, a new parliament and a new cabinet. There is both the return to old normalcy, as well as the beginning of a new normal. The end cannot be taken for granted, but there could not have been a better start for the making of a new nation.",
    "Politics is nothing but constant work in progress. No government can deliver on everything that is possible. The best any government can do is to maximize the good that is possible and minimize the bad that is avoidable. And achieve within its term durable benefits for the people. There is enough reason to be optimistic about the new government while being alert to the risks \u2013 that are also aplenty \u2013 of its straying off course.",
    "There is already an indication of straying in the elephantine omission of any reference to the future of the executive presidency or the enactment of a new constitution in an otherwise well crafted and comprehensive inaugural Policy Statement by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the opening sitting of the new parliament on Thursday.",
    "I read the English version of the speech issued by the President\u2019s Media Division, and even ran the \u2018word find\u2019, looking for words like \u2013 constitution, executive, president, referendum \u2013 and found none of them, let alone abolition! There is one reference to \u2018provincial councils\u2019 but that is also in connection with the role they could play in \u2018cleaning Sri Lanka\u2019. There is also no mention if and when local government and provincial council elections will be held. I don\u2019t think these omissions are a result of translation from Sinhala to English.",
    "And they will be viewed as grave omissions by NPP critics considering the pillorying that was given to Ranil Wickremesinghe over elections and their postponements. Already there have been criticisms over the government\u2019s walking back on the promise to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act. At least the government issued a statement indicating its position on the PTA matter.",
    "But omitting any reference to a new constitution or the executive presidency in the Policy Statement flies in the face of the government\u2019s insistence on being transparent and accountable. NPP\u2019s many critics will justifiably view this omission as a sign that the new government is not going be any different from its predecessors in making and breaking promises to abolish the executive presidency. Unless the government has other plans, and we are not privy to it. Otherwise, this will be a part of the old normal.",
    "The omission is also unfortunate in that it diminishes the government\u2019s impressive achievements in setting up its first cabinet and in outlining its policy framework in the President\u2019s well thought out statement to parliament. The new president, parliament, the new cabinet and the President\u2019s Policy Statement are also indicative of the sociology of the JVP\u2019s metamorphosis into NPP and the roots of their political success.",
    "It could easily be said that the NPP cabinet is the most compact and competent cabinet of ministers to be assembled in Sri Lanka in the 21st century. Unlike other presidents this century, President AKD has restricted his portfolios to three: Defence, Finance and Planning & Digital Economy. This is more in line with President JRJ\u2019s portfolios that closely resembled the Prime Minister\u2019s portfolios during the parliamentary system of government. This is moving away from the practice of presidents assigning themselves too many portfolios that began with President Kumaratunga.",
    "However, in keeping Finance under his wings, the President is continuing the practice that was also started by President Kumaratunga in 1994. Finance deserves to be a single portfolio of a single cabinet minister without any other occupational distractions. That is why Professor Mick Moore, who called Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis under Gotabaya Rajapaksa, \u201ca man-made problem\u201d, subsequently advocated that Sri Lanka should get back to the old-style finance minister carrying only the finance portfolio.",
    "The identification of portfolios and the selection of individual ministers would appear to be based on considerations of ability, political and/or professional experience, and electoral results. Nine of the cabinet ministers led the vote tallies in their respective electoral districts, and include mostly old JVPers and new NPPers. Seven of the ministers are those who came second or third in their electoral districts. The elected MPs in the cabinet reflect the JVP/NPP\u2019s geographical sweep and its sociopolitical roots in the electoral districts in seven of the island\u2019s nine provinces.",
    "Six of the cabinet ministers are drawn from the NPP\u2019s 18 National List MPs, which is a high proportion that indicates the need for balancing electoral representation with cabinet competence. Two of the National List cabinet ministers, Bimal Ratnayake and Ramalingam Chandrasekar have been credited for their political work in the Jaffna District that led to the NPP\u2019s electoral success in the district. Mr. Ratnayake is a seasoned JVP parliamentarian, while Mr. Chandrasekar is a new MP and also the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic & Oceanic Resources.",
    "Chandrasekar with Saroja Paulraj, who was elected from Matara and is the new Minister of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Affairs, are both from the Malayaha Tamil community. The two ministers seem to be part of a new turn in cabinet making that privileges not ethnic representation but political participation. That would be consistent with the vision of an equal, inclusive and \u2018non-racial\u2019 Sri Lankan society that President Dissanayake eloquently articulated in his Policy Statement. But until that Eldorado is reached the government has to deal with misgivings about missing Muslim and Sri Lankan Tamil representation in the cabinet.",
