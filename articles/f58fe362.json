    "Dialog Axiata PLC has launched the Sayuru mobile app, available in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, to support fishing communities. Targeted at day-boat fishermen, the app provides real-time weather updates and essential services in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Department of Meteorology. Building on the success of the SMS and voice-based Sayuru service introduced in 2020, the app features daily weather forecasts, route marking, saved locations, department services, awareness programs, a digital compass, SOS alerts, and a fuel calculator. While the SMS and voice service remains free, the app offers a 90-day trial for new features followed by a daily subscription fee of Rs. 2 + tax. It can be downloaded for free from the Google Play Store, with no data charges for Dialog customers.",
    "Aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the initiative aims to enhance the safety and livelihoods of fishermen, already benefiting over 100,000 users and delivering millions of weather alerts. Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda praised the app as a vital resource, while Asanga Priyadharshana from Dialog Axiata highlighted the company\u2019s commitment to empowering marginalized communities through technology.",
