    "Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) President Kaushalya Nawaratna PC categorically denied any financial misconduct within the organisation yesterday. He and several other members are under scrutiny for alleged misappropriation of funds intended for an anti-corruption initiative funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)",
    "Speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court complex, Nawaratna stated his intention to provide all relevant information to the committee tasked with investigating the allegations. He emphasised, \u201cThere is a distinction between media reports and the actual facts.\u201d",
    "On Wednesday, Nawaratna announced he would temporarily step down from his position pending the conclusion of the investigation into alleged financial irregularities within the BASL. This decision came amidst mounting pressure and concerns over the purported misappropriation of funds designated for an anti-corruption initiative funded by JICA.",
    "While Rs. 21 million was allocated for the project, accusations suggest that five members of the BASL, including Nawaratna, misappropriated at least Rs. 19 million of these funds. The other accused are BASL Deputy President Nalinda Indatissa PC, former Deputy President Shavindra Fernando PC, Rashmi Indatissa, and Nuwan De Alwis. They are also accused of not obtaining approval from the Bar Council and the Executive Committee to receive the funding for the project.",
