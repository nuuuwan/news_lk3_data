    "This was raised during a discussion held between the Agriculture Minister and representatives of the All Ceylon Egg Producers' Association today (13).",
    "During the discussion, the existing prices of eggs were taken into consideration, highlighting the need to further bring down the prices, which is currently at Rs. 48.",
