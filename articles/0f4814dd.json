    "Sahasdhanavi Ltd has responded to recent debates regarding its power plant\u2019s levelised tariff, reaffirming the project\u2019s significance in Sri Lanka\u2019s energy stability as outlined in the government-approved Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LTGEP). In a press release issued recently, the company sought to clarify misconceptions and provide transparency on key aspects of the project.",
    "The 350 MW RLNG/Diesel power plant was awarded in 2021 through an International Competitive Bidding (ICB) process, with Sahasdhanavi submitting the lowest bid. After securing Cabinet and Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) approval by December 2023, the project faced delays due to broader national circumstances.",
    "24/7 Reliable Power: 318 MW (diesel) or 350 MW (LNG) on demand, with over 90% availability (penalties apply if unmet).",
    "Capacity Charge\u00a0(Rs. 6.5/kWh): Paid only when the plant is idle.",
    "Energy Charge: Based on actual consumption (~Rs. 57/kWh for diesel, ~Rs. 33/kWh for LNG).",
    "Market-Linked Adjustments: Final tariffs in 2028 will align with prevailing fuel prices.",
    "The company clarified that criticisms of the levelised tariff stem from a misunderstanding of its purpose:",
    "It is a\u00a0theoretical metric\u00a0based on RFP assumptions (fixed fuel prices, exchange rates).",
    "Does not reflect actual payments, which are tied to real-time costs.",
    "The PUCSL endorsed the tariff and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on 1 April 2025, with additional legal clearance from the Attorney General\u2019s Department.",
    "A comparable Battery Storage System (BESS) would cost\u00a0USD 1.75\u20132.2 billion (~6x more)\u00a0with additional standby charges (Rs. 37/kWh).",
    "\u201cThis plant is a\u00a0strategic asset for energy security,\u201d the spokesperson stated. \u201cThe levelised tariff is purely for bid evaluation \u2013 actual costs depend on real-world factors. We urge policymakers and the public to recognise the project\u2019s\u00a0vital role\u00a0in Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable energy future.\u201d",
