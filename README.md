This will be my first Christmas without my father, Eric Cooray, who passed away three months ago. Life has felt strange since that inevitable moment, one I always dreaded, while never anticipating just how difficult his loss would be to accept.

Almost every day starts and ends with thoughts of my father, from fond memories of my childhood to imagining how proud he would be of his beloved grandchildren. Throughout my life, he inspired me in countless ways. Even now, I draw so much strength from memories of him that it still feels like he is guiding me from the heavens, giving me the strength to keep moving forward.

President of the Republic Anura Kumara Dissanayake spoke without notes in his first policy statement in Parliament. His unhesitating delivery in punctilious order was simultaneously translated into both English and Tamil.

I rely on the English translation of the speech for the purpose of this brief commentary. He described it as a “monumental moment in the history of Sri Lanka’s Parliament.”

Indeed, it will be remembered as a watershed moment, a turning point of our politics if only he succeeds in resolving his twin dilemmas – ensuring ethical governance, adopting pragmatic economics to break free from a “Sovereign Debt Trap.”

As early as the 1890s, psychology research has been done on crowd behaviour. Gustave Le Bon (1841) who was a French social psychologist pioneered research on group behaviour, especially crowd behaviour. People with compatible needs and interests come together (convergence theory), purposefully and united, to have their views represented. Classical theories treat crowds as pathological (contagion theory). Crowds are seen as mobs, mobs that act irrationally.

Delivering his inaugural policy statement to Parliament, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake dealt mostly with the economy and, in particular, the IMF agreement. The problem he faces is that the former government agreed to terms with the IMF that did not consider the impact on the people, but gave priority to meeting fiscal targets. The President acknowledged that the government had no alternative but to continue with it as the country had gone too far down the road to change direction. He said, “The negotiations had already been ongoing for more than two years. If we were to restart discussions on the restructuring programme for an extended period it will be impossible for us to move the economy forward…”

However, the foreign employment work is hiding the opportunities for South Korea, so they are struggling to prolong the time as they have to go to work.

But it is illegal to send to business on E8 visa. The President of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau said it could not be allowed. As well as the console is not likely to get a visa without knowing. The Chairman of the Bureau said that there is no truth in reporting that we have got a career opportunity for South Korea.
