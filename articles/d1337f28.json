    "\u201cWith respect to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic performance, Macroeconomic policies in Sri Lanka are starting to bear fruit. Commendable outcomes include a rapid decline in inflation, robust reserve accumulation, and initial signs of economic growth, while also preserving stability in the financial system,\u201d said IMF Director of Communications Julie Kozack speaking to journalists in Washington D.C. yesterday.",
