    "A year after the events of 9\u201313 July, there are more questions than answers to the hoary issues of our unprecedented \u2018People\u2019s Revolution\u2019.",
    "Who \u2013 if any single individual or parties with vested interests acting in collusion \u2013 orchestrated \u2018the long march\u2019 on Colombo on 9 July 2022, which eventually ousted a sitting president through his resignation-in-exile on the 13th? A hidden hand whose intent was later writ large? An ancien r\u00e9gime embarrassed by a liability turned loose cannon? Were these one and the same?",
    "What were the root causes of the months-long, nation-wide protests \u2013 other than the self-evident fuel, food, forex, fiscal policy, financial praxis, fertiliser and pharmaceuticals shortages that radicalised diverse communities?",
    "From housewives beating pots and pans and their kitchen cabals; through trendy youth at iconic Independence Square; to sundry organic protests in farm, field and at Galle Face: What sociopolitical and economic phenomena did the \u2018spontaneous\u2019 uprising of the masses-as-one seek to eradicate?",
    "Have an abundance of resources more readily available now, albeit at no small cost, banked the flames of outraged citizen dissent sufficiently that the powers that be may swan about again in truculent authoritarianism, brandishing antiterrorism laws and potentially oppressive media bills to boot?",
    "And has the semblance of legality in an unelected, arguably mandate-less administration (that has space to reflect a sea of green tinged by shades of conviction blue in the face from snarling \u2018we won the war\u2019, \u2018we won that poll\u2019, \u2018we have those votes from the last time round\u2019) suitably impressed a populace more amenable to peace with plenty than justice without compromise \u2013 to quell the stoutest republican fervour?",
    "First, we submit Aragalaya\u2019s SWOT. Then, let us essay a \u20183F-theorem\u2019 of sorts. And finally, raise a red flag.",
    "Checks and balances to a collusive division and separation of powers sends strong signals to all three branches of government that the people are sovereign",
    "Intrinsic lack of vision, mission and purpose other than a short-term goal (regime change)",
    "Not organised enough to seek the sustainable support of key civil society blocs (e.g. apex bodies of academic and professional organisations, biz and trade chambers, media) for sustainable changes/ongoing revolution)",
    "Traduced as a Trojan horse by elites defending vested interests aligned to autocratic government necessary for crony capitalism",
    "Justice being dispensed in the non-salutary form of vigilantism, mob violence",
    "The potential in citizen hands to challenge and reform an entrenched culture of corruption and cronyism",
    "Return to the status quo and a consolidation now of the corrupt, kleptocratic, incompetent regime facing ouster and possible criminal prosecution then",
    "FORM: The Aragalaya of Jan-July 2022 was a legitimate citizens\u2019 movement that brought to the fore popular dissent as a legal enough force to effect regime change or part-thereof, in the absence of a constitutionally guaranteed right of recall whereby nonperforming elected representatives could be removed from office midterm.",
    "FUNCTION: But while it achieved part of its plan \u2013 the removal of a demonstrably incompetent president impervious to sustainable policy tweaks to avoid defaulting on Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign debt repayments due and subsequent bankruptcy \u2013 it failed to concretise a sustainable mechanism whereby the notion and impact of \u2018popular sovereignty\u2019 could be made viable for a better-governed republic.",
    "FUNDAMENTAL: All if not most bloodless revolutions tend to reinstate the status quo by sly and subtle manipulation of the body politic\u2019s pre-existent mechanisms.",
    "To be young at heart though middle aged in mind, and old and tired of the same old story since Independence in spirit was (if not heaven, or a fools\u2019 paradise) distraction enough from all that has, will, and shall continue to ail our nation state short of a sustainable, ongoing, peaceful \u2018people\u2019s revolution\u2019.",
    "This was our storming of the Bastille (even the dates match), fall of the Berlin Wall, Tiananmen Square, whatever you like to compare it to.",
    "The most pressing question now, perhaps on further reflection, is not whose Aragalaya it was, then.",
    "But rather, who doesn\u2019t want it to be remembered as a purer, more unalloyed and not as yet discredited event it is now, by dint of being hijacked by a \u2018red brigade\u2019 and/or other mercenaries, as well as political actors with mixed motives.",
    "And if even now, as then, maybe like always, we fail to ask who benefits \u2013 \u2018Cui bono?\u2019 \u2013 from the guttering of the flame, our fate and future as a republic with potential will bleed in the gutter.",
