China, June 2 (BBC) - The Chang'e 6 touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin at 06:23 Beijing time on Sunday morning (22:23 GMT Saturday), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said.

Launched on 3 May, the mission aims to collect precious rock and soil from this region for the first time in history.

The probe could extract some of the Moon's oldest rocks from a huge crater on its South Pole.

The landing was fraught with risks, because it is very difficult to communicate with spacecraft once they reach the far side of the Moon. China is the only country to have achieved the feat before, landing its Chang'e-4 in 2019.

After launching from Wenchang Space Launch Center, the Chang'e 6 spacecraft had been orbiting the Moon waiting to land.

The lander component of the mission then separated from the orbiter to touch down on the side of the Moon that faces permanently away from Earth.

### Quo Vadis?

*2024-06-01 21:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/quo-vadis/) · `en`

This has been the most rainy and squally Vesak that I can recall in my eight decades on this planet and it has made me grumpy. The depression in the Bay of Bengal has prepared all of for the couch of some psycho-quack conning folks with fictious talk of depressions.

This essay is in two separate parts unconnected with each other; a) Feeding the 225 and b) people taking the initiative into their hands and not relying on the state.

Jesus fed 5,000 with two fishes and five loaves (Mathew 14:13-21) and you may reckon that to be a great achievement but he did it only once. Our people in Sri Lanka have to keep feeding the 225 day-in-day-out every day of their lives. And where does it all go? Into political pockets! Import permits for luxury cars, insurance cover for wives, mistresses and sons and of course plain rip-off.

With elections coming up in a few months’ time – notwithstanding Palitha Range Bandara’s outrageous remarks, to which Saliya Pieris, the former President of the Bar Association, responded thoughtfully – new coalitions and alliances are cropping up. These have pulled together the unlikeliest MPs and ideologues, who you’d never put together in the same room but who have, in the aftermath of the 2022 crisis, have unified around certain issues. Outside of the government, the consensus seems to be that we have yet to see a proper Opposition. This is the selling promise of these new coalitions: they tout themselves as that proper Opposition, the only political groups that matter.

India, June 1 (BBC) - India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to win a third consecutive term in office, exit polls suggest.

Analysts warn the polls, released by various news agencies, have often been wrong in the past and are not impartial.

The BJP, the main opposition Congress party and regional rivals battled it out in a fierce campaign over seven phases of polling.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government.

The BJP led-coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will cross this target - according to exit polls.

If Mr Modi wins, he will be only the second prime minister in India to hold office for three consecutive terms. The first to do so was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first PM.

### Sir Aldo Castellani (1877-1971), a great medical scientist

*2024-06-01 17:58:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-aldo-castellani-1877-1971-a-great-medical-scientist/) · `en`

The Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon, that massive volume of Ceylonians published in 1910, records that the man who came to be known as Marchese Sir Aldo Castellani, KCMG, was born on the September 8, 1874, or just a 100 years ago (as this is being written). But who, a reader of the younger generation may well inquire, was this man, and why should we take note of this centenary of his birth? Well, he was a versatile character who had a distinguished career in Ceylon for 12 years as a physician and medical scientist. Thereafter in a long life, he continued to hit the headlines in many foreign fields.

Castellani’s name appeared in such reference books as “Who’s Who”, the “International Who’s Who” and the “Authors and Artists Who’s Who”, but in each case with a different year of birth. I am inclined to accept the date of birth given in “Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon” because the information would have been furnished when he was a comparatively young man.

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - Those who dislike seeing progress achieved by the underprivileged have labelled entrepreneurs like Elon Musk as "economic hitmen", Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said at a meeting held in Badulla.

"Elon Musk is the number one billionaire in the world. Tesla, SpaceX, eBay, Bitcoin and Starlink Satellite are all under his leadership. He has informed the President that he will start a Tesla branch in Sri Lanka.

"Elon Musk is a powerful entrepreneur who brought technology to the world and is someone from whom we can learn about life. Despite not having a university education, his actions have made a significant impact globally," he said.

Yesterday, I saw NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti call Elon Musk an 'economic hitman.' This is not true. Elon Musk is a man who changed the world economy and propelled it forward.

### Adolescent guilt at a Catholic school

*2024-06-01 17:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/adolescent-guilt-at-a-catholic-school/) · `en`

I joined St Anthony’s College at Wattala when I was seven years-old. It was a private college run by the La Salle Christian Brothers. The cover page of my ‘Report Card’ said that the College leads young boys in the Christian faith, helping them to become god-fearing, diligent, honest, and good citizens.

Each school day started with a standard set of prayers. A 90-minute catechism class followed morning prayers. After that, students learned other subjects. At the beginning of each study period, students got up, acknowledged that they were in God’s presence, and prayed for his help. Each study period ended with a prayer of gratitude. A day at the College ended at 3.15pm with another standard prayer, which took about 10 minutes.

Lunch time for working people in Sri Lanka differ in various places and offices. Those bringing lunch from home sit together in the canteen or an alotted lunch room while others lunch at their own desks. Those lunching in office travel to work from far so that they cannot go home for their meal and return within the stipulated hour.

During our schooldays, schools used to start at 8.00 am and go on till 3.00 pm with an hour long lunch interval. The day scholars who travelled from far brought their lunch from home. They used to eat either in the tuck shop or in a separate room allotted for the purpose. Those living close to the school went home for lunch and returned in time for classes. The hostelers would go to the boarding for lunch and return for the afternoon session.

### Shortage of 5,000 buses hampers private passenger transport services

*2024-06-01 17:11:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Shortage-of-5-000-buses-hampers-private-passenger-transport-services/108-283883) · `en`

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - A shortage of 5,000 private buses is making it difficult to provide adequate passenger transport services, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijerathne claimed.

He told the Daily Mirror that 70% of buses with valid route permits are running in the country, while the remaining buses are not operating properly.

He noted that buses with valid route permits cannot provide proper services because some are undergoing major repairs or are engaged in other services.

As a result, the existing private bus fleet has been reduced to 13,000, and even these buses sometimes do not operate properly, Wijerathne said.

"As a result, people have to pay Rs. 100 for three-wheeler fares to travel a minimum distance of one kilometre. The shortage of private buses has severely impacted the transport sector, with people suffering the most when relying on public transport," he said.

### Hope, wisdom and cynicism: Voices from rural Sri Lanka

*2024-06-01 16:22:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hope-wisdom-and-cynicism-voices-from-rural-sri-lanka/) · `en`

The lakes, paddy fields and forests of the ancient village of Dutuwewa are a world away from Colombo’s high-rises and colonial buildings. As elsewhere, decisions taken by ‘old men’ in the corridors of power impact life here, just as these rural voters will impact politics nationally

Times are tough and it’s hard to make ends meet. A refrain heard from just about anyone in my home country Pakistan where the rupee has dropped to around 300 to the dollar. This is now comparable to the rupee in Sri Lanka, recovering from the biggest economic crash in its history.

Stories of hardship echo from the island nation’s largest city Colombo to the farming heartlands around Anuradhapura district, a little over 200 km to the north-east. At the core of Anuradhapura lies the irrigation tank called Dutuwewa which sustains several villages.

Sri Lanka’s rural landscape is dotted with as many as 14,000 such large and small irrigation lakes, known as wewas, built by kings thousands of years ago.

### 2024 Lok Sabha election campaigns Modi

*2024-06-01 16:20:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185045) · `ta`

In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, faced unexpected challenges and criticism. Despite initial predictions of an easy win, the BJP engaged in aggressive tactics against opponents, including disabling Congress party bank accounts and arresting two chief ministers. The Election Commission's handling of the elections, especially regarding electronic voting machines, drew controversy and accusations of bias. Modi's campaign focused heavily on his leadership, with less emphasis on Hindu-Muslim politics until late in the game, where he addressed concerns directly. The Congress party responded with a focus on caste and class issues, criticizing the BJP's alleged favoritism towards wealthy capitalists. The unpredictable nature of the campaign highlighted the complexities and potential flaws in India's electoral system, raising concerns about democracy and fairness.

🟩

The Indian Lok Sabha elections are over and the results are being released.This time the general election campaigns were held. They were completely different for what we thought.

Most people thought that winning this election was an easy task for the Bharatiya Janata Party and that Prime Minister Narendra Damodaradas would consider himself a small work ahead of his third coronation.. We thought that he would be proudly proudly proudly, ignoring the opposition parties and taking the achievements of his ten -year regime to the people.

But most of us do not have campaigns as expected. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) falsely lied to all expectations and carried out attacks against its enemies with self -esteem and behaved in a defensive style. Congress party bank accounts disabled. Two chief ministers in office were arrested and jailed. Non -Bharatiya Janata Party of India was afraid that they could be arrested in their homes.
