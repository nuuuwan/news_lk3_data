    "In a gesture reflecting the spirit of forgiveness, tolerance and compassion, United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has ordered the release of 91 Sri Lankans this year.",
    "This Presidential pardon reflects UAE\u2019s deep humanitarian values, while also giving those released the opportunity to rebuild their lives and make positive contributions to their families and societies.",
    "The 91 Sri Lankans are part of a total of 1,138 prisoners of several nationalities who were issued the Presidential pardon this year. This annual act of Presidential clemency is intended to foster family unity, and provide prisoners with the opportunity to reflect on their future, apart from helping them reintegrate into society.",
    "President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed regularly grants Presidential pardons on important UAE occasions, reflecting his vision of humanness, tolerance, and compassion by offering those released with a second chance at life. This initiative underscores the UAE\u2019s values of forgiveness and tolerance while helping to strengthen family bonds by reuniting prisoners with their loved ones, thereby bringing joy to families.",
    "The prisoners were released on the occasion of Eid ul-Adha, a festival celebrated by Muslims around the world. Most of the 91 prisoners had been serving sentences related to financial offenses. The government pardon also covered the settlement of their fines and penalties on behalf of the inmates."
