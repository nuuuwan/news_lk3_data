    "The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\u00a0 (CBSL) has decided not to renew the money changing permits of 15 money changers (MCs) in the country for the year 2023.",
    "Issuing a statement in this regard, the CBSL explained that the relevant decision was taken due to the non-compliance with a condition of the permits issued for the year 2022.",
    "Thus, the matter was communicated to the respective MCs on 22 June, and they are thereby no longer permitted to engage in money changing activities, including the buying, selling and exchanging of foreign currency.",
    "CBSL further warned that engaging in such activities with said companies will be considered a contravention of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017.",
