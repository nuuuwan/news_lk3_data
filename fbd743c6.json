    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s food inflation will ease to a single digit next month though the government had been expecting it in December this year, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said as appreciation of the rupee, improved local food supply with chemical fertilizer application, and base effect have helped to ease the inflation.",
    "The year on year food inflation has eased to 15.8 percent in May from from 27.1 percent in the previous month\u00a0 as measured by National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), the data showed on Wednesday (21).",
    "It touched over 80 percent in the second half of last year after the economic crisis followed by dollar shortage hit the island nation with queues for fuel, gas, and medicines.",
    "\u201cThe food inflation was expected to reach single digit in December. However, our policies have helped it to ease sharply and we expect a single digit by next month,\u201d Fernando told a media briefing.",
    "\u201cdefinitely it will decrease to below 10 percent next month. We are achieving the target much earlier than we expected. However, its true that the rate of price decrease is slower than it was increased when the imports are concerned.\u201d",
    "Former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s overnight policy to ban chemical fertilizer adversely hit the country\u2019s cultivations and the island nation was unable to import foods as earlier due to lack of dollars.",
    "Minister Fernando, however, said reduction in interest rates and strengthening of rupee among many other policy outcomes have helped the country to see a gradual stability though he said many people still paying more due to monopoly and lack of competition in Sri Lanka markets.
