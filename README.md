### Cabinet nod for Constitutional amendment to align Presidential and Parliamentary terms for 5 years

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved a proposal to amend the Constitution, addressing inconsistencies in the terms of the President and Parliament.

“The proposed amendment seeks to substitute the phrase ‘exceeding six years’ with ‘exceeding five years’, thereby ensuring that both the Presidential and Parliamentary terms are aligned,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and  Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

The decision comes amid Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissing a petition seeking to postpone the upcoming Presidential election. The five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, rejected the petition by C.D. Lenawa on several grounds. Firstly, they noted the lack of new evidence compared to a similar petition filed in 2019. Additionally, the Attorney General argued that the petitioner’s fundamental rights were not violated as the constitution clearly states a ‘five year’ Presidential term.

### Adani controversy: Why the cheerleaders are wrong

Samaranayake’s rambling polemic against environmentalists and in favour of Adani sidesteps the most important issue: transparency

The past week has seen a flurry of media activity from apologists for, and supporters of, the proposed Adani wind power project in Mannar. An article by Engineer Gerald L. Samaranayake in the Daily FT of 8 July, for instance, observed: “Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.” (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Will-environmentalists-stall-new-50MW-Mannar-wind-power-project/4-763942).

The National Peace Council welcomes the Supreme Court’s decision to consider the case as soon as possible. We believe the continuing uncertainty about the holding of the Presidential election is deeply harmful to the country in every aspect.

The public also needs a fair, equitable, transparent and accountable tax system that aims at implementing good tax principles

There are two certain things with regard to nature in the world. They are Death and Tax. Taxes are the most important source of revenue of the modern Government. It plays a vital role in fulfilling peoples’ aspirations and their rights. Taxation is not a new concept in the modern world. It is as old as the first attempt of mankind to organise a civilised society.

### Healthy and radiant skin…

*2024-07-10 22:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/healthy-and-radiant-skin/) · `en`

Hi! Thought of giving you something different, this week, for you to try out.

Like me, I know all the lovely ladies like to keep their face…always beautiful.

You will need 01 tablespoon ground flaxseed, 01 tablespoon white flour, 01 teaspoon olive oil, and 02 tablespoons non-sugar yoghurt…yes, plain yoghurt.

In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed with the white flour. Then add the olive oil to the mixture. Next, gradually mix in the 02 tablespoons of non-sugar yoghurt (plain yoghurt). Stir well until you achieve a smooth paste-like consistency.

(You can adjust the consistency of the mask by adding more yoghurt if it’s too thick, or more flour if it’s too runny.)

Wash your face thoroughly with a gentle cleanser and pat dry with a towel.

Apply the mask evenly to your face, avoiding the eye area, and allow the mask to sit on your face for about 15-20 minutes.

Once the time is up, rinse your face with lukewarm water to remove the mask completely.

The first person to receive the accolade was Chandralal Senadhira, a manager who has served over 30 years working with the Saudi food and beverage giant Almarai and was set to retire and return to Sri Lanka.

*2024-07-10 21:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/bourse-in-recovery-stage-following-oversell-of-shares/) · `en`

The stock market turned out to be in a recovery stage yesterday after the market saw an oversell of shares due to a dip in the market for two consecutive sessions. Only 27 Index points were secured in trading as against 160 points down during the last two sessions, market analysts said.

The market was dominated by two crossings; especially that of Agalawatte Plantations, but retail investor participation was significantly low. Out of the 801.2 million turnover only Rs 450 million had come from retail investors, due to political uncertainty, which resulted in the market becoming lacklustre.

Amid those developments both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 27 points while S and P SL20 rose by 14.47 points. Turnover stood at Rs 801.2 million with two crossings. Those crossings were reported in Agalawatte Plantations, which crossed 10.9 million shares to the tune of Rs 350 million; its shares traded at Rs 32 and Sampath Bank 300,000 shares crossed for Rs 23.25 million.
