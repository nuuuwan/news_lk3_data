    "The 37th K.N. Seneviratne Oration will be held at the Faculty fo Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenepura on Saturday, November 23, 2024. It will be held in conjunction with the Annual Sessions of the Physiological Society of Sri Lanka (PSSL). The inauguration will begin at 7.55 am and the Oration begins at 8.50 am.",
    "Much has been written on the life and work of Prof. Keerthi Nissanka Seneviratne by his academic colleagues, generations of his admiring students and those who knew him as a sincere friend. He is no stranger to the medical academic community in Sri Lanka. I have been very fortunate to be one of his students at the tail-end of his life as a teacher in Physiology at the Colombo Medical School.",
    "Professor Keerthi Nissanka Seneviratne was born in Elpitiya, Galle on November 22, 1929 as the second son of Dr. Robert and Mrs Laura Seneviratne. Prof. Seneviratne came from a privileged family. His father, Robert Seneviratne was a doctor trained in Edinburgh, Scotland, where subsequently, Prof. Seneviratne obtained his research doctorate.",
    "He had his primary and secondary education at Royal College, Colombo. He obtained his MBBS degree with honours in 1954 from the University of Ceylon, Colombo, gaining a distinction in Medicine and winning the Gold Medal for Operative Surgery.",
    "After completing his clinical training as a young doctor, he joined the Department of Physiology of the Colombo Medical School on secondment as a Demonstrator in 1957. Due to his interest in research, he went to the UK and obtained his Ph.D from the University of Edinburgh. Having rejoined the Department of Physiology at the Faculty of Medicine, Colombo, he was promoted to the post of Professor of Physiology at the young age of 39 in 1969 and was in the post until 1981.",
    "I do not think it is necessary to reiterate to this audience, the highlights of Prof. Seneviratne\u2019s unique and distinguish career that was cut short by the massive heart-attack he suffered in August 1986. His career highlights include, in particular, his exemplary research and teaching career at the Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo; his pioneering, but short stint as the founder Director of the Institute of Postgraduate Medicine (IPGM) that has subsequently transformed into the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM); and his unfinished tasks at the South-East Asia Regional Office of the WHO in New Delhi. His ground-breaking efforts to bring postgraduate medicine into Sri Lanka amidst much opposition from the medical establishment has been grossly under-estimated and gone almost unrecognised. I consider it a \u2018revolution\u2019 of sorts that transformed postgraduate medicine in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Institute of Postgraduate Medicine which later became the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine was established by Prof. Seneviratne in 1974 and he was the Founder Director until he was appointed as a Regional Advisor to the World Health Organisation in 1981. The tragedy of our times is that we do not recognise great pioneers, but do so of lesser men who tread the paths that have been cleared for them. The photograph of Prof. K.N. Seneviratne does not hang on the walls of the PGIM as the founder of that institution (though by another name). My attempts to redress that injustice to Prof. Seneviratne while I was the Chairman of the Board of Management of PGIM fell on deaf ears. Perhaps, my attempts were too feeble and ineffective.",
    "He earned the immense respect of his peers, as he was undoubtedly the \u2018primus inter pares\u2019 among them. He earned the respect of lesser men, not by his position or authority, but I believe, by the abundance of his innate humility, humour and humanism. Prof. Seneviratne was different in many ways. He (and Prof. Leicester Jayawardene) came to work in white bush-shirts and often in sandals. Mark Twain, US humorist, novelist, short story writer and wit, once said that \u201cClothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society,\u201d. Prof. Seneviratne and Prof. Leicester Jayawardene showed me early, contrary to Mark Twains dictum, that \u2018clothes do not make the man\u2019.",
    "Of those who knew him intimately, Prof. Carlo Fonseka was perhaps, one of the closest. Prof. Fonseka\u2019s description of him in \u201cThe Island\u201d on November 21, 1987, to my mind, fits best and exemplifies the multi-faceted nature of his personality. I quote: \u201cThis large- hearted giant of a man was spontaneously self-effacing, consciously non-competitive, disarmingly non-aggressive and pathologically publicity shy\u201d. Giants of men are a rare breed in any country. It is, perhaps, even more so in ours. A giant in stature, character and personality is that much rarer. Prof. Seneviratne was one such very rare gentle giant of a man.",
    "I have not found an explanation as to why Prof. Seneviratne chose physiology for his specialization and future professional career and not a clinical one, in any of the commemorative tributes and articles written of him. They all seem to assume that it was an obvious and natural choice with him.",
    "I wish to believe Prof. Seneviratne\u2019s strong research profile was fired by an urge to \u2018search and find\u2019 new information that had eluded medical researchers until then. Perhaps, He was also attracted to the discipline of physiology by the intrinsic scientific logic of its basic principles.",
    "And therefore, what better way to commemorate him than an Oration in his name by The Physiological Society of Sri Lanka?",
    "This years Orator will be Prof. Savithri Wimalasekera, Professor in Physiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenepura. Prof. Wimalasekera obtained her MBBS degree from the North Colombo Medical College in 1991, her MPhil from the University of Colombo in 2002 and the PhD from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka in 2009. She has 30 years of experience in teaching physiology to medical students in both the Universities of Sri Jayawardenepura and the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University. Prof. Wimalasekera\u2019s main research interests are in the fields of clinical neurophysiology and respiratory physiology. She has co-authored seven books on student aids in physiology and many research papers in peer-reviewed journals.",
    "She has won many awards for her research papers and presentations. Furthermore, she has been President of the Physiological Society of Sri Lanka, the Vice President of the South Asian Association of Physiologists (SAAP) and also the Secretary General of SAAP.",
    "The title of her oration this year will be \u201cCognition through a life span: Perspectives from Sri Lanka\u201d. She will speak on some of the many aspects that affect cognitive development during childhood, adolescence and young adults and also on a few factors that can help in the development of cognition during the early years of life. Furthermore, she hopes to speak on the decline in cognition with ageing and some measures that can be adopted to retard the rate of cognitive decline with ageing.",
