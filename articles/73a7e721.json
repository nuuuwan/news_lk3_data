    "\u2013 Representatives from Sri Lanka\u2019s business community, government, and the finance sector convened in Colombo to discuss the mix of policies, financial mechanisms and technologies, crucial for propelling the country\u2019s industrial decarbonization and economic recovery. This event is the second edition of the Industry Dialogue organized by the European Union (EU)-funded Accelerating Industries\u2019 Climate Response in Sri Lanka project.",
    "\u201cFor Sri Lanka to emerge stronger, industrial decarbonization must be at the heart of the country\u2019s economic recovery from the energy crisis of the past two years,\u201d said Secretary to the Ministry of Industry Thilaka Jayasundara during one of her interventions. \u201cThis means that manufacturing processes should become greener by shifting away from fossil fuels, scaling-up renewable energy and adopting energy-efficient solutions.\u201d",
    "Industries employ 30 percent of the nation\u2019s workforce and deliver the second-highest share of GDP, but they also consume large quantities of fossil fuel imports. In recent years, this has led to challenging cost rises for many businesses, with petrol shortages further disrupting operations.",
    "To open the half-day event, Head of Cooperation for the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Dr Johann Hesse reminded more than 120 participants of the risks of climate change and the need for action at all levels: \u201cBy reducing energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions, industries will not only chart a more sustainable path to economic growth, but will also help the country meet its climate goals and energy security. We are happy to assist Sri Lanka to meet the goals it has committed to achieve.\u201d he said.",
    "The Sri Lankan government has pledged that 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy will come from renewable sources by 2030. As part of this, Sri Lankan industries must reduce their fossil fuel use, aiming for a 7 percent reduction in industrial emissions.",
    "As part of the program, international experts presented recent research by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) on industrial decarbonization trends in Sri Lanka, focusing on key manufacturing sectors like textiles, food and beverages, rubber production, and cement. The research shed light on the existing policy and regulatory landscape and identified institutional needs and capacity gaps essential for advancing Sri Lanka\u2019s climate goals.",
