  "original_body_lines": [
    "In this engaging and thought-provoking interview with Levan S. Dzhagaryan, the Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Republic of Maldives, the seasoned diplomat shared his country\u2019s perspectives on recent political developments in Sri Lanka and the intricate geopolitical dynamics surrounding the situation in Ukraine. With a diplomatic career spanning decades, Dzhagaryan\u2019s insights reveal the nuanced layers of Russia\u2019s foreign policy and its implications for global relations.",
    "Ambassador Dzhagaryan opened the dialogue by expressing optimism regarding the recent presidential elections in Sri Lanka. \u201cFirst of all, I would like to congratulate your country on the occasion of very successful presidential elections,\u201d he stated, acknowledging the peaceful atmosphere that marked the process. \u201cIt was commendable to see it unfold without any unrest.\u201d His praise for the electoral process underscores Russia\u2019s traditional respect for the sovereignty of nations, reflecting a diplomatic approach that emphasizes cooperation over interference.",
    "When discussing the future political environment of Sri Lanka, Dzhagaryan maintained that Russia holds firm to its principle of non-interference. \u201cWe do not comment on the outcomes of elections in foreign countries,\u201d he declared. This assertion reinforces Russia\u2019s stance of respecting the choices made by the Sri Lankan electorate. \u201cMy meeting with His Excellency President Dissanayake allowed me to express my hopes that the new government would continue its traditional policy of neutrality and maintain a balanced foreign policy,\u201d he added, emphasizing Russia\u2019s desire to be recognized as a \u201ctraditional friendly country ready for cooperation.\u201d",
    "The ambassador also shared that he extended a formal invitation to President Disanayake to attend the Kazan Summit (BRICS Summit) in October. \u201cWhile he accepted my message, we are still awaiting his decision regarding the invitation,\u201d he said, underscoring the respect Russia has for Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign decisions amidst a busy political climate.",
    "Returning to the controversial situation in Ukraine, Dzhagaryan offered a perspective that diverges sharply from the mainstream Western narrative. \u201cIt\u2019s important to clarify that the situation in Ukraine is not merely a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\u201d he asserted. Instead, he described it as a \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d claiming that it stems from a broader geopolitical struggle between Russia and what he referred to as the \u201ccollective West.\u201d In this context, he characterized Ukraine as a lever for the West to achieve strategic goals against Russia.",
    "Dzhagaryan lamented the lack of constructive dialogue from the current Ukrainian government, which he claims is heavily influenced by the U.S. and the U.K. \u201cThe government has been instructed to continue hostilities against Russia, undermining any potential for negotiation,\u201d he noted. This stark framing of the conflict highlights Russia\u2019s grievances and underscores its call for a political resolution\u2014one that has been consistently advocated since the Minsk agreements in 2014.",
    "Reflecting on historical precedents, the ambassador drew parallels between the current situation and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. \u201cIf we reflect on historical precedents, we can understand our security concerns regarding military infrastructures close to our borders,\u201d he stated, emphasizing the perception of threat that drives Russian policy. He further remarked, \u201cOur nuclear doctrine has been revised in light of these threats, emphasizing our preparedness to respond decisively to any aggressive actions against us.\u201d",
    "His remarks on the revised nuclear doctrine reflect a deep-seated concern over provocations from nations aligned with U.S. interests. \u201cOur nuclear doctrine now clearly outlines our commitment to retaliate forcefully against any aggression directed at our nation,\u201d he stated, reinforcing Russia\u2019s unwavering stance on national security. This re-calibration is not just about military posturing; it is a calculated deterrent aimed at reminding adversaries that Russia is serious about defending its sovereignty. \u201cIf our sovereignty is threatened, we will respond with appropriate measures,\u201d Dzhagaryan asserted, sending a clear message that aggression will not be tolerated.",
    "Turning to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the ambassador highlighted the intricacies that hinder potential resolutions. He characterized the situation not merely as a conflict between two nations but as a broader geopolitical struggle against what he termed the \u201ccollective West.\u201d \u201cThe current Ukrainian government, which we consider to be a regime influenced heavily by the U.S. and U.K., has shown little willingness to engage in constructive dialogue,\u201d Dzhagaryan noted, underscoring the challenges posed by external pressures on Kyiv. His remarks reflect frustration over the lack of agency in the current Ukrainian leadership, which he describes as a \u201cpuppet regime\u201d operating under directives from Washington.",
    "Dzhagaryan\u2019s perspective on international initiatives aimed at fostering dialogue, particularly from countries like Brazil and China, was equally pointed. \u201cUnfortunately, the prospects for negotiations are limited at this moment,\u201d he stated, emphasizing that any meaningful dialogue is obstructed by a lack of genuine decision-making power in Ukraine. The ambassador also expressed concern about the broader European context, noting that many nations seem to lack an independent stance, often waiting for guidance from the U.S. \u201cEurope bears significant costs, both politically and economically,\u201d he added, referencing the growing discontent within European countries like Germany and Austria.",
    "As the conversation shifted to the upcoming BRICS summit, Dzhagaryan articulated Russia\u2019s commitment to enhancing cooperation among member states to support the Global South. \u201cWe are prepared to address numerous topics, including the humanitarian crises in Gaza, Palestine, and broader security concerns,\u201d he said, highlighting the significance of the summit in facilitating dialogue on pressing global issues. The ambassador also stressed the importance of economic collaboration, particularly in reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. \u201cWe intend to advocate for the use of national currencies in trade, reducing the weaponization of the dollar,\u201d he affirmed, emphasizing Russia\u2019s vision for a more equitable global economic landscape.",
    "In discussing Russia\u2019s bilateral ties with Sri Lanka, Dzhagaryan expressed a desire for increased cooperation, particularly in energy and infrastructure projects. \u201cWe have demonstrated our capability and experience in these areas, and we hope Sri Lanka will recognize the potential benefits of cooperation with Russia,\u201d he asserted. He further revealed that Russia is committed to enhancing diplomatic relations, including educational exchanges and humanitarian aid, demonstrating a robust intent to forge lasting partnerships in a shifting geopolitical environment. \u201cOur readiness to assist has been met with challenges, but we remain optimistic about the future,\u201d he concluded, highlighting Russia\u2019s resolve to be a supportive ally amid global uncertainties.",
    "As we wrapped up the discussion, Ambassador Dzhagaryan expressed deep concern over the recent developments in the Middle East, particularly the escalating conflict involving Israel and Iran. His words resonated with a call for accountability, as he emphasized that \u201cthe primary responsibility for the current state of affairs rests with the United States.\u201d He pointed to the controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, which he believes has only intensified tensions and undermined Palestinian rights. \u201cWhen the U.S. endorsed actions against Palestinian rights, it exacerbated the situation,\u201d he stated, highlighting the detrimental impact of external interference on regional stability.",
    "Russia\u2019s position is clear: the resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be rooted in respect for international law and the rights of both peoples. \u201cThe use of military force is never a sustainable solution,\u201d he asserted, advocating for constructive dialogue as the only viable path forward. This commitment to diplomacy reflects Russia\u2019s longstanding approach to international conflicts, prioritising negotiation over confrontation.",
    "Dzhagaryan reiterated the need for a ceasefire and open negotiations, underscoring the importance of humanitarian concerns in addressing the violence that has plagued the region. \u201cWe must unite as an international community to address this situation with a focus on humanitarian concerns and a commitment to finding a just resolution,\u201d he urged, calling for collaborative efforts to break the cycle of violence that has persisted for far too long. His remarks encapsulate a vision of peace that transcends political divisions, advocating for a future where dialogue prevails over aggression and justice is sought for all parties involved.",
