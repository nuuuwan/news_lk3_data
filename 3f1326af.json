    "\u201cLooking beyond the present, we need a comprehensive national plan, inspired by Sir Jayathilaka\u2019s approach, to unite everyone for the country\u2019s future,\u201d he added.",

Notably, strong national figures like D.S. Senanayake and Sir Ernest Silva were nurtured in the influential environment of the Colombo YMBA.
