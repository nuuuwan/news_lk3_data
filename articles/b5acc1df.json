    "Several cities in the Southeast Asian nation including the capital, Jakarta, have been gripped by anti-government demonstrations in the past week that have at times led to clashes between protesters and police.",
    "While the protests have been fuelled by a wide range of issues - including the death of a ride-sharing driver - one core complaint concerns a new monthly allowance for lawmakers.",
    "President Prabowo Subianto announced on Sunday that several perks would be reined in, including the size of some allowances.",
    "The Indonesian leader - who has already had to cancel a trip to China over the unrest - said some demonstrations had gone beyond what was considered peaceful and may amount to \u201ctreason and terrorism\u201d.",
    "He added that he had ordered the police and armed forces to take strong action against looting and property damage.",
    "The home of Indonesia\u2019s finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati was among several targeted by looters on Sunday, news agency AFP reports.",
    "The protests have primarily centred on an increase of 50 million rupiah ($3,030; \u00a32,250) in parliamentarians\u2019 allowances - almost 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta.",
    "But they escalated after Affan Kurniawan, a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver, was run over by a police vehicle during a demonstration in the capital on Thursday.",
    "The incident inflamed tensions and prompted accusations that police were using excessive force to deal with protesters. Seven officers were found to have violated a professional ethics code and an investigation into the incident has been launched.",
    "Ride-hailing and delivery drivers in Indonesia have long argued that their pay and conditions are unfair. The death of one of their own brought shows of solidarity amongst their ranks.",

    "Rehayu Saraswati, a member of the ruling party in Indonesia, told the BBC the large-scale protests had come as \u201cquite a surprise\u201d.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us saw this coming,\u201d she told BBC Newshour. \u201cIt happened very, very quickly within a matter of days.\u201d",
    "Ms Rehayu Saraswati rejected protesters\u2019 suggestion that the government was being \u201ctone deaf\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe understand that the situation is difficult, and that the economy has been quite, I would say, challenging for some people,\u201d she said.",
    "The recently announced cuts to the parliamentary budget and allowances, she added, were \u201ca way to show that we are listening\u201d.",
    "Prabowo did not specify which lawmakers would have their allowances curtailed, but said a moratorium on overseas trips would also be imposed.",
    "However, the concessions to the protesters may not quell the widespread dissent.",
    "Muzammil Ihsan, head of the All Indonesian Students\u2019 Executives Body, the country\u2019s largest student group, told Reuters that the move was \u201cnot enough\u201d and that further demonstrations were being considered.",
