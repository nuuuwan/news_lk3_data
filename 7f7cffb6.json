    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 India's Supreme Court on Monday (31st) slammed the Manipur state police for its inaction in a large number of cases of horrendous violence against women, as the court began hearing a petition by several women who were paraded naked by a mob and gang-raped, Indian media reported.",
    "The Supreme Court intervened after a video of the horrific attack in which the women's village was burned down, went viral on social media. Manipur has for many months been wracked by sectarian violence between two distinct communities that has left hundreds dead and tens of thousands homeless.",
    "The court declared that the violence against women in the state of Manipur was of \"unprecedented magnitude\" and demanded that Manipur authorities provide details of an extraordinary 6,000 complaints of rape, murder, arson, and looting.",
    "\"We are dealing with something which is of unprecedented magnitude, namely crimes and perpetration of violence against women in a situation of communal and sectarian strife,\" Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said.",
    "The Chief Justice, who is heading the 3-judge bench, berated the Manipur police, the central government, and the state government, and ordered that the Manipur police should not be the investigating authority.",
    "The court noted that the women had been handed over to the mob by the police themselves, and queried why the police complaint (first incident report) of the May 4 incident had not been registered until 14 days later. Arrests were made only after the video went viral and the Supreme Court stepped in.",
    "The investigation has since been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), but the court questioned whether the Centre intended to transfer all 6,000 cases to the CBI and how the CBI would be able to cope with the sheer magnitude of the situation.",
