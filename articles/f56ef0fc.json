    "The Kalutara District Crimes Division yesterday uncovered a house in Mayurapura, Hambantota, allegedly used by underworld figures \u2018Kehelbaddara Padme\u2019 and \u2018Kudu Nilanga\u2019 to manufacture the drug \u2018Ice.\u2019",
    "Police said the search of the house uncovered 52 litres of chemicals suspected to be used in producing Ice. One room had been set up as a laboratory, containing four white iron cauldrons, six plastic buckets, and other equipment believed to be linked to narcotics production. A vehicle allegedly used to transport the drugs was also seized. Investigations show it is registered to an organised criminal residing overseas and had previously been in police custody before being released.",
    "Earlier this month, sleuths seized about 50,000kg of chemicals at a residence in Thalawa, Middeniya, suspected to be used for Ice production. Tests by the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board confirmed that 17 of 20 samples taken contained substances used to manufacture methamphetamine."
