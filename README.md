### IHP says General Election voting intent estimates uncertain due  to substantial response bias

*2024-11-14 02:58:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/IHP-says-General-Election-voting-intent-estimates-uncertain-due-to-substantial-response-bias/56-769254) · `en`

SLOTS polling of voter intent conducted by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) since the Presidential Election through 8 November has suffered from an increased level of response bias.

“This has been due to respondents’ over-reporting support for the NPP. This has resulted in large uncertainty and a significant bias in favour of the NPP in the resulting vote intent estimates,” said IHP in a statement.

“Nonetheless, we are releasing estimates based on these polling data in the interests of transparency. We advise that these estimates are likely to be associated with a large margin of error, and caution should be taken when interpreting them. As with any opinion poll, they should not be regarded as a prediction of the final election result,” it added.

The North Central Province Predecessor High Court Judge and incumbent Kuliyapitiya High Court Judge Manoj Thalgodapitiya has ordered the acquittal of two defendants indicted before the Anuradhapura High Court for a murder that took place in Rajanganaya 27 years ago.

The case, which dates back to 29 October 1997, was initially brought to the Anuradhapura High Court under Section 296 of the Sri Lanka Penal Code Ordinance by the Attorney General, accusing the two defendants of committing the offence within the Anuradhapura HC’s jurisdiction.

### Will the 2024 General elections redefine Sri Lanka’s political future?

This election is expected to be a defining moment for Sri Lanka, with outcomes that could significantly impact its political and economic trajectory in the coming years – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The upcoming General elections in Sri Lanka are pivotal, given the country’s complex political and economic landscape. Several key factors are shaping expectations for the outcome.

First, economic challenges remain a critical concern. Sri Lanka’s economic recovery from a severe debt crisis and inflation surge has been slow, with many citizens still experiencing financial hardship. This context has led to frustration with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as many view its policies as ineffective in alleviating economic pressures. This dissatisfaction may boost Opposition parties like the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National People’s Power (NPP), who have gained traction with promises of economic reforms and anti-corruption measures.

### Trump’s triumph: American Revolution/counter-revolution and world order

President Trump actually thought that Kamala Harris, a feminist progressive-liberal, was a “radical-leftist, Marxist, Socialist, Communist”.

The Trump administration and a Republican Senate are going to regard a JVP-NPP regime in the Indian Ocean headed by JVP leader Anura Dissanayake, pale-pink NPP frill, crony corporate décor and all, differently from the way a Democrat White House and Senate did.

The multidimensional triumph of Donald Trump is an outcome I hardly applaud, but as a political scientist and former diplomat, I cannot fail to note its magnitude, even epic character, and respect the political achievement.

Was it a counter-revolution or a revolution? Critics would argue the former; fans, the latter. It is like those two-dimensional pictures we had as postcards or key-tags when we were schoolkids. It all depends on which side you tilt it; which angle you view it from.

### What we should learn from Nehru

Now after so many years we have to shamefully admit that in this age of religious ostentation, hypocrisy, superstition and orthodox thinking where priests of all faiths are gaining influence and getting political patronage for opinions, there is now a deep gap between the Nehruvian understanding of scientific approach and its practical application and implementation in the Indian context. It has come a long way. But Nehru is as relevant today as he was then.

While today there is a deluge of superstitious clerics and leaders everywhere in the country, about seventy years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had foresightly emphasised that, ‘Politics led me to economics and it was from that that I was inspired by science and knowledge to adopt a scientific approach to problems and life. Only science can solve the problem of hunger and poverty. Science is the only medium that can eradicate hunger and poverty.’

A system change will be meaningless unless governance participation is taken to the people in an effective, practical way not just during elections but in between them as well – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In a society that has inequality and inequity, with many having no recourse to hold politicians responsible for the promises made, except believing promises by another set of politicians at the next election and believing them, and many ending up without opportunities for their advancement due to the failings of politicians, life does not change for them except going further downhill

Government has no wealth, and when a politician promises to give you something for nothing, he must first confiscate that wealth from you -- either by direct taxes, or by the cruelly indirect tax of inflation

Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s energy sector is expected to undergo significant changes, guided by social and economic reforms under the island nation’s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government. Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPP’s policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. ​

The main issue in Sri Lanka is the economy. 2022ஆம் ஆண்டு பொருளாதாரம் முற்றாக வீழ்ச்சியடைந்தது. Accordingly, it was announced that our country was bankrupt. We had the first to leave the bank. If we declare it alone, it is not enough. சர்வதேசத்தினால் ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளப்பட வேண்டும்.

The Sri Lanka Customs Trade Union Alliance says that the decision taken by the customs officers to only carry out the activities related to their respective duties has been temporarily suspended.

ECONOMYNEXT – Both local and foreign investments in Sri Lanka are likely to face shifts that reflect new priorities in economic and social reforms under President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government after the November 14 parliament polls. Here are five likely key impacts on investments:

The NPP is expected to introduce stricter regulations for sectors deemed strategic or essential, which could increase the complexity of doing business for both local and foreign investors, analysts say. Such moves are likely to help in curbing deep rooted corruption at the expense of some delays, they say. This could affect investment in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and utilities, where state influence may increase to ensure alignment with public needs and national priorities​.

### EXPLAINER: Possible policy impacts on Sri Lanka’s banking sector after parliament polls

*2024-11-13 15:08:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/explainer-possible-policy-impacts-on-sri-lankas-banking-sector-after-parliament-polls-187241/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Under Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government, Sri Lanka’s banking sector is likely to experience significant changes and challenges as it navigates policy shifts focused on economic redistribution, social reforms, and restructuring. Here are five potential impacts on the banking sector after the parliament polls, in which NPP is believed to have an edge:

The NPP has historically advocated for stronger state control over strategic economic sectors, including banking. Under Dissanayake, the sector may face increased regulation and scrutiny aimed at reducing perceived corruption, addressing financial mismanagement, and protecting consumer interests. This could lead to a more restrictive operational environment for banks, with potential impacts on profitability and compliance costs. ​

"Parents dispute suicide claim for son. Cite his helpful nature & love for life. Seek justice rather than accepting death as self-inflicted."

The death of two students of an international school in Colombo's luxury series has caused great controversy and many questions.

Although many claimed suicide, the parents of one of the students who died, Joro Singh's parents, have rejected it and have reported that there have been many misunderstandings.

They have shared their memories of Givon and have reported the events that caused him to die.

The attitude of Jivon, who helped others, was the cause of his death on July 2 at luxury.

Jivon tried to help someone who was in need of his help that day. It was his natural attitude.

However, due to his dedication to help others, we have decided to respond to the false information about his death.

Givon did not commit suicide, and his immense love for life and the attitude of thinking favorably were his characteristics, and we are trying to protect his memories and ensure that his character is understood.
