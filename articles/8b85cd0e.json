    "The Colombo High Court today (28) issued a notice to consider the revision petition filed by former Minister Rajitha Senaratne, seeking an order to suspend the arrest warrant issued by the Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court to take him into custody.",
    "Although Senaratne\u2019s legal team also requested an interim order to suspend the arrest warrant, the High Court did not issue such an order, stating instead that only notice has been issued to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), which is named as the respondent.",
