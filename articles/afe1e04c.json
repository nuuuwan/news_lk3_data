    "Residents in U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris\u2019 ancestral village in southern India were preparing to hold prayers on election day on Tuesday in a Hindu temple more than 8,000 miles (13,000 km) from Washington.",
    "Harris\u2019 maternal grandfather P.V. Gopalan was born more than a century ago in the leafy village of Thulasendrapuram in what is now southern India\u2019s Tamil Nadu state.",
    "\u201cThere will be a special prayer on Tuesday morning at the temple,\u201d G. Manikandan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said. \u201cCelebrations will follow if she wins.\u201d",
    "At the temple, Harris\u2019 name is engraved into a stone that lists public donations, along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes \u201cthe daughter of the land\u201d success in the election.",
    "Gopalan and his family migrated a few hundred miles to the coastal city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu\u2019s capital, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement.",
    "The village received global attention four years ago, when its residents prayed for victory for Harris\u2019 Democratic Party in 2020 before celebrating her inauguration as U.S. Vice President by setting off firecrackers and distributing food.",
    "Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump were scrambling to get supporters to the polls in an historically close contest, which means it could take days for the winner to emerge."
