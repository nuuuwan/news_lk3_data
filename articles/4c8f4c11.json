    "In 2007, my late friend, Jackson Anthony, and his younger son visited us in Auckland during their trip to New Zealand, I recall that he talked about the Aba script during that period. We organised a small gathering for our friends who admire his talents. Amidst casual conversations, Jackson, well-versed in both Catholicism and Sinhala Buddhist culture, interpreted Bhakthiya as Bhaya (Fear) and Sraddha as Achala Vishvaasaya (Unwavering Confidence). It was a delightful mix of cultural insights, shared stories, and music, emphasizing the richness of diverse perspectives.",
    "Last Sunday, around 10 AM near SLIIT Malabe, there was a pirith chanting ceremony. Upon inquiry, I was informed that individuals were cutting a branch from a sacred Bo tree. They believe that chanting pirith would dispel any negative consequences associated with cutting the sacred Bo tree. Do people live in fear of unseen forces?",
    "Cricket legends, especially in this region, like Sanath Jayasuriya, display gratitude to unseen forces by gazing at the sky every time they achieve a milestone. Belief in a higher power has long influenced human culture, including sports. But does this faith hinder the development of skills and talents, and moreover, does blind faith derail the path to prosperity for individuals and nations alike?",
    "Many people, especially politicians, seeking protection and prosperity, wear not only wristbands but also ankle bands in multiple colours, often associated with spiritual agents like Gnanakka of Anuradhapura, and even aiming at a blissful rebirth. Do these people lack self-confidence?",
    "Faith, a powerful motivator, often drives people to see their abilities as gifts for a greater purpose. However, when faith turns into blind faith, it can impede personal growth. In some sports cultures, sportspeople may believe success solely depends on divine intervention, leading to complacency and a lack of dedication to training. Blind faith may also lead to resistance against adopting proven training methods and certain foods etc., preventing people from realising their full potential.",
    "Contrarily, confidence, as defined by psychologist, Albert Bandura, in his social cognitive theory, is the belief in one\u2019s ability to perform a specific task successfully. Bandura\u2019s research emphasizes the role of self-efficacy in shaping behavior and achieving goals. Confidence is closely linked to skills and talents, as individuals who recognize their abilities are more likely to pursue challenges and persist in the face of obstacles.",
    "The interplay between faith, skills, talents, and confidence is dynamic and complex. Faith can serve as a motivating force, inspiring individuals to cultivate and apply their skills and talents with confidence. However, blind faith may lead to misplaced trust and hinder the development of critical thinking skills. Conversely, skills and talents can bolster confidence, enabling individuals to approach challenges with a positive mindset. There is a paradoxical relationship between faith, and the development of skills and talents.",
    "However, a subtle shift occurs when faith transforms into blind faith, characterised by unquestioning belief without critical evaluation.This blind adherence to divine intervention can potentially undermine the cultivation of skills and talents, creating a dependency on external forces rather than personal development.",
    "Attributing success solely to faith among people may diminish the importance of hard work, perseverance, and honed skills. This reliance on divine intervention risks overlooking personal agency and the continuous need for skill development. Striking a balance between faith and personal responsibility is crucial while prioritizing confidence. Faith can inspire and provide resilience, but it should complement, not replace, deliberate efforts to enhance skills. While faith motivates, blind faith risks creating a passive reliance on divine intervention, hindering the necessary training and effort for skill development.",
    "The relationship between religious beliefs and economic development has been a subject of scholarly inquiry, with contrasting perspectives on how extreme religious beliefs may influence productivity and economic progress.",
    "It is crucial to note that not all religious societies exhibit the same characteristics, and there are instances where religious values contribute positively to societal development. For instance, Max Weber\u2019s seminal work, \u201cThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\u201d explores the relationship between Protestantism and the rise of capitalism in Western societies. Weber argues that certain Protestant values, such as the \u201cProtestant work ethic,\u201d played a role in promoting hard work, discipline, and economic development.",
    "Moreover, especially in homogeneous societies, studies have shown that a sense of community and shared values, often fostered by religious beliefs, can positively impact social cohesion and stability. Societies with strong communal ties may experience greater trust among members, potentially leading to collaborative efforts that promote economic growth.",
    "However, strict adherence to religious doctrines may impede societal freedoms, hindering creativity and innovation. Societies that prioritise conformity over individual expression may struggle to foster an environment conducive to the free exchange of ideas and the pursuit of unconventional paths. For instance, theocratic regimes like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan etc., have faced criticism for limiting artistic expression, which can stifle cultural innovation and creative industries.",
    "Similarly, heightened patriotism or ultra nationalism (as in Sri Lanka) can become a barrier to inclusivity in diverse societies, especially when minority groups are marginalized. In 2019, we observed severe consequences when the fervor to change the regime, fuelled by intense emotions, resulted in the rallying cry of \u201cinna ratak\u201d (the need for a country).",
    "In contrast, more liberal nations tend to exhibit greater economic flexibility, fostering environments that encourage innovation, diversity, and international collaboration. Many advanced economies are known for their progressive approach to social issues, including religious freedom. This has contributed to a diverse and inclusive society, promoting innovation and economic development.",
    "Many advanced economies, with their secular governance and emphasis on individual freedoms, have been successful in balancing social values with economic development. These models combine a robust social welfare system with a thriving knowledge-based economy, contributing to high levels of innovation and productivity.",
    "In conclusion, the potential hindrance to productivity and economic growth and blind faith or extreme religious adherence requires careful consideration, recognising the diverse nature of societies. The multifaceted relationship between religion and societal development necessitates nuanced understanding, accounting for factors like the interpretation of religious doctrines, historical circumstances, and cultural diversity within a country. Critical engagement with these nuances is essential to minimize the impact of blind faith on economic aspects.",
    "Similarly, navigating the complexities of human existence involves understanding the intricate relationships among faith, skills, talents, and confidence. Cultivating a balanced approach that integrates faith with critical thinking, skills with humility, and confidence with self-awareness contributes to personal growth and meaningful achievements. Recognising the power of belief, the importance of evidence-based reasoning, and the value of honing unique skills and talents fosters a confident and resilient approach to life. This balanced approach is also crucial in many activities, where blind faith may lead to complacency and hinder skill development. Striking a balance between confidence (rather than faith) and personal responsibility is key, ensuring that any kind of belief enhances, rather than hinders, skills and potential.",
