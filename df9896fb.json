    "Entering wildlife and forest conservation reserves located in the Nuwara Eliya district, climbing the mountains located in those reserves, and camping in those mountains are strictly prohibited, as of yesterday (4), Nuwara Eliya District Secretary Nandana Galabada said.",
    "He said the decision was taken following the discovery of the unidentified body of a woman who had died mysteriously on top of the Great Western Mountains in Talawakele.",
    "A special discussion was held in this regard at the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat with wildlife officers and officers of the Forest Conservation Department.",
    "Since yesterday, if anyone wants to visit or climb any mountain in the Nuwara Eliya district, they need to obtain approval from the government agencies within whose purview the particular mountain areas come under. People must submit approval to the nearest police station and obtain permission from them to visit the relevant places.",
    "At the end of the trip, if they are unable to come to the police station to report that their tour was completed safe and sound, they can call the police again, he said.",
    "However, notification of the end of the trip should be done. Legal action will be taken against individuals and groups who enter forest conservation areas for climbing or camping without valid permission, Nandana Galabada said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
