    "Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Special Investigation Unit of the Police Headquarters has launched an investigation into students being dressed in uniforms resembling the jungle camouflage uniforms used by the Police Special Task Force (STF) during a sports event at a leading school in Gampaha.",
    "Police said the probe was launched following orders from the Inspector General of Police due to concerns that police officers responsible for overseeing the police cadets were aware of the incident but took no preventive action.",
    "In addition, the investigation will address the lack of proper permission for the uniforms.",
    "Police said that disciplinary action will be taken against any officers found to have acted improperly.",
