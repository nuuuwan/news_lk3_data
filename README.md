### In Defence Of The Diaspora: Why Sri Lanka Should Embrace Expat Voting

*2025-09-27 16:58:03* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/in-defence-of-the-diaspora-why-sri-lanka-should-embrace-expat-voting/) · `en`

The proposal to grant digital voting rights to Sri Lankan expatriates has provoked fierce opposition from some quarters. In “South Asian Spring: Why Expats Should Not Get Digital Vote in Sri Lanka” the author argues that enfranchising expats is a threat to sovereignty, opens the door to external interference, and undermines the integrity of domestic governance. While these are serious concerns in principle, a closer look reveals that many of them rest upon dubious assumptions, selective history, and fear of change rather than evidence. Below, while contesting the major claims by the author, it will be shown that extending voting rights abroad is not only defensible but aligns with democratic norms worldwide.

The author claims: Granting expats voting rights is a gamble with sovereignty, giving the ballot to people who do not live under Sri Lankan laws, do not face its burdens, and do not pay its taxes.
