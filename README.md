Sri Lanka’s economy grew 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2025, higher than projected by most agencies, as the central bank missed its inflation target of 5 percent.

### Car bomb kills 10 in Pakistan after militants trigger shootout with troops

A powerful car bomb killed 10 people in Pakistan after exploding outside the paramilitary security forces’ headquarters.

Before detonating their vehicle in the southwestern city of Quetta, six attackers who were inside the car stepped outside and engaged troops in an intense shootout, police said.

People living in the area said the blast was so powerful it was heard from miles away.

Dozens were also wounded and taken to hospital after ambulances rushed to the site in front of the Frontier Constabulary.

No group immediately claimed responsibility, though suspicion will fall on separatist groups that often target civilians and security forces in insurgency-plagued Balochistan, where Quetta is the provincial capital.

Provincial health minister Bakhat Kakar said there were fears the number of people killed could rise.

Local television channels and CCTV footage from the site of the explosion shows a car stopping in front of the gate of the paramilitary compound.
