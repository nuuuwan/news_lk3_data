The agreement with the IMF on debt restructuring is not going to end the presidential election until the presidential election is over. This is because the debt does not need to pay until the debt is not reorganized.

The government that has made the country the country cannot build the economy of the country.

He said this while addressing the adjournment of the House in Parliament on Wednesday (22).

The President recently said that the government has passed 75 new laws during this period.

It is true. But even if the laws are allowed, they are not properly implemented. Over the past few years, the law has been established only for the government. The current chief justice king has filed 42 cases during the Good Governance. But the Gotabhaya government did not know what happened to the cases after the arrival of the government.
