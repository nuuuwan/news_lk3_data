    "Colombo School of Arts and Sciences (CSAS) recently concluded a panel discussion and a parental workshop on teenage mental health. With the growing concerns surrounding teenage mental health, CSAS took the initiative to organise both a panel discussion and workshop for parents of teenagers, to educate them on the challenges faced by their children.",
    "As per the World Health Organization\u2019s newest statistics, it is estimated that 4.4% of 10\u201314-year-olds and 5.5% of 15\u201319-year-olds experience an anxiety disorder. Global estimates also show that depression is estimated to occur among 1.4% of adolescents aged 10\u201314 years, and 3.5% of 15\u201319-year-olds \u2013 alarming numbers that further stress the need for both an academic and practical discourse surrounding the changes and stresses of adolescence. By clearing doubts, addressing taboos, and debunking myths, the panel discussion and subsequent workshop incited fruitful discussions among parents, enhancing their knowledge of how they can face novel circumstances in a society that is constantly evolving at a rapid pace.",
    "The panel discussion, named \u201cWeathering the Storm,\u201d was held on 1 November, and addressed topics such as adolescent depression and suicidal thoughts, hormonal changes, peer pressure, parenting and education. The panellists for the discussion were Colombo North Teaching Hospital Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Senior Registrar Dr. Prabha Vidyatilake, University of Colombo Faculty of Medicine Department of Medical Humanities Head Dr. Santushi Amarasuriya, Lanka Lifeline Chief Operating Officer Ranil Thilakaratne, and CSAS International School Principal Shaleeka Jayalath.",
    "The discussion was also moderated by Corporate Trainer and Life Coach Dinali Dandeniya. The session primarily revolved around topics such as,",
    "Recognising early signs of depression in teenagers that parents and teachers should be aware of Steps families should take when they suspect that a young person is struggling with depression and or suicidal thoughts Common triggers of stress for teenagers today, especially in the digital age, and how they differ from past generations How biological or hormonal changes intersect with environmental factors (home and school life), and Specific policies or programs that could be implemented in schools to raise awareness and provide support around teenage mental health",
    "The panel discussion was attended by both parents and industry professionals who wished to gain insight into a timely and expanding discourse. The full session is now available for viewing on the CSAS Facebook page for all interested parties.",
    "The session proved to be a success, with one participant commenting, \u201cThe program itself brought out hardcore facts and emotions in a very candid, transparent manner\u2026Parenting is an effort that can bring out great rewards if the information brought out by the program could really be put into practice. We actually need programmes like this.\u201d",
    "CSAS also organised a follow-up session titled \u201cShifting the Tide,\u201d which took a more hands-on approach with the active participation of parents to discuss the issues they face in bringing up their children. Held on 19 November and conducted by Shaleeka Jayalath, Ranil Thilakaratne and Dinali Dandeniya as the key facilitators, the workshop explored how parents can connect with their child, recognise anxiety in a child while also safeguarding the mental wellbeing of parents. The program further provided parents with practical tips to open and explore lines of communications with teenagers which are often closed off due to generational differences and various family dynamics that come into play with the changing social trends.",
    "Furthermore, CSAS International School plans to hold a workshop specially catered to teenagers and we are happy to announce that plans are underway for the event to take place in January 2025. If you would like to stay informed about future events regarding teenage mental health at CSAS, call 077 430 3204."
