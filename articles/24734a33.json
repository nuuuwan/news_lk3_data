    "The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) says its daily revenue has gone up by approximately Rs. 25 million owing to the special bus service set in place for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.",
    "Since 5 April, the SLTB has been deploying at least 200 additional buses to facilitate the people who are returning to their hometowns for the festive period.",
    "As a result, the state-owned bus service provider\u2019s daily income saw an increase to the tune of Rs. 25 million over the past few days, according to SLTB Deputy General Manager Panduka Swarnahansa.",
    "However, the commuters complained that they were inconvenienced due to the inadequate number of long-distance buses in operation to accommodate the high volume of passengers.",
    "Meanwhile, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said the income generated by the expressways has gone up by at least 10% during the festive season, adding that it is expected to further increase in the coming days until 15 April."
