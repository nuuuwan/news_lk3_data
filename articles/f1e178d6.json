    "It may have been in 1983 that Dilhan introduced me to Nissanka Wimalasuriya. My friend Herman Gunaratne has devoted an entire book \u2014 \u2018God\u2019s Secret Agent\u2019 \u2014 to his association with Nissanka and the many extraordinary incidents involving him. What I was told was that Nissanka had a unique link with the Almighty, that he would pray to God seeking intervention in the lives of distressed people, and that such prayers were answered favourably. At first I did not believe this, but having prayed with him and personally experiencing the results of such prayer, I finally became convinced that Nissanka was indeed a man with a special gift or spiritual power.",
    "One morning Dilhan and Serena walked into my house, in deep distress, and said that Nissanka had predicted that within the next three months, I would have a heart attack which could prove fatal. Understandably, I was quite shaken by this news. A few days later I contracted a high fever and was admitted at the Durdans Hospital, where I was diagnosed with dengue. Whilst in hospital I became unconscious after a severe haemorrhage and stopped breathing. My doctor, Hemal Fernando, who was in attendance, had called Malik and Kimarli in and told them: \u201cWe have lost Merrill.\u201d However, miraculously, a few minutes later my heart revived.",
    "The next morning I had a whole host of visitors, whom I saw one by one. My very good friends, the Esufallys and Nordi and his wife Shirrin were among the first to arrive. I returned home a few days later, but was back again in hospital within a few weeks with an attack of chikungunya. Soon after I recovered from that illness, as Nissanka had predicted, I did suffer a heart attack and was rushed to hospital.",
    "After what seemed a quick recovery, I suffered two more heart attacks in quick succession.",
    "I was then flown to Singapore and admitted to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, where I was examined by Dr. Sivanathan, a brilliant heart surgeon, and Prof. Maurice Cho; both recommended open heart surgery. An angiogram done by the latter revealed seven arterial blockages. Dilhan and Serena, who were present, were advised accordingly.",
    "However, I was adamant that there should be no surgery and, consequently, I was first fitted with three stents and three more soon, thereafter. During these distressing times Nissanka and my children prayed for me constantly. In the background of all these episodes, I realized that I had to take Nissanka seriously.",
    "Nissanka suddenly passed away, in 2014, in Boston, USA, while visiting his friend Tony Weerasinghe. His unexpected death was great loss to the community that he frequently assisted and, to me a personal loss, but I believe that it was what the Lord ordained for favoured son.",
    "In 1988, whilst on a business trip to New Zealand, I visited m urologist. On investigation he opined that I may have a growth in m bladder and recommended more intensive evaluation, either in UK or in Singapore, on my way back to Sri Lanka. On my return I prayed together with Nissanka and, thereafter traveled with him to South India and met Pastor D. G. S. Dhinakarar After prayer he advised that I should seek treatment in Singapore traveling there with Nissanka.",
    "I consulted Professor Kesava Esuvaranathan in Singapore, who removed a nodule in my bladder. He also advised me that I should undergo medical examinations at three month intervals. Some months later, whilst in London on a long stay on the advice of my friend Dr. Daya, I underwent emergency surgery for the same problem. My surgeon also advised Dr. Kesavan about the process and the latter requested me to see him as soon as possible.",
    "Soon afterwards I visited Singapore, accompanied by Dilhan, Serena, my grandson Amrit, and Nissanka, and met Dr. Kesavan at the New University Hospital. He went through my reports and told me not to worry, that he would decide on the course of treatment and that God would see me through. We rented a two-bedroom apartment in Singapore and over a four-week period I underwent treatment under Dr. Kesavan\u2019s personal supervision.",
    "In another instance, again under Dr. Kesavan\u2019s hand, I underwent exploratory surgery and he was able to reassure me that everything fine with me. The good doctor relied on medical science, which was reinforced by my abiding faith in God.",
    "The invocation of evil forces to harm one\u2019s adversaries is a practice as old as man himself. The associated practices go back to the dawn of mankind. That is understandable as such practices are to be expected from primitive societies. What is unacceptable and inconceivable is that in this day and age, when mankind is obviously more enlightened and educated, such evil acts should still be practiced.",
    "Much of this type of vengeful activity consists of burying \u2018charms\u2019 and other similar objects in the intended victim\u2019s business premises or home.",
    "In fact, my friend Nissanka, with the special gift he possessed, was able to identify and unearth many such objects \u2014 copper scrolls inscribed with invocations against me for instance \u2014 from both my office and home garden. These objects were specifically designed to harm me personally and my business as well. I honestly could not understand why any person would go to such extents to try and harm me. Frankly, I was also deeply distressed by the obviously evil intent as, in my entire life, I have never intentionally tried to harm any person.",
    "Pastor Colton would visit me in office once a month and pray with me in my office. I was both appreciative of and grateful for his caring, as I could perceive the benefits of these interventions. We also have a monthly prayer meeting in office to which a renowned pastor is invited, along with any employee who wishes to attend, irrespective of religious belief.",
    "Pastor Samson Christy, whom I first met at one of the commemorations of Nissanka\u2019s death, is another man of God who has been a source of great support and comfort to me. He visits me frequently and we have prayed together. His interventions in critical moments in my life have convinced me that he has been guided by the Lord to help me. On one occasion he was scheduled to fly to Manila, Philippines, to preach to a congregation in that country but, on an unexplained impulse, had cancelled the trip on the very day he was due to leave. The very next day I was rushed to hospital with a serious illness and Pastor Samson was at hand to pray for me and help me recover.",
    "Between May and September 2021, I suffered two serious strokes, severe enough to have completely debilitated me. However, expert medical attention, the power of prayer, and my own will enabled me to recover, so that I was able, except when absolutely essential, to dispense with the wheelchair that was recommended. It was also fortuitous that I had installed an elevator in my house in April of the same year, enabling me to avoid using the staircase leading from the living area to my bedroom and study upstairs.",
    "On January 6, 2009, we celebrated the 21st anniversary of the `Dilmah\u2019 brand, my 60 years in the tea industry, and my 80th birthday, with a dedication to the Lord. It was symbolized by a 21 ft. granite tower placed at the main entrance to the Peliyagoda office, bearing the inscription, \u201cJESUS is the Head of Dilmah and the unseen driving force which has inspired our staff to achieve success, which seemed beyond the reach of ordinary men and women\u201d. With that declaration, I dedicated my entire enterprise to the Lord I worshiped.",
    "My belief in the Lord is what has shepherded me throughout my entire life. My faith has always reinforced my decisions and supported me in times of stress and trial. My prayers have always been answered and in this late stage of my life I feel a greater connection to that force than ever before. Looking back on what I have achieved, and the benefits arising from my business success, which have also cascaded to the less fortunate, I am blessed in the belief that I have been chosen. It is a message between me and the Lord I worship.",
