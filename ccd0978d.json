  "original_title": "Online Safety Bill & Anti-Terror Bill \u2013\u00a0 Law Making To End Democracy & Fundamental Rights Of Sri Lankan Citizens",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government has included two Bills titled \u2018The Online Safety Act\u2019 (OSA) and the \u2018Anti-Terror Act\u2019 (ATA) in the Parliamentary Order Paper dated 3rd October 2023. Both Bills have sweeping provisions to seriously. curtail and even violate the freedoms of expression, free speech, right to information, assembly and association. Both present fatal threats to democracy and fundamental rights in this country.",
    "The OSA proposes to create an \u2018Online Safety Commission\u2019 appointed by the President and dismissed at his will and pleasure, which is given sweeping powers to determine if a statement is a \u2018false statement\u2019 and take measures to \u2018prohibit\u2019 it from circulation. The Commission has powers to issue directives to persons and online service providers to remove or block content, sites and locations. If its directives are not complied with, penal sanctions including prison sentences and fines can be imposed. The OSA will embed a culture of state harassment of online journalists and activists, artists, scholars, writers, Trade Unions Civil Society Organisations, including Women\u2019s Groups, Human Rights defenders, professional organisations, and any citizen who dares to criticize government and disagree with its policies and governance. Not only the Fundamental Rights of speech, expression and access to information, but the right to claim them through the connected rights of freedom of protest and association will be curtailed and destroyed by the State. The inevitable self-censorship of citizens and communities that can follow, will embed authoritarian and dictatorial\u00a0governance that has no respect for the Sovereignty of the Sri Lankan people that is a foundational value in our Constitution. The lack of accountability and corruption in governance that we see today will become a permanent aspect of governance. The impact on\u00a0the life of a Sri Lankan citizen and another generation will be far reaching and hard to reverse.\u00a0This will complete Sri Lanka\u2019s transformation into a complete Orwellian State where what the \u2018truth\u2019 is will be determined and imposed exclusively by the State.",
    "The ATA will be a reinvention of the\u00a0of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which it claims to repeal. Under the ATA the definition of what comprises \u2018terrorism\u2019 is so vast and vague that any act can become an act of terror if the State deems it so. Any protest or strike can become an act of terror. Any instance of free speech can be deemed as inciting \u2018terrorism\u2019. Any organisation can be proscribed as a \u2018terrorist\u2019 association. Any publication can be deemed a \u2018terrorist\u2019 publication. Anyone associated with \u2018terrorist\u2019 suspects, by virtue of association and knowledge, can be punished. Detentions will be made through executive orders and the military has been given powers to arrest and detain, powers which it did not have even under the PTA. The ATA will create a permanent state of emergency where Sri Lanka will effectively become a military state functioning under the exclusive dictate of the Executive. Repealing\u00a0the PTA has been a promise\u00a0made to the nation and the global\u00a0community of nations represented\u00a0at the United Nations. What this bill does however is to increase the power of the State to repress citizens\u00a0 \u00a0and deny the Constitutionally guaranteed Fundamental Rights of the People.",
    "The proposed laws are a clear indication that the government fears that its indifference to the grave\u00a0hardships\u00a0of the people in this economic crisis will not be tolerated, and will be resisted. The Citizens\u00a0of this country were not responsible\u00a0for this man made crisis. Instead of taking the responsibility for the crisis, the government is making use of debt restructuring to make laws that encourage governance that is not accountable to the people and tries to legalise misuse of state power. Under the guise of domestic debt restructuring savings of the working people are being stolen. Under the guise of labour law reforms proposals are being pushed to bring an end to the right to unionise and exploit women\u2019s labour. Women\u2019s groups and activists\u00a0have made an important contribution to ensuring that our laws and policies on women\u2019s work conform to international ILO and other standards, and our Constitution. The proposed labour laws target women disproportionately, and will eliminate all these gains, embedding and\u00a0encouraging exploitation of their labour. Even criticism of the transformation\u00a0will be prevented by these repressive laws.",
    "We are still suffering the impact of repressive laws of the past, enacted in the name of national defence, stability, economic growth\u00a0and development. What Government\u00a0needs to do, is to learn from the past and engage in enlightened law making. That agenda must repeal repressive laws and respond\u00a0to embedded corruption, foster national unity and equitable\u00a0economic growth that benefits all citizens in our plural society. The government\u2019s intention in passing laws that\u00a0violate the basic values of democratic\u00a0governance\u00a0in our Constitution, shows that they want\u00a0to\u00a0change course, and establish a political dictatorship. The pretext is\u00a0debt restructuring and economic recovery from bankruptcy.",
    "We as Women\u2019s groups and other Civil Society groups and concerned\u00a0citizens call upon the government\u00a0to withdraw ALL these Bills from Parliament. Government must engage\u00a0in a\u00a0 \u00a0process of consultative law making, that we saw when the Right to Information Bill was passed. That law has received praise for strengthening accountable governance in local and international\u00a0reviews of governance\u00a0in our country. MPs, whether\u00a0or not they are unelected by the people, and come to Parliament\u00a0from a national list, take an oath of office that must respect the responsibilities of office under the basic law of our country the Constitution. According to the Preamble to that document THEIR DUTY\u00a0 IS:",
    "\u201c\u00a0to humbly acknowledge (their) obligation to ratify the immutable republican principle of representative democracy, assuring to all people Freedom Equality Justice Fundamental Human Rights and the Independence of the judiciary\u201d.(PREAMBLE Constitution 1978)",
    "We call upon the govt to\u00a0WITHDRAW ALL\u00a0these bills, and engage\u00a0in a public conversation with qualified\u00a0persons and citizens on public policy in these important areas. We call upon ALL Members of Parliament\u00a0to fulfill the above stated Constitutional mandate and\u00a0VOTE AGAINST these repressive laws.",
