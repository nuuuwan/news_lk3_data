    "This order has been issued by a judge bench consisting of the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Sasi Mahendran, while considering a petition submitted by the Centre for Environmental Justice.",
    "During the case was taken up today, Attorney-at-Law Ravindranath Dabare, appearing on behalf of the petitioning party, informed the court that a certain group is engaging in deforestation in a section of the Bogahapalassa Forest Reserve while claiming that it belongs to the Soragune Devalaya in Kataragama.",
