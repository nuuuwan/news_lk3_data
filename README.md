Dr. Ramadan Paris said the Palestinian people did not carry out this war with confidence in any leader or officer.

He said that this is much greater than Yahya Sinwar, the destruction war and the issue against the Palestinian people.

Israel is not just destroying us, he wants to destroy the entire Middle East.

I do not think that Sinwar's death will affect Hamas.

### CEB clarified about fueling thermal power plants

*2024-10-18 15:32:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202314) · `si`

Here's a 200-character summary:



CEB clarifies fuel supply for thermal power plants. Uses HFO (5.8%), naphtha (1.9%), diesel (1.1%) for electricity generation. Diesel purchase via CPC at fixed price due to lack of competitive bids. CEB considers diesel uneconomical but uses temporarily to meet demand until other power plants restored.

🟩

The Ceylon Electricity Board has issued a special announcement on supplying fuel to thermal power plants.

It states that some recent newsletters are expected to explain the word 'fuel'.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (Ceylon Electricity Board) is also used to generate three types of fuel to generate electricity.

* Receipt oil (HFO) - 715.3 GWh (5.8% of total electricity production) in 2024

* Napatha (Naphatha) - 235.5 GWH (1.9% of the total electric production) in 2024

* Diesel (Diesel) - 133.1 GWH (1.1% of total electric production) in 2024

Both credits (HFO) and Naupta (Naphatha) are bypace on the oil refinery.

Since there is no other supplier, the Ceylon Electricity Board is purchased by CPC from an anciently agreed price.

Competitive bidding is diesel, and some of them have recently commenced their business for diesel.

However, even under the management of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Diesel has not purchased competitive bids for electricity generation.

The Secretary of the association Anura Marasinghe stated that it costs less than Rs. 25 to produce an egg, making it feasible to sell them at a price of Rs. 35 per egg.

“The issue of escalating egg prices remains unresolved, with current market rates ranging from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 per egg. We urge the government to appoint a committee and establish a transparent pricing formula,” Mr. Marasinghe said.

He further noted that the actual production cost of an egg is between Rs. 20 and Rs. 23, while farm-gate prices currently stand at around Rs. 30.

The association believes a pricing mechanism would benefit both producers and consumers, ensuring fair pricing across the board.

### Kenya’s deputy president sacked while in hospital

*2024-10-18 08:54:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102771/kenyas-deputy-president-sacked-while-in-hospital) · `en`

Kenyan senators have voted to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office despite his failure to testify at his impeachment trial after his lawyer said he had been taken to hospital.

In one of the most dramatic days in Kenya’s recent political history, Gachagua had been due to appear in the Senate after lunch to defend himself, a day after he had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges.

However, Gachagua, popularly known as Riggy G, did not show up and his lawyer requested a postponement saying his client was suffering from chest pains and was being treated by doctors at The Karen Hospital.

Senators chose to continue the trial without him, prompting the defence team to leave the chamber.

The senators’ refusal to delay proceedings until Saturday - as long as would have been legally allowed - shows how determined they were to get rid of Gachagua, several months after he fell out with President William Ruto.
