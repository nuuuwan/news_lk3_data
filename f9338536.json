    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Protests against the controversial Sri Lanka Electricity Bill entered their second day today, as concerns about the proposed restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) continue to simmer.",
    "The bill, which seeks to divide the CEB into six separate entities and register them under the Companies Act, has drawn fierce opposition from trade unions and employees who fear it paves the way for privatization.",
    "Demonstrations centered around the CEB's main office in Colombo Fort have drawn crowds of employees, chanting slogans and voicing anxieties about the proposed reforms.",
    "They raise concerns that splitting the CEB weakens its national service mandate and opens the door for piecemeal privatization.",
    "Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera's recent statement threatening disciplinary action against any employee obstructing CEB services or violating management guidelines was met with further dissent.",
    "The Minister confirmed that the proposed reforms, including amendments, have been submitted to Parliament for approval.",
    "The Acting General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had also issued a circular cancelling all leave for CEB workers until further notice."
