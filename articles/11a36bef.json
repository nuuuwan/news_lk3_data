    "A gazette notification is scheduled to be issued soon, making it mandatory for all passengers travelling in expressways buses to wear seat belts, according to a report we publish today. This is something long overdue, given the sheer number of accidents on expressways. Seat belts are known to prevent deaths, and serious injuries including permanent disabilities. Some bus drivers initially protested against the seat belt law, but they have come to terms with reality; non-compliance results in fines.",
    "Minister of Transport, etc., Bimal Rathnayake has said seat belt prices have more than doubled in the local market in view of the new law; he has urged the Consumer Affairs Authority to look into the matter. It is only natural that when the demand for a particular product increases, its price soars. A state intervention is therefore called for. The government should seriously consider importing seatbelts through a state institution to make their prices competitive and prevent some unscrupulous businesses from making a killing at the expense of vehicle owners.",
    "While action being taken to ensure that everyone belts up is welcome, there are other measures that should be adopted to make roads safe and save lives. Road fatalities average seven or eight a day. More than 2,500 lives are lost in road accidents annually. A World Bank report has revealed that the annual crash deaths per capita in Sri Lanka are twice the average rate in high-income countries and five times that of the best performing countries in the world! Sri Lanka reportedly has the worst road fatality rate among its immediate neighbours in the South Asia region.",
    "Drug addiction is believed to be prevalent among heavy vehicle drivers, and this may explain their recklessness, which causes most fatalities. No room should be left for fatigue to be cited in extenuation of causing or failing to prevent accidents. Those who do not feel fit enough to drive should stay at home and rest, without endangering their own lives and those of others.",
    "According to unconfirmed reports, the driver of the tipper truck that crashed into a school van killing three persons including two children, in Kuliyapitiya, the other day, had fallen asleep at the wheel. He had reportedly been working for long hours without a break. The same is true of most commercial drivers. Accidents of that nature are common in this country.",
    "As for sleep-related road mishaps, which have become a significant concern, there is a need for more rest areas along the expressways and other roads. As we pointed out in a previous comment, gadgets and technologies are available to monitor drivers\u2019 eye movements and facial expressions, detect signs of drowsiness and fatigue and give warnings. There are also steering wheel sensors to detect drowsiness of drivers. Modern vehicles come fitted with them, and some drowsiness detection systems can be retrofitted to older vehicles to help save lives.",
    "Making such technologies available at affordable prices should be part of any road safety programme. As for drivers\u2019 drug addition, the need for roadside drug tests cannot be overstated. Facilities are currently available only for testing drivers for drunk driving. Heavy vehicle drivers are required to undergo mandatory drug testing only when their driving licences are renewed\u2013\u2013that too not in well-equipped laboratories. Heavy vehicle driving licences are valid for four years, and during that period, the holders thereof must be tested for drugs at least twice a year.",
    "Vehicles are tested for emissions once a year, and therefore it defies comprehension why the heavy vehicle drivers should not be tested for drugs every six months. Drug testing facilities can be made available at state-run hospitals for the convenience of the heavy vehicle drivers.",
