### Memories of the past of the photos!

*2024-08-19 16:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191440) · `ta`

Photos capture moments, immortalizing them for future generations. They remind us of growth and change over time, celebrating milestones like birthdays. Poet Vairamuthu's verse, "Don't carry old age, run as a child," resonates with us when viewing old photos, evoking both joyous and poignant memories. Photography, beyond being a mere hobby, is an art form that conveys photographers' talents and ideas. Its evolution, from the Daguerreotype Process in the 19th century to modern digital cameras, reflects humanity's fascination with capturing reality. Today, photography continues to play a crucial role in documenting our world, from personal snapshots to historical images like the iconic "Tank Man" photo. Recognizing the impact of photography, World Photo Day serves as a reminder of its power to convey stories and emotions, making it a vital part of our cultural heritage.

🟩

Photos are the ones that we live in and live in this world forever!

The indirect meaning that we celebrate birthdays is that one year has increased in our lives. The photos taken during the passing of years have been reminiscent of the time they have passed and keep us young.

When we look at those photos in the present, we have a refreshing thing that we will go for that time!

Poet Vairamuthu's concept poetry is "Do not carry out the old age, and run the child ..". When we look at our old photos, these lines are the ones that tap our minds. They are the treasures of the time that bring the happy moments and tragic events in our lives.

Photo is not a movie alone. It is a classic art that expresses the talent of photographers.

It is their artistic art for the famous photographers to express many ideas at the same time.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Louis Daguerre and Joseph Nicephore Niepee designed the operational method of the photo known as "Daguerreotype Process".
