*2025-10-01 17:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226616) · `ta`

கொழும்பு நீச்சல் கழகத்திற்கு  (Colombo Swimming Club) எதிராக, கொழும்பில் உள்ள பாடசாலை ஒன்றில் கல்வி கற்கும் 8 வயதுடைய பாடசாலை மாணவன் ஒருவனின் தந்தை கொள்ளுப்பிட்டி பொலிஸ் நிலையத்தில் முறைப்பாடு  அளித்துள்ளார்.

எனது மகன் கொழும்பு நீச்சல் கழகத்தில் நடைபெற்ற  பிறந்தநாள் கொண்டாட்டம் ஒன்றில் கலந்துகொண்டிருந்தார்.

மகனுக்கு எவ்வளவு நேரம் ஒட்சிசன் வழங்கப்பட்டது, அம்புலன்ஸ் எப்போது வந்தது என வைத்தியர்கள் கேட்ட கேள்விகளுக்கு எங்களிடம் பதில் இல்லை.

ஏனென்றால், கொழும்பு நீச்சல் கழகத்தின் அதிகாரிகள் இந்த சம்பவம் தொடர்பில் சரியான தகவல்களை எங்களிடம் வழங்கவில்லை. அவர்களிடம் சிசிடிவி கமராக்களும் இல்லை.

எனது மகனுக்கு மூளை பாதிப்பு ஏற்பட்டமைக்கு கொழும்பு நீச்சல் கழகத்தின் கவனக்குறைவே காரணம்.

எனவே, இது தொடர்பில் உரிய விசாரணைகளை மேற்கொள்ளுமாறு பொலிஸாரிடம் கேட்டுக்கொள்கின்றேன் என அந்த தந்தை முறைப்பாட்டில் குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.

### US government faces brain drain as 154,000 federal workers exit this week

*2025-10-01 15:50:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113111/us-government-faces-brain-drain-as-154000-federal-workers-exit-this-week) · `en`

More than 150,000 federal employees will leave the U.S. government payroll this week after accepting buyouts - the largest single-year exodus of civil servants in nearly 80 years, triggering what unions and governance experts warn is a damaging loss of institutional expertise.

The official resignations begin on Tuesday for workers who opted into a deferred exit program that kept them on the payroll through September. The buyouts are a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s push to shrink the federal workforce, combining financial incentives with threats of dismissal for those who declined the offer.

Many left their agencies months ago, according to the federal government’s HR office, and have effectively been on paid leave.

Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said the biggest impact of this week’s exodus will be the brain drain of so many experienced civil servants, a loss of talent he says will be hard to reverse.

### US government shutdown begins as partisan division rules Washington

*2025-10-01 13:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113103/us-government-shutdown-begins-as-partisan-division-rules-washington) · `en`

The U.S. government shut down much of its operations on Wednesday as deep partisan divisions prevented Congress and the White House from reaching a funding deal, setting off what could be a long, grueling standoff that could lead to the loss of thousands of federal jobs.

There was no clear path out of the impasse, while agencies warned that the 15th government shutdown since 1981 would halt the release of a closely watched September employment report, slow air travel, suspend scientific research, withhold pay from U.S. troops and lead to the furlough of 750,000 federal workers at a daily cost of $400 million.

Trump, whose campaign to radically reshape the federal government is already on track to push out some 300,000 workers by December, warned congressional Democrats that a shutdown could clear the path for “irreversible” actions including cutting more jobs and programs.

### Gaza War: Trump - Netanyahu Meeting; US extreme pressure on peace - 8 countries including China and Pakistan welcome

*2025-10-01 13:16:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226574) · `ta`

Eight countries, including China and Pakistan, have welcomed the 20 -stipulated plan to end the Gaza Conflict.

More than 65 thousand Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed in the Gaza attack on Israel over the past one and a half years. Attempts to meditate under the leadership of US President Donald Trump have been intensified to end the war.

In this context, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to the United States on September 30. The meeting occurred at the time of Israel's intensification of the Gaza War, which caused a stir on the world stage.

This is the 4th time Netanyahu goes to the United States in the current year. Trump, who came to the white palace door, greeted Netanyahu, who came out of the car. During the talks at the White House, it seems that Gaza has been pressed on behalf of Trump to end the Gaza War immediately. Thus, there is an expectation that the Gaza War may be ended soon.

### First US Federal Shutdown in Six Years Begins After Funding Talks Collapse

*2025-10-01 13:04:00* · [`newsfirstlk`](https://english.newsfirst.lk/2025/10/01/first-us-federal-shutdown-in-six-years-begins-after-funding-talks-collapse) · `en`

The US federal government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the lights on — and no one inside the Capitol knows what will happen next.

Republicans insist Democrats need to simply agree to extend current funding for another seven weeks.

Democrats refuse to do so without major concessions for lending their votes to pass any funding measure in the Senate.

Both Republican and Democratic proposals that would have funded the government past Tuesday failed in the Senate during the eleventh hour, effectively shutting down the government at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday.

The federal government ran out of money after a Democratic-backed spending bill that would have extended health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and reversed cuts to Medicaid failed, as well as the GOP-backed stopgap funding measure that would have funded the government for seven weeks also failed.
