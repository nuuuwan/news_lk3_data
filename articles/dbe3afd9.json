    "As the protests grew violent, resulting in the deaths of 19 people, the government late on Monday revoked the ban.",
    "However, anti-government protests continued over the lives lost in the agitation across the country. Authorities already reportedly imposed curfew in the key areas of the capital after the deaths in Monday\u2019s protest.",

    "The residence of former home minister Ramesh Lekhak at Naikap was also torched just a day after he resigned from the post following the police\u2019s use of force on the young protesters agitating against the ban on 26 social media sites, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube.",
    "The protests have so far left 19 people dead and more than 300 others injured."
