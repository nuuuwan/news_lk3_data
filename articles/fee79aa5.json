    "We pensioners particularly are resentful of Parliamentarians getting pensions for life after warming the seats of the House by the Diyawanna for a mere five years. Many of them hardly contributed to on-going debates, and many have been more absent than present in Parliament. Some have been caught on camera snoozing while sessions were on. And then after being paid for each session attended and a salary and free petrol and heavily subsidised meals, they lose their seats at an election and are gifted a pension.",
    "How was it with us who are entitled to pensions and get a certain amount each month which hardly keeps us medically secure, leave along paying for our food. However, we are grateful for the amount that comes to us as recompense for work well done at least for 20 years, paltry though it be. And, how did we work then? Most were highly dedicated, competent, took pleasure and pride in our work, and actually earned our salaries and later, pensions. Not to mention honesty.",
    "Someone said the Constitution provided for pension payments to MPs. Thus, not easy to do away with it although most of the people will want it scrapped. The perks given to former presidents ranging from large security contingents to mansions to most other life\u2019s higher benefits are not constitutionally guaranteed. So, they can be removed forthwith to save money. One reason given for maintaining the extravagant perks is that an ex-president saved the nation. Such a fallacy. So many were involved in the war victory \u2013 more so the soldiers who laid down their lives for the country. And being elected President he was expected to do all in his power to serve the country. It was reported a Bill had been debated and Act passed to axe these perks to ex-presidents.",
    "US President Donald Trump continues to play his tariff game much to the detriment of many countries, including Sri Lanka. Praise was bestowed on diplomats of our country for managing to reduce the tariff imposed on SL from 44% to 20%. It was the result of President AKD having experts thrash the matter out and giving those who know such matters a free hand to act. It was heartening to hear Dr Harsha de Silva give due praise to the government. Cass wished more Opposition MPs to act this way: criticise the government where it is due and give acknowledgement when a good act is executed.",
    "Al Jazeera reported on August 5 from Washington DC: \u201cThe Republican led oversight committee in the US House of Representatives has issued a subpoena to obtain records related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, amid ongoing scrutiny about his case. Also, on Tuesday, the panel\u2019s Republican Chair James Comer issued deposition subpoenas for top officials from both major parties, including ex-President Bill Clinton, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and \u2026\u201d",
    "Cass understood next to nothing of this but further reading explained matters better.",
    "\u201c\u2026 requests the release of all documents and communications relating or referring to Epstein and his ex-girlfriend and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell\u201d",
    "Trump had been using all his power to block opening up the can of worms regarding this Epstein who cultivated many VVIP men with the bait of underage girls. Disgusting to not only prude Cass. We remember how Epstein was supposed to commit suicide when in prison but whispers floated he was murdered, having too many secrets of VVIPs in mind, in danger of being exposed.",
    "Photographs appeared in against-Trump newspapers of him with Epstein. Not so surprising that Melania Trump is also suffering the shivers.",
    "That\u2019s the United States of America for you, or sections of it.",
    "The latest was that Trump increased tariffs on Indian goods exported to the US: \u201cstop importing oil from Russia or you face further punishment.\u201d India diplomatically termed it mild or some such innocuous epithet but Cass, admirer of India, was appalled at Trump\u2019s brass to order another country around and India of all nations.",
    "So, Cass rests her case. One last comment: Trump expects to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. For what? Palestinians in Gaza are being deliberately wiped out by Israel aided by the US under Trump. The world has at last woken up to the utter horror of children dying of malnutrition in Gaza; aid denied them by the Israel army and those who line up to receive a saucepan of soup shot at point blank by Israeli soldiers. The war in Ukraine continues. So what has Trump done to usher in peace? Far from being a dove he is a rapacious eagle!",
