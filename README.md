### ‘‘Sri Lanka’s ISB restructure: Debt trap backed by IMF and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce’’

Sri Lanka’s debt crisis is a stark example of the destructive power of predatory lending

The current NPP administration has agreed to implement a new variant of the same corrupt deal which merely reduces the weighted coupon rate of interest of bonds from 8.1% to 6.5% from 2028 onwards reducing total payments by $ 1 billion. The new Government must reject this destructive path and prioritise people’s interests. It is evident that the Sri Lankan Government’s actions have been influenced by corrupt interests. The cosy relationship between the Government and international creditors raises serious questions about transparency and accountability. The new administration must break free from this destructive path and prioritise the well-being of the Sri Lankan people

### Irrational behaviour of RW and MR vs. rational behaviour of President AKD

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President RW will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behaviour can be compared with the rational behaviour of President AKD. Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost

Given the parliamentary election on 14 November 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

The decision was made, but the decision was taken to make the decision to be implemented, but not done. What does that mean then?Clearly, it is a false promise in the election period, to mislead the people. "

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake greets Hindus on Diwali, emphasizing change and unity. He calls for celebrating the festival as a symbol of hope and progress, urging Sri Lankans to work towards eliminating injustice and promoting cultural diversity.

🟩

In his Diwali greeting, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that we have initiated the era of change of public expectations.

The Diwali festival is celebrated by Hindu devotees in the world to mark the light of darkness.

The Sri Lankan people who have been searching for light from the dark after independence are now carrying new expectations. This is the many years expectation of the people. We have begun the age of change of the expectations of the public who have been paralyzed by the rulers of Sri Lanka for so many days.

There are many reasons for the Diwali celebration. The festival is celebrated to commemorate the return of Ayodhya and destroy Krishna Narakasura after the 14 -year wilderness.

I urge the people to celebrate the Diwali festival this time that the new revolution will lead to the new revolution by carrying torches in the tone of the light of the conscience.

We extend their hands for honor, acceptance and brotherhood, in order to enrich the beauty of cultural diversity.

### Examining Elpitiya, Israeli-Zionist beachheads, Anura’s inaction and Prabhakaran’s profile

*2024-10-31 01:50:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Examining-Elpitiya-Israeli-Zionist-beachheads-Anura-s-inaction-and-Prabhakaran-s-profile/4-768630) · `en`

On the campaign trail, President AKD followed-up his memorable line “I hear talk in certain places about an Opposition. An Opposition? No. What we need now is a powerful Government!” with a no less memorable and ominous one: “They think this government will be short-lived but I’m telling you this Government will step down only after having rebuilt the entire country!”

He should have said “this government will step down only if you decide it should at a national election”.

Meanwhile senior JVP member and NPP candidate Samantha Waidyaratna reassured his audience and the nation on TV news that “the incoming Government will last an aeon (‘kalpayak’)”.

Elpitiya was a legendary JVP stronghold during the April 1971 insurrection and thereafter. Therefore, last week’s Elpitiya PS election weeks after Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s presidential victory, illuminates greatly.

The JVP-NPP has shrunk slightly (47%) in comparison with its Elpitiya vote in September (49%).

A group of suspects has been arrested in Elpitiya for allegedly attempting to sell a large stock of ‘Ambergris’, estimated to be worth around Rs. 50 million, police said.

The arrests were made during a raid conducted following a tip-off received by the Walana Central Anti-Vice Unit.

Police apprehended two main suspects involved in the racket along with three accomplices, and seized 17 kg and 234 grams of ambergris found in their possession.

The suspects have been handed over to the Pitigala Police Station for further investigations.

Ambergris, also called grey amber or whale vomit, is created by the bile duct of the sperm whale and is often referred to as “floating gold” due to the immense price it fetches in the international market for its use in luxury perfumes.

However, it is reported that certain individuals are also engaged in the racket of slaughtering whales in the deep seas around Sri Lanka with the aim of obtaining Ambergris to sell it for high prices.
