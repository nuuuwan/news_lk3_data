    "Parliament, Feb. 20 (Daily Mirror)- The government is planning to provide the Galle Face agitation site where the 'GotaGoGama' Aragalaya was conducted, to establish a casino centre, NPP MP Vijith Herath alleged today.",
    "He told Parliament that the government is planning to provide a license through the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to an institution bearing a Chinese name to open a casino centre on the Aragalaya site and that a famous gambler in Negombo was behind this particular institution.",
    "The MP said the 'Aragalaya site', which was a turning point in Sri Lanka's political history, is provided for a casino centre to take revenge from the Aragalaya people and that it was a serious mistake.",
    "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said no casino centre will be opened targeting locals and that Rs. 10 billion needs to be paid when opening a casino.",
    "\"It is not easy to open a casino. The initial payment of Rs. 10 billion needs to be made when opening a casino. When a local enters a casino, they need to pay an entry fee of USD 50 and plans are afoot to increase that fee to USD 200 after two years. We are discouraging locals patronising casinos. These casinos solely target foreigners,\" he said."
