Tamil MPs are protesting peacefully against the government's refusal to address their complaints, including the detention of citizens during a religious ceremony. The opposition leader has called for the release of the detainees and the right to religious freedom. The Archaeological Department has imposed restrictions on visiting Hindu temples, causing confusion and concern among the local population. President Wickremesinghe has been active in addressing land issues and supporting the 13th Amendment, aiming to devolve powers to provincial councils.

The dissatisfaction among the Tamil political community takes a new twist in Parliament because the government fails to treat themselves honestly and solve their grievances.. Tamil MPs are embarking on a peaceful struggle instead of talks, as it is impossible to understand the majority of votes.

It is rare for political parties that represent ethnic and religious minority communities to confuse parliamentary activities. One reason for this is that their number is inadequate. But the confusion of the council is that the ruling party MPs and the opposition MPs often behave like their privacy..
