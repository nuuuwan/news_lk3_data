  "original_body_lines": [
    "Wanindu Hasaranga has received an official reprimand for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Qualifier match against Netherlands.",
    "After being dismissed, Hasaranga displayed aggressive behavior by striking the boundary skirtings with his bat upon returning to the pavilion. This action violated Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which prohibits the abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment, or fixtures and fittings during an International Match.",
    "Consequently, Hasaranga has been assigned one demerit point, as it was his second offense within a 24-month period. This brings his total demerit points to two.",
    "Level 1 breaches carry penalties ranging from an official reprimand to a maximum of 50% of the player's match fee, along with one or two demerit points. If a player accumulates four or more demerit points within 24 months, these points are converted into suspension points, potentially leading to a ban.",
    "A ban is imposed when a player accumulates two suspension points, resulting in a suspension from either one Test match or two ODIs or two T20Is, depending on whichever comes first.",
