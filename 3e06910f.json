    "Maldives government on Sunday suspended ministers over derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi relating to his Lakshadweep visit. Reportedly, Mariyam Shiuna, Malsha and Hassan Zihan were suspended over their \u2018insulting\u2019 remarks.",
    "Seeking action against the ministers, former foreign minister of Maldives Abdullah Shahid said that the public figures must maintain decorum.",
    "\u201cDerogatory remarks made by 2 Deputy Ministers of the current Maldives Government, and a member of a political party in the ruling coalition, towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India in social media is reprehensible and odious. I call on the Government to reprimand these officials. Public figures must maintain decorum,\u201d Shahid had tweeted.",
    "He also added that India is a time-tested friend and an unwavering ally. \u201cThey have historically been the first to respond in our time of need. Our close relationship has been bound by mutual respect, history, culture and strong people-to-people relations..,\u201d he said.",
    "The Maldivian government had issued a statement distancing itself from the \u201cderogatory remarks\u201d made against PM Modi on social media. According to the government, the opinions are \u201cpersonal and do not represent the views of the Government.\u201d",
    "Modi visited Lakshadweep on January 2 and inaugurated, laid foundation stone for development works worth over Rs 1,150 crore. During his stay in Lakshadweep, he urged people to visit the serene island and boost tourism.",
    "A massive row had erupted after Shiuna made insulting remarks against Modi, calling him a \u2018clown\u2019 and \u2018puppet\u2019 over his recent Lakshadweep visit. Though the minister deleted his post on X, it paved way for huge backlash against Maldives. Ex-president Mohammad Nasheed condemned Shiuna\u2019s remark by calling it \u2018appalling\u2019."
