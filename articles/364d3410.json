  "original_body_lines": [
    "A protest was held yesterday in front of the Mullaitivu District Secretariat, organised by the North-East Coordinating Committee (NECC) alongside representatives of women\u2019s community-based organisations, human rights defenders and members of fisher societies. The group appealed to the Sri Lankan Government, urging it not to deport the Rohingya refugees who were rescued by the Sri Lankan Navy on 19 December 2024.",
    "The NECC expressed appreciation for the swift actions of the local fishers in Mullaitivu who first noticed the distressed refugees and alerted the Navy, offering immediate assistance. The group also commended the Sri Lankan Navy for rescuing the refugees. However, the NECC stressed that Sri Lanka, as a member of the United Nations, has a responsibility to adhere to international humanitarian and human rights laws. They highlighted the importance of upholding the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the return of refugees to places where they face persecution or harm.",
    "The group raised concerns about the current arrangements for the refugees, who have been held for more than two weeks at the Keppapulavu Air Force Base in Mullaitivu under a militarised environment. They argued that this is incompatible with international humanitarian norms and basic human values. They urged the Government to transfer the refugees to a more suitable location, such as the refugee centre in Mirihana, and place them under the supervision of civil administrative authorities instead of the military.",
    "While acknowledging that Sri Lanka, as a developing country, is not positioned to serve as a hub for international refugees, the NECC emphasised the need to treat the rescued individuals according to international standards for refugee protection.",
    "They urged the Government to seek the assistance of the United Nations to identify eligible countries willing to provide refugee status to the group.",
    "Copies of the appeal were also sent to the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the United Nations Resident Representative for Sri Lanka, and the National Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka."
