  "original_body_lines": [
    "Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said she urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home.",
    "Harris said she had a \u201cfrank and constructive\u201d conversation with Netanyahu in which she affirmed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself but also expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza over nine months of war and the \u201cdire\u201d humanitarian situation there.",
    "With all eyes on the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Harris largely reiterated President Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding message that it\u2019s time to find an endgame to the brutal war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have died. Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed \u201ctotal victory\u201d against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.",
    "\u201cThere has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,\u201d Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. \u201cAnd as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.\u201d",
    "Netanyahu met separately earlier in the day with Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire.",
    "The White House said in a statement that Biden discussed with Netanyahu \u201cthe need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza.\u201d Biden and Netanyahu also discussed improving the flow of aid into Gaza as well as the ongoing threat posed by Iranian-backed militant groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.",
    "Harris said after her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel\u2019s war in Gaza is more complicated than simply being supportive of one side or the other.",
    "\u201cToo often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,\u201d Harris said.",
    "Harris also condemned Hamas\u2019 brutality. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.",
    "Kirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \u201cbut there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\u201d",
    "With Harris\u2019 forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.",
    "\u201cWhat has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\u201d",
    "Thousands protested Netanyahu\u2019s visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.",
    "Netanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.",
    "Ahead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \u201ctotally against the Jewish people.\u201d",
    "Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.",
    "She\u2019s also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel and installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president\u2019s residence in Washington \u2014 her husband is Jewish. She also has connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.",
    "For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She\u2019s being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn\u2019t done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.",
    "Harris\u2019 last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she\u2019s taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.",
    "The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they\u2019ve known each other and thanked the president for his service.",
    "\u201cFrom a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu told Biden.",
    "A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.",
    "Following their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.",
    "Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said the families received an \u201cironclad commitment\u201d from Biden and Netanyahu to get the hostages home. He said he was more hopeful than at anytime since Hamas released more than 100 hostages during a temporary cease-fire in November.",
    "\u201cThere is more reason today than in any time since the last round of hostage releases that something can happen,\u201d he said.",
    "Netanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.",
    "In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel\u2019s conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \u201cAmericans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\u201d",
    "\u201cRemember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cOur fight, it\u2019s your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \u201c",
    "Netanyahu also derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran\u2019s \u201cuseful idiots.\u201d",
    "Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.",
    "\u201cPro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cI condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\u201d",
    "Protesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \u201cArrest Netanyahu,\u201d and brought an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counterprotesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders."
