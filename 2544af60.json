    "Newly appointed Governor of the Sabaragamuwa province Navin Dissanayake yesterday pledged to serve the Sabaragamuwa province and uplift the lives of its people.",
    "Following his appointment by President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, Dissanayake said Wickremesinghe had promised to appoint him to the post nearly eight months ago. \u201cHe has delivered on his promise today,\u201d he said, adding that he intends to use the powers vested in the Governor due to the lack of Provincial Councils to serve the province.",
    "Dissanayake was appointed after the former Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province, Tikiri Kobbekaduwa stepped down from his post with effect from 10 June 2023. Kobbekaduwa was appointed as Governor by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in November 2019.",
    "Speaking to the media after receiving his appointment letter from President Wickremesinghe, Dissanayake also revealed his plans to obtain the support of private partners to develop the province\u2019s education sector due to the lack of state funds and budget cuts.",
    "\u201cThe President has taught us how to face obstacles. In other words, we must accept the challenges before us. Therefore at a time we are in an economic crisis and the Government is looking to curb expenses, I intend to with my capabilities obtain funding from the private sector and uplift the education sector of the province,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake said he will consider it an achievement if he is able to carry this out within 18 months."
