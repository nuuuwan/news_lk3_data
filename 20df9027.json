I will be appointing a commission headed by retired chief justice Priyasad Dep to look into political parties. There are a large number of political parties in the country. No one knows who leads them. The new commission will look into details on the parties. Some parties are influenced by persons who offer them large sums of money. The commission will probe into all these and make recommendations regarding parties in six werks time. I would like to know the stand of political parties on this move,\u201d he said.",

Also, Opposition MPs like Harsha De Silva and Patali Champika Ranawaka have also support me through their acts as chairpersons of two parliamentary committees,\u201d he added."
