    "According to Dissanayake, this unexpected change has unsettled the ruling classes, who had anticipated that power would remain within a few influential families.",
    "\u201cIt has mentally stressed them,\u201d he observed, attributing recent statements made on the campaign trail by Opposition figures to their discomfort with the new Government. He argued that these individuals are \u201cfinding this unbearable\u201d and are actively hoping for the Government\u2019s failure, sentiments he believes stem from their disappointment at losing power.",
    "\u201cThe country, once divided along various lines, has now come together with hope and expectations for the NPP. The Government will remain strong due to the trust placed by the people,\u201d he assured.",
    "Dissanayake said the change has been long-awaited by the people and is reflected in the support seen across the country.",

    "The President praised the NPP\u2019s unique role in uniting the traditionally divided regions of Sri Lanka, saying: \u201cOur traditional politics were divisive, i.e. against the North and South. For the first time, a politics of unity has arisen which has brought the North, South, East, and West under one flag.\u201d This, he stated, has brought together a country divided along various lines, fostering new hope and expectations focused on the NPP.",
    "Dissanayake pointed out that the current structure\u2014a President and Cabinet of three\u2014is insufficient to address the challenges the Government faces.",
    "\u201cPolitical power has been divided among various entities and centred around them,\u201d he explained, criticising the indefinite postponement of local Government elections. He argued that to effect a full transformation across all sectors, it is essential to have close political leadership and a powerful majority in Parliament to provide \u201ctransformative guidance.\u201d",
    "He called on the public to support the NPP in the 14 November election, describing it as a vital step towards realising this transformation.",

    "Addressing concerns about the NPP\u2019s inexperience in governance, Dissanayake rejected the notion that his party lacks capable leaders.",
    "He acknowledged that while some of the NPP\u2019s candidates may be new to Parliament, they are not new to politics. \u201cThey are those who stood for the people and fought for their rights and betterment,\u201d he said. In a call for broader change, he also appealed to those voting for other parties to support new candidates, stating: \u201cSend new faces from their parties, and we will teach them good ways.\u201d",
    "Emphasising the need for a completely renewed legislature, he remarked: \u201cEspecially this Parliament must be new. It must be cleaned.\u201d",
    "He likened the 14 November vote to a \u201cnational level shramadana\u201d\u2014a communal effort to restore and rejuvenate the country\u2019s political landscape and to create a clean, accountable Government."
