"This is my last election if the 2024 US presidential election is lost," Donald Trump said.

The US presidential election is scheduled for November 5. There is fierce competition between Kamala Harris and Trump. Although Kamala Harris has begun to take the lead in nationwide polls, Trump is making various allegations against the ruling Democratic Party.

In this case, Donald Trump, a former president of the United States, interviewed a reporter. Then he said to him, "Will you contest the election again?"The question was raised.

Responding to this, Trump issued a statement saying, "If he fails to return to the White House in 2024, he will not contest the presidential election in 2028."
