I have always been struck by two distinct moments in history. First, in June 1865, during the tenure of President Abraham Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the United States of America. And yet, there were slaves who were reluctant to embrace the associated freedoms. They appeared to be too attached to their chains.

Then, in July 1945 C.W.W. Kannangara introduced an act in parliament to ensure free education for all Sri Lankans. He was compelled to debate for hours extolling the virtues of this move. There were many who attempted to throw sand in his wheels. Among the elites there were even those who argued that if this piece of legislation was passed, they wouldn’t be able to find a boy to pluck coconuts on their extensive properties.

### NMSJ urges political parties  to uphold people’s expectations

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMS) in a statement urged all political parties to uphold people’s expectations.

We believe that in three days, the new Parliament, made up of representatives elected by the people, will take on a greater responsibility than ever before in history.

This is especially important given the irresponsible behaviour we have seen in Parliament in recent years. Both the incoming Government and the Opposition will have a huge responsibility. Their first task should be to strengthen democracy by helping the country recover from the financial crisis we are facing. Additionally, the new Parliament must reflect the political culture that the people expect, with both the ruling party and the Opposition playing their part.

### Archbishop of Canterbury resigns over handling of church child abuse case

*2024-11-12 21:58:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103365/archbishop-of-canterbury-resigns-over-handling-of-church-child-abuse-case) · `en`

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.

Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when release of the inquiry’s findings kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church.

“It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,” Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. “I believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve.”

### Sri Lanka’s CEB restructure faces execution risk, BB+(lka) rating confirmed: Fitch

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board’s re-structuring faces execution risk, Fitch Ratings said, while confirming its ‘BB+(lka) rating on expected state support.

“The new Electricity Act includes provisions to unbundle CEB’s generation, transmission and distribution into separate entities,” Fitch said.

“We believe the unbundling will improve CEB’s efficiency and competitiveness. The utility is already preparing separate financials, maintains separate bank accounts and is in the process of allocating assets and liabilities for the three units.

“However, we believe the restructuring faces execution risk and may be contingent on the outcome of Sri Lanka’s general election on 14 November.”

A deviation from cost reflective tariffs is risk to the CEB’s balance sheet.

“CEB has operated on a cost-reflective tariff mechanism since June 2023, which is revised quarterly to ensure operating costs are covered,” Fitch said.
