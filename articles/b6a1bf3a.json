  "original_body_lines": [
    "Ambika Samuel, the newly elected female representative to Parliament, has expressed confidence in the potential of the youth in plantation community and beyond to take an active role in politics.",
    "Speaking about her journey into politics, Samuel, the first female Tamil MP to have been elected through a major political party from the plantation community, emphasized that her entry into the political sphere is not just a personal achievement but a stepping stone for others, especially young people from the plantation sector, who she believes have been confined to outdated frameworks.",
    "\u201cI am the first to enter politics from here, and my brothers and sisters will undoubtedly follow. These are young individuals with immense talent and a genuine desire to serve the country. For too long, they have been trapped within certain limitations, but now that those barriers have been broken, we can expect a new wave of leadership emerging from the hill country and from other districts,\u201d she added.",
    "Samuel particularly highlighted the role of women, who she believes have long been restricted to traditional roles, particularly in the household.",
    "\u201cWomen were often confined to the kitchen, but many of them are capable of much more. They possess great potential, and their influence, until now, has been limited by societal expectations. With the first step I\u2019ve taken in politics, we will undoubtedly see more women rising to leadership positions, both in Parliament and beyond,\u201d she added."
