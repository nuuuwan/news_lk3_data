    "The Women\u2019s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) has launched its annual flagship event, the \u201cWCIC Prathibhabhisheka Women Entrepreneur Awards 2025.\u201d",
    "This prestigious awards ceremony, set to take place in January 2026, aims to recognise and celebrate the remarkable achievements of outstanding women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and across the SAARC region.",
    "WCIC Chairperson Gayani De Alwis outlined the chamber\u2019s commitment to empowering women over its 40 year history, with the awards ceremony now marking its 15th anniversary. She highlighted that the event was re-launched in 2022 as \u2018Prathibhabhisheka\u2019 a Sanskrit term for \u2018crowning women\u2019 to reflect a new vision. The 2025 edition will be the fourth consecutive year under this concept, which celebrates entrepreneurs who demonstrate not just success, but also strong financial governance and a dedication to ethical and sustainable business practices.",
    "De Alwis called upon all exceptional women entrepreneurs to share their stories of resilience and success and compete for the prestigious awards. She added that the ceremony will honour them for their persistence, their ability to grow and scale their businesses, and their significant impact on the Sri Lankan economy. While the primary focus is on Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, a special category has been created to include participants from the SAARC region.",
    "She highlighted the value that previous winners have gained from the awards, noting that the Prathibhabhisheka honour has enhanced both their personal brand and their businesses.",
    "De Alwis acknowledged the immense contributions of past WCIC Chairpersons, whose efforts have been crucial in carrying this initiative forward each year. The main purpose of the awards is to highlight the significant economic impact that women entrepreneurs have on the nation. She also shared that such initiatives are essential for motivating women, recognising their achievements, and empowering them to grow, which will eventually contribute to the country\u2019s economic development.",
    "WCIC member and Co-chair Tusitha Kumarakulasingham, shared her excitement about the awards, noting that \u201cYear on year, WCIC Prathibhabhisheka gathers thrust, and we are elated with the traction this amazing project has gained.\u201d She described the initiative as a national endeavour to honour women entrepreneurs across the country.",
    "Kumarakulasingham outlined the eligibility criteria for the program, with a primary focus on women-owned and women-led businesses. The main condition for ownership is that the applicant must be the sole owner or hold a minimum of 51% of the shares. However, businesses with ownership of less than 51% but a minimum of 33% can also be considered if the applicant is involved in a C-suite capacity. She emphasised that ownership is a critical requirement for participation.",
    "Providing further details on the application and selection process, Kumarakulasingham explained the awards program has been designed to encourage participants to undertake a deep self-assessment of their businesses. The application process requires two key components: \u201cMy Story,\u201d a detailed description of the applicant\u2019s journey and thought process, and supporting financial and governance information. There are 10 top awards on offer, including the prestigious Woman Entrepreneur of the Year for Sri Lanka and the Woman Entrepreneur of the Year for the SAARC region.",
    "Applications will be submitted under six categories, based on the size of the business, with a separate category for SAARC region applicants. Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards will be presented for each category, and an award will also be dedicated to the \u201cBest of the Province\u201d for each of Sri Lanka\u2019s nine provinces. The categories for application are Start-Up, Micro, Small, Medium, and Large, with each having a specified annual revenue for the review period of 2024/2025.",
    "She noted that the event received over 80 applications last year and expressed confidence that it will reach even greater heights this year. She added, \u201cWe have already received more than 10 applications from the SAARC region, which demonstrates the growing regional interest in this initiative.\u201d",
    "Regional participation is a key focus, and applicants from all nine provinces are encouraged to take part. The applicants will initially compete for a \u201cBest of the Region Award\u201d based on their location before being considered for the national awards. For the regional awards, the category classification will not apply, but it will be a factor for the national awards.",
    "In addition to the main categories, a number of popular special awards will be presented. These include The Young Woman Entrepreneur, Outstanding Start-Up, The Woman of Courage, The Most Outstanding Export Oriented Entrepreneur (Products and Services), The Digital Entrepreneur, The Most Innovative Entrepreneur, and The Social Entrepreneur for 2025. The ceremony will conclude with the grand award for \u201cThe Woman Entrepreneur of the Year 2025.\u201d",
    "WCIC Prathibhabhisheka Women Entrepreneur Awards 2024 Winner Dr. Dilesha Perera, shared her experience, stating that the initiative has provided significant recognition for many talented women entrepreneurs. As a winner, she has gained considerable exposure and visibility, which has led to greater momentum in her business. She expressed her gratitude to the WCIC for the support she received."
