    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has alleged that Sri Lanka\u2019s recent energy crisis\u2014marked by shortages in electricity, fuel, and gas\u2014was deliberately manufactured under the pretext of the economic collapse, with the intention of fulfilling undisclosed objectives.The claim was made during a heated COPE session held this week, where Dr. Nishantha Samarawera, Chairman of the committee, announced that a formal investigation would be launched into the matter.\u00a0The session focused on the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and its affiliated entities, including Lanka Transformers Ltd (LTL).Dr. Samarawera accused certain officials and institutions of misusing public funds, stating that Rs. 5,943,680 had been mishandled.\u00a0\u201cThis is not a trivial loss. Funds that should have remained within the institution were diverted for personal use,\u201d he said.He further criticized the sudden increase in electricity tariffs, noting that power cuts lasting up to 18.5 hours were imposed during critical periods such as school examinations, only to be lifted immediately after tariff hikes were approved in Parliament.\u00a0\u201cThis was a calculated move to justify price increases,\u201d he added.The COPE Chairman also pointed to artificial shortages of gas, stating, \u201cWe are not saying there was a shortage. We are saying it was created.\u201d He alleged that the crisis was used to manipulate consumer behavior and justify price surges, with gas prices rising from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 7,500.\u00a0\u201cSince then, there have been no (LP Gas Cylinder) explosions. That\u2019s the real story,\u201d he said."
