    "Bourse ended in the green zone, ending a six- day downward trend on the back of price appreciation on blue chip and banking counters. ASPI was recorded at 10,624 a 20 point increase from the previous session, despite the index fluctuating between red and green multiple times through Thursday\u2019s session.",
    "The positive gain was influenced largely through the banking counters as investors capitalized on bargain low prices of these shares due to its fall in prices in the previous sessions. Market turnover was recorded at LKR 1.2Bn which is a 19.6% increase from the monthly average of LKR 1.0Bn.",
    "Market turnover was mainly contributed by off-board transactions by high net worth investors on counters such as CARG, CTHR, RCH and WAPO. Foreign investors remained net sellers, recording a large net outflow of LKR 599.5Mn, with CARG contributing the largest towards the outflow.",
    "The CBSL conducted its second treasury buy back auction today where LKR 10.0Bn was offered under 01.06.26 tenor, out of which LKR 2.5Bn was accepted at 13.70%. Similarly, LKR 10.0Bn was offered under 15.01.27 tenor where only LKR 272.0Mn was accepted. Meanwhile, in the secondary market, activities remained limited where trades were mostly centered on the short to mid tenors. Accordingly, 2026 maturities hovered in the range of 13.75%-13.80% while on the mid end, 15.09.27 traded at 13.95% and 2028 maturities traded in the range of 14.05%-14.10%.",
