    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to raise withholding tax on deposits to 10 percent from 5 percent but exemptions will be given for lower income brackets, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.",
    "Depositors who earn less than 150,000 rupees a month can get a direction from the Department of Inland Revenue to get an exemption, he said.",
    "Others whose income tax bracket is below 10 percent, will be able to reclaim the extra taxes, he said.",
    "A special unit will be set up in the Department of Inland Revenue, to advice the public he said.",
