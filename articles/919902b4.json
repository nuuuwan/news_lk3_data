    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Support for his three main rival candidates declined in the first half of 2024 to the benefit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe whose support more than doubled though he still remained in third place, the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) said.",
    "The institute said on Tuesday September 10 that, in the first half of 2024, the most notable changes in voting intent were the rise in support for Wickremasinghe as a potential presidential candidate at the apparent expense of support for rival candidates.",
    "According to IHP, Wickremesinghe saw a rise in support at the expense of leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and a generic candidate from the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which later transpired to be its national organiser Namal Rajapaksa.",
    "In IHP\u2019s Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP) model projections, support for Dissanayake, Premadasa and the generic SLPP candidate declined by 7 percent, 1 percent and 5 percent respectively from the first two months of the year to June/July 2024.",
    "\u201cThe main beneficiary was President Wickremesinghe, whose support more than doubled, increasing 13 percent to 22 percent during the same period, although this still left him trailing in third place,\u201d IHP said in its statement.",
    "To shed some light on what was driving these changes, the IHP said it studied its August 2024 MRP model estimates of voting intent to look at how support for the currently leading candidates changed in different demographic groups.",
    "According to IHP, Dissanayake registered losses in support across most demographics, but the biggest losses were in his core base of the better-off, Sinhala and youth (18\u201329 years) voters, where support fell 12, 9, and 17 points respectively. Support amongst voters with a favourable view of the Aragalaya fell 9 percent\u2013a bigger fall than Sajith Premadasa experienced, although he retained a strong lead over his opponents in these voters. He also lost support amongst voters who voted for Gotabaya Rajapakse or Sajith Premadasa in 2019, although the MRP estimates suggest he managed to consolidate his 2019 presidential election voters.",
    "Premadasa also lost support across most demographics, with his biggest losses in older adults (60+ years) where his support fell 9 points. However, the institute said, he did consolidate support amongst poor Sri Lankans (+3) and Muslims (+4), both groups where he led other likely candidates.",
    "\u201cThe shifts away from both Dissanayake and Premadasa seem to have been largely to the gain of President Wickremesinghe. His support rose across all demographics, except in Muslims. This included a larger gain in women (+17% vs. +8% in men), improving his better performance in women. Shifts in his favour were biggest in better-off (+17), Sinhala (+16), older (+24), and former Gotabaya Rajapakse (+20) voters. But notably the biggest shifts in his favour were in anti-Aragalaya voters, where he gained 26 points to build a lead over all other likely candidates. To a considerable extent, President Wickremesinghe has been a major beneficiary of the core pro-government/Rajapakse/SLPP vote, which in the first half of the year largely collapsed across all demographics.\u201d (Colombo/Sep10/2024)"
