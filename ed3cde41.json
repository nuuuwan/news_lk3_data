  "original_body_lines": [
    "Several issues have emerged due to the lack of coordination among the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), the Fisheries Ministry and the Attorney General\u2019s Department with regard to the X-Press Pearl maritime disaster, a parliamentary committee has observed.",
    "At a recent meeting, the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on Environment, Natural Resources & Sustainable Development said this has affected the payment of compensation to the fishermen hit hard by the damage caused by the fire-ravaged freight ship X-Press Pearl.",
    "Accordingly, SOC chair MP Ajith Mannapperuma instructed that the AG\u2019s Department, the Fisheries Ministry, the MEPA and the members of the MEPA-appointed experts\u2019 committee jointly prepare a program and submit a related report to the Committee.",
    "During the meeting, MEPA officials told the SOC members that despite asking the AG\u2019s Department in writing about the activities of the experts\u2019 committee and its future needs, they have yet to receive a proper response.",
    "The MEPA officials also said that they had received information from the Justice Ministry that an international, independent experts\u2019 committee would be appointed to continue the assessment of the damage. As a result, they explained that the MEPA expert committee has not made a firm decision on how to proceed. The officials also pointed out that it is problematic that the MEPA is unaware of the work being carried out in this regard by the AG\u2019s Department.",
    "It was revealed that since the payments related to the research activities conducted by the experts\u2019 committee appointed by MEPA have not been made, the Ministry was requested to submit a Cabinet paper to look into the ability to make relevant payments.\u00a0 It was also disclosed that no appointments have been made to the experts\u2019 committee for the year 2023."
