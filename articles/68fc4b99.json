    "Colombo, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) - \u00a0The Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry is conducting the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Catch-up Immunization Programme across the island on January 20 and 21, targeting children aged between 9 months and 15 years.",
    "Globally and regionally, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in measles vaccination rates, resulting in a notable increase in measles cases.",
    "Compounding this challenge, Sri Lanka has been grappling with an imported measles outbreak since May 2023, with cases predominantly reported among vaccine refusal communities and partially vaccinated individuals (aged 9 months to 3 years).",
    "In response, the Epidemiology Unit initiated a nationwide MMR Catch-up Immunization Programme on January 6, specifically focusing on children who had missed their routine MMR vaccinations. The programme aims to ensure that children aged 9 months to 15 years have the opportunity to receive any missed routine MMR vaccinations.",
    "Children who couldn't avail themselves of the MMR dose during the initial campaign are encouraged to receive the catch-up doses at routine immunization clinics within their respective Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas."
