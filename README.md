### ஒழுங்கற்ற மனித நடவடிக்கைகளே இயற்கை பேரழிவுகளுக்குக் காரணம் : ஜனாதிபதி

*2024-11-25 17:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199636) · `ta`

அனர்த்த முகாமைத்துவ நிறுவன கட்டமைப்புகளை வலுப்படுத்துவது  மட்டும் போதுமானதல்ல , தீர்வுகளை அடிமட்டத்திற்குக் கொண்டு செல்வதற்கான வழிமுறைகளை உருவாக்க முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொள்ளப்பட வேண்டும். ஒழுங்கற்ற மனித நடவடிக்கைகளே இயற்கை பேரழிவுகளுக்கு காரணம்  நிறுவன மட்டத்தில் விதிமுறைகள் இருந்தும் அவை நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப்படுவதில்லை என ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திஸாநாயக்க தெரிவித்தார்.

பாதுகாப்பு பிரதியமைச்சர் அருண ஜயசேகர பதவியேற்பு நிகழ்வில் இன்று (25) இணைந்து கொண்ட போதே ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க இந்தக் கருத்துக்களைத் தெரிவித்தார்.

அனர்த்த முகாமைத்துவத்தில் நிறுவன கட்டமைப்புகளை வலுப்படுத்துவது மட்டும் போதாது எனவும், தீர்வுகளை  அடி மட்டத்திற்கு கொண்டு வர முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொள்ளப் பட வேண்டும் எனவும் ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க தெரிவித்தார்.

உள்ளூராட்சி நிறுவனங்களை பலப்படுத்தி அச்சுறுத்தல் உள்ள பிரதேசங்களில் ஏற்படும் அனர்த்தங்களை தடுப்பதற்கு புதிய தீர்வுகள் வழங்க  வேண்டுமெனவும் அவர் சுட்டிக் காட்டினார்.

At the Third SAARC Summit Meeting in Nepal on November 2-4, 1987, 1 had called for going “full sail ahead” with the King of Nepal in the host’s chair. I said:

“As we all know, regionalism in South Asia has had a late beginning. One of the remarkable developments since the Second World War has been the spread of regionalism, manifested in the setting up of regional organizations which have to cover most of the globe. The fact that SAARC came to be formed so late has been explained by the disparities and imbalances within our region. Nevertheless, there is at the same time, an underlying homogeneity among South Asian countries, on which we hope to build an enduring regionalism for the common benefit of all of us.

Constitutionally, the President must be at least 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.

A word first used in 17th century England is gaining new currency in 21st century America. Kakistocracy, a Greek derivative per usual, means government administered by the worst group of citizens – in qualification, competence, experience and scruples. Kakistocracy is in full display in the US with the election of Donald Trump as president for a second term. America is returning to chaos not heeding Kamala Harris’s warning against going back.

In Sri Lanka, Rajapaksas epitomized Kakistocracy for nearly two decades before it imploded under Gotabaya Rajapaksa. After them came Ranil Wickremesinghe to clean up the economic mess left behind by the Rajapaksas. To his credit, Mr. Wickremesinghe did clean up the economic mess.

About 20 years ago, I used the same title, in a writing dealing with Mahinda Rajapaksa’s triumphant ascent to power, published in an issue of the Sunday Island. In that I expressed my deep apprehensions of a Rajapaksa dispensation. As the years unfolded, the grim realities of years of misrule, with the younger Rajapaksa outdoing the elder brother in criminality, corruption and incompetence, exceeded the worst fears of my imagination. In between, not to be forgotten, there was also the crushingly disappointing “yahapalanya” farce, perpetrated by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe collaboration.

### Sri Lanka can cut floor rate, but targeting ‘dysfunctional’ market will lead to trouble

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is just emerging from a default after large volumes of money were printed to target a narrow policy rate, in the pursuit of instant growth (potential output) and denying monetary stability to the people.

From 2015 in particular Sri Lanka very narrowly targeted a policy rate despite being a reserve collecting central bank.

Targeting a mid-corridor rate is the same as printing money to maintain a single policy rate. The label is different but the required inflationism is the same.

The same consequences of targeting a mid-corridor rate in 2015 and especially 2018 when the budget deficit was brought down.

If the call money rate is so dysfunctional as claimed in a recent defence of money printing through OMO, it should obviously not be used as the operating target for monetary policy at all.

Since the end of the war the central bank has cut rates around 18 to 20 months after a currency crisis, just as private credit recovered and triggered a currency crisis.

In these two killing fields IDF has not spared even news reporters and aid workers.
