  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a bold move that promises to reshape Sri Lanka\u2019s energy future, the Ministry of Energy has confirmed the initiation of sweeping reforms to modernize the country\u2019s electricity sector, inclusive of the \u2018unbundling\u2019 of the sector into three distinct functions.",
    "Spearheaded by the newly formed Power Sector Reforms Secretariat (PSRS), these reforms aim to create a sustainable, competitive, and people-centric energy landscape, laying the groundwork for a new era in energy generation, transmission and distribution.",
    "At the helm of these reforms is Eng. Pubudu Niroshan Hedigallage, the newly appointed Director General of PSRS. A veteran energy policy expert, Hedigallage previously played a pivotal role in the creation of Sri Lanka\u2019s Energy Policy Framework 2024.",
    "He is joined by a team of renowned professionals, including Prof. Lilantha Samaranayake, Eng. Kosala Kamburadeniya and Dr. Indra Mahakalanda, all of whom bring their expertise and deep understanding of the energy sector to drive this transformative journey.",
    "\u201cWe are not merely restructuring the sector,\u201d says Hedigallage. \u201cWe are creating an energy ecosystem that serves the people\u2014efficient, transparent, and sustainable. Our goal is to build a system that evolves with the future, while aligning with the immediate needs of the people.\u201d",
    "The PSRS\u2019s reform agenda centers on several key objectives that will revolutionize the sector, with the unbundling of the electricity industry expected to be completed by June 2025.",
    "The reforms\u2019 core feature is the unbundling of the electricity sector into three distinct functions: generation, transmission, and distribution. This segmentation aims to enhance operational efficiency and allow for the creation of a strong single-buyer market, overseen by an Independent System Operator (ISO). While this will foster better competition, critical infrastructure such as transmission and distribution will remain firmly under state control, ensuring public ownership and safeguarding the national interest.",
    "Moreover, the reforms are designed to encourage private sector investment, particularly in renewable energy generation. Eng. Hedigallage notes that the reforms will strike a careful balance\u2014ensuring state ownership of essential infrastructure while opening doors for private innovation in power generation, especially in renewable sources like solar and wind.",
    "Another significant aspect of the reforms is the shift towards empowering consumers to become \u201cprosumers\u201d\u2014active participants who can generate electricity, often through renewable sources and feed it back into the grid. This decentralized approach is expected to reduce dependency on traditional power plants and contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.",
    "The phased implementation of these reforms will also create the conditions for the eventual establishment of competitive wholesale and retail electricity markets, with the ultimate goal of creating a fully mature, market-driven energy system by 2030.",
    "The PSRS team emphasizes that these reforms are not merely a technical overhaul\u2014they are informed by cutting-edge academic research, data-driven strategies, and long-term planning.",
    "One of the most ambitious goals of the reform agenda is the creation of a democratic and inclusive energy system. The PSRS envisions a future where Sri Lankans are not only consumers of electricity but active participants in its generation and distribution. The transition to renewable energy sources is seen as central to achieving both the country\u2019s energy security and its climate goals.",
    "\u201cOur mission is about more than infrastructure or policy, says Hedigallage. \u201cWe are building a future where every citizen can play a role in energy production, consumption, and sustainability. This is an inclusive, fair, and environmentally sustainable energy system.\u201d",
    "The reforms are being rolled out in a phased timeline, with clear milestones set for each stage:",
