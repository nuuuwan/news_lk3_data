    "LESSONS FROM MY CAREER: SYNTHESISING MANAGEMENT THEORY WITH PRACTICE \u2013 PART 22",
    "Awardee of the APO Regional Award for promoting Productivity in the Asia Pacific Region",
    "Recipient of the \u201cOrder of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays\u201d from the Government of Japan.",
    "Today I continue with further stories during my stint as Chairman at the ETF Board",
    "Synchronising the definitions with the EPF and differentiating from the EPF",
    "During my first few months at the ETF Board, several people complained about the differing interpretations of definitions, including \u2018earnings\u2019, \u2018allowances\u2019, \u2018meal subsidies\u2019, and \u2018covered employees\u2019, between the EPF and the ETF.",
    "I reviewed our forms alongside those of the EPF and identified some glaring discrepancies. While the labour department does not include overtime as a part of earnings, we at ETF ask for and include overtime. This was wrong and was corrected immediately. We set up a team with me heading the ETF side and the Commissioner of Labour heading the EPF side, and reconciled all the differences. Employers adopted various ruses by granting fixed allowances without including them as part of the earnings, which were actually included in the earnings. These, too, were clarified.",
    "Many were confused about the two funds and why we needed two superannuation funds. We had lengthy discussions at the Board level, delving into the written and unwritten details of the fund\u2019s creation. I have written extensively on this topic and have also made presentations at seminars. In summary, the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) is a superannuation Fund that would benefit employees at the time of retirement.",
    "At the same time, the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF) is expected to provide benefits to employees throughout their working life and also serve as a fund that spurs economic growth through investments in industry and commerce. It is not a pure superannuation fund. This is why there are so many benefit schemes by the ETF. It is believed that Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali\u2019s idea was to allocate an amount equivalent to 3% of the employees\u2019 earnings to the ETF, thereby funding industrial and commercial ventures and spurring economic growth. The dry docks in Colombo would never have seen the light of day if not for the investment by the ETF.",
    "Mostly, people were confused because the EPF and ETF bi-annual statements looked very similar. We decided to print our statements in a beige-pink colour and have the benefits printed overleaf. We even embarked on an advertising programme to make people aware of the benefits. People noticed the difference.",
    "Penalties for delayed payments were another bone of contention. Our Act allows a waiver of a penalty for late payments only if the delay was due to circumstances beyond the employer\u2019s control. Beyond the employer\u2019s control would be events such as floods, fires, other natural disasters, and the closure of a business, among other unforeseen circumstances. I would receive many requests to waive penalties for spurious reasons.",
    "Some were hilarious, like the payment cheque was given to a peon who had forgotten to bank it, or the bank closed one minute earlier than usual, or the vehicle that took the cheque broke down on the way. Many of my friends were quite upset with me for not providing them with the expected waivers. My hands were tied; I had to implement the law.",
    "Some CEOs argued with me at a meeting that, with many operational units, they were unable to meet the deadline in one month because all figures from branches and units had to be consolidated. Further, they accused me of not understanding the difficulty, because I was a public officer.",
    "I had a fantastic opening. I told them that I managed an operation with 4,500 employees, over twenty production units spread across the country, plus more than 15 retail units, and that I had consolidated and paid without any delay, except during the insurgency. I was referring to the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation, where I was the General Manager. Realising I had been on their side as an employer and that I came from the industry, they were shocked, and there were no more arguments.",
    "When estates were privatised and handed over to private sector management companies, they had huge cash flow problems in the first months. The treasury didn\u2019t bail them out when they were under Government management. All estate companies paid late, and an automatic penalty was imposed. One company contacted me, and I advised them on how to respond to the penalty notice, providing complete details of the circumstances and explaining why it was beyond their control.",
    "I used the powers vested in me and waived the penalty, covering myself in the process, because the detailed explanation for the delay was clear. Other companies requested a meeting with Mr Paskaralingam, Secretary to the Treasury, who called a meeting, and I was summoned. I explained the process, informed them of the correct procedure that should have been followed, and described the solution I provided to the company that contacted me.",
    "I asked them not to run to Mr Paskaralingam for everything, but to call me first, because I am the Chairman and I can provide a solution within the law. Mr Paskaralingam reiterated what I said. Some very senior chairmen of plantation companies did not expect this response from a young Chairman of the ETF. The matter was resolved to the satisfaction of everyone.",
    "The IBM System 34 computer we had was a disaster. It was seriously outdated, and the computerisation of member accounts was far behind. As a result, we were processing claims manually. Data entry was handled by 6 operators who were unable to cope with the workload.",
    "I initially decided to outsource data entry to clear the backlog, discussed a solution with IBM, obtained Cabinet approval, and after a long delay due to technical committee deliberations and tender Board deliberations, we ordered a new IBM machine. We had taken so long that the quoted machine was already outdated, and IBM was kind enough to offer the newer model at the same price. We had our tender board decisions challenged, and another committee was established to deliberate on the matter. It was such a hassle that not many people would want to go through such an exercise.",
    "Commissioning was another hassle, and the number of members was continuing to grow in the meantime. The arrears were never completed during my tenure. It continued to be a headache for many other Chairmen after me. We made some progress, though. The office had to be completely refurbished, including the installation of false floors to accommodate the data cables. I was disappointed that I couldn\u2019t finish what I had started. The new machine cost around LKR 25 million, and I was tasked with keeping the price within that range. We struggled to keep up with the workload. My instinct was to opt for a higher-capacity machine, but even the Ministry was hesitant to approve anything more. Our specifications were found to be short of what we actually needed. Many Ministry officials felt that I wanted a toy and said processing should be done manually, \u201cwithout wasting members\u2019 money\u201d. It was a different era.",
    "Since our fund was substantial, the Auditor General had a permanent office in our premises. Almost every week or two, we would receive an audit query. I was pleased with this because I felt safer with the oversight of another department. There were many issues that I had not been aware of and were able to remedy them.",
    "What irked me most were some comments in the draft report of the Auditor General after my first year in office. One comment was that I had sent my car for all repairs to Associated Motorways (AMW) without obtaining quotations from other garages. My vehicle was a Nissan Bluebird, and I always sent it for service and repairs to the agent AMW. I would have been insane if I had sent it to a roadside garage, considering it was an expensive car at the time. The second was that I had purchased a transportable cellular phone, which was hardly used, and it was termed an uneconomic transaction. It was a time when cellular phones were just being introduced and were so huge that they did not fit into a pocket.",
    "The transportable telephone was placed on a side table in my office for taking and receiving calls, only if the phones in the office or the entire building were out of order. Having to get daily quotations for 7-day call money rates from 26 banks when the phones went dead, we could use this telephone instead. In fact, in one instance, before this purchase, all the phones went dead, and we lost out on getting the best rates due to connectivity issues. Only the telex worked that day. Unfortunately, since we purchased the new cellular phone, we have not had a single telephone problem. It cost Rs 80,000/-.",
    "The third issue was the purchase of shares. Before my time, shares of Sampath Bank and Seylan Bank had been purchased. The ETF was expected to buy shares because one of its objectives was to promote economic growth through investments. These were new ventures, and anyone who has a smattering of commercial knowledge knows that a new venture takes a few years to build reserves and consolidate before declaring dividends. The Auditor General classified this as an uneconomic transaction because dividends were not received within 12 months.",
    "I met the Auditor General himself and challenged these findings. I asked the Audit Superintendent, who had conducted the audit, why it was uneconomic to go to the agent for repairing my official car, and asked him whether it wouldn\u2019t be worse if an unprofessional garage used counterfeit parts? I further asked him whether he too wouldn\u2019t consult a well-known doctor if he were confronted with a heart ailment, rather than seeking quotations from different doctors?",
    "The Auditor General immediately asked that the comment be deleted. The next was the cellular telephone, where I explained that it was for emergency use only. If there were a telecom failure and we lost just 0.5% because we were unable to obtain the best rates of the day, the loss would amount to millions of rupees. This, too, was accepted. However, the Auditor General refused to delete the comment about the share investments despite my proof that we had received additional shares through bonus shares and that the market price was higher than our original investment.",
    "However, he finally agreed to insert a comment stating that I had met him and explained that investments should not be judged solely by dividends, but also by the increase in market value, etc. The classification as an uneconomic transaction remained but my statement was included without comment, as seen in the published in the Annual Report of the ETF that year. The lesson is that although delegation is recommended in most management literature, some activities should not be delegated.",
    "It is situational. No subordinate of mine could have argued with the Auditor General due to their status level. Additionally, in both the private and state sectors, CEOs unfamiliar with functional skills are at the mercy of subject specialists. This is why I venerated the MBA at PIM at an early age, which transformed my management thinking and style.",
    "To celebrate the 10th anniversary, as a unifying mechanism for the staff, and as a means of blessing our institution, I suggested a pirith ceremony and a Catholic service instead of a tamasha. This was taken up well by our employees and they were in the process of organising both ceremonies when I was removed from my post due to fake information going to the President. This is fully described in a previous episode. The Minister then took control, and both religious ceremonies were cancelled; instead, he organised a tamasha with several Ministers and dignitaries, accompanied by numerous speeches.",
    "I was reappointed and returned in about two months. Strange things were happening now with staff members meeting with accidents, one lady dying during childbirth, and similar disasters. Many staff members told me that it was because we cancelled the religious ceremonies.",
    "I decided to restart organising the religious ceremonies. The Pirith was attended by the Prime Minister himself. On a side note, during the entire maha piritha that day, the PM tried to convince me to enter politics and work with him, saying that he had started as an apprentice under the Honourable A. Ratnayake, a former well-respected Minister. He failed to convince me. The catholic mass was attended by the archbishop himself and was a great success.",
    "Thereafter, all disastrous events came to a complete stop. No one in our office even got a scratch after the religious ceremonies. My belief in divine powers continued.",
    "Having realised that many in the private sector were unaware of the ETF benefit schemes, I devised several action plans to bring these schemes to the attention of members. I was instrumental in introducing several new benefit schemes, supplementing the existing death insurance and total disability insurance schemes. The new initiatives included free heart surgery at Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital, free intraocular lens implants after cataract surgery, and the grade 5 scholarship scheme. The last one was as a result of many of my friends and colleagues asking me how they could benefit from ETF schemes. My answer would surprise them.",
    "I said \u201cI hope you will never qualify for benefits because you must either die, or be totally and permanently disabled or need a cataract surgery, or heart surgery\u201d This made me think. We had schemes for \u201cnegative\u201d matters and none for \u201cpositive\u201d things. Then one of our employees suggested a new scheme to reward excellent performers of the grade 5 scholarship examination for children of members with a monetary gift deposited in a prescribed bank, to be used when the child reaches a particular age. This was also supported by the Minister, and it was implemented soon.",
    "When our advertising became successful, explaining coverage and earnings, our rate of membership growth surpassed that of the EPF. Workers were questioning the management whether the ETF is being paid on their behalf. Many ladies who managed their private estates would argue that they were unaware of EPF and ETF, and thus they were in violation of the law. I would tell them that the ignorance of the law is no excuse.",
    "I was told by some CEOs who were defaulters that I was disrupting their hitherto good industrial relations. Suddenly, I was summoned to the Cabinet subcommittee on investments and instructed to halt the campaign.",
    "I was told that the advertising campaign was scaring off foreign investors. The campaign was stopped, but the results continued to follow. With lunchtime programmes in companies relayed on the radio, and seminars to educate the private sector, the knowledge had diffused widely by then. Although the advertising was stopped, the number of new registrations increased notably. Years later, we were once again allowed to advertise.",
    "The next episode will continue with further stories and how a life was saved.",
