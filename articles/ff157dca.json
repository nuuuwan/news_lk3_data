    "Fitch Ratings-London-19 September 2025: Global trade volumes slowed noticeably in 2Q25, reversing the sharp increase recorded in 1Q25, a move which had been triggered by importers front-loading ahead of the implementation of US tariffs. An example of this trade volatility is shown by US imports in 1Q25 and 2Q25, when volumes increased 30% year on year (yoy) in March but then contracted to -2.8% yoy by June, as highlighted in the latest \u2018Fitch-20 Economic Monitor\u2019.",

Exports from Mexico, a major trading partner of the US, were flat in 2Q.",
    "Import growth slowed sharply in Brazil from 16% in 1Q25 to 4% in 2Q25, as past monetary tightening continues to weigh on domestic demand. In India, import volume growth rebounded from almost -13% yoy in 1Q25 to 11% yoy in 2Q25, while in Mexico it was flat.",
