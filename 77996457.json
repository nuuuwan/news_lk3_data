    "\u201cThis bill will regulate the money-lending business and the microfinance business to provide protection for [customers of each],\u201d the official said in a tweet Friday January 05 morning.",
    "\u201cThis will further repeal the microfinance act, No. 6 of 2016 to enhance greater protection,\u201d he added.",
    "The new body was announced in October 2023 following a proposal by President Ranil Wickremeinghe in his capacity as Minister of Finance that had been approved by the cabinet of ministers.",
    "\u201cAlthough there are about 11,000 microfinance institutions operating in the country, only five of them have been registered,\u201d State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in November.",
    "\u201cThe existence of unregistered microfinance institutions means that they are operating without any control,\u201d he said, adding that about three million people who had been inconvenienced by microfinance activities had organised themselves. \u201cThis makes it an international problem.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe will make it mandatory for microfinance institutions to register, and these institutions will be subject to the regulations and laws imposed by the Central Bank.\u201d",
    "Institutions and individuals who do not comply with this will be fined five million rupees and may face a prison sentence of up to five years, said Siyambalapitiya.",
    "Microfinance institutions mostly deal with rural low-income people. Siyambalapitiya said the government recognised this and the hardships they had to face, prompting them to adopt such a measure."
