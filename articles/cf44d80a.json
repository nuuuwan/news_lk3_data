    "\u201cGreat Pretender\u201d, originally sung in 1955 by Los Angeles based vocal group, The Platters, was given a new life by Freddie Mercury 32 years later, as he felt the song conveyed the way he felt about his public image. Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar to Indian-Parsi parents, became an icon of rock music, as a solo artiste as well as the frontman of \u2018Queen\u2019, and was sometimes referred to as \u2018The Great Pretender\u2019. Perhaps, he confirmed this at his death. Though he suffered from HIV/AIDS, kept it away from even the closest of his friend till he issued a statement just a day prior to his premature death at the age of 45 years, on 24 November 1991.",
    "Sri Lanka has been blessed with a number of \u2018great pretenders\u2019, perhaps more appropriately called charlatans, over the years. Though it was brought into focus by the fiasco involving the ex-speaker Asoka Ranwala it is not a new phenomenon. By the way, Ranwala is yet to locate his certificates! The fiasco has left an indelible blot on the new administration which was elected on the promise of integrity. President AKD demonstrated his lack of experience by not taking prompt action and some NPP MPs who audaciously claimed that they were not concerned about a vote of no-confidence against Ranwala as they had a steamroller majority in Parliament! They are the ones who clamoured for a system change, castigating the previous MPS who defeated the no-confidence motion against the disgraced minister of health?",
    "Although the Covid-19 pandemic is a distant memory, can we forget the charlatans who made a quick buck? Even prominent politicians foolishly consumed the Dhammika Peniya. Not to be outdone, a lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine in Galle concocted a pill, which he was able to market as a supplement! Wonder whether the Sri Lanka Medical Council took any action against this cheat?",
    "Even before the pandemic, \u2018Dr\u2019 Eliyantha White, sans any medical qualifications, was a much sought-after figure in Sri Lanka thanks to the advertising campaign led by no less of a person than the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa! During the pandemic, Dr White went a step further.",
    "Sadly, even Dr Anton Chitral Jayasuriya, known to his friends and colleagues as Kara ruined his reputation. He was 10 years my senior, qualifying in 1954 and obtaining MRCP in 1959. He worked as a Consultant Physician in the Department of Physical Medicine in General Hospital, Colombo. In 1974, he was selected, if I remember right with Dr Sylvia Perera, Anaesthetist, and Dr Stanmore de Alwis, Cardio-Thoracic Surgeon, to go on a three-months WHO fellowship to study acupuncture in China. Although the other two incorporated acupuncture into their practice gradually, Anton became a specialist in acupuncture overnight! In fact, he has written a number of books on acupuncture which are selling even today.",
    "Anton started an institute of his own and started awarding degrees. In 1981, having read a news item that President J R Jayewardene was to award degrees at the convocation of this institute, I, as the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Medical Association, brought that to the notice of Dr N J Wallooppillai, the President of SLMA. Awarding degrees in that manner was illegal as only universities accredited by the University Grants Commission could do so. We sought an urgent appointment with President Jayewardene and briefed him stressing that he was in a difficult situation as he was the Minister of Higher Education then, UGC being under his purview. JRJ attended the convocation but did not award the degrees! Anton sent a letter of demand to SLMA threatening to sue for damages. When I tabled that at the next council meeting there were a lot of worried faces but I was able to convince the council that the best course of action was to \u2018bin\u2019 the letter. Nothing further was heard from Anton!",
    "Anton then became a specialist in homeopathy and started the Open International University for Complementary Medicines (OIUCM or OIUCMED) in 1987. He stopped practising the brand of medicine he was qualified in. The Internet is full of information about him.",
    "A company marketing says on its website: \u201cHe [Anton] also served as homeopathy physician to Queen Elizabeth, free of charge. As patronization for his service, the Queen has gifted several exotic vehicles to him including a few Rolls-Royce cars.\u201d The Queen, as generous as she is, is not known to have gifted any cars to any physician, not even Prof Sir Huw Thomas, the long-standing Physician to the Queen!",
    "Writing on Anton\u2019s 90th birth anniversary, the Chairman of Sir Anton Jayasuriya Memorial Committee, who holds a Ph. D. in Public Relations (Honoris Causa) from Medicina Alternativa Open International University (90th birth anniversary of late Prof. Pundit Dr. Sir Anton Chitral Jayasuriya, a Sri Lankan newspaper has said he treated over 3.5 million people from over 140 countries without ever charging doctors\u2019 fees for consultation or treatment, both from local as well as foreign patients. In his 50 years of practice, even if he worked every day, Anton would have had to see 191 patients daily to achieve the figure of 3.5 million. Total impossibility! What is written should be plausible at least!!",
    "It is also mentioned that he got knighthoods from many countries. However, the UK is not one of them!",
    "\u201cThe late inimitable Emeritus Prof. Dr. Carlo Fonseka in his Commemoration Orations on Prof. Anton has said that \u201chis Alternate Medicines took the best from all systems. He promises to cure only those that can be cured, but always gives hope, courage and consoles them. Prof. Anton was a trailblazer, a pathfinder and a model Doctor. To meet him, is to have half your ailments cured. This placebo effect is due to his combination of personality, humour, wit and ambiguous statements that cut both ways.\u201d",
