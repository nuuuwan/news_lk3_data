    "U.S. President Donald Trump gave Hamas until Sunday evening to reach a last-chance agreement on his plan for Gaza\u2019s future or have \u201call Hell\u201d break out against the Palestinian militants.",
    "\u201cAn agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time,\u201d Trump wrote Friday on social media.",
    "\u201cEvery Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.\u201d",
    "Asked whether his group had finalised its response to Trump\u2019s Gaza plan, a Hamas official told Reuters late on Thursday: \u201cNot yet, intensive discussion is under way.\u201d",
    "The official said Hamas had held talks with Arab mediators, Turkey and Palestinian factions to shape \u201cthe Palestinian response.\u201d",
    "Trump had said on Tuesday he would give Hamas three to four days to accept the 20-point document, which calls on the group to disarm -- a demand it has previously rejected.",
    "The plan specifies an immediate ceasefire, an exchange of all hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the introduction of a transitional government led by an international body.",
    "The U.S. president, increasingly frustrated by his failure to secure a ceasefire, described Hamas as a \u201cruthless and violent threat in the Middle East\u201d that drew heavy retribution for its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.",
    "In his Truth Social post, Trump said remaining Hamas militants in Gaza are trapped and \u201cwill be hunted down, and killed\u201d without a deal, and warned \u201cinnocent Palestinians\u201d to leave for safe areas of Gaza without specifying where that would be."
