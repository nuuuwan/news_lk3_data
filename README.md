### Sri Lanka food prices sharply down after multiple VAT hikes: Analysis

After years of pushing the ideology that direct taxes are the best system tax, and indirect taxes were ‘regressive’ both politicians and ‘professionals’ received shock when income tax rates were raised to pay state worker salaries in 2022.

Politicians are usually against tax in a knee-jerk reaction from Western ideology

Now they want to reduce personal income tax. Personal income taxes have a major disadvantage because they undermine individual choice and take taxes away before an economic decision and transaction is made.

Value added tax is collected after an individual makes a choice, guiding the economy towards their needs and then the government collects a tax, analysts say.
