    "Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - Schoolchildren cannot wait, and their growth cannot be halted till we address their issues after resolving our own. They may opt for alternative educational systems in the meantime, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.",
    "While addressing the event marking the beginning of the 2024 school meal programme held today (25) at the Sujatha Girls\u2019 College in Narahenpita, he said if a suitable education system is not available in school, the children will definitely find alternative systems.",
    "\"Today we are facing that situation. Many children say good-bye to our government school education system and engage with alternative education systems. We need to solve our issues, but we need to make their future in the first place,\" the Minister said.",
    "\"The education programmes in a country are joined by technology and most of the countries have gone very far with the new technology systems. We are also following them,\" he said."
