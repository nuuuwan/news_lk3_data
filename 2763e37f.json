    "In a broader sense, conference means any interaction among people for conferring a particular topic. It is a\u00a0form of meeting of a large group of people who come together to discuss common issues and activities. The history and evolution of conferences and meetings extend across millennia, reflecting the shifting dynamics of human civilization and the quest for knowledge, collaboration, and progress.",
    "The primary objective of a conference is to facilitate the gathering and information sharing among individuals with common interests. This is achieved through presentations, discussions, and networking opportunities. Participants from diverse locations attend these conferences, presenting a valuable opportunity to acquire knowledge and establish professional connections.",
    "In ancient Greece, during the 5th to 4th centuries BCE, luminaries such as Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle engaged in philosophical discussions that laid the foundation for intellectual discourse. Similarly, in ancient India, during the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, Buddha disseminated his teachings through assemblies and meetings. The sermons and discussions conducted by Buddha with his disciples were pivotal in propagating his philosophy. These gatherings served as early forms of conferences, fostering both spiritual and intellectual development in ancient India.",
    "As civilisations progressed, in medieval Europe, from the 5th to the 15th century, there were conventions addressing theological and doctrinal matters, profoundly influencing religious ideologies and practices. Concurrently, trade fairs emerged as economic conferences during this period. Merchants and traders exchanged goods, ideas, and market trends, contributing to the economic development of medieval Europe.",
    "The Renaissance period, spanning the 14th to the 17th century, witnessed the revival of classical learning and a surge in intellectual pursuits. Academics, scientists, and artists convened in forums to discuss advancements in various fields, contributing significantly to the intellectual and cultural reawakening of Europe during this transformative period.",
    "The 17th century saw the establishment of the Royal Society in England, promoting scientific discourse and experimentation. As the scientific revolution gained momentum, conferences became integral to the dissemination of groundbreaking discoveries and advancements.",
    "The 19th century witnessed the emergence of professional associations and societies, each hosting conferences to facilitate collaboration and knowledge exchange within specific industries. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), founded in 1848, exemplifies this trend, becoming a model for other professional organizations.",
    "In the 20th century, technological advancements revolutionised the conference landscape. The advent of telecommunication allowed for virtual conferences, transcending geographical constraints. World War II played a pivotal role in the development of large-scale international conferences, such as the Yalta Conference in 1945, Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks in 1944 created the framework for international cooperation in the postwar world and shaping global political landscapes.",
    "Today, conferences have evolved into multifaceted events encompassing diverse fields, including academia, business, technology, and more. They feature keynote speakers, panel discussions, workshops, and interactive sessions. Virtual conferences have gained prominence, providing accessibility and inclusivity on a global scale.",
    "There exists a diverse array of conference types, each serving a distinct purpose and concentrating on specific themes.",
    "Professional/Business Conferences which unite business professionals to discuss various aspects of business management, fostering networking and idea exchange. CA Sri Lanka has organised successful conferences for over 30 years, and the 2023 conference by Certified Management Accountants featured a keynote address by CBSL governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe.",
    "Academic/Scientific/Educational Conferences empower scholars and researchers to present and discuss their work, fostering opportunities to stay updated on new research and connect with peers. State universities consistently organise successful conferences, with some even accounting for 3-5 conferences per year as conferences are organised by each faculty. Remarkably, SLIIT Uni stands out among non-state universities for its excellence in organizing international conferences at the faculty level.",
    "Social/Cultural Conferences bring people together to discuss various facets of culture and society, spanning topics from political issues to social trends while Peace Conferences convene representatives from different countries to discuss strategies for resolving wars or conflicts, the notable examples include the Congress of Vienna, the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and the Camp David Accords.",
    "Then there are Trade Conferences which gather representatives from different companies or industries to explore ways to enhance trade relationships. The attendees include business professionals, government officials, and economic experts. The primary objective is to promote trade and investment by identifying opportunities and eliminating barriers.",
    "While the term \u201cconference\u201d is used, Press or News Conferences specifically involve a representative of a company, organization, or government addressing reporters and responding to their questions. Typically conducted to announce new products, initiatives, or provide information about recent events, these conferences draw reporters from diverse news outlets and interested members of the public.",
    "Similarly, while the concept of a conference is straightforward, it\u2019s often confused with conventions, colloquia, or symposiums. In contrast, unconferences differ by lacking a top-down organisational hierarchy or sponsored presentations.",
    "Organising a successful conference involves more than just securing a digital screen rental; it requires careful planning and consideration. Executing a successful conference, especially without a profit motive, presents significant challenges. Unlike universities in developed countries benefiting from government funding, lucrative sponsorships and student fees, the noteworthy aspect is that Sri Lankan universities adeptly organize conferences within minimal budgets.",
    "Therefore, Sri Lankan universities face considerable hurdles in securing sponsors, given the limited interest shown by the business community in the research findings of these institutions. However, websites like https://allconferencealert.net/srilanka.php demonstrate that Sri Lanka hosts over 1000 conferences annually, averaging around 100 per month. Regrettably, a substantial portion of these conferences lacks academic rigor, with lax or non-existent peer-reviewed processes. Some conferences accept only abstracts, while others permit paper submissions just days before the conference dates. A prevalent characteristic of such conferences is their imposition of conference fees in US dollars, primarily targeting affluent academics from overseas. Unfortunately, many students and emerging academics devalue their research findings and expend their resources by presenting papers at these conferences.",
    "SLIIT Business School, the business faculty of Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), the largest Uni in Sri Lanka with over 25,000 students and eight campuses including Jaffna, Kandy and Matara, is organizing the 2nd International Conference on Sustainable & Digital Business (ICSDB 2023) to be held on December 14-15, 2023. SLIIT Business School offers this international conference with a significant difference incorporating its signature event ICSDB Excellence Awards that recognize business firms with substantial contribution to sustainable and digital business.",
    "ICSDB 2022 had three key eminent scholars namely Professor John Bessant from Exeter University of UK, Professor Jaideep Prabhu of University of Cambridge and Professor Muthu De Silva of Birkbeck, University of London as keynote speakers. The chief guest was Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Central Bank Governor.

    "The inauguration ICSDB 2023 will be held on December 14, 2023 at the Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla, Sri Lanka with the participation of over 200 business leaders and CXOs from diverse industry sectors, researchers from Sri Lanka and other regions, and academics.
