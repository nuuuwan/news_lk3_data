### United Nations arms embargo, other sanctions reimposed on Iran

The United Nations reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran on Saturday following a process triggered by key European powers that Tehran has warned will be met with a harsh response.

Britain, France and Germany triggered the return of sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council over accusations the country has violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.

The end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites.

U.N. sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday (0000 GMT). Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. this week.

### The Importance Of Education In Emergencies For Eliminating The Dependency Mindset

*2025-09-27 22:03:58* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-importance-of-education-in-emergencies-for-eliminating-the-dependency-mindset/) · `en`

Emergencies—whether natural disasters, armed conflicts, pandemics, or economic crises—disrupt the normal functioning of societies. In such contexts, the education system often collapses, leaving children and communities vulnerable to a “dependency mindset.” This mindset is characterized by reliance on external aid rather than building self-reliance and sustainable solutions.

Education plays a critical role in preventing and eliminating this dependency. By continuing learning even during crises, education nurtures resilience, independence, and problem-solving capabilities, enabling individuals and communities to rebuild their futures

The dependency mindset refers to a psychological and social state where individuals or communities rely excessively on external aid rather than developing internal capacities to solve their own problems.
