    "Several religious leaders had filed this petition seeking an order to prosecute Pastor Jerome Fernando under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) over his derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.",
    "Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.",

    "After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on November 29.\u00a0 As per an Appeals Court directive, the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island.",
    "He was first placed behind bars on remand on December 01, following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a few hours after he arrived at the premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day.",
