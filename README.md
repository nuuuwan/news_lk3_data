In about ten days, on November 5, the US will have its quadrennial presidential election along with its biennial House and Senate elections. The presidential election is literally down to the wire, and the two candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are fighting it out at the margins in the so called seven swing states. At the time of writing, it is a total toss up and there is no certainty about the outcome.

In a presidential election year, the American voters mark their ballots to elect their president for four years, a third of their 100 senators for six years, and all 435 members of the House of Representatives for two years. The elections to the Senate and the House are called the ‘down ballot races’, below the main presidential runoff.

Serving in the police from 1965 to 2000, and in retirement for two and a half decades thereafter, I was witness to violence which followed every election with monotonous regularity.

''පාර්ලිමේන්තුවේ 225 ම එක යි. අපේ ඡන්දයෙන් ගිහින් සුර සැප විඳිනවා.''

''ඕකට ගිය හැටි යි, ගියාට පස්සේ මන්දිර ගහපු හැටි යි අපි දන්නවා.''

''මන්ත්‍රීවරු වැඩි හරියක් කරන්නේ වරප්‍රසාදවලට මුවා වෙලා කාටහරි මඩක් ගහන එක.''

ඉහත දැක්වෙන්නේ, රටේ නීති සම්පාදනයේ උත්තරීතරම ආයතනය වන පාර්ලිමේන්තුව, එහි මන්ත්‍රීවරුන් සහ ඔවුන්ට හිමි වන වරප්‍රසාද පිළිබඳව රටේ ක්‍රම වෙනසක් වෙනුවෙන් හඬ නගන ජනතාව පසුගිය කාලයේදී අතරින් අසන්නට ලැබුණු අදහස් කිහිපයකි.

ජනතා මනාපයෙන් පාර්ලිමේන්තුවට තේරී පත්වන මන්ත්‍රීවරුන්ට හිමි වන සුවිශේෂී වරප්‍රසාද තිබේ. එම වරප්‍රසාද භුක්ති විඳින මන්ත්‍රීවරුන් ජනතාවට සහ රටට සාධාරණය ඉටු කර තිබේ ද? යන සංවාදය යළිත් කරළියට පැමිණ තිබේ. ඒ, ඊළඟ පාර්ලිමේන්තුවට මන්ත්‍රීවරුන් තෝරා ගැනීම සඳහා තවත් සති දෙකක පමණ කාලයක් ඉතිරිව තිබියදී ය.

මැතිවරණ වියදම් සීමා කිරීමට නීති පනවා තිබුණ ද අපේක්ෂකයන් බොහෝ දෙනෙකු සිය ප්‍රචාරණ කටයුතු සඳහා විශාල ධනස්කන්ධයක් වැය කරන බව නිරීක්ෂණය වෙයි.
