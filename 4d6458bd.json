    "The suspect Roshan Dissanayaka was produced before the Naula (Paldeniya) Magistrate's Court on charges of threatening a Member of Parliament, breaching Parliamentary privileges and criminal intimidation.",
    "Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema appearing for the prosecution submitted to Court that the suspect had sent threatening messages to the mobile phone of State Minister Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon on May 10, 2022, immediately after the death of MP Amarakeerthi Athukorala and his security officer and the aftermath of the 9th of May when the State Minister's house had already been burned to the ground. He further said the suspect had also posted threatening facebook posts even after his statement was recorded by police.",
    "The Senior State Counsel further submitted that the constitutional right to freedom of speech does not extend to illegal conduct and objected to granting bail to the suspect. He further argued that the suspect had violated all four conditions set out in the Bail Act. He argued that breach of Parliamentary privileges could also be tried in parallel by the Supreme Court.",
    "Defence Counsel who appeared on behalf of the suspect argued that the incident happened over a dispute between the Minister and the suspect and that the suspect was not part of the Aragalaya.",
    "After considering the submissions made by the both parties, Magistrate Nishadi Chandrawansa refused to grant bail to the suspect and remanded him till August 3."
