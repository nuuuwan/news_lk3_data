Since Sri Lanka is a country that provides free education from kindergarten to university, Sri Lanka has a leading position in terms of literacy in South Asia.",

    "During an economic crisis, household indebtedness can sharply rise due to the hardship experienced by households facing income reductions, job losses, and financial uncertainties.

    "The Food Consumption Score (FCS) is a measure used to evaluate a household\u2019s current status of food consumption.

    "Nationally, the average Food Consumption Score (FCS) was found to be 70.2. FCS is a composite indicator that considers the dietary diversity, frequency and nutritional importance of the food groups consumed by the households. Based on this indicator, 93% of the households were categorised as having acceptable food consumption while 7% had borderline or poor consumption.",
    "According to the World Food Program (WFP), reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI) is an indicator used to compare the hardship faced by households due to shortage of food. Results of the survey indicate that rCSI of Sri Lanka is 7.48. It is 6.48, 7.66 and 8.05 for Urban, Rural and Estate sectors respectively.",
    "Higher rCSI values signify more acute challenges in dealing with food shortages and meeting basic nutritional needs within each specific sector. A higher rCSI score indicates that households are employing more severe coping mechanisms due to food shortages. It can include actions like relying on less preferred and less expensive food options, borrowing food or seeking assistance from relatives or other sources, reducing the number of meals consumed in a day and taking drastic measures like restricting the consumption of adults so that small children can eat adequately. These measures often involve compromises in the quality, quantity, and regularity of meals, highlighting the need for interventions and support to alleviate food shortages in these areas.",
    "Households not only adapted their food consumption habits but also employed diverse livelihood-based coping strategies to address the challenges of inadequate food access and availability. Some of these strategies may have adverse effects on their income generation and ability to respond to future shocks. The survey revealed that 21.9% of the households nationwide had implemented crisis strategies to address the scarcity of food or financial constraints. This was followed by stress strategies, and it is about 19.2%. Notably, in the rural sector, this crisis strategy used proportion rose to 22.8% of households."
