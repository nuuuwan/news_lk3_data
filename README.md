ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s 2025 growth has been kept at 3.9 percent by the Asian Development Bank, lower than trend indications while inflation has been slashed to just 0.5 percent, according to a regional outlook issued in September.

“Sri Lanka’s growth forecast for 2025 is unchanged, but the 2026 projection is revised down, as the 20 percent US tariff is expected to weaken exports and dampen consumption due to potential job losses,” the ADB report said.

Sri Lanka’s economy grew 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2025, higher than projected by most agencies, as the central bank missed its inflation target of 5 percent.

Sri Lanka’s inflation is also helped by better US monetary policy with commodity prices easing from around the second half of 2022 after the US hiked rates.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents appeared to make little progress at a White House meeting aimed at heading off a government shutdown that could disrupt a wide range of services as soon as Wednesday.

Both sides emerged from the meeting saying the other would be at fault if Congress fails to extend government funding beyond a Tuesday midnight deadline (0400 GMT Wednesday).

“I think we’re headed to a shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said.

Democrats say any agreement to extend that deadline must also preserve expiring health benefits, while Trump’s Republicans insist health and government funding must be dealt with as separate issues.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the two sides “have very large differences.”
