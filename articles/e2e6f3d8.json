    "After the international press conference on 3 September 2024, the Frankfurt trade fair organisers Ambiente, Christmasworld and Creativeworld have embarked on a press roadshow.",
    "On-site networking events provide a unique opportunity to engage in a dialogue. The events reach journalists from over 30 countries and underline the focus of the three leading consumer goods trade fairs on the international networking of the industry. They lay the foundation for a strong start of the 2025 order season.",
    "The international online press conference and the press events in Buenos Aires, Frankfurt am Main, Los Angeles, New York City and S\u00e3o Paulo marked the start of the Consumer Goods Fairs 2025 press roadshow: Athens, Barcelona, Lisbon, London, Milan, Mexico City, Paris, Riga, Rotterdam, Warsaw and Zurich are going to follow.",
    "Until the end of October, the Frankfurt trade fair makers will be answering questions from journalists from over 30 countries. \u201cPersonal contact is the be-all and end-all when it comes to getting people excited about our trade fairs, especially in the consumer goods industry. Our roadshow is the perfect occasion for journalists to get prepared for their trip to Frankfurt next February. And at the same time, it is extremely important for us as trade fair organisers to see and hear live how the markets we focus on are currently developing,\u201d explains Messe Frankfurt Vice President Consumer Goods Fairs Julia Uherek, referring to the intensive weeks of exchange that will allow delving more deeply into the innovations and highlights presented on the press conference on 3 September 2024."
