    "NPP presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake has pledged to abolish VAT on food, healthcare, and education, under a future JVP/NPP government. He is not alone in making such promises. President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself has undertaken to reduce taxes. He told a group of university administrators on Tuesday (13) that the government was \u2018looking at adjustments to the personal tax structure to provide some relief to the taxpayers\u2019; he said he had received two proposals in that regard\u2013\u2013one from the Treasury, which is under him, and the other from the IMF. By making that claim, he has unwittingly belied his much-advertised contention that Sri Lanka\u2019s agreement with the IMF is a fait accompli. The SJB has also promised to bring taxes down to an affordable level through negotiations with the IMF.",
    "Thus, all main presidential candidates have pledged to reduce taxes in the event of securing the presidency. Such promises no doubt resonate with the people, who are reeling from huge tax hikes, which have made it extremely difficult for them to keep the wolf from the door. But how feasible is it to slash taxes overnight without jeopardising the economic recovery process? What are the alternative ways of boosting state revenue significantly to offset the losses that proposed tax cuts are bound to entail?",
    "Nobody likes taxes or tax hikes. The bitter truth, however, is that tax increases are among the factors that have helped achieve a semblance of economic stability in this country however hurtful they may be.",
    "One may recall that the public rejoiced when the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government introduced politically-motivated tax cuts purportedly as an economic stimulus. Those ill-conceived measures had no positive impact on the economy. Instead, they led to a crippling rupee-crisis, and money had to be printed excessively to bridge the yawning gap between state revenue and expenditure, and an increase in the money supply resulted in a rise in inflation and an unprecedented depreciation of the rupee against all major foreign currencies. The country\u2019s forex exchange had been dropping rapidly, but no urgent steps were taken to shore them up with the help of the IMF. The current economic crisis came as no surprise.",
    "The presidential candidates had better refrain from undertaking to perform tasks such as slashing taxes overnight in case of being voted into office. If the public is given false hope, the successful presidential candidate will not be able to win the next parliamentary election without decreasing taxes first. Perhaps, he may be able to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in the short run if the general election is held in quick succession, but trouble will be inevitable thereafter unless the promised tax relief is given forthwith; trade unions will take to the streets in such an eventuality.",
    "Theoretically, if revenue collection is streamlined with drastic action being taken to widen the tax net and rid Inland Revenue, the Customs, the Excise Department, etc., of corruption and other malpractices, it may be possible to ease the current tax burden on the public to some extent. But that is an uphill task, the accomplishment of which will require not only a Herculean effort but also considerable time. So, how will the next President be able to bring taxes down immediately?",
    "The presidential candidates will do well to take the public into confidence and tell them the unpalatable, unvarnished truth that economic relief will take a little longer to materialise lest the latter should start demanding promised relief immediately after the presidential election.",
    "Above all, the presidential candidates ought to convince the public that they are willing to manage state funds frugally, adopt austere measures themselves and share in the people\u2019s woes. But, sadly, given the manner in which they are throwing money around, which has gone unaccounted for, and their efforts to secure the Election Commission\u2019s nod for spending billions of rupees each on their election campaigns, it is doubtful whether they are serious about prioritising the people\u2019s interests over their own, much less putting the country before self.",
