    "All Baghdad embassy staff were safe, the Swedish foreign ministry press office said in a statement, condemning the attack and highlighting the need for Iraqi authorities to protect diplomatic missions.",
    "Thursday\u2019s demonstration was called by supporters of Shi\u2019ite cleric Muqtada Sadr to protest the second planned Koran burning in Sweden in weeks, according to posts in a popular Telegram group linked the influential cleric and other pro-Sadr media.",
    "Sadr, one of Iraq\u2019s most powerful figures, commands hundreds of thousands of followers whom he has at times called to the streets, including last summer when they occupied Baghdad\u2019s heavily-fortified Green Zone and engaged in deadly clashes.",
    "Swedish news agency TT reported on Wednesday that Swedish police granted an application for a public meeting outside the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm on Thursday.",
    "The application says the applicant seeks to burn the Koran and the Iraqi flag, TT reported.",

    "Most protesters had withdrawn, with a few dozen milling around outside the embassy.",
    "Late last month, Sadr called for protests against Sweden and the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador after the Koran burning in Stockholm by an Iraqi man.",
