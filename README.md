MPs Mahinda and Namal Rajapaksa, by backing a separate candidate instead of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, risk moving to the opposition in the next parliamentary elections. The Sri Lanka PA's committee faces a crisis as it prepares to field a candidate against the government's wishes, potentially leading to internal conflict and weakening the party's stance ahead of the polls.
