    "Claims Govt. determined to go ahead with new media legislation despite opposition",
    "Accuses Ministers of misleading the public by claiming the proposed legislation is merely a list of proposals",
    "Accuses Govt. of launching a systematic and malicious plan to suppress the media to curb possible uprising of people",
    "Promises to defeat Govt. efforts to enact the legislation by challenging it before the courts",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris on Monday said the Government is determined to completely annihilate the freedom of media in the country by introducing the Broadcast Authorities Act.",
    "Peiris told the media that the Government is proving to be inflexible and has expressed its intention to forge ahead with enacting the new legislation. \u201cThe President in a recent speech at an event in Homagama confirmed this,\u201d he said.",
    "Peiris stated that despite the assertions made by Government ministers that the proposed legislation is simply a collection of proposals, the term \u201cAct\u201d is consistently mentioned throughout the draft. He accused the ministers of dishonesty and argued that the presented draft is not merely a list of proposals, contrary to their claims.",
    "The MP accused the Government of launching a systematic and malicious plan to suppress the media. \u201cIt is evident the matter will be focused on at the UNHRC sessions in Geneva which have now commenced. It will be unavoidable,\u201d Peiris opined.",
    "According to the MP, the Government\u2019s latest move will only further harm Sri Lanka\u2019s image and human rights record. \u201cIt will be yet another black mark. This is an unfortunate situation,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u00a0Peiris said despite the harm the legislation may cause to the country\u2019s image internationally, the Government is determined to enact it in fears of an imminent uprising of the people due to the Government\u2019s decision to restructure domestic debt which in turn will lead to the devaluation of the people\u2019s employees provident fund monies.",
    "The MP said the results will be disastrous and therefore the Government is attempting to implement a powerful mechanism to curb a possible uprising. \u201cThe new legislation is part of that mechanism,\u201d he said.",
    "Peiris said the Opposition will defeat the move and will take all steps necessary including challenging the legislation before the courts."
