### Harsha raises concerns over Bribery Commission’s financial management

*2025-09-12 08:34:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112418/harsha-raises-concerns-over-bribery-commissions-financial-management) · `en`

The Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF), MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, has raised concerns regarding the financial management of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), questioning whether the institution can be considered truly independent under its current framework.

He made these remarks when CIABOC officials appeared before the Committee to discuss the Commission’s budget estimates.

“As far as I know, there is a macro-level issue here. The fundamental question is what we mean by independence. If an institution does not have financial independence, how can it claim to be independent? The issue then arises as to how the powers granted are exercised, and who has the authority to appoint the necessary staff.”

Addressing the Committee, CIABOC Director General Ranga Dissanayake stated that although provisions had been made to establish a dedicated staff for the Commission, this had not been implemented even after nearly two years.

### World Bank report slams Sri Lanka VAT amid poverty from monetary meltdown: analysis

*2025-09-12 08:19:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/world-bank-report-slams-sri-lanka-vat-amid-poverty-from-monetary-meltdown-analysis-240310/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – A World Bank report on Sri Lanka’s tax has slammed value added tax hike, though rate cuts and money printing for potential output targeting by macro-economists led to a collapse of the rupee and inflation that was the core reason for a dramatic rise in poverty.

The rhetoric against VAT may have negative consequences for Sri Lanka for which the poor will eventually pay a higher price if it leads to a repeat of tax cuts like in 2019, observers say.

The recent steep rise in Sri Lanka VAT was also a result of having to pay the salaries of a bloated public sector, including 100,000 development officers and other unemployed graduates hired into public service, who apparently do not have offices to sit and work according to statements made in parliament as well as a legacy large military from a civil war.

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced on Thursday to 27 years and three months in prison hours after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, dealing a powerful rebuke to one of the world’s most prominent far-right populist leaders.

The conviction ruling by a panel of five justices on Brazil’s Supreme Court, who also agreed on the sentence, made the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in the country’s history to be convicted for attacking democracy, and drew disapproval from the Trump administration.

“This criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present and its future,” Justice Carmen Lucia said before her vote to convict Bolsonaro, referring to a history checkered with military coups and attempts to overthrow democracy.

There was ample evidence that Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, acted “with the purpose of eroding democracy and institutions,” she added.

Feedback is the Breakfast of Champions is a popular phrase attributed to the author Ken Blanchard. His succinct writings using One Minute themes have a global following. The Deming cycle PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) has embedded the feedback loop into the top management governance cycle and is a gold standard in management practices. Our PDCA is more akin to Politics-Diatribe-Constituency-Attrition in practice. However, in our nation’s planning, feedback is not exactly visible. Our breakfast of short eats or loads of carbs with some sambol and curry has led to more NCD prevalence than progress.
