    "CAASL Chairman Sunil Jayarathne and officials discuss on the Batticaloa Airport runway",
    "The Government is preparing to transform Batticaloa into a hub for tourism and strengthen the national economy. The initiative aims to position the Eastern Province town as a unique tourist destination by capitalising on its geographical advantages, historical significance, and natural beauty.",
    "The Government expects the project to unlock fresh tourism opportunities in the Eastern Province and contribute to broader efforts to diversify Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism offering.",
    "Under the proposed plan, the Government is exploring aerial entertainment and adventure sports in a bid to boost recreational and adventure aviation activities that would make Batticaloa Airport an attraction for both local and foreign tourists. The cultural heritage and scenic environment surrounding the airport are expected to complement these efforts.",
    "Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) officials, led by Chairman Sunil Jayarathne, recently visited the Batticaloa Airport to assess opportunities and discuss logistics. The delegation included Director General Captain Daminda Rambukwella and Deputy Director Generals Rehan Wanniappa and M.A.K. Prasanna. The visit was conducted under the guidance of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake and Deputy Minister Janith Ruwan Kodithuwakku.",
    "Jayarathne acknowledged that although Batticaloa Airport was developed with public funds and integrated into the domestic airport network, its current operations remain minimal. \u201cWe had to look into ways to get rid of that situation and bring aircraft to this airport in a way that would benefit the public as well as the national economy,\u201d he said.",
    "Alongside tourism-focused initiatives, the CAASL also plans to expand airline operations at Batticaloa. The regulatory body is encouraging operators to deploy aircraft with maximum permissible capacity, a move aimed at ensuring profitability for both passengers and investors, while enhancing regional connectivity."
