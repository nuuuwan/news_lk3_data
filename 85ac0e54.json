    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Bank for Everyone, DFCC Bank, has launched a new initiative to support the education of children in the country by promoting a culture of learning while exploring the world through books. The \u201cDFCC Read the Way\u201d programme aims to provide educational assistance by donating books to disadvantaged children in Sri Lanka, particularly those who face financial difficulties in accessing quality education. The programme seeks to empower and embolden children by fostering a culture of reading and providing them with the necessary tools to succeed in life and become future leaders.",
    "Guided by its Sustainability Strategy and vision for 2030, education is one of the 6 Es- the 6 cross-cutting themes that the Bank focuses on, in addition to Elderly, Environment, Exercise, Emergency Relief and Entrepreneurship. The 6 Es are inspired and sustained by DFCC Bank\u2019s sustainability purpose, \u2018Contributing towards a resilient Sri Lanka.\u2019 Thus, the DFCC Read the Way initiative is one of many ongoing initiatives by DFCC Bank to uplift education in Sri Lanka, alongside flagship programmes such as \u201cDFCC Samata English\u201d and the \u201cDFCC Education Scholarship Programme, conducted in collaboration with Caritas Sri Lanka \u2013 SEDEC.",
