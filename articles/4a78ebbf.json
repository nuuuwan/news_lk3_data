    "BoardPAC has proudly earned the Carbon Neutral Certificate for 2022 from the Sri Lanka Climate Fund (SLCF), an organisation operating under the Environment Ministry committed to fostering a low-carbon business economy and promoting sustainable lifestyle choices.",
    "This remarkable achievement underscores BoardPAC\u2019s dedication to environmental responsibility and is a key milestone in its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) journey.",
    "For the second consecutive year, BoardPAC has secured this prestigious certification by offsetting its organisation-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, after being audited to the specifications of the ISO 14064-1:2018 standard.",
    "BoardPAC was founded with a vision to revolutionise board meetings through the power of technology, allowing companies to eliminate the need for cumbersome printed documents and transition to a paperless workflow. To date, BoardPAC has assisted clients from over 40 countries in transforming their board meetings into efficient, eco-friendly processes, resulting in the preservation of more than 16,000 trees per annum on average.",
    "BoardPAC Co-Founder and Executive Director Lakmini Wijesundera commended this achievement and added: \u201cWe enable boards of large corporations and global banks, including Forbes Global 2000 companies, to have a paperless and secure method of conducting meetings and maintaining records. Currently, there is a global shift in focus towards ESG and making their corporations sustainable. As a facilitator in that process, we felt it was important to be carbon neutral ourselves.\u201d",
    "Over the past years, BoardPAC has worked to further its commitment to sustainability with various initiatives. These include maintaining a paperless office environment and enabling remote work for employees, thus reducing overall fuel consumption. Another commendable initiative is the company\u2019s tree planting program, where new seedlings are planted in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to promote the long-term growth of urban forests helping generate oxygen for future generations to come.",
    "Additionally, BoardPAC operates a dedicated CSR team, focused on waste reduction. Each month, waste, including food, plastic, and paper, is measured, and every employee strives to minimise waste, contributing to a better environment.",
    "Former Environment Ministry Secretary and SLCF Chairman Dr. Anil Jasinghe stated: \u201cI extend my congratulations to BoardPAC for attaining carbon neutral certification using the global ISO standard. Let this achievement inspire other companies in Sri Lanka to embark on this journey, contributing to the development of a sustainable IT industry.\u201d",
    "The Carbon Neutral Certificate bestowed upon BoardPAC is a well-deserved recognition of its unwavering commitment to sustainability. This achievement would not have been possible without the wholehearted participation of BoardPAC\u2019s employees, whose dedication to this cause is truly commendable. It reflects the company\u2019s core values and its ongoing mission to champion sustainability on a global scale."
