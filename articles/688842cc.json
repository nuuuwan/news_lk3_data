  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government of India has released the first installment, amounting to around USD 2.5 Million for the installation of an advanced signalling and telecommunication system along the Maho\u2013Anuradhapura Railway Line.",
    "This marks another key milestone in India\u2013Sri Lanka cooperation in the railway sector, the Indian High Commission in Colombo stated.",
    "The project was jointly launched by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi during the recent high-level visit in April 2025. Initially envisaged as a Line of Credit (LoC) project at a cost of USD 14.89 million, it was later converted into a grant by the Government of India during the State Visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in December 2024. It is being executed by Indian Public Sector Undertaking, Ircon International Limited.",
    "With Indian assistance, the tracks on the Northern Line have been upgraded to support train speeds of up to 100 kmph. Complementing this, an advanced signalling system will enhance passenger safety while increasing the frequency and efficiency of train services. The system also provides real-time tracking of train positions within each block section, ensures centralized monitoring of the entire section from a modern Control Centre, and facilitates the simultaneous reception and dispatch of trains at stations, optimizing operations and reducing delays. Preliminary work has commenced, and the project is scheduled for completion by August 2026, the High Commission added further."
