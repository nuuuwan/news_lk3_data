    "Notes Jayasekara\u2019s name never appeared in earlier investigations or inquiries",
    "Claims Opposition now trying to link unrelated incidents to case to divert focus",
    "Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday alleged the Opposition was attempting to shield the true masterminds behind the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks, a move he claimed mirrored the actions of the previous Rajapaksa administration.",
    "He made these remarks at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, when queries were posed on the no-confidence motion against Defence Deputy Minister Major General (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekara.",
    "When asked if the Government would treat Jayasekara in the same manner as other officials under investigation, including former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and former SIS chief Nilantha Jayawardena; Dr. Jayatissa dismissed the suggestion, saying the Government would not be swayed by political manoeuvres.",
    "\u201cWe will not fall for these tricks brought about by the Opposition from time to time,\u201d he said.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa claimed that during the initial, \u201chaphazard\u201d investigations, Jayasekara\u2019s name had never been raised by the faction led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa.",
    "He argued that now, with investigations being conducted more systematically to identify both the mastermind and those who enabled the attacks politically, the Opposition was trying to \u201clink all kinds of incidents\u201d to the case.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa said the CID was focusing on individuals who failed to act despite having access to credible intelligence prior to the attacks, adding that Jayasekara\u2019s name had not been mentioned in the Parliamentary Investigation Committee hearings or the Presidential Commission of Inquiry.",
    "\u201cThe reason they are suddenly remembering these names is because the Opposition wishes to hide the real mastermind and the real accused. We earlier thought only the Rajapaksas wished to do this. Now it\u2019s apparent the Opposition does too,\u201d he stressed.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa said the Government welcomed the no-confidence motion, as it would provide an opportunity to present information that had not been previously disclosed during earlier investigations."
