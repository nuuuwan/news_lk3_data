*2024-08-26 14:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/unseating-of-harin-and-manusha/) · `en`

In fact such a determination was long overdue since defections have become all too common in recent times. There are examples of some MPs continuing to hold cabinet office even with changes of government; so much so, some of these long jumpers are always on board whichever government holds office.

Australian employees can now ignore work emails and calls thanks to a new “right to disconnect” law designed to curb those and other intrusions into personal lives.

The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.

Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.

“Before we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day,” said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.

“Now, globally it’s the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday.”

President Asif Ali Zardari and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in separate statements called the attack “barbaric” and vowed that those who were behind it would not escape justice.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has re-implemented the fertilizer subsidy program aimed at reducing costs for tea cultivators in Sri Lanka.

As part of this initiative, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has taken steps to reduce the prices of five key fertilizer types produced by the State Fertilizer Company.

Under this program, the cost of a 50kg bag of tea fertilizer has been reduced by Rs. 4,000, offering substantial relief to tea planters across the country.

The fertilizer types subjected to this price reduction include T 200, T 750, U 709, U 834, and T 65.

With a total investment of Rs. 2,400 million, this subsidy program is fully funded by the Sri Lanka Tea Board, ensuring that no government funds are utilized, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Mahinda Amaraweera said.

### Israel and Hezbollah in major missile exchange as escalation fears grow

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel’s military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv.

Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah’s backer Iran and Israel’s main ally the United States.

As long as the people keep asking for giveaways as against conditions for life improvement, the takaran era will not end – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

It is because of this increased literacy that people are asking politicians making promises to also state how the money will be found. The politician who some time back promised to zero out VAT, has now retreated to saying that VAT will be removed for educational and healthcare services (leaving aside the fact that most of these services are already exempt from VAT). Even then, he is being challenged to explain how the shortfall is going to be covered

First, knowledge must be created by its universities and research institutions. Then, such knowledge should be made available to prospective entrepreneurs for use in commercially viable productions known as innovation. Once the initial entrepreneurs become successful, that knowledge, both invention and innovation, should be disseminated or diffused across the economy to facilitate others to imitate the original inventors and innovators

In the high-stakes world of trade and logistics, corruption at Sri Lanka’s customs, IRD, ports, and airports is not just an inconvenience—it’s a crisis that’s crippling the nation’s export sector. Outdated, manual systems have become breeding grounds for corruption, where bribery and inefficiency rule, bleeding exporters dry and stifling economic growth. The country stands at a critical juncture, where the only viable path forward is the digitalisation of customs and trade operations.

These antiquated, paper-based customs processes are no match for the demands of the modern global economy, where speed, accuracy, and transparency are paramount. Instead, they are plagued by errors, deliberate delays, and a lack of accountability, allowing corrupt practices to thrive unchecked. As global trade standards become stricter, the need for transparent, secure, and efficient customs operations has never been more urgent.
