Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Arjuna Herath recently met with Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council (SLSC) Chairman Sean Van Dort and representatives from the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Secretary General Yohan Lawrence and Brandix Group Head of Logistics Taiyoob Ahamed to discuss critical issues affecting the country’s export industry.

The talks focused on enhancing security measures and operational efficiency to safeguard Sri Lanka’s reputation in the global market.

Pilferage at crucial inspection points was highlighted as a key concern, with the SLSC reporting significant losses due to thefts at the Central Verification Terminal (CVT), allegedly involving Customs and BOI inspection officers, and industry-related wharf representatives. Incidents of theft of high-value merchandise occurring after cargo handovers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) Cargo Village have also been reported, resulting in international buyers submitting shortage claims.

### Poverty of CBSL’s monetary policies: Part II

*2024-11-27 06:09:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Poverty-of-CBSL-s-monetary-policies-Part-II/4-769738) · `en`

High domestic interest rates on Government debt, combined with the absence of Central Bank intervention to purchase newly issued debt, will escalate the domestic debt servicing burden

The present article expands on the loss of control by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) of interest rates that we developed in Part I. In Part I the focus was money market or short-term interest rates. In the present article the focus is long-term interest rates, particularly interest rates on long-term Government debt.

The article makes two key points in this regard. Firstly, the CBSL has not only lost control over money market or short-term interest rates, as argued in Part I, but also over long-term interest rates, specifically those on long-term Government debt i.e., on Government debt exceeding one year. Secondly, this loss of control stems partly from the CBSL’s inability to regulate short-term money market rates and partly from the provisions of the new Central Bank Act (CBA) passed in 2023.

### Blunder by new Government: No fertiliser to paddy farmers

*2024-11-27 06:02:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Blunder-by-new-Government-No-fertiliser-to-paddy-farmers/4-769737) · `en`

The current Government’s biggest blunder is the neglect of fertiliser to paddy farmers

Over the past few weeks, TV channel ‘Derana’ reported on a number of occasions, the plight of the paddy farmers in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Amparai districts due to non-availability of fertiliser for their paddy cultivation. But the Government TV channels were silent over the issue.

Maha rainy season started in early October as usual and will continue until early January. Rains start in early October during the evenings and intensity will increase reaching a maximum in December and rains will end in early January, allowing the farmers to harvest from late January onwards.

The paddy farmers prepare fields after first rains having softened the grounds, mostly with tractors. With increase in rains, fields become muddy and are prepared for sowing of seed paddy generally in early November.

### New regime and its representation problem

*2024-11-27 05:57:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-regime-and-its-representation-problem/4-769735) · `en`

The symbolic exclusion signalled by the missing Muslim at the highest level of governance is significant and no amount of patronising rhetoric about our collective Sri Lankanness is going to address this sense of exclusion

The change that the new election has brought to the country is unprecedented. We have a woman Prime Minister (that many of us in the academic and activist communities know) and we have several young women in Parliament. Historically, since independence, we have only had 5% representation at any given moment. Now we have close to 10%. And that too through elections and only one through the national list.

### Entrepreneurship in the 21st century

Last week marked Global Entrepreneurship Week; with our world on the brink of catastrophe in so many respects – conflict, climate, inequality – we have never needed the involvement of youth in defining entrepreneurial solutions to these problems, more than now. I was privileged to join the NIBM School of Business in exploring what entrepreneurship looks like from a practitioner’s perspective.

The good news is that everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. Less good is the reality that few know how. Most have gone through the motions – marketing, business administration, new media, and their social media dramatically quotes great entrepreneurs. One explains, ‘anything is possible’, another, ‘make the climb without the rope,’ and ‘let’s punch today in the face.’

### Cabinet nod to present Interim Budget for first four months  of 2025

*2024-11-27 05:37:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Cabinet-nod-to-present-Interim-Budget-for-first-four-months-of-2025/34-769731) · `en`

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the formulation of an Interim Budget to cover the Government’s expenses during the first four months of 2025.

It will focus on relevant expenses for Government recurrent and capital expenses, public debt servicing, and loan restructuring.

The move comes as the new Parliament which convened on 21 November lacked sufficient time to complete the constitutional steps required for passing the full Appropriation Bill for 2025.

Therefore, as stipulated in sub-section 23(1) of the Public Finance Management Act No 44 of 2024, an interim Budget should be submitted to Parliament to allocate provisions for the continuation of currently implemented projects and public services for the first 4 months of 2025.

The proposal to this effect presented by the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the Inauguration of the First Session of the Tenth Parliament delivering a speech, said that the NPP government must go with the IMF framework and the previous administration’s debt restructuring agreements as they have been endorsed by the IMF. It is true. Renegotiating for a new Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) is now dead. That is good, because we must end this process as early as possible to enter a new beginning. If the Net Present Value analysis proves beneficial for us to ensure debt sustainability even under the macro-linked bond mechanism we must finish this process. The NPP government is going to do it possibly by the end of December this year. It is a great consolation.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank will announce a single overnight policy rate from November 27, instead of the current policy corridor involving standing deposit facilities, the monetary authority said.

Sri Lanka has been running broadly deflationary policy from around September 2022, withdrawing liquidity through outright transactions, but concerns have been raised at initial inflationary policy through its overnight and term operations.
