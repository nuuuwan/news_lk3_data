    "Says President must intervene to uphold SC decision against Acting IGP",
    "Stresses failing to do so will undermine judicial decision before citizens constituting a breach of his oath as President",
    "Questions President\u2019s commitment to uphold Rule of Law in SL",
    "Claims Police now faced with major challenge to protect its honour",
    "Urges NPC to guarantee that Police operates in accordance with the law",
    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) issuing a statement yesterday demanded the President to take an immediate decision on the post of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) following the recent Supreme Court decision ordering the current Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennekoon to pay compensation to a citizen for subjecting him to torture.",
    "The main opposition party noted that the President must intervene in the matter as it is his responsibility to uphold the Rule of Law.",
    "\u201cIf the President disregards court rulings and endeavours to undermine the judiciary in the eyes of the nation, it constitutes a breach of the oath he has sworn to uphold,\u201d the party noted.",
    "However the party questioned if the President will in fact stand for the country\u2019s Rule of Law as he himself ignored a Supreme Court decision ordering the Ministry of Finance to provide funds to hold the Local Government elections.",
    "The party emphasised that it falls upon the Executive to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court order, highlighting that observers concerned with the Rule of Law are closely monitoring whether this responsibility will be fulfilled.",
    "The party also said that its representative in the Constitutional Council did not endorse the appointment of Acting IGP Deshabndu Tennekoon when it was proposed, citing concerns about its potential direct impact on the Rule of Law.",
    "The party underscored that Judges should take note that their decisions and recommendations regarding unlawful arrests and torture have been disregarded. It pointed out that this has presented a substantial challenge to the honour of the Sri Lanka Police, emphasising the significance of the National Police Commission\u2019s (NPC) forthcoming actions in response to the recent court decision to safeguard that honour.",
    "It urged the NPC to guarantee that the Police operate in accordance with the law, emphasising the need for the Police to genuinely serve the Sri Lankan public."
