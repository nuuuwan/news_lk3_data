  "original_body_lines": [
    "On 1 August, the United States imposed a 15% tariff on most European chemical imports. It caught some off guard. However, for many in the industry, it was just another warning sign: Europe\u2019s chemical sector is under serious pressure \u2014 and time is running out to turn things around.",
    "The challenges go far beyond trade. For years, Europe\u2019s chemical industry has been weighed down by sky-high energy costs, complex regulations, and growing competition from Asia. The US tariffs didn\u2019t start the crisis \u2014 they simply added to the long list of pressures driving Europe\u2019s steady decline.",
    "To understand Europe\u2019s current vulnerability, it\u2019s important to look beyond short-term trade tensions and examine the deeper forces driving the region\u2019s decline. A combination of high energy costs, slow regulatory processes, and rising global competition is steadily undermining Europe\u2019s position in the global chemical market.",
    "High energy prices remain a major weakness. Since 2022, European manufacturers have paid up to seven times more for natural gas than US producers. Electricity prices in Germany and France are more than double those in places like Texas or eastern China. For an industry heavily reliant on power, that\u2019s a critical disadvantage.",
    "Europe\u2019s energy transition also adds yet another layer of pressure. As Europe accelerates its push toward net-zero, chemical manufacturers are being asked to cut emissions rapidly. Meeting these goals typically requires costly upgrades to plants, investment in new technologies, and rising compliance costs.",
    "These regulatory demands have the potential to push firms to shut down or relocate production abroad \u2014 accelerating industry consolidation and further eroding Europe\u2019s manufacturing foundation.",
    "Bureaucratic delays make things worse. Under the EU\u2019s REACH system, it can take up to four years to get a new chemical approved \u2014 slowed by extensive testing and documentation requirements.",
    "Compliance is expensive. REACH registration often costs millions of euros per substance \u2014 a burden large firms can absorb, but smaller ones cannot. This slows innovation, ties up capital, and pushes R&D and production elsewhere.",
    "The result is a fragmented, costly system that makes it harder to bring products to market \u2014 stifling innovation rather than supporting it.",
    "While Europe slows, Asia is gaining ground \u2014 and India is emerging as a standout. Backed by strong government support, India\u2019s Chemicals and Petrochemicals Vision 2040 aims to grow the sector into a $ 1 trillion industry.",
    "Major projects like Haldia Petrochemicals\u2019 planned $ 10 billion plant in Tamil Nadu show this ambition in motion.",
    "India is also benefiting from the global shift toward a China+1 model. With supply chain risks prompting multinationals to diversify beyond China, many are turning to India as a manufacturing alternative. Combined with ongoing regulatory reforms and export-friendly infrastructure, this shift is cementing Asia\u2019s growing dominance in global chemical supply chains.",
    "In July, the European Commission launched a new Chemicals Industry Action Plan, built around four key goals:",
    "The plan includes measures such as a Critical Chemical Alliance to protect key production sites, an Affordable Energy Action Plan to bring down electricity and gas prices, and a regulatory package expected to save \u20ac 363 million per year by simplifying regulations, reducing paperwork, and cutting the administrative burden that slows down innovation.",
    "On paper, it\u2019s a strong response to an industry in trouble. But most of these measures won\u2019t start until 2026 \u2014 and for many companies, that\u2019s too late. Jobs are already being cut. Plants are closing. Investment is moving elsewhere.",
    "Industry groups welcomed the plan but warned that time is running out. Without faster action and stronger coordination across Europe, the plan could fail to stop the decline. A well-meaning strategy only works if it arrives before the damage is done.",
    "Some firms are already scaling back. BASF is closing several plants at its main site in Germany and cutting hundreds of jobs, citing high energy costs and weak demand. At the same time, it\u2019s investing heavily in China \u2014 including a $ 10 billion complex in Zhanjiang, where energy is cheaper and regulatory conditions more stable.",
    "Dow is taking similar steps. It plans to shut down three European sites and cut 800 jobs as part of a broader global restructure. Combined with earlier cuts, the company will have shed more than 2,000 jobs in Europe this year alone.",
    "These developments are early signals of a broader structural shift already in motion. If implementation lags, Brussels risks watching Europe\u2019s chemical base erode in real time \u2014 as capital steadily migrates to regions offering faster approvals, lower costs, and greater regulatory certainty.",
    "The message from firms like BASF and Dow is clear: investment will leave Europe and go elsewhere if conditions don\u2019t change.",
    "Europe remains a global leader in chemical research. In 2023, EU-based firms increased R&D spending by nearly 10%, outpacing both the US and China. Around 20% of all private-sector chemical research worldwide originates in Europe.",
    "But research alone isn\u2019t enough. To stay competitive, Europe must translate more of that innovation into commercial success. That means scaling up investment and clearing the regulatory hurdles that slow progress from lab to market.",
    "Europe\u2019s chemical sector employs 1.2 million people and benefits from top-tier institutions like ETH Zurich and Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay. However, employers are warning of widening skills shortages \u2014 especially in areas like green chemistry.",
    "Unless science and engineering education modernises to meet industry needs, those strengths will erode \u2014 regardless of Europe\u2019s past performance.",
    "Europe\u2019s chemical industry still holds the core ingredients for success: exceptional talent, cutting-edge research, and a legacy of innovation. However, these strengths are no longer guarantees. If high energy costs persist, regulatory burdens remain unresolved, and skilled labour continues to dwindle, Europe risks falling behind for good.",
    "The question is no longer whether it can compete \u2014 but whether it can adapt fast enough.",
