Due to deforestation in urban areas, Western purple-faced langurs also known as purple-faced leaf monkey are forced to use rooftops for travel in search of food and resting places, putting them at risk of encounters with dogs, people, and vehicles which can be fatal for the animals, a primatologist and behavioral ecologist said.

A recent post on social media revealed that three purple-faced langurs near Thalangama Lake were shot at, resulting in two animals succumbing to their injuries

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Smithsonian primatologist and behavioral ecologist Prof. Wolfgang Dittus said that the purple-faced langur is highly arboreal and that they come to the ground only under extreme circumstances when their arboreal pathways have been blocked by the removal of trees.

It is in this backdrop that people in urban settings now perceive Purple-faced langurs as a pest.

### Don’t cry for me Sri Lanka, if wrong people are elected - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-19 04:56:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Dont-cry-for-me-Sri-Lanka-if-wrong-people-are-elected-EDITORIAL/172-279106) · `en`

Elections have been the main focus among frontline political parties these days with the Presidential election scheduled for this year.

According to the Sri Lankan Constitution “the poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.”

Since the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is holding office “only for the unexpired period of the term of office” of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the term in this case is considered to be the term of President Rajapaksa who was sworn in on November 18, 2019. Hence the next Presidential election should be held between September 18 and October 18 this year.

### African debt crisis and lessons for Lanka

*2024-03-19 04:51:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/African-debt-crisis-and-lessons-for-Lanka/172-279105) · `en`

In the last two decades since Arrighi wrote his seminal article, Sri Lanka and many African countries have been on the same path of commercial borrowing. The process has resulted in the extraction of more wealth and further exacerbated balance of payment problems, even as the elite in these countries sprawl in luxurious consumption.

Crisis and despair push us to learn rapidly and that is true of debt crisis as well. But whom do we learn from and whom do we work with to find solutions to the crisis?

The IMF team in all their pomp are again visiting Sri Lanka. Their tutelage continues to be the same for us as many other countries in debt distress—austerity, repaying creditors and promoting free markets.

In this case, the radiation engine is often damaged and the person who is not here is unable to get treatment on the day since it is not here from Jaffna or Colombo.

As a result, the hospital has to go to the hospital in the morning and wait till night and get treated for the night.

Therefore, the machine should have been appointed here as the machine is often damaged and the patients have to wait until the engineer is dark or three days later.

Therefore, the hospital administration focused on this and obtained a solution to this.

I would like to make the following comments based on your Editorial.

I am in total agreement of your last sentence where you prophetically warn of the dangers of ageism.

I had made a comment two years ago (attached herewith) on similar lines.

In this comment I specifically focused on ‘old’ politicians (not by age but by duration of involvement in politics) and their continued adherence to ‘old’ political ideas (once again not due to age but due to outdated political economic and other ideas and not changing them to benefit the citizens of Sri Lanka).

### Political parties good for democracy; but not cults, fiefdoms and extremists

*2024-03-18 23:15:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Political-parties-good-for-democracy-but-not-cults-fiefdoms-and-extremists/4-759636) · `en`

Although there is growing public disillusionment with party politics in a democracy and a renewed cry for a different system of governance, the majority support for party politics remains

Whilst there has been no grave damage to Sri Lanka’s democracy, to date, because of the activities of political parties, there are tell-tale signs of the emergence of cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men who are using party power in testing the limits of the Constitution. The voting citizens must be wary of such moves. Dissociation from cults of personality and fiefdoms is a must. Political parties are essential institutions of democracy

The heading in the Daily Mirror of 18 March 2024, “Public Trust in Parliament and Political Parties Reaches All Time Low”, begs the question of the appropriateness, and efficacy, of political parties in democratic Sri Lanka. Further, the lack of consensus among political parties in most matters heightens these concerns.

### Three ways boards can drive data centricity

How do data-centric enterprises set themselves apart from their peers?

Boards can help companies accelerate the shift toward the next generation of data and analytics for a competitive advantage

Organisations are entering a new frontier of data and analytics, which will drive pivotal decisions, processes and interactions. Unsurprisingly, more than half (57%) of Asia-Pacific senior executives in the 2022 biannual EY study, Tech Horizon, identified data and analytics as their top investment priority in the next two years, up from 31% in 2020. What’s more, tech-enabled transformations in the region that exceed expectations are predicted to yield an average annual revenue growth of 6.2%, compared with 5.4% for transformations that fall short of expectations.

### Mitigating climate-related sovereign risk to accelerate action on the climate emergency

*2024-03-18 22:56:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Mitigating-climate-related-sovereign-risk-to-accelerate-action-on-the-climate-emergency/14-759632) · `en`

https://www.asiapathways-adbi.org: Climate change poses a serious threat to the development of countries and can have material impacts on sovereign risk. Sovereign risk refers to the probability that a country may not be able to pay its debts. However, since the global financial crisis, interactions between fiscal balances, public and private debt, and the financial sector have proven to be very complex. Sovereign risk reflects this complexity.

For example, the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2022 were caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains and faster melting of glaciers. They killed more than 1,700 people, left half a million homeless, and cost around $30 billion. The events led to Moody’s revising downward Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating by one notch, citing amplified liquidity and debt sustainability risks alongside falling foreign exchange reserves.

Global inequality is at an all time high. According to a recent Oxfam report (Inequality Inc. January 2024), the richest 1% of the world owns 43% of global assets; the world’s richest five men have doubled their wealth since the onset of the pandemic while five billion people have been made poorer. Ever-reducing wages (for workers), tax concessions and evasion (for/by corporates), and the privatization of public services has concentrated wealth and power in corporates, increasing their influence in every policy domain, says Oxfam.

### Trump unable to get $464m bond in New York fraud case, his lawyers say

New York, March 18 (BBC) - Donald Trump's lawyers have said finding a bond to cover the $464m (£365m) judgement in his New York fraud case is a "practical impossibility".

A judge ordered Mr Trump to pay the penalty in February for falsely inflating the value of his assets.

Mr Trump offered to post a smaller bond of $100m while he appeals, but that request was denied.

In a filing on Monday, his lawyers said they had approached 30 companies to back the bond without success.

"The amount of the judgement, with interest, exceeds $464m, and very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude," his lawyers wrote in the nearly 5,000-page filing.

They are asking a judge to put the judgement on pause while Mr Trump appeals against the decision.

"The practical impossibility of obtaining a bond interferes with defendants' right to appeal," his lawyers said.

Mr Trump's two eldest sons also must pay millions of dollars in the case.

### Gunmen kidnap at least 87 in Nigeria’s Kaduna state

Gunmen in Nigeria have kidnapped at least 87 people, including women and children in Kaduna state, residents and police said on Monday, in a fresh attack after an armed gang seized 286 students and staff from a school in early March.

Kidnappings by criminal gangs demanding ransom payments have become an almost daily occurrence in Nigeria, especially in the north, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them.

Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan confirmed the incident in Kajuru Station village on Sunday night but could not give a figure of those missing. He said security agents had been deployed to try to rescue the villagers.

Tanko Wada Sarkin, a village head, said 87 people were taken.

“We have so far recorded the return of five people back home who fled through the bush. This attack makes it five times that these bandits are attacking this community,” he told Reuters by phone.

They also requested that people to drink natural beverages, adding some salt to maintain the sodium level in their bodies.
