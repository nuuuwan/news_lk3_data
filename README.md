Despite its rich resources, strategic location, and potential, Sri Lanka has yet to find its equivalent of Lee Kuan Yew. This article explores why none of Sri Lanka’s political leaders have been able to replicate his success.

An inexperienced and understaffed Government is making appointments to various senior positions. To be true to their election promises, a process has been initiated to strip away various “privileges” given to holders of political office. What is common to both is the problem of managing conflicts of interest.

Concerns were raised when the CEO of a supermarket chain was appointed as chairman of Sathosa, the Government’s supermarket company. It cannot be because he lacks the necessary knowledge to run the business. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine a better qualified person to serve as CEO or as executive chair of the ailing SOE.

Directing services to Colombo - Jaffna have been resumed about 10 months later on Monday (28).

The train departed from the Colombo Fort Railway Station at 05.45 am today and reached the Jaffna Railway Station at 01.10 pm.

Railway services between Jaffna and Colombo have been limited to Vavuniya due to civil war.

The Colombo -Jaffna services have been resumed since 2014 after the war was silenced.

In 2023, the train from Colombo to Vavuniya and Anuradhapura was limited by the train from Colombo to Anuradhapura and the departure of Jaffna with Vavuniya.

In this backdrop, the train from Colombo to the rehabilitation of the railway line between Anuradhapura and Mago has been limited by Mago and the departure of Jaffna with Anuradhapura.
