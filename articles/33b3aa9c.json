    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that a nation cannot prosper under leaders who flee during times of crisis.",
    "He further highlighted that had he not taken charge during the country\u2019s period of turmoil, he shuddered to think of the current state of affairs.",
    "These remarks were made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his attendance at a meeting of United National Party representatives from the Batticaloa District, held yesterday (22) at the Municipal Council Auditorium, Batticaloa.",
    "\u201cI had the opportunity to engage with various political and public organizations in Batticaloa. Presently, our country faces significant challenges. During the previous administration, I consistently emphasized the necessity of maintaining a reserve of at least USD 03 billion to propel our economy forward.",
    "No political party endorsed this stance. What did Samagi Jana Balawegaya and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna have to say about it? We were the sole advocates of this crucial initiative, often dismissed as spreading false propaganda. Irrespective of our political affiliations, we must uphold truthfulness for the sake of our nation\u2019s future. In politics, honesty must always prevail.",
    "Amidst that struggle, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa proposed Mr. Sajith Premadasa to take charge of the country, but they declined the responsibility for the country\u2019s future. Similarly, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, aspiring for leadership, remained conspicuously absent. It begs the question whether these individuals are fit to lead our country.",
    "Nevertheless, we stood steadfast against adversity and established a government. Presently, the country is emerging from bankruptcy. During that period, the opposition levelled numerous accusations, urging my resignation from both the roles of Prime Minister and President upon assuming leadership amidst challenges.",
    "What would have become of the country had I stepped down then? I steered the country through its most trying times. I undertook numerous initiatives that benefitted the people, actions that were neglected during the country\u2019s financial turmoil.",
    "Even amidst the country\u2019s economic collapse, we increased allowances for government employees and worked to double the Samurdhi allowance through the Aswasuma program. Initiatives were also launched to grant freehold land deeds to those who have no land rights. In Batticaloa district alone, I directed officials to issue freehold land deeds to over 27,000 individuals within just two months.",
    "If such measures were achievable during a financial crisis in a country, imagine what more can be accomplished for a country that has emerged from bankruptcy. The time has arrived for us all to unite, organize, and progress together.",
    "The event was attended by Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Head of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Governor of Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman, General Secretary of the United National Party Palitha Range Bandara, District Organiser of the UNP in Batticaloa K. Mohan, Organizer of the UNP in Eraur M.A.M. Bilal, Zonal Organiser of the UNP in Batticaloa M.A. Nazar, group of former UNP local government members, regional organizers, party activists, and other participants."
