    "Browns Hotels & Resorts (BHR) was recently awarded the prestigious International Gold Winner title in the Hospitality & Travel: Conservation & Wildlife category at the Green Apple Environment Awards 2024, held at Kensington Palace, London. This recognition celebrates BHR\u2019s exemplary mangrove conservation efforts, particularly its Ratha Milla (Lumnitzera littorea) project, spearheaded by Thaala Bentota Resort in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Conservation.",
    "The Ratha Milla, a critically endangered mangrove species native to Sri Lanka, was rediscovered in the Bentota estuary and Dedduwa lagoon after being unrecorded for over a century. Previously believed to be limited to the Madu River Ramsar Wetland, recent ecological studies have identified over 100 young plants, aged 10 to 20 years, marking a significant milestone in biodiversity conservation.",
    "Launched earlier this year, the conservation project included a series of impactful initiatives such as installation of informational signage at the Bentota mangrove site to raise awareness on the vital role mangroves play in coastal ecosystems. Community educational sessions were also conducted, bringing together locals, tourists and environmental officials to discuss the importance of protecting the Ratha Milla and mitigating threats to its survival. Monthly excursions to the mangrove site provided hotel guests with a unique opportunity to experience the delicate balance of mangrove ecosystems and their contributions to biodiversity, carbon sequestration and coastal protection.",
