Russia may use its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile to attack тАЬdecision-making centresтАЭ in Kyiv in response to UkraineтАЩs firing of Western missiles at Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Kyiv is heavily protected by air defences, but Putin says the Oreshnik, which Russia fired for the first time at a Ukrainian city last week, is incapable of being intercepted - a claim greeted with scepticism by Western experts.

тАЬOf course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range Western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on November 21,тАЭ Putin told leaders of a security alliance of ex-Soviet countries at a summit in Kazakhstan.

The Government has already formed a relevant ministry and well-qualified advisers in the field. This is a good positive starting point. The people have yet to see the change in this regard. The NPP Government should also encourage the industries that encourage the creation of jobs, especially for young people, by supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and offering vocational training programs. The curriculum of the technical colleges should be overhauled, and relevant job-orientated vocational training should be further developed

The NPP, which has become a major political force in the most recent Parliamentary election in Sri Lanka, has presented a vision for system change that many people find appealing.

Both the IMF and the Government officials should keep in mind that maintaining broad public support is as important as implementing necessary reforms

The new Government and the IMF have so far been in sync. For instance, the IMF underscored the importance of securing funding for social spending and supporting the most vulnerable. President Dissanayake has assured that his Government would prioritise effective use of social funds, focusing on combating child poverty, addressing malnutrition, and improving support for differently-abled individuals. These priorities, core to the NPPтАЩs election platform, demonstrate at least some levels of alignment between the GovernmentтАЩs goals and IMF conditions.
