*2024-03-05 12:23:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177943) · `ta`

The US High Court ruled that states cannot prevent Trump from contesting the US presidential election, overturning Colorado's decision to exclude him from the ballot due to alleged support for the January 6 attacks.

🟩

The High Court has unanimously ruled that states cannot prevent former Donald Trump contesting the US presidential election.

The Colorado state court ruled last December that Trump's name could not be included in the Colorado State Republican election ballot ballot due to allegations that he supported the attacks on the US parliamentary complex on January 6, 2021.

In this context, the US federal Supreme Court judges on Monday (04) ruled that the Colorado High Court's ruling was 9: 0.

The US High Court said that the states do not have the authority to prevent competing under the charge and that the US parliament has such a power.

It is noteworthy that the Republican party elections will be held today in 15 states, including Colorado.

### The reconciliation mechanisms put forward by the Sri Lankan government are not going to solve the concern of the victims - the Human Rights Council

*2024-03-05 11:05:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177929) · `ta`

The Pearl Organization highlights the need for justice for the 169,796 Tamils affected by war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed 15 years ago. The Sri Lankan government's lack of political commitment to meaningful accountability and justice is also noted, along with the ongoing impact of Sinhala Buddhism and human rights-affecting laws.

🟩

The People's Organization for Equality Relief in Sri Lanka has told the United Nations Human Rights Council that the international community can report the Sri Lankan government that the international community will not be exempted from the clutches of the punishment.

In the aftermath of the Human Rights Council's oral report at the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Pearl Organization recalled the war crimes committed 15 years ago, crimes against humanity and genocide.

The Sri Lankan rulers have revealed that the rulers of Sri Lanka have not revealed any political commitment in carrying out meaningful accountability justice. The current government has proposed empty harmony mechanisms.

At the same time, Sinhala Buddhistism continues to be the main mechanism in Sri Lanka, and the laws that are affecting human rights continue to be created.
