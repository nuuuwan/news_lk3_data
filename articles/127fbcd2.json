    "Lebanese armed group Hezbollah said on Tuesday it had elected deputy head Naim Qassem to succeed slain secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air attack on Beirut\u2019s southern suburb over a month ago.",
    "The group said in a written statement that its Shura Council had elected Qassem, 71, in accordance with its established mechanism for choosing a secretary general.",
    "He was appointed as Hezbollah\u2019s deputy chief in 1991 by the armed group\u2019s then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year.",
    "Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollah\u2019s leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media, including as cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year.",
    "Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27, and senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine - considered the most likely successor - was killed in Israeli strikes a week later.",
    "Since Nasrallah\u2019s killing, Qassem has given three televised addresses, including one on Oct. 8 in which he said the armed group supported efforts to reach a ceasefire for Lebanon."
