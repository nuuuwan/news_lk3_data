    "As part of a growing push for regional collaboration, the South Asia Sustainability and Security Research Institute (SASSRI) was launched in Colombo on Wednesday to advance resilience, sustainability, and cooperation across South Asia.",
    "The SASSRI is positioned as a multidisciplinary hub, working with governments, academia, civil society, and the private sector to generate knowledge, shape policy, and strengthen partnerships for a sustainable and secure future. The inauguration brought together distinguished leaders, diplomats, scholars, and practitioners to explore collaborative approaches to maritime security and sustainable development in the Indian Ocean region.",

Khandare and Synergia Foundation India Chief Strategic Officer and Defence Intelligence Agency India former Director-General Lieutenant General (Retd.) G.A.V. Reddy were Guests of Honour at the event. SASSRI Director Dr. Nirmal De Silva said: \u201cIn today\u2019s VUCA world, our challenges are global. It is no longer an individual problem, and neither are opportunities. In order to leverage these opportunities, we need to emphasise research and collaboration.\u201d",
    "He highlighted the importance of moving beyond narrow, short-term perspectives, calling for a collaborative approach that addresses challenges such as food security, digital security, and sustainable governance in the region.",
    "Speaking at the event, Gateway House Professorial Fellow and Overseas Development Institute (ODI) Visiting Senior Fellow Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja also highlighted the pivotal moment that South Asia is experiencing, noting both its economic potential and persistent structural challenges. He stressed that economic security should be treated as a core component of national security, and that lessons from both regional reforms and international collaboration can guide sustainable growth across South Asia.",
    "\u201cThere is opportunity, but there\u2019s also these deep-seated challenges, and we need an interdisciplinary approach to understand this and formulate a strategic response. By convening scholars across this geography, the SASSRI can build on the strengths that it has in Sri Lanka and provide pragmatic solutions.\u201d",
    "Giving the keynote speech, International Relations Office (IRO) Director and Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) Centre for Strategic Assessment (CSA) Director Dr. Harinda Vidanage also reflected on the complex global and regional environment, outlining recent geopolitical events and major transitions shaping South Asia. He highlighted the critical need for strategic thought in Sri Lanka and other small States, noting the importance of interdisciplinary research and forward-looking analysis to navigate challenges and leverage opportunities.",
    "\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s really missing in our Sri Lankan context is the major deficit in strategic thought. That\u2019s the area we need to work on,\u201d Dr. Vidanage said, emphasising the role of think tanks in cultivating this capability.",
    "He further stressed the strategic significance of maritime and financial security, technological change, and global rivalries. \u201cThis \u2018iron triangle\u2019 of geopolitics, geoeconomics, and geotechnology will dominate politics and development for the next 50 years. Functioning effectively as a think tank in this environment requires continuous engagement and dialogue,\u201d he said.",

They noted that geopolitical shifts, debt pressures, and economic limitations are shaping their foreign policy decisions.",
    "The panellists also underlined maritime and environmental sustainability as key priorities, and ocean warming, sea-level rise, acidification, and unsustainable fishing practices as pressing regional threats. They too, stressed the need for collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches, policy frameworks, and innovative research to address these challenges, underlining the role of think tanks like the SASSRI in translating ideas into actionable strategies for regional resilience.",
