    "Tourism State Minister Diana Gamage said in Colombo last week that Miss World Tourism 2023 which would take place in Sri Lanka from July 20th to 30th would get participants from 40 countries, some of whom have little awareness about the country and would never visit it if not for the upcoming tourism event.",
    "\u201cThese countries will be sending their most exquisite representatives to vie for the coveted crown at the competition. The Ministry of Tourism and the Tourism Promotion Bureau are working hand in hand during this historic 11-day extravaganza to make it an awe-inspiring spectacle for the visitors. All those who are coming are global travel influencers, the new key actors in tourism promotion. Sri Lanka will be able to gain great mileage from the compelling content they create to showcase our destination among their fan bases,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIn the face of challenging economic times, Sri Lanka can find solace in the transformative power of tourism. Radika Gunawardhana who has won accolades as Mrs. World Gold Medalist 2013, Mrs. Asia International 2015, and a recipient of numerous national and international beauty pageant titles from 2005 to 2015 would lead the exercise of putting this event together,\u201d the state minister said.",
    "\u201cWe have made elaborate arrangements for the interested global community to witness the enchantment of Miss World Tourism pageant in Sri Lanka as it unfolds on scenic locations of our country. It won\u2019t just be a beauty pageant. It will relay to the world Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural heritage, tourist attractions and local hospitality as they had never known before.\u201d",
    "Responding to a query from The Island Financial Review, she said, \u201cThe specialty here is there is no prize money for the winning contestants and they pay their own air-fare as a support for our country at this difficult time. However, we will be providing them with star-class accommodation, Sri Lankan gastronomical delights and all visits to tourism locations and other necessary facilities for free. It is encouraging to see that there are people out there with so much goodwill to support Sri Lanka in its Tourism marketing without expecting any remuneration.\u201d",
