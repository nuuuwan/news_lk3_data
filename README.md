### Sir John Kotelawela (1953 — 1956), as seen by his Assistant Secretary

The strongest man is never strong enough to be always master, unless lie transforms his power into right, and obedience to duty.

At the time my story begins, a routine civil service transfer had me moved as Assistant Secretary in the prime minister’s office which was without doubt the most exalted and powerful institution in Sri Lanka. For the first 30 years of the new state’s existence, its place in the political structure remained unchallenged and unchanged. The role of the prime minister as the keystone of the arch in a Westminster-style government was paramount. It was only much later, after the second Republican Constitution in 1978 and the creation of the Executive Presidency with its enormous concentration of power, that the position of the prime minister became as it now is, devoid of constitutional authority, largely decorative’ and what its holder is able to make of it.

We are less than six weeks from the most significant election in the history of the United States of America, when the electorate of the most powerful nation in the world elects its leaders for the next four years.

Until a few months ago, the protagonists for the U.S. Presidency were incumbent President Biden and former President Trump. As many as 75% of the US electorate, Republican and Democratic, were “Double Haters”, who believed neither of these old fogies was capable of leading the nation.

The total meltdown of President Biden at the first Presidential Debate on June 27 provided the inevitable pivotal point in an untenable situation.

### Welcome, Comrade Anura!

*2024-09-30 12:32:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/welcome-comrade-anura/) · `en`

It’s official – Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the ninth Executive President of Sri Lanka.

For those who don’t know, between 1948 – when we obtained independence from the British Empire – and 1977, the highest elected political official in Sri Lanka was the Prime Minister. He or she – Sri Lanka has the distinction of electing the world’s first woman Prime Minister – was invested with a tremendous array of powers, while the President served a ceremonial role.

In 1978, the government of J. R. Jayewardene enacted a new Constitution which transformed the office of the Prime Minister into that of an all-powerful, almost omniscient Executive President who was both head of state and head of government. The then Prime Minister’s rationale was that the parliamentary system which had prevailed until then had become a hindrance and that the country required a new political arrangement which would shield its leaders from the vagaries of parliamentary politics.

Sri Lanka’s Presidential election saw a genuine left-winger, from a Marxist party, record a victory that upended the country’s political establishment. But the NPP’s win was more than just historic for this country. A man whose ideology with regard to the fundamental questions of policy differs from all predecessors was elected. This is something presently unimaginable in the West. While it may have been different 100 years ago, today in most major Western countries, there is increasingly no way for the public to vote away the two sacred cows of the establishment: neoliberal capitalism and neo-con foreign policy. Here, Sri Lanka can provide hope.

### PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION:

The propaganda which possibly helped the NPP leader to overcome SJB and UNP leaders was their capacity to aggressively agitate against many features of an ‘’iniquitous system’’ which people attributed to have been responsible for the bankruptcy of the country. They also exploited the belief of people that members of political groups or traditional parties which exchanged political power in turn, enjoyed perquisites and privileges associated with the “system”, while citizens suffered under the weight of the economic collapse. The “Aragalaya’’ of May 1922 heralded the emergence on a pervasive scale of hatred against the ‘’system”. The NPP took notice, and their campaign against it did not abate till the conclusion of the election.
