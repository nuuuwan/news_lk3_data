    "Expresses disappointment over escalating cost of living and heavy tax burden faced by people",
    "Says despite having been in power for 28 days, has yet to provide any substantial relief to the public",
    "Calls for establishment of a balanced Parliament, one that includes experienced and capable persons from across party lines",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate S.M. Marikkar voiced strong criticism over the weekend against the current National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government, highlighting their failure to deliver on key promises made during their election campaign.",
    "Marikkar expressed disappointment over the escalating cost of living and heavy tax burden faced by the public, while accusing the Government of prioritising media campaigns over meaningful governance.",
    "Addressing a press conference, Marikkar said that while the NPP had initially claimed that taking power would alleviate the high cost of goods and reduce the tax burden, the opposite has occurred. He noted that the price of essential goods continues to rise, making it harder for people to meet their basic needs. \u201cThe people hoped for relief, but instead, they are burdened with increased taxes and mounting debt,\u201d Marikkar said.",
    "Recalling the Good Governance Government of 2015, Marikkar emphasised that under their leadership, fuel prices were reduced, Government employees\u2019 salaries were increased, and support programs, such as nutritional bags for pregnant mothers, were introduced. He contrasted this with the current Government, which, despite having been in power for 28 days, has yet to provide any substantial relief to the public. \u201cThe people are still waiting for the promises made by the NPP to be fulfilled,\u201d he added.Marikkar also criticised the NPP for failing to create a production-based economy, a key component of their campaign promises. \u201cThere is no visible program to bring investments into the country, no strategy to reduce taxes, and no effort to renegotiate harmful conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\u201d he said, accusing the Government of engaging in a media show rather than addressing the real issues.",
    "He further noted that many of the trade union leaders who once spearheaded strikes and protests have now become NPP candidates, leaving workers without representation to push for their demands. According to Marikkar, this has created a void in labour leadership at a time when the working class needs it the most.",
    "Looking ahead to the upcoming general election, Marikkar called for the establishment of a balanced Parliament, one that includes experienced and capable persons from across party lines. \u201cWe need talented people in both the Government and Opposition to ensure that democracy is upheld and the country is led in the right direction,\u201d he asserted.",
    "Marikkar warned that without a strong Opposition in Parliament, Sri Lanka risks descending into a dictatorial regime.",
    "He urged the public to elect experienced and knowledgeable persons in the upcoming election to form a balanced Parliament that can truly represent the interests of the people and steer the country towards a more prosperous and democratic future."
