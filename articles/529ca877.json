    "Newly appointed IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya has promised to crack down on the netherworld of crime and drugs. He made this pledge at a media briefing, after assuming duties in his new position, where he had been acting previously. Stressing the need for new laws to combat crime effectively and expressing the hope that the NPP government would make them soon, he identified a nexus between criminals and politicians who had been in power previously as one of the key factors that had facilitated the rise of the underworld. Thankfully, the situation had changed under the new dispensation, but some criminals continued to maintain contacts with their former political bosses, he said, promising to bring back all the Sri Lankan underworld kingpins hiding overseas and make them face the full force of the law.",
    "One cannot but agree with the new police chief. It however needs to be added that the sorry state of affairs in the Police Department is also due to the subservience of some of its officers and men to politicians. Last year\u2019s regime change was expected to help sever links between politicians and cops, but there has been no discernable change. A case in point is the appointment of a retired police officer who actively took part in the NPP\u2019s election campaigns as the CID Director.",
    "Now that the new Police Chief has said that some crime czars are still in contact with their former political bosses, a thorough probe is called for against the politicians concerned. As he has rightly pointed out, politicians made it impossible to neutralise the underworld. After 1977, all governments had their goon squads led by notorious criminals to do political work for them. The Jayewardene regime used Gonawala Sunil, a convicted rapist, who was given a presidential pardon and released from prison, to terrorise the Opposition and rig elections. Soththi Upali, who worked for the Premadasa government also remained above the law. Some OICs of police stations in Colombo would spring to their feet and offer their seats to him whenever he walked into their offices, barking orders.",
    "Interestingly, former Chairman of the Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday at a ceremony to felicitate him that the practice of \u2018switching ballot boxes\u2019 had ended in 1981. However, large-scale election malpractices did not come to an end in that year. The outcomes of the presidential election and the referendum in 1982, and the elections in the late 1980s\u2014Provincial Council, Presidential and Parliamentary\u2014would have been different if they had been free and fair. We witnessed a similar situation in 1999 during the North Western Provincial council election, where the goon squads of the SLFP-led People\u2019s Alliance government, under President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga\u2019s watch, chased away polling agents and stuffed the ballot boxes while the police were looking away.",
    "The Kumaratunga government appointed a contract killer cum extortionist Beddegana Sanjeewa as reserve Sub Inspector of the Police and attached him to the Presidential Security Division. The situation took a turn for the worse under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, with pro-government criminals attacking the Opposition activists in full view of the police. Wielding clubs, they operated alongside the police to crush Opposition protests, and when the media asked questions about the presence of men carrying clubs, a police spokesman had the chutzpah to claim that they may have carried \u2018sticks\u2019 to prevent stray dog attacks. The police looked on while the thugs of the Rajapaksa government were attacking the peaceful Aragalaya protesters in Colombo in 2022. They also did not act when organised groups carried out arson attacks on the properties of the then ruling party politicians.",
    "There are no paragons of virtue in Sri Lankan politics. The governments led by the UNP and the SLFP used underworld characters to perpetrate crimes such as assassinations and attacks on democracy, but the JVP itself committed many crimes and they included countless murders, incidents of assault, armed robberies and arson attacks on state-owned properties. All these political parties and their breakaway groups do not seem to feel any remorse for their past crimes.",
    "IGP Weerasooriya has rightly prioritised the task of ridding the police of lawbreakers. In fact, a considerable number of bad cops have already been sacked and prosecuted. The police deserve praise for that. However, the success of the new Police Chief\u2019s efforts to cleanse and revitalise the police hinges on his ability to depoliticise his department, which is full of servile elements ready to lick politicians\u2019 boots or sandals.",
