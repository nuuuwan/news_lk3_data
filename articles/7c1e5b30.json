    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday gave its green light to revise the existing methodology for granting lands to war heroes, whilst addressing issues that have arisen under the existing system.",
    "\u201cThe key objective of the move is to address the shortcomings of the current system and ensure that war heroes receive adequate support and recognition for their sacrifices,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing held yesterday.",
    "Circular instructions issued by the Land Commissioner General have outlined the procedures for distributing lands to war heroes from the three armed forces, Sri Lanka Police and Civil Defence Department, including those who have sacrificed their lives, gone missing, become disabled, retired, or are currently in active service.\u00a0 He said despite these guidelines, it has become evident that the relief provided to war heroes is inadequate, and the economic value of the allocated lands is not accurately reflected due to limitations in the existing legal framework governing land ownership conditions.",
    "In response to these challenges, the Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Defence Minister to revise the methodology for granting lands to war heroes.",
    "Recalling that the month of May is quite special for all Sri Lankans as it marks the end of the 30-year civil war, he said: \u201cBy revising the land grant methodology, the Government seeks to provide meaningful assistance to war heroes and their families, recognising their contributions to national security and stability.\u201d",
    "Gunawardena also said that the initiative marks a significant step towards improving the welfare of war heroes and reaffirms the Government\u2019s commitment to ensure that war heroes receive the support and recognition they rightfully deserve for their service to the country,\u201d he explained."
