    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. Charitha Herath yesterday announced he would release a research report on Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal and public debt management within three months.",
    "Herath said the research will be conducted externally and independently of the Parliament through the party\u2019s People\u2019s Investigation Committee led by him.",
    "\u201cThe special parliamentary committee appointed to probe the causes of Sri Lanka\u2019s bankruptcy has turned into a farcical joke. The opposition has stepped down from the committee, turning it into a committee consisting of Pohottuwa members alone,\u201d he said. \u201cAppointing such a committee at a time when the people are rejecting the entire parliament will only further enrage the people,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP noted that he as the then Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (CoPE) decided on 4 July 2022 to conduct a special inquiry into the country\u2019s economic and public debt management.",
    "\u201cHowever, the situation in Sri Lanka on 9 July 2022 and the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as President on 20 July brought these efforts to an abrupt halt. One of his first acts as President was to suspend parliament in a manner that led to the dissolution of CoPE,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said the act impeded the investigation from being carried out.",
    "\u201cI will commence the investigation which was stopped and complete it within the next three months,\u201d the MP announced."
