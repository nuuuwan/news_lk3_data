    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court on July 24 suspended previous IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon from serving his office and suggested an acting appointment be made.",
    "The Supreme Court verdict on Tennekoon came after granting leave to proceed for nine fundamental rights petitions filed against his appointment as IGP.",
