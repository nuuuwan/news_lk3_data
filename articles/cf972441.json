    "A little over a month ago, I received a phone call in the early hours of the morning from Ralston Joseph. His voice, though calm, carried the weight of sorrow. He told me his father had passed away. In that moment, a profound sadness settled over me\u2014because Ainslie Joseph was not just someone I admired, he was a mentor, friend and confidante.",
    "\u201cUncle Ainslie,\u201d as I fondly called him, was a man carved from gentleness and purpose. He was a man for others\u2014selfless, wise, and unwavering in his quiet pursuit of goodness. He was not born into privilege, and yet when he found himself with the opportunity to pursue personal gain, he turned away from it. His wealth was never material. His mission in life was to build something far greater: social and cultural capital, a legacy of service, wisdom, and human connection.",
    "Unlike many tributes I\u2019ve written before, this one has been difficult to compose. The memories of Uncle Ainslie don\u2019t come in neat paragraphs\u2014they arrive unexpectedly, like waves that are hard to contain. He was that kind of man: unforgettable, understated, and deeply cherished.",
    "He spent his life lifting up the overlooked and unheard. For decades, he worked with Catholic charities such as SEDEC and Seth Sarana, addressing issues most people shied away from\u2014peace-building, interfaith dialogue, ethnic harmony. He was never too loud, but his impact was thunderous in its quiet resolve. He helped people understand the world around them and nudged them, gently, toward compassion.",
    "But the way I came to know him was through a different door\u2014one that led to his love for language and storytelling. Long ago, while a student at St. Joseph\u2019s College, he won the senior English essay prize. The students who placed after him went on to become a prominent lawyer and an international politician. That moment should have propelled him to literary fame. Instead, he chose a quieter path\u2014one of editing, mentoring, and uplifting others. For a time, he served as a sub-editor at The Messenger, quietly shaping other people\u2019s voices while rarely seeking the spotlight for his own.",
    "I met him years later, long after he had retired, during a moment of desperation. I was a student then, struggling to finish my book on the history of St. Joseph\u2019s College. The work was dear to me, but as it wasn\u2019t an official publication, many editors politely declined. I needed someone not just to correct grammar, but to see if the words I had written carried weight\u2014if they made sense, if they mattered. I suppose any reasonable author looks for these in an editor.",
    "My friend Johann Pieris, the musician, connected me with Uncle Ainslie, and I still remember our first conversation. He didn\u2019t question my age or background or the merit of my book. He simply laughed warmly and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it\u2014on one condition: I won\u2019t take a cent.\u201d That was the kind of man he was\u2014gracious to a stranger, generous without condition, and ever so kind.",
    "In the years since, I have worked with many editors and proofreaders. Some were efficient, others were brilliant. But none\u2014absolutely none\u2014matched the care, depth, and precision of Uncle Ainslie. He may have worked slowly, but every edit was surgical, thoughtful, and insightful. He treated words with reverence, and writers with dignity. If Uncle Ainslie ever disagreed with something I had written, he would never say it harshly, never undermine. Instead, he would gently offer a new way of seeing things\u2014quietly opening doors to deeper insight, without ever raising his voice or wounding my pride. His corrections never felt like criticism; they felt like invitations to think more clearly, to write more truthfully. Hardly any serious criticism emerged\u2014apart from a few who had dismissed it even before reading. The book: Till the Mountains Disappear did well: three prints in one year and now sold out. At the launch of that book, I made it a point to honour Uncle Ainslie. Perhaps he thought our collaboration had come to a close. But for me, that was only the beginning.",
    "More projects followed. I wrote on Little Bike Lost, Sri Lanka\u2019s first schoolboy film, and later co-authored Fruits of Virtue\u2014a deep social analysis of St. Joseph\u2019s College\u2019s early years\u2014with Dr. Srilal Fernando. Each time, I turned to Uncle Ainslie. Each time, he sharpened the edges of my work with his meticulous eye and generous spirit. He never once accepted payment. In time, we became more than collaborators. We became family. His beloved wife, Marina, his children, in-laws, his grandchildren\u2014they welcomed me not as a guest, but as a brother and a son.",
    "His mind was a library. Every day, without fail, he read the papers\u2014daily and weekly. If he came across an article he thought would interest me, he\u2019d flag it and send it on WhatsApp, always thinking of others. His grasp of both local and global affairs was nothing short of masterful. With a sharp memory and a discerning eye, he could separate truth from noise. Knowing I collected rare books on Sri Lanka, he would often send me contacts of those selling valuable volumes through the papers. That was his way.",
    "In time, my focus shifted more seriously toward Sri Lankan studies. That\u2019s when the idea of The Ceylon Journal was born\u2014a platform to honour our heritage and engage in meaningful dialogue. I knew I had to assemble a formidable editorial team, and I reached out to both old friends and new minds from diverse fields. But one name was never in doubt. Uncle Ainslie had to be part of it. His breadth of knowledge, his calm wisdom, his remarkable sensitivity to nuance across literature, politics, history, and theology made him irreplaceable. At first, he declined. But I persisted, and at last, he agreed.",
    "It was then that his health began to falter. There were moments when he wanted to step down, to quietly slip away from the work. But I wouldn\u2019t let him. I told him he had to remain\u2014if not in body, then at least in spirit. He agreed to stay but he did more than that. Even while unwell, he continued to show up, to read, to edit, to contribute. His was a quiet heroism\u2014the kind we only recognize in full once it\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t think I could ever repay what Uncle Ainslie did for me. But there is one thing I did that brought him great joy: I introduced him to a remarkable group of men and women\u2014the editorial team of The Ceylon Journal. From our patron M.D.D. Pieris to every contributor, he formed deep bonds with them all. Surrounded by lawyers, doctors, academics, accountants, and software engineers, Uncle Ainslie thrived. He became a central figure, sharing perspectives and speaking with wisdom and warmth. His son Ralston, also on our team, once told me this was a \u201crenaissance\u201d in his father\u2019s life. The admiration was mutual\u2014nearly every member was present at his funeral.",
    "I still remember our inaugural meeting when the journal\u2019s name was being debated. Many opposed the branding: \u201cThe Ceylon Journal.\u201d But Uncle Ainslie stood up\u2014calm, firm, and eloquent\u2014and defended the name, and by extension, my conviction. He did it of his own volition, and for that, I am forever grateful. We spoke often. I visited his home every now and then and followed his work. In his parish, he taught English freely to the needy. He sourced micro-loans from the affluent to uplift the poor. He was a quiet environmentalist, growing fruits and flowers with pride\u2014always eager to show me his garden.",
    "But above all, he was a deeply spiritual man\u2014regular at Mass, committed to causes that mattered, quietly powerful in his compassion. Even in the ICU, when I asked his doctor, Dr. Ruwan Ekanayake, how he was doing, he told me, \u201cHe\u2019s reading liberation theology in intensive care.\u201d That was Uncle Ainslie\u2014reading to the very end. He borrowed books from me, particularly on politics. The last one he read was a biography of a controversial politician\u2014a book he said he thoroughly enjoyed, just days before he passed.",
    "Men like Ainslie Joseph are not rare\u2014they are unfindable. His passing has left a quiet, aching void in my life and in the hearts of all who truly knew him. He was not just a great man\u2014he was a quiet force of goodness in a world too often starved of it. May this tribute not merely honour his memory but stir others to walk in his footsteps\u2014 with the same quiet grit, generous grace, and steadfast humanity that defined the life of Ainslie Joseph. If we do, the world may just become a little more like him.",
