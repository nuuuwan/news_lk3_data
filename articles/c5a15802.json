    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has faced criticism for his inability to face challenges after he cancelled a live interview with a privately-owned local television channel, and criticism over evading responsibility as a leader.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Derana television channel had informed the public that Premadasa will appear in the live 360 programme late evening on Tuesday.",
    "However, Premadasa\u2019s party has sent a letter citing that he had never been confirmed for a live interview.",
    "\u201cAs usual, Sajith Premadasa has evaded facing challenges,\u201d Manusha Nanayakkara, a former legislator from Premadasa\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) who is now backing President Ranil Wickremesinghe charged in a live talk show which replaced the opposition leader\u2019s scheduled live 360.",
    "A member of SJB said that the opposition leader did not confirm for a live programme.",
    "\u201cHe did not confirm that he will participate. This has been informed in writing,\u201d Ajith Mannapperuma, an SJB parliamentarian told viewers on Tuesday.",
    "However, programme host Chathura Alwis of Derana said the TV channel started to advertise in papers and the TV after Premadasa agreed to the interview.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential candidates have mostly evaded debates on their policies with other candidates. Instead, they usually send surrogates for debates and live programmes.",
    "This comes more than two years after he refused to take over the prime minister post when he was offered by former leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the peak of a political crisis following an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "Premadasa later said he rejected the offer because he did not have a mandate from the people and he did not want to work with corrupt politicians whom people wanted to chase out with mass protests.",
    "However, Nanayakkara, who is now backing the current president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, for his presidential bid at Saturday\u2019s election said Premadasa did not heed the party members\u2019 requests in 2022.",
    "\u201cWhen we repeatedly asked him to take over the government, he did not take it. He is not a leader who can take on a challenge,\u201d Nanayakkatra said.",
    "Premadasa, however, appeared in a programme on Monday in another privately owned channel which is backing him. His critics have claimed the Monday programme was pre-recorded and aired as a live programme.(Colombo/September 18/2024)"
