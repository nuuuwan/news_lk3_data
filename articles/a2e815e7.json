    "We can only hope that voters would choose wisely and well again, as arguably they did a brace of months back \u2013 Pic by Shehan Gunasekara",
    "As the nation gears down for the second election in the short space of two months, it is incontrovertible that the winds of change continue to whistle through the corridors of power and influence.",
    "A quick survey of the contenders in the parliamentary polls set for 14 November shows that a slew of newcomers to the fore focus on \u2018national\u2019, \u2018developmental\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019 fronts.",
    "The decks are cleared for showdown between the old guard representing a rump in the house that until recently looked like it could not be ever moved, and that the people\u2019s aspirations as reflected in the ultimately abortive Aragalaya of 2022 would not be reflected in the legislature of 2024-9.",
    "Only a year and a half ago, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe appeared to have set his sights on the year 2048, a then far-in-the-future date the ex head of state said he had hoped Sri Lanka would come to rank \u2013 yes, finally, after 100 years of independence \u2013 among developed nations.",
    "In his address to the UNP\u2019s May Day rally in 2023, the GOP leader and six times Prime Minister of Sri Lanka said: \u201cThe country should not focus on short-term politics; instead, we should think about the future, specifically 2048, and work towards making Sri Lanka a developed country.\u201d",
    "Despite his critics (and there were many even then, but mostly beyond the pale of City and Chamber) who felt it was a bridge too far and too blas\u00e9 an ask, the erstwhile chief executive in June 2023 elaborated on his workers\u2019 day address in his \u2018National Transformation Road Map\u2019.",
    "However elusive in these past 75+ years this laudable objective may have been to the Grand Old Party\u2019s long-serving leader \u2013 in power, so to say, for almost five of those decades \u2013 the UNP stalwart who was elected as chief executive not through the ballot but by a parliamentary poll and who failed to consolidate his office at the Presidential elections in September 2024 may come to realise in hindsight that there is no preaching patience to a people with a hunger for more than justice. Striking a counterpoint to the GOP\u2019s and the Old Guard\u2019s traditional approach to development, civics and governance, and posing a potential countervailing force to the until recently seemingly entrenched and unshakeable political culture, the United Centenary Front (UCF) led by a parliamentary aspirant in 2024 envisages \u2018a country without corruption\u2019 among many other attributes including \u2018an inclusive Sri Lankan identity\u2019 and \u2018true meritocracy.\u2019",
    "Strikingly, the youthful challengers who grew out of Sri Lanka Unites\u2019 leader Prashan de Visser\u2019s Centenary Movement, \u2018a movement with a vision for the year 2048,\u2019 envision a Sri Lanka that is \u2018a country where the state serves its people, not politicians.\u2019",
    "The movement set up a political academy with students islandwide undergoing 52 week, 700 hour courses in theory and practice for public sector leadership and to become politicians \u2018of character, competence and with compassion for those whom they serve\u2019 \u2013 and the first batch from out of 400 applicants in all 25 provinces (42% of whom are women) graduated symbolically on Independence Day 2022.",
    "Out of this come voters who will eschew blind loyalty to party ideology and opportunistic promises to win elections, and develop national transformational leaders to shape smarter strategic policies... inclusive of all \u2013 especially those who are presently excluded from policy-making because they don\u2019t belong to the right family, inner circle or social stratum.",
    "Since that day when we as a nation will now well have to choose between two contesting ideologies \u2013 the establishment touting stability and emerging contenders for leadership promoting change with responsibility \u2013 we can only hope that voters would choose wisely and well again, as arguably they did a brace of months back (QED).",
    "And may we never feel cornered by the false dichotomy: \u2018If only old age could, if only youth knew how...\u2019"
