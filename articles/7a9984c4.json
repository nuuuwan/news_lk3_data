  "original_body_lines": [
    "The story of a Sri Lankan worker, who migrated to Australia less than a decade ago and has become a millionaire now, has taken the internet by storm. At the age of 25, Vinul Karunaratne has made enough money to quit and shift full-time to doing gig jobs.",
    "Karunaratne moved to Australia in 2015 and started working at 7-Eleven stores. But in 2019, he started taking on end-of-lease cleaning jobs on Airtasker. It\u2019s a Sydney-based online marketplace that enables people to outsource everyday tasks - such as cleaning, assembling furniture, or yard work - for others to complete in exchange for cash.",
    "Karunaratne told local news channel 7News that he didn\u2019t have much resources and equipment when he started. \u201cWhen I started, I didn\u2019t even have much equipment. I had a vacuum, mop, bucket, and some rags,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThat was the stuff I had at home.\u201d",
    "His hard work eventually paid off and he was soon able to ditch his job at 7-Eleven to shift full-time to Airtasker.",
    "According to the platform, Karunaratne is one of the top 10 earners on Airtasker. He manages to pocket an impressive $1,000 to $1,400 everyday. Dailymail reported that Karunaratne mainly performs bond cleans but also steams carpets and cleans offices.",
    "Tim Fung, Airtasker founder and CEO said, referring to Karunaratne\u2019s success on the platform that anyone can earn extra cash by working hard. Fung also termed Karunaratne\u2019s story as \u2018inspirational.\u2019 Fung hoped that more work will be available on his platform in the coming days.",
    "Karunaratne also shared his experience of working with the platform, saying it enabled him to be his \u2018own boss.\u2019",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s physical work, but it\u2019s good money. I enjoy the flexibility and working on my own terms. I\u2019m my own boss,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Australian media outlet."
