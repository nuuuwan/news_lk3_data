  "original_title": "From Valvettithurai to Nandhikkadal ; The Rise and Fall of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The evolution and growth of the armed struggle for the goal of Tamil Eelam  in Sri Lanka saw many Tamil militant groups emerge across the politico-military horizon. There was a time when  34 known  outfits \u2013 big and small \u2013 existed. Among all these, the single organization that kept the Tamil armed struggle alive for many years  was none other than the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) led by Velupillai Prabhakaran from Valvettithurai in the Jaffna peninsula. The LTTE under Prabhakaran fought on relentlessly towards its avowed objective of a separate Tamil State until the very end.",
    "The month of May is significant in the history of the Tamil secessionist armed struggle in Sri Lanka. It was on May 5,  1976, that a section of  militant Sri Lankan Tamil youths re-organized themselves into  the LTTE with the goal  of establishing  a separate  Tamil State on the Island  through an armed struggle. It was on May 14, 1976, that the chief political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils re-named itself as the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and adopted a resolution demanding the creation of a Tamil State called \u201cTamil Eelam\u201dcomprising the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the Island.",
    "Decades later in May 2009, the  LTTE  suffered  a total military defeat at the hands of the Sri Lankan armed forces in the Mullaitheevu district of Sri Lanka\u2019s northern province. Four days in May from May 15 to May 18 were of crucial importance in this regard. On May 19, 2009,   South Asia\u2019s longest war came to an end with the official announcement that the LTTE leader Thiruvengadam Veluppillai Prabhakaran was dead. His body was recovered on the banks of the Mullaitheevu lagoon known as \u201cNandhikkadal\u201d. The LTTE formed in  May 1976 was militarily annihilated after 33 years in May 2009.",
    "It can be seen therefore, that the  month of May has proved to be of  great significance in the Tamil armed struggle for Tamil Eelam spearheaded by the LTTE known as the Tigers. It is against this backdrop that this column , in this  third week of May , focuses on Prabhakaran  and the rise and fall of the LTTE with the aid of earlier writings.",
    "Prabhakaran was born on November 26, 1954. He was the youngest in a family of  two boys and two girls. Since he was the youngest, Prabhakaran\u2019s pet name was \u201cThambi\u201dor younger brother. His father was Veerasamy Thiruvengadam Veluppillai. Prabhakaran\u2019s mother\u2019s name is Paarvathipillai.  Prabhakaran\u2019s family hailed from the coastal town of Valvettithurai, referred to generally as VVT. Prabhakaran\u2019s family was of respected lineage in VVT. They were known as belonging to the \u201cThirumeni kudumbam\u201d or Thirumeni family. Prabhakaran\u2019s ancestors constructed the famous Sivan Temple of VVT.",
    "Prabhakaran\u2019s attitude and political thinking was shaped by contemporary events and environment. The gruesome tales he heard as a four-year-old child about the 1958 anti-Tamil violence impacted greatly. One day, Prabhakaran\u2019s home had a female visitor whose legs were scarred by burns. Upon inquiring, the little boy was told that the woman\u2019s home had been set on fire by a \u201cSinhala\u201d mob. She had escaped with burns. Young Praba also heard the famous story of the Brahmin priest in Panadura being burnt to death in a bonfire, and also about the infant thrown into a tar barrel. All these tales made an indelible impression.",
    "Being a native of Valvettithurai was another factor in making a militant out of Prabhakaran. VVT had acquired a reputation for smuggling and had a sub-culture of its own. \u201cOperation Monty\u201d was launched by the armed forces in post-independence Sri Lanka to check and counter illicit immigration and smuggling.",
    "This necessitated the setting up of security camps in VVT from the early fifties of the last century. There was much friction as a result of this military  presence. This in turn led to a confrontational mood prevailing between the VVT  people and armed forces long before the political crisis escalated in the seventies. It was in this environment that Prabhakaran and a host of other VVT youth grew up  in Valvettithurai  with anger and resentment towards the armed forces and by extension the government in Colombo.",
    "Prabhakaran growing up in this atmosphere got politically motivated in the late sixties and early seventies of the previous century. This was when former Kayts MP V. Navaratnam broke away from the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) known as Federal Party (FP) in English. Navaratnam once described as the \u201cgolden brain\u201d of the FP formed the \u201cThamizhar Suyaatchi Kazhagham\u201d or Tamil self-rule party in 1968.",
    "Navaratnam abandoned the federal demand as being too little and too late and instead opted for \u201cSuyaatchi\u201d or \u201cself-rule\u201d \u2013 a euphemism of sorts for a separate State. There was a pedagogue named Venugopal master for whom Prabhakaran had great regard and respect. Venugopal master became an active supporter of Navaratnam. Several students, including Prabhakaran became his followers and turned into ardent devotees of Tamil self-rule.",
    "With the introduction of standardization in 1970, the student population of Jaffna began getting radicalized. The Tamil Maanavar Peravai (Tamil Students\u2019 Federation) and Tamil Ilaignar Peravai (Tamil Youth Federation) were formed. A series of meetings, processions and rallies were held. Prabhakaran himself began participating in some of these activities and also attended most of the Tamil student and youth activist meetings.",
    "Soon he began losing interest in meetings and non-violent agitation. These were too tame for him. Greatly inspired by tales of Israel\u2019s Hagannah and Irgun,  Prabhakaran became firmly convinced that perceived  Sri Lankan State oppression could be resisted only through force.",
    "Prabhakaran teamed up with some others and formed the Tamil New Tigers. Apparently some of the Tamil radicals  in the ITAK like Rajaratnam of Nunaavil had formed a  group named \u201cTigers\u201d to fight for Tamil rights in the early sixties. This never got off the ground. Prabhakaran had begun interacting with Rajaratnam and felt the new movement should be a \u201crevival\u201d of sorts. Hence, Tamil New Tigers (TNT). The acronym TNT was also applicable for the explosive compound \u201cTrinitrotoluene\u201d.",
    "The TNT made its mark in July 1975 with the assassination of former Jaffna MP and Mayor Alfred Durayappah  at the Ponnaalai Varatharajapperumaal (Vishnu) Temple. Later Prabhakaran went on record that this killing was his \u201cfirst military action\u201d.",
    "The TNT metamorphosed into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on May 5, 1976. On that day, around 40-50 Tamil youths  met clandestinely at a secret location in the Jaffna peninsula and formed the LTTE. Uma Maheswaran became its leader. Prabhakaran was made Military Commander. A five-member committee was appointed to control and coordinate the new movement. Both Uma Maheswaran and Prabhakaran were members of this committee.",
    "The LTTE split into two after a few years. A large number of members broke away under the leadership of Uma Maheswaran and formed the People\u2019s Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). Some like Nagarajah and Aiyer  went their own way. Only a handful of the original LTTE members remained loyal to Prabhakaran.",
    "Now the LTTE began functioning independently under Prabhakaran, who was both its Leader and Military Commander. Later Charles Anthony alias Seelan, became Military Chief. By July 1983, the LTTE cadre numbered 30. There were 23 full-time members and seven part-timers and there were also many \u2018helpers\u2019 of all ages from different walks of life.",
    "The LTTE killed 13 soldiers through a landmine at Thirunelvely on July 23, 1983. This triggered off  the   Black July 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom. There was a spontaneous \u2018rush\u2019 by Tamil youths to join the militant movements and fight for Tamil Eelam. India began training and arming the movements. The struggle for Tamil Eelam itself underwent many bizarre twists and peculiar turns. There was internecine warfare among the movements. The LTTE became the dominant Tamil group.",
    "The Indo-Lanka Agreement of July 29, 1987, caused a sea of change in Tamil politics. Except for the LTTE, all other Tamil parties and organizations accepted the accord.They opted to give up the Tamil Eelam struggle and accept an arrangement provided under the Accord.. The LTTE also agreed initially, surrendered some arms, and even accepted a monthly payment of money from New Delhi as an \u2018incentive\u2019 in the early stages. The Tigers, however, changed track soon and resumed hostilities, daring to  even take on the Indian Army. The Indian army was withdrawn in 1990.",
    "The  ensuing years  saw  many rounds of peace talks between the LTTE and different governments in Colombo. None of them succeeded and the country suffered endless war interspersed with temporary spells of no war.",
    "In the meantime, the LTTE  achieved tremendous \u2018growth\u2019 in certain aspects. The  initial double-digit membership  reached  five digits. The LTTE  developed into a transnational entity  with front/branch organizations among the widespread Tamil diaspora. From 1990, the LTTE  succeeded in keeping under its control sizeable parts of the north and east. The area of this de facto state  fluctuated periodically until the end came in May 2009. Tiger territory has increased and decreased according to the fortunes of war. Yet, there  was for many years, a \u201cvariable\u201d sphere of LTTE control akin to a de-facto state..",
    "Within this \u201cLTTE \u2013controlled\u201d area, the Tigers set up structures like Police Stations, Courts, Inland Revenue Offices, TV, Radio, Film units, Newspapers, Banks, Immigration and Emigration Offices, business ventures, farms etc., They even drafted their own laws.",
    "Militarily, the LTTE  grew. The Tigers raised Infantry Brigades, Women\u2019s Brigades, Commando units and specialized divisions for laying mines, sniping, firing mortars and artillery, resisting tanks and armoured cars etc. Above all they had a suicide killer squad known as the Black tigers or Karumpuligal.",
    "The Tigers also formed  a naval wing known as Sea Tigers and a fledgling air wing called Air Tigers. The LTTE  possessed many marine vessels and a limited number of small aircraft.",
    "The tigers   set up an elaborate overseas network with the Tamil diaspora as its base. There were multiple media organizations engaging in propaganda and myriad activists raising funds. The Tigers had  the capacity to organize mass demonstrations at short notice in many Western cities. The LTTE also ran many commercial enterprises in several countries both West and East. They also  ran a fleet of ships transporting arms acquired overseas to the North of Sri Lanka.",
    "In short, the LTTE\u2019s growth in the post-83 era  was phenomenal. It  was perhaps the only enterprise run \u2018for, of and by\u2019 the Tamil people in Sri Lanka that  registered a \u2018success\u2019 of this magnitude after July 1983.",
    "This successful growth  came at huge cost to the Tamil people of Sri Lanka. Vertically the LTTE  went up, but horizontally the Sri Lankan Tamils  went down. This  was the unpleasant and inconvenient truth that the LTTE and acolytes often denied and did  not like to hear being said  in the past.",
    "After decades of fighting that  debilitated and diminished the Tamil people,  no  concrete gains  were made by the LTTE in winning back the lost rights of the Tamil people. Death, displacement and destruction  enveloped the Tamil areas for many years. Despite all this suffering and sorrow undergone by the Tamil people, the  LTTE  had achieved nothing tangible  in its enduring  quest for Tamil Eelam.",
    "The writing on the wall was discernible to any sensible observer of the military situation from 2007 onwards. Yet, Prabhakaran and his followers were oblivious to reality  even as the army advanced. \u201dKitta Varattum, Thittam Irukku\u201d (Let them come near. We have a plan) was the parrot-like cry by the top leaders as the enemy neared. Apparently, Prabhakaran and the LTTE  were not unduly concerned about the advancing armed forces for quite a while, as the Tigers were confident that the army would not be able to proceed beyond a certain point.",
    "This assessment got skewered after the fall of Paranthan, which was a major turning point. Paranthan was followed by Kilinochchi and then Elephant Pass\u2026 the hasty evacuation of cadres trapped in the peninsula through a \u201cmini-Dunkirk\u201d type of operation indicated that the Tigers were indeed caught napping.",
    "Even after losing the Jaffna-Kandy road or A-9 highway and all areas to its west, the LTTE was yet confident of withstanding the army for a much longer period in areas east of the A-9 highway. The final option was to \u201ccarve\u201d out a large   area  in Mullaitheevvu district with access to the coast and then defend it strenuously.",
    "But the rapid progress of the Army during this phase took the LTTE by surprise. Within a relatively quick period, the various military divisions and task forces  made sweeping strides into Tiger territory. As a result the LTTE and hundreds of thousands of civilians were boxed into a small space that kept on shrinking as the army continued to  advance.",
    "Despite the Army advancing, Prabhakaran  believed wrongly that the LTTE could at some point deliver a crippling blow on the battlefront and exact a heavy casualty toll. This would demoralize the army and help reverse the situation, Prabhakaran appears to have  surmised. The politico-military situation deteriorated, but Prabhakaran  was pretty sure that at some point the military drive would grind  to a halt.",
    "Apparently he was relying very much on the massive counter-offensive being planned to destroy army defences in the Puthukkudiyiruppu region. But the military debacle on April 4-5, 2009  at Aanandapuram resulting in the deaths of 623 cadres, including his northern force commander \u201cCol\u201d Theepan soured those plans. This writer then wrote   that the LTTE would not be able to  recover from the Aanandapuram defeat and  that this  defeat could be the defining moment of the war. That  observation was subsequently  proved correct .",
    "Six weeks after Aanandapuram, the finale came in mid May. A beleaguered Prabhakaran and  his senior Tigers went into a brain-storming session. A decision was reached to launch a tripartite venture. One group of Tigers, including Prabhakaran was to break out from trapped positions and cross the lagoon and Paranthan-Mullaitheevu road or A-35 highway. Thereafter the Tigers would move into the vast Wanni jungles and operate. Some would move to the East.",
    "A second group of Tigers would contact the army and negotiate terms of surrender. The main objective was to obtain urgently needed medical treatment for injured cadres, family members and civilians. The third group was to engage in fierce rear guard action.",
    "The LTTE launched a massive counter  attack on the armed forces shortly after midnight on Sunday, May 17,2009. The attack was in three directions but mainly directed towards the Nandhikkadal lagoon area held by the 53 division. After fierce fighting , the three Tiger contingents broke through. The three contingents together numbered about 350-400. Almost all military leaders were part of the three groups trying to break out",
    "A  large number of Black Tigers died in the assault as explosive-strapped boys and girls jumped on army positions and blew themselves up. This created the \u201cgaps\u201d for other Tigers to penetrate the military cordon. Though Tigers breached the 53- division defences, the soldiers began an intensive artillery barrage in which many died. Also the army had set up  multiple layers of defence with more personnel at the back.",
    "The LTTE cadres who broke through were to some extent sandwiched in between and  later  cut down. With the assault resulting in failure and many Tigers being encircled, several LTTE cadres began consuming cyanide. Similarly, the Tiger \u201cdefenders\u201d were also routed .",
    "Prabhakaran\u2019s body was discovered before dawn on Tuesday. The body of the 54-year-old supreme leader of the LTTE  was found on Tuesday, May 19 near the Mullaitheevu lagoon known as \u201cNanthikkadal\u201d (sea of conches).  It is widely belived that he had committed suicide by shooting himself. Soldiers of the 4th Vijayabahu infantry regiment led by Lt. Col. Rohitha Aluvihare claimed to have found the body.",
    "Thus ended the life of the man who was once described by the LTTE\u2019s political strategist, Anton Stanislaus Balasingham, as both \u201cthe President and Prime Minister of Tamil Eelam\u201d. Army commander Sarath Fonseka announced the death officially at 12.15 p.m. on May 19.",
    "The ephemeral nature of power was illustrated vividly by the death of Prabhakaran who controlled what was perhaps the most powerful guerrilla organization in the world.Prabhakaran who commenced his militant career with a single pistol had over the years built up the LTTE into a powerful movement running a shadow state.He  acquired the status of being \u201cTamil National Leader\u201d (Thesiyath Thalaiver) , and was raised to divine status as \u201cSooriyathevan\u201d (Sun God) by his sycophantic followers. .",
    "Prabhakaran, like a compulsive gambler,  risked the entire existence of the Tamil people as a vibrant ethnicity in Sri Lanka for the elusive goal of Tamil Eelam. It was  an all or nothing gamble for him. He was  like an invading military general who burns his boats so that his soldiers have no choice other than to fight on for victory or face death. There is no turning back. If the soldiers win the war, the general will be praised for his steely determination. If they lose, there won\u2019t be anyone left to tell the tale.",
    "Ultimately that is what had happened. Prabhakaran and the LTTE  military machine are no more but the irredeemable harm caused to the Tamil people living in Sri Lanka , \u201clives after them\u201d.",
