    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Levan S. Dzhagaryan accused Western nations of breaking promises, calling them \u201cbig liars,\u201d and defended Moscow\u2019s decision to launch what it terms a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.Speaking on Russia\u2019s stance, Ambassador Dzhagaryan said: \u201cOur main mistake was trusting Western countries and their leaders. They don\u2019t keep their promises. So we had to start our special military operation.\u201dHe reiterated Russia\u2019s non-negotiable demands, including:- Ukraine must never join NATO and remain a neutral state.- Recognition of four regions\u2014Kherson, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Donetsk\u2014along with Crimea as part of Russia.- Lifting of all sanctions imposed on Moscow.The Ambassador also revealed optimism about recent diplomatic engagements under the Trump administration, citing meetings between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. officials, including Marco Rubio, and a high-profile summit in Alaska between President Putin and President Trump.\u201cThey are more constructive now, ready to listen to our concerns\u2014unlike the previous administration,\u201d he said.However, Dzhagaryan noted that President Trump\u2019s remark calling Russia a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d drew a sharp response:\u201cWe are not a tiger. We are bears\u2014not paper bears. We are bears.\u201d"
