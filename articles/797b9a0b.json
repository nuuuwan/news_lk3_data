    "State Minister of Primary Industries, Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, announced plans to unlock significant economic potential from the 5,000 acres of land owned by Sri Lanka Cement Corporation.",
    "The initiative aims to generate USD 300 million annually, bolstering the nation\u2019s economy and demonstrating efficient resource utilization, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) reported.",
    "The State Minister also stressed the imperative of leveraging our nation\u2019s available resources to propel its development, regardless of any challenges that may arise, emphasizing the need to build the country steadfastly.",
    "The announcement was made during a press briefing titled \u201cCollective Path to a Stable Country,\u201d held at the President\u2019s Media Centre (PMC) today (07 Feb.).

    "\u201cWhile our phosphate company possesses valuable mineral resources estimated at Rs. 24 million, legal challenges from NGOs currently prevent us from profiting from them. Despite this hurdle, we successfully generated income through phosphate sales, enabling us to cover all loans, fulfil salary payments, and contribute Rs. 350 million to the Treasury.\u201d",
    "\u201cSimilarly, we generated profit from salt mines in Elephant Pass and Mannar, further contributing Rs. 100 million to the Treasury. These examples demonstrate the potential of utilizing our nation\u2019s resources for economic benefit.\u201d",
    "\u201cHowever, challenges such as legal cases against phosphate exports can arise. While these obstacles exist, we must not be discouraged. Giving up on resource utilization due to difficulties would be a disservice to our struggling nation. In these times, maximizing the potential of our resources becomes even more crucial\u201d, the State Minister further explained.",
