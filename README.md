### UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees

*2024-12-12 09:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104178/un-general-assembly-demands-ceasefire-in-gaza-and-backs-un-agency-helping-palestinian-refugees) · `en`

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban.

The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA.

The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group and demanding access throughout Gaza to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. Other opposing both resolutions included Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga.

While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly.

### A no -confidence motion against the Speaker?

MP Ajith P. Perera threatens no-confidence motion against Speaker over missing PhD credentials. He claims Speaker must prove academic qualifications within two weeks. Opposition may unite to challenge Speaker's legitimacy if requirements aren't met.

🟩

United People's Power MP Ajith P. Perera has said that he expects to bring a no -confidence motion against the Speaker.

The National People's Power or Speaker should explain the doctor's degree of the Speaker.

Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said that if it did not, the opposition members would meet and bring a no -confidence motion against the Speaker.

If he had a really acceptable doctor degree, this story had no meaning. But it is a major problem in the delay, the government's speechless journalist in the news, and the removal of the issue of doctorate from the parliamentary website.

His doctor's degree must submit to the country in the next two weeks. Otherwise it is expected to bring a no -confidence motion. We haven't decided yet. We are going to discuss with the Opposition MPs group. If that happens, the National People's Power MPs will vote during their conscience during the no -confidence motion. Remble

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s obsession over reopening car imports, shows a sad and worrying defeat of economics and the iron grip of naked mercantilism among policy makers that led the country to 72 years of exchange and trade controls and eventual external default in 2022.

Sri Lanka’s peacetime default, after a 30-year war, came amid a general deterioration of monetary policy worldwide in the aftermath of the housing bubble fired by the Fed, reviving the false religion of stimulus (potential output) and excess liquidity (quantitative easing), which classicals used to call the super abundance of paper money.

In this journey to default, technical advice from the International Monetary Fund, for monetary policy modernization and justifications to print money and deny monetary stability to the poor (potential output) has played a big part.

However formidable, even brilliant, a leader and protagonist in the national political arena President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is, dialectics in general and the dialectics of the debt deal in particular, will undermine and undo AKD-NPP rule. A contradiction lies embedded at the very heart of the Government between the NPP’s progressive political sociology—its generational and gender configuration—and its regressive political economy. AKD and the NPP’s economic decisions; their choice of economic strategy and model; their economic turn, will erode and disintegrate the NPP social bloc and vote-base—and cannot but do so. Anura is determined, but the economy is the determinant.

While investing in the share market carries risk, there are clear long-term rewards for those who enter it with discipline

Sri Lanka’s equity market as measured by the Colombo Stock Exchange is hitting new highs, in a wave of political and economic optimism.

Accuses NPP Govt. of mishandling governance and focusing on trivial, self-created issues

### Liberal Youth Movement urges Govt. inquiry into academic qualification concerns of Speaker

*2024-12-12 04:51:39* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Liberal-Youth-Movement-urges-Govt-inquiry-into-academic-qualification-concerns-of-Speaker/56-770394) · `en`

The Liberal Youth Movement yesterday expressed its deep concern over allegations questioning the authenticity of the academic qualifications presented by Speaker Ashoka Ranwala prior to elections and during Parliamentary proceedings.

“These concerns have sparked significant public debate and raised serious doubts about the integrity of information shared by leaders with the electorate,” said the Liberal Youth Movement’s Co-Convener Namini Panditha in a statement.

While academic qualifications are not mandatory for holding the position of a Member of Parliament or Speaker, such titles carry weight and are often used to influence voters and enhance political credibility. Misrepresentation of credentials undermines public trust and tarnishes the democratic process.

*2024-12-12 01:30:23* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cvgne5j931wo) · `si`

ඉතාලි රියැදුරු බලපත්‍රය: 'ඩ්‍රයිවින් කරන රස්සාවක් හොයාගන්න තිබුණා ලයිසන් එක තිබුණා නම්. එහෙනම් මේ සීතලේ මැරෙන්න වෙන්නේ නෑ'

වැඩි වශයෙන් ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයන් සංක්‍රමණය වන රටවල් අතරින් රටක් වන ඉතාලියේ වෙසෙන ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයෝ ආසන්න වසර දෙකක පමණ කාලය තුළ රියැදුරු බලපත්‍ර සම්බන්ධ ගැටලුවකට මුහුණ දී සිටිති.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ රියැදුරු බලපත්‍රය ලබා ගෙන තිබුණු ඉතාලියේ ස්ථීර පදිංචිය ලැබූවන්ට එම බලපත්‍රය ඉතාලියට වලංගු වන ආකාරයෙන් හරවා ගැනීමේ පහසුකමක් මීට පෙර හිමිව තිබිණි.

ඒ, ශ්‍රී ලංකා රජය සහ ඉතාලි රජය අතර පැවති ද්විපාර්ශ්වික ගිවිසුමක් අනුව ය.

නමුත් මේ වන විට එම පහසුකම ඉතාලියේ වෙසෙන ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයන්ට අහිමි වී තිබේ.

ඉතාලියේ අගනුවර වන මිලානෝ සිට කිලෝමීටර 350ක් පමණ දුරින් පිහිටි නගරයක් වන, පේසරෝ නගරයේ ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයෙකු වන නුවන් දිසානායක දිවි ගෙවයි.

2022 වසරේ ශ්‍රී ලංකාව මුහුණ දුන් ආර්ථික අර්බුදය හමුවේ බොහෝ තරුණ පිරිස් වෙනත් රටවල්වලට ශීඝ්‍රයෙන් සංක්‍රමණය වූ අතර නුවන් ද එම වසරේදී ඉතාලියට සංක්‍රමණය වූ අයෙකි.

### 2024-12-11 (Wednesday)

### Beat the Heat…

*2024-12-11 23:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/beat-the-heat/) · `en`

Phew! It’s terribly hot when you venture out and your skin is at an exposed danger of the ultraviolet rays.

Yes, we can’t stop ourselves from stepping out, but you can protect yourself from the harmful rays.

Application of fresh aloe vera gel to the skin helps to soothe and heal sunburn. Aloe vera contains zinc, which is actually anti-inflammatory.

Papaya pulp can be applied on the skin, like a mask…washing it off after 20 minutes. Papaya contains enzymes and helps to remove dead skin cells. Add curd or lemon juice to the papaya pulp to remove tan. Fruits like banana, apple, papaya, orange can be mixed together and applied on the face. Keep it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Papaya helps to cleanse dead skin cells. Banana tightens the skin. Apple contains pectin and also tones the skin. Orange is rich in Vitamin C. It restores the normal acid-alkaline balance.
