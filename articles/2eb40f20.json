    "The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) last week (1 August) hosted a high-level meeting with a delegation from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to discuss the progress of audit of poultry slaughterhouses and further discussions on enabling Sri Lankan poultry exports to Singapore.",
    "The discussions built on two recent SFA inspection missions to Sri Lanka. The first visit, conducted in March 2024, covered New Anthony\u2019s Farm, NELNA Farm, and Ceylon Grain Elevators. The second visit, held from 28 July to 1 August, included audits of DAPH, Pussella Farm, Jaya Farm, and Bairaha Farms PLC.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s potential to supply high-quality poultry products was emphasised, backed by its disease-free status, strategic geographic position, and competitive product offerings. In 2024, Sri Lanka exported poultry products worth $ 5.4 million reflecting a 37% year-on-year (YoY) increase to destinations including the Maldives, Qatar, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan. Efforts are also underway to enter the Chinese market.",
    "EDB and DAPH have shortlisted several Sri Lankan companies for potential export to Singapore, and the necessary applications have already been submitted to the SFA. Key discussion points included meeting Singapore\u2019s rigorous food safety standards and outlining the regulatory requirements for Sri Lankan exporters to secure market access.",
    "Both parties underscored the importance of close cooperation. The SFA\u2019s engagement and DAPH\u2019s leadership in ensuring regulatory compliance were commended as pivotal to achieving successful market entry. This initiative represents a significant step in deepening bilateral agricultural trade and diversifying Sri Lanka\u2019s export portfolio.",
    "The meeting was chaired by EDB Chairman/CEO Mangala Wijesinghe and attended by Director General Champika D. Dharmasena, senior EDB officials, as well as the senior officials from the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) and the Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation Ministry.",
    "The SFA delegation included senior officials: Deputy Director \u2013 Joint Operations Division Herman Teo, Senior Assistant Director \u2013 Joint Operations Division Low Bee Leng, Regulatory Standards and Veterinary Office Veterinarian Dr. M. Yoganandhini and Southwest Regional Office Manager Alex Chen.",
    "The Department of Animal Production and Health was represented by Director General Dr. Hemali Kothalawala, Additional Director General Dr. H. Kothalawala, and other technical experts. The Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation Ministry was represented by Livestock Development Additional Secretary Dr. Palika Fernando.",
    "Officials concluded the meeting with optimism that Sri Lankan poultry products will soon gain approval for export to Singapore, paving the way for stronger economic ties and expanded opportunities for agri-trade collaboration."
