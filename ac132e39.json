  "original_body_lines": [
    "The European Parliament has voted to pass a fiercely contested law to restore degraded natural ecosystems, salvaging the environmental measures that centre-right lawmakers had campaigned to kill off.",
    "European Union lawmakers on Wednesday adopted the legal proposal with 336 votes in favour, 300 against, and 13 abstentions.",
    "Lawmakers and member countries will negotiate the final text, aiming for a deal before EU Parliament elections in 2024.",
    "\u201cWe have won. It is a social victory: for scientists, for young people, for a lot of companies and businesses, for the agricultural sector,\u201d Cesar Luena, the parliament\u2019s lead negotiator on the law, told reporters after the vote.",
    "The decision came after months of political campaigning that exposed deep divisions among EU countries and lawmakers over the proposal, with some government leaders warning that Europe is pushing through too many environmental laws as part of its overall green agenda.",
    "The new legislation will require countries to introduce measures restoring nature on a fifth of their land and sea by 2030.",
    "The aim is to reverse the decline of Europe\u2019s natural habitats \u2013 81 percent of which are classed as being in poor health.",
    "\u201cRestoring nature brings numerous benefits to farmers such as revitalising soils, supporting pollinators and buffering them from the worsening impacts of climate change. It is as simple as this: we cannot grow food on dead soil,\u201d EU lawmaker Mohammed Chahim said after the vote.",
    "The European People\u2019s Party (EPP), the European Parliament\u2019s biggest lawmaker group, led a campaign to reject the plan on the grounds it would harm farmers and endanger food security.",
    "That is despite Ursula von der Leyen \u2013 the head of the European Commission, which proposed the nature law \u2013 being from the EPP party.",
    "\u201cWe fear that this law will be counterproductive and have significant social and economic consequences,\u201d the EPP group said in a tweet.",
    "Other lawmakers and scientists have rejected the EPP\u2019s claims, accusing the group of using misinformation to court votes before EU Parliament elections next year. The group denies this.",
    "\u201cThis law is not against anybody,\u201d Luena said. \u201cThis is a law on behalf of nature, not against any person whatsoever.\u201d",
    "Luena thanked the scientists and young people who had supported the law \u2013 among them Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who attended the EU assembly on Wednesday to watch the vote.",
    "Brussels has already passed dozens of CO2-cutting laws to deliver the EU\u2019s overall green agenda, including its goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.",
    "But recent environmental proposals have hit resistance \u2013 particularly those that would require changes from farmers to tackle environmental pollution and the collapse of bee and butterfly populations.",
    "EU lawmakers voted earlier this week to weaken another law to cut pollution from farms."
