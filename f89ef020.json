  "original_body_lines": [
    "Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe disclosed this week that the Chitrasiri Committee report for a new constitution for Sri Lanka Cricket cannot be implemented due to a court-issued stay order.",
    "Speaking in Parliament on Thursday he highlighted that despite the apparent inclination of many MPs in favour of implementing the report, there are three court orders in place that prevent the execution of crucial reports and decisions relating to cricket.",
    "\u201cThe court has issued a stay order preventing the authorities from taking action against fraud and corruption based on the Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena T20 World Cup report. The same court has also issued a stay order on the Chitrasiri Committee report for a new constitution to be introduced to SLC. A third injunction order by the court has now also been issued against the interim cricket committee appointed by the Sports Minister,\u201d he explained.",
    "The Minister clarified that these orders remain valid to this day, and despite unanimous support within the Parliament for a new constitution for Sri Lanka Cricket based on the Chitrasiri Committee report, it should be acknowledged that the Courts have put a halt to its implementation. \u201cThis is the impasse in which cricket finds itself,\u201d he observed.",
    "The report by the Committee headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri to introduce a new constitution to Sri Lanka Cricket through a Parliamentary Act was handed over to the Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to resolve Sri Lanka Cricket issues, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry PC, by President\u2019s Secretary Saman Ekanayake on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday.",
    "This new draft constitution suggests a comprehensive overhaul of the method for appointing members to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, as well as changes in its composition, administration and management."
