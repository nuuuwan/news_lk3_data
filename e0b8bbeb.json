    "Points out proposed DDO plan is optimum solution with least burden on people",
    "It is essential for Sri Lanka to ensure it goes ahead with the current reform efforts, else it runs the risk of having to face another Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) exercise, the Central Bank cautioned yesterday.",
    "\u201cIf Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t continue to remain on track, there could be a second DDO. But we don\u2019t need another DDO since the current one is strong and consistent with the expectations,\u201d said Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe.",
    "He shared his views while presenting the keynote at the CEO forum organised by the Sri Lanka Chapter of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA).",
    "End of June, Sri Lanka announced the proposed DDO arrangement. Dr. Weerasinghe stressed this was done after a \u201ccareful analysis\u201d of all possible options available.",
    "\u201cThe proposed plan would be the optimum solution with the least burden on the citizenry,\u201d he stressed while reiterating that the Central Bank remains committed to ensuring the stability of the banking system while also ensuring the well-being of the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund.",
    "Dr. Weerasinghe shared that going forward, the key expected outcomes of both the DDO process and restructuring of foreign debt is the reduction of the gross financing need to below 13 percent of GDP, over the period 2027-2032 and removal of public debt to below 95 percent of GDP during the same timeframe.",
    "Now that the DDO process is underway, the Central Bank is actively working with the government to establish macroeconomic stability, as envisaged in the broader macroeconomic framework agreed upon under the International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility, he said, outlining the next course of action.",
    "\u201cWith the debt restructuring, fiscal consolidation and reforms to state-owned enterprises underway, it is expected that the government borrowing in the medium term will reduce while the availability of credit for private sector investment will improve, thereby having a positive growth impact,\u201d said Dr. Weerasinghe.",
    "In turn, economic growth is essential in the post-debt restructuring period, as it affects the ability of a country to pay its debt obligations, even after restructuring, he added. Further, Dr. Weerasinghe pointed out that the 2023 borrowing limit is not to further borrow but to pave the way for the DDO."
