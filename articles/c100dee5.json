    "The Commercial Bank of Ceylon Group has achieved impressive growth at the end of the third quarter of 2024 by banking on judicious portfolio management and continued improvement of its CASA ratio to counteract the impacts of reduced interest income in prevailing market conditions.",
    "Comprising of Sri Lanka\u2019s biggest private sector bank, its subsidiaries and an associate, the Commercial Bank Group has reported net interest income of Rs 88.98 billion for the nine months ended 30th September 2024, an increase of 46.15%, despite declines in interest income and gross income for the period.",
    "With interest rates for customer advances as well as government securities continuing to be lower than in the preceding year, the Group posted gross income of Rs 241.71 billion for the period, down 5.57% over the corresponding nine months of 2023.",
    "Interest income was similarly impacted, reducing by 7.77% to Rs 207.12 billion, but repricing of deposits and a further improvement in the CASA ratio brought interest expenses down by a noteworthy 27.83% to Rs 118.14 billion, enabling healthy growth in net interest income, the Group said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).",
    "\u201cThe challenge for banks operating in periods of low interest rates is to grow their portfolios while managing margins with timely adjustments,\u201d Commercial Bank Chairman Sharhan Muhseen commented. \u201cOur impeccable record of prudence and fairness along with our demonstrated financial strength continues to drive deposit mobilisation, enabling us to continue to step up lending. The performance for the nine months reviewed flows from these dynamics, underscoring the Group\u2019s expertise and resilience.\u201d",
    "Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge added that vigilant supervision of the quality of the loans portfolio, equitable and forward-looking management of impairment provisioning and timely repricing of assets and liabilities have underpinned the Group\u2019s nine-month performance and would continue to be the strategy for the future. \u201cStrong, consistent performance even in volatile conditions enables the Bank to continue to accelerate lending, and invest in digital transformation, sustainability and other commitments,\u201d he said.",
    "For the nine months reviewed, the Group reported gross loans and advances of Rs 1.42 trillion, a growth of Rs 121.06 billion or 9.34% since December 2023, at a monthly average of Rs 13.45 billion. Significantly, 44.20% of loan book growth was recorded in the third quarter of the year. Loan book growth over the preceding 12 months was Rs 177.88 billion or 14.36%, averaging Rs 14.82 billion per month.",
    "Deposits increased by 3.66% to Rs 2.23 trillion in the nine months, despite the appreciation of Rupee against the Dollar, reflecting average monthly growth of Rs 8.73 billion, and YoY growth of 9.22%, with monthly average growth of Rs 15.67 billion over the preceding 12 months. Notably, while Rupee deposits grew by more than Rs 120 billion in the review period, the Rupee value of foreign currency deposits reduced by Rs 46.19 billion, due to the appreciation of the Rupee.",

In contrast, impairment charges for the third quarter of 2024 were just Rs 1 billion.",
    "Net operating income for the nine months grew by 57.74% to Rs 95.70 billion. The Group\u2019s success in containing total operating expenses for the period to Rs 36.49 billion \u2013 a growth of only 14.12%, enabled it to report operating profit before taxes on financial services of Rs 59.21 billion, an improvement of 106.36%.",
