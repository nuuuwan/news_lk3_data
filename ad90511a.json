    "By means of the new communiqu\u00e9, the Extraordinary Gazette bearing reference No. 2356/43 dated November 05, 2023, has been rescinded with immediate effect, thereby dissolving the Interim Committee appointed for the purpose of exercising the powers, functions and duties of SLC.",

Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen.",
    "The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging the move.",
    "Later, on Nov.13, then Sports Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order.",
    "Nevertheless, on Nov.27, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation.",

    "Against this backdrop, the SLC decided to establish an independent committee to inquire into audit reports, and make recommendations to ensure the prevention of corruption. The panel comprises Retired Supreme Court Judges S. I. Imam and Rohini Marasinghe and Retired High Court Judge Irangani Perera."
