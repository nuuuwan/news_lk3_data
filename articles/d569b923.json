    "Requests probe into the manner in which he was arrested in 2019 and prosecuted",
    "Alleges charges against him were fabricated as part of a deliberate conspiracy aimed at creating discord among communities",
    "Accuses law enforcement of collecting complaints against him only after his arrest",
    "Kurunegala Teaching Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics Unit Senior House Officer Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen who was cleared of all charges related to his 2019 arrest has lodged a complaint with the Public Security Ministry.",
    "Dr. Shihabdeen is urging the Ministry to investigate the circumstances of his arrest and subsequent prosecution, asserting that the allegations against him were fabricated as part of a deliberate conspiracy which also involved forged documents, aimed at creating discord among communities.",
    "Speaking to the media outside the Ministry Dr. Shihabdeen recalled the struggles faced by him over the past five years due to the false allegations and the undue stress imposed on his family. He observed that law enforcement officials only began collecting complaints against him after his arrest. The medical practitioner said he was lodging the complaint on behalf of those who fought for his freedom and committed to prevent similar injustices from taking place against others in the future.",
    "The Kurunegala Magistrate\u2019s Court acquitted Dr. Shihabdeen of all charges related to his 2019 arrest and subsequent arrest on Wednesday. Magistrate Bandula Gunaratne, following the Attorney General\u2019s advice and due to insufficient evidence, ordered Dr. Shihabdeen\u2019s acquittal. Dr. Shihabdeen, who was at the time of his arrest a practising gynaecologist at the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, faced serious allegations in May 2019 when he was accused of performing unauthorised sterilisation surgeries on women. The accusations first levelled against him by a popular Sinhala daily newspaper led to his immediate suspension sparking significant media attention and public outcry."
