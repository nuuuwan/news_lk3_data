    "Speaking at a rally in Matale, Wickremesinghe emphasized that he does not require any privileges for himself and that the government must prioritize the safety of other former presidents.",
    "Addressing the rally, he remarked, \u201cPresidential residences are being removed. I don\u2019t have a problem. I don\u2019t live in a residence. It\u2019s not a problem for me. Why are they chasing behind Chandrika? Just let her be in that house. I have nothing special, but for humanity\u2026 If Mahinda Rajapaksa requires security for himself\u2026he is the one who ended the war, think about it\u2026\u201d",
