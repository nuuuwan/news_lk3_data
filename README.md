Another dispute has emerged within the New Democratic Front (NDF) concerning the nomination of Faiszer Musthapha for a National List MP position with the coalition partners alleging that this decision has been made without consulting them.

When inquired by Ada Derana, former Parliamentarian Ramesh Pathirana stated that there was unanimous agreement to appoint former Minister Kanchana Wijesekera to the remaining National List MP position.

However, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), a key partner in the NDF, had proposed Faiszer Musthapha’s name for the position.

The NDF, which contested under the ‘gas cylinder’ symbol in the 2024 general elections, secured two National List seats.

The other National List MP seat had been filled by former minister Ravi Karunanayake of the UNP, also under somewhat controversial circumstances.

Sri Lankan cricketer Niroshan Dickwella’s ban from playing any form of cricket has been significantly reduced from three years to three months.

Accordingly, this makes him eligible to play all forms of cricket effective from today (11).

After the consideration of an appeal made by Dickwella, the appeal panel has declared that as per the medical evidence it is clearly established that the player has consumed a substance of abuse out-of-competition and that it is unrelated to sports performance.

Accordingly, the panel has stated that therefore, they are of the view that the player Niroshan Dickwella’s 3 years ineligibility period imposed by the disciplinary panel, should be reduced to 3 months ineligibility period, commencing from 13 August 2024.

Furthermore, the panel has mentioned that this decision balances the player’s right to fair consideration with the principles of anti-doping, ensuring fairness while maintaining the integrity of sport.
