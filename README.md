Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and External Affairs (July 1960 ‚Äî August 1965)

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Working with S W R D Bandaranaike in the 1956-1959 period had given me the opportunity of appreciating the many-faceted character of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was a devoted mother to her three children, ran her very busy and sometimes even chaotic household with a firm hand and had developed an understanding with her husband which allowed him to engage in his political pursuits with minimum interference.

### Two Bhikkhunis ‚Äì one ancient, the other of the recent past

December to me is the month to celebrate women. I presume the reason is that I revere Sanghamitta Theri, daughter of Emperor Asoka, who on request of King Devanampiya Tissa (250 ‚Äì 210 BC) on behalf of the women in his court, came to Lanka. She brought a sapling from the Gaya Bo Tree under which Siddhartha Gautama solved the riddle of samsaric existence and found a solution. She also started the Bhikkhuni Order in this country; the request being made by Queen Anula, sister-in-law of King Devanampiya Tissa.

Theri Sanghamitta‚Äôs arrival in a then port in the Jaffna Peninsula now known as Jambakolapatuna and her being conducted in procession to Anuradhapura occurred in the month of December, hence our observance of Unduvap Poya this month along with Sanghamitta Day.

I would like to explain why I continue writing so shamelessly about a subject about which recent events have proved I know next to nothing.

In my defense, the news I have reported over the years has been always been based on facts and the traditional ‚Äúreliable sources‚Äù. Unfortunately, my opinions and predictions have been personal and out of touch with the current political and social climate prevailing in the United States, which has changed substantially since the turn of the century.

Donald Trump will spend the next three months finalising his Cabinet.

### Ranil‚Äôs ascent in the UNP to become PM after the Premadasa assassination

On September 21, 2024, Sri Lanka will hold (Note: this was written before the election) its ninth presidential election. Unlike all previous such polls, which were in effect two-way battles between the governing party and the main opposition party, this is a three-way contest between Wickremesinghe, Premadasa of the SJB and Dissanayake of the JVP ‚Äì the latter heading a coalition dubbed National People‚Äôs Power (NPP).

But the election is taking place on a battleground largely of Wickremesinghe‚Äôs making. The 21st Amendment he pushed through gave birth to an independent Election Commission. He also enacted a campaign finance law that enables the commission to decide the amounts candidates can spend and to enforce these limits. The commission is conducting this election with unprecedented even-handedness and applying long-ignored election laws ‚Äì including against Wickremesinghe‚Äôs own campaign.

Wickremesinghe‚Äôs deal with the IMF earlier came under severe opposition criticism;

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-08 03:28:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) ¬∑ `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.

### An impusive visit to George Keyt nearly 40 years ago

*2024-12-08 03:13:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/an-impusive-visit-to-george-keyt-nearly-40-years-ago/) ¬∑ `en`

A few Sundays ago (this article was written in July 1985) I travelled through the fertile lands of the Dumbara valley and passed through Kundasale, Arangala, Gammaduwa (with its Buddhist Temple of unique design) and Sirimalwatta, to Gunnepana.

The purpose was to see, in person, George Keyt, whose great artistic achievements and invaluable contribution to art in Sri Lanka were so beautifully presented recently in a telefilm Directed by Tissa Liyanasuriya with the script by Tissa Devendra. Up to the time of this TV program it was a hope that a chance meeting would materialize, but it became an urgent need after that.

The drive was tortuous, the roads being more like gullies than even cart tracks. But what bothered me more was a faint recollection of a conversation I cannot remember where, which left with me the impression that the artist does not welcome visitors. However, since the decision had been made I kept going stopping frequently for directions.

NPP received massive mandate by the people across ethnic, religious and social divide to charter the course of the country for the coming five years. Attracted primarily by their slogan of eliminating corruption and reducing wastage and others like delivering social justice to all and applying meritocracy in selection, they have been ushered into position of authority. However they have made a fundamental mistake in deciding that problems faced by Sinhalese and Tamils are the same and if the economic situation in the country improves, everything will be fine, descending into wishful thinking that Tamil demand for justice would fizzle out. In this aspect they seem to be no different to previous governments.

### South Korea‚Äôs President survives impeachment vote after his party boycotts

A South Korean legislative push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law fell through on Saturday after most lawmakers from his conservative governing party boycotted the vote.

The defeat of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for Yoon‚Äôs ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president‚Äôs impeachment.

Yoon‚Äôs martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative party, but it is also determined to oppose Yoon‚Äôs impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals.

Impeaching Yoon required support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties who brought the impeachment motion had 192 seats, but only three lawmakers from PPP participated in the vote. The motion was scrapped without ballot counting because the number of votes didn‚Äôt reach 200.

Earlier this year, electricity tariffs were reduced twice under the policy of revising rates quarterly‚Äîby 21.9% in March and 22.5% in July. Although another revision was due in October, it was postponed to December.

The PUCSL recently rejected a CEB proposal to reduce rates by 6% to 11%, asserting that a more significant reduction was possible given current conditions.

He explained to us that the Haier unit had one year full warranty and a 5 year compressor warranty.¬† He did ask us the size of the room and based on my experience with AC‚Äôs in SL for several decades, I opted for a 12000 BTU unit meant for just one room.
