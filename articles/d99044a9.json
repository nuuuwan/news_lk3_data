    "Ghana\u2019s Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia has accepted defeat in Saturday\u2019s election and congratulated the opposition candidate, former President John Mahama, on his victory.",
    "The elections come amid the country\u2019s worst economic crisis in a generation, which saw the country default on its debt.",
    "The Electoral Commission (EC) said results had been delayed because supporters of the two main parties were impeding the process and it had asked the police to clear the collation centres.",
    "Mahama\u2019s supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate in its northern stronghold of Tamale, the central city of Kumasi and the capital, Accra.",
    "Bawumia said he was basing his statement on internal tallies from the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP).",
    "He said these showed Mahama had won \u201cdecisively\u201d, while the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) had also won the parliamentary election.",
    "Mahama confirmed that Bawumia had called to congratulate him on his \u201cemphatic victory\u201d.",
    "The NDC earlier said that its internal results showed Mahama had won 56% of the vote against 41% for Bawumia.",
    "The vice-president said he was accepting defeat before the official announcement of the results \u201cto avoid further tension and preserve the peace of our country\u201d.",
    "President Nana Akufo-Addo is stepping down after reaching the official limit of two terms in office.",
    "Mahama, 65, previously led Ghana from 2012 until 2017, when he was replaced by Akufo-Addo. Mahama also lost the 2020 election so this victory represents a stunning comeback.",
    "Since the return of multi-party politics to Ghana in 1992, only candidates from either the NDC or the NPP have won the presidency.",
    "No party has ever won more than two consecutive terms in power - a trend that looks set to continue.",
    "Mahama\u2019s previous time in office was marred by an ailing economy, frequent power-cuts and corruption scandals.",
    "However, Ghanaians hope it will be different this time round.",
    "In Tamale, NDC supporter Gajia One told the BBC: \u201cWe handed over to them [NPP] and thought they could manage the country well, but they have failed, and we take over again.\u201d",
    "\u201cJohn Mahama is the right man to rule this country. We are fed up.\u201d"
