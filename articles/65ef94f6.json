    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru reaffirmed their commitment to deepening bilateral security and strategic cooperation during high-level talks in Tokyo on Monday. The meeting marked a significant step in advancing defense collaboration and regional stability in the Indo-Pacific.",
    "Both leaders emphasized the importance of enhancing Sri Lanka\u2019s security and deterrence capabilities to safeguard peace in the Indian Ocean Region. In a landmark move, Japan announced the provision of advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Sri Lanka under its first Official Security Assistance (OSA) initiative. The UAVs will bolster maritime surveillance and disaster relief operations, reinforcing Sri Lanka\u2019s role in maintaining regional security.",
    "President Dissanayake expressed gratitude for Japan\u2019s continued support in humanitarian and post-conflict initiatives, particularly its longstanding contribution to Sri Lanka\u2019s mine action program. Japan\u2019s assistance in demining has been instrumental in advancing national reconciliation and community development in former conflict zones.",
    "The two leaders also exchanged views on regional and global issues, reaffirming their shared commitment to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order. Both sides underscored the importance of multilateralism, democracy, and adherence to international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in maritime domains."
