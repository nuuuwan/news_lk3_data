### Kabosu, the face of cryptocurrency Dogecoin, dies at 18, owner says

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kabosu, the Japanese dog that became a global meme and the face of alternative cryptocurrency Dogecoin has died at 18, her owner announced in a blog post on Friday.

The Japanese Shiba Inu passed away while sleeping, her owner Atsuko Sato wrote.

Kabosu became recognizable as the face of Dogecoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy.

But the token jumped in value after Tesla boss Elon Musk, a proponent of cryptocurrencies, began tweeting about it in 2020. Since then the billionaire has repeatedly promoted the coin.

Dogecoin added as much as $4 billion to its market value last year when the billionaire, who bought social media site Twitter in 2022, briefly replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with an image of Kabosu. Musk subsequently renamed Twitter X.

With a market capitalization of around $23.6 billion, Dogecoin is now the ninth biggest cryptocurrency, according to data site Coingecko.com.

It seems like you've shared a detailed narrative about the evolution of Buddhism in Indonesia, particularly focusing on the influence of Ashin Thera and the development of a unique Buddhist tradition that incorporates elements of Indonesian multiculturalism and language. This narrative touches upon the historical context of Buddhism in Indonesia, including its interaction with the government, the rise of Christianity among certain groups, and the adaptation of Buddhism to fit local cultures.



If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any part of this narrative, feel free to ask

🟩

The various teachings of Buddhism, including theravada and wita, is spreading throughout the entire Indonesia today. How did it break into different traditions after it began?

One day at the school phase I went to the house of a friend located in the southern part of Jakarta. Like me, this friend is also a Chinese origin. The difference is that he is a Christian and is a Buddhist.

After I wanted to return home, I came to his mother, and she came to my gate.

There she briefly replied with me: "What church are you going?"

Back to her again I have answered "yes" before she left.

For more than 15 years, for more than 15 years, I have been unrest that I was saying that "still Buddhist" on the same day.

Her motive was not bad. She said it was by a normal tone and not to ridicule.

However, when I think of the statement, I said, "So what have I been in a Buddhist?"I question me that I am.

My family is followers of Trotic Policies and is literally, "three teachings of truth".

### High cost of mandatory currency conversions on Sri Lanka’s ability to earn foreign exchange

*2024-05-25 00:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/high-cost-of-mandatory-currency-conversions-on-sri-lankas-ability-to-earn-foreign-exchange/) · `en`

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currency’s strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.

While a stronger rupee certainly promises cheaper imports of essentials like petroleum, electricity, food medicine and other essentials in the short term, as a nation that is surviving on borrowed time and foreign currency, we cannot afford to ignore the other side of the equation – exports.

Each year in April, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) marks its first armed insurrection against the government in 1971, as ‘April Heroes’ Commemoration Day. The second JVP insurrection is memorialised by way of the ‘November Heroes’ commemoration marking the death of JVP founder and leader Rohana Wijeweera in 1989.

Wijeweera led two rebellions, one in 1971 and a second in 1989. Thousands of young Sinhalese men and women died in the two insurgencies led by the then-JVP leader. In those dark days, civilians were involuntarily disappeared by state forces, while the JVP too killed many civilians.

The ‘Mothers of the Disappeared’ was a coming together of female Sinhalese, who lost relatives during the JVP insurrections to government forces. They came together under a common umbrella to demand information as to what had happened to their sons, daughters, husbands and wives.

Despite President Wickremesinghe yet to officially announce his candidature the prospect of him contesting is increasing

Following the Election Commission’s announcement on May 9 that the Presidential election would be held between September 17 and October 16, President Ranil Wickremesinghe  informed the Cabinet on Wednesday that only the said election would be held this year putting an end to speculations that Parliament might be dissolved before the Presidential election.

However, the race for the top most post started months ago with the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) or the National People’s Power (NPP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the apparent two front-runners having commenced their campaigns in a huge way. They have been organising public meetings for various interest groups such as women, farmers and retired armed forces personnel with large crowds attending.

Sajith, with his haphazardly acquired knowledge, lacked the courage to face Anura directly.

Both leaders should be held responsible for sabotaging the debate. They repeated their 2022 strategy of evading responsibility by refusing to address the task of revitalizing the bankrupt economy. However, they deserve commendation for declining the offer, as they had the wisdom to recognize the enormity of the challenge, and acknowledging it as beyond their capabilities.

### Tragedy and farce on a day of mourning

The government wanted Sri Lankans to mourn over the demise of an Islamic ultra-conservative nicknamed ‘Butcher of Tehran’

The death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman in the custody of Iran’s moral  police over charges of not properly covering up hair, unleashed  nationwide protests in Iran, followed by a brutal crackdown by a regime  devoid of semblance of legitimacy, until Iranian proxies, Hamas  momentarily shifted the global spotlight from Iran’s suppression of its  people by carrying out an industrial scale massacre in Israel on October  7 last year.

As the monsoonal rains are set to wreak havoc and a climate emergency is in the making, the government had other pressing priorities. It declared a day of national mourning over the death of Iranian President and Islamic hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, whose VIP chopper crashed during a trip from Azerbaijan.

### Top UN court orders Israel to stop Rafah offensive

May 24 (BBC) - The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has issued a dramatic ruling, ordering Israel to "immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah".

It acted in support of a South African application last week which sought a number of measures against Israel, accusing it of stepping up what it says is a genocide.

Presiding judge Nawaf Salam said the situation in Gaza had deteriorated since the court last ordered Israel to take steps to improve it.

Israel has vehemently denied the allegation and signalled it would ignore any order to halt its operation.

Reading the court's ruling on Friday, Nawaf Salam said "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate" which could bring about "the physical destruction" of the Palestinians - alluding to what constitutes genocide under international law.

Israel, he added, must also allow unimpeded access to Gaza to any UN body investigating allegations of genocide.

This week alone, three European countries announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, and the chief prosecutor for another U.N. court requested arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, along with Hamas officials.
