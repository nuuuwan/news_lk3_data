According to the statement, he also addressed Russia\u2019s eastward shift and the evolving dynamics between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which further complicate the geopolitical landscape, calling for nuanced diplomacy and strategic foresight.",
    "Reiterating ri Lanka\u2019s commitment to promoting stability and cooperation in the Indian Ocean region, Wickremesinghe called for maintaining an inclusive approach that respects the historical significance of the Indian Ocean and considers the perspectives of its diverse stakeholders for long-term peace and prosperity.
