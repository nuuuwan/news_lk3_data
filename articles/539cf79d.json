    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. Charitha Herath on Tuesday emphasised the importance of prioritising the Presidential Election over Parliamentary Polls, urging the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to focus on this goal. Speaking at a press conference held at the party headquarters, Herath highlighted the constitutional mandate to hold the Presidential Election in a timely manner.",
    "He noted that while dissolving parliament and conducting a general election are separate processes, there have been instances of delays in convening parliament after dissolution, leading to delayed general elections. Given this context, Herath stressed the need to prioritise the Presidential Election, which is mandated by the constitution.",
    "According to Herath, the Executive post cannot be left vacant, and it is crucial to hold the Presidential Election before the end of the incumbent President's tenure. He pointed out that while there have been periods where the country was governed by the cabinet in the absence of parliament, the position of Executive President has never been vacant since 1978.",
    "In light of these considerations, Herath emphasised the importance of ensuring the timely conduct of the Presidential Election to avoid any vacuum in the Executive leadership of the country."
