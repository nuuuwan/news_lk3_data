Most structural benchmarks due before October-2024 were either met or implemented with delay,\u201d IMF said.",

    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s ambitious reform agenda supported by the EFF is delivering commendable outcomes.

Average headline and core inflation remained contained at 0.8 and 3.8 percent during the third quarter. Gross official reserves increased to US$6.4 billion at end-October 2024 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the Central Bank.
