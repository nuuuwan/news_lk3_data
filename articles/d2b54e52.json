    "GRIT partners \u2013 Hatch, LIIN, and Yarl IT Hub with representatives from WUSC and Canadian High Commission",
    "WUSC (World University Service of Canada) held its first entrepreneurial ecosystem convening and knowledge sharing events on 27 February 2024 in Colombo and 14 March in Jaffna, under its newest project GRIT - Growth, Resilience, Investment and Training, a Gender-Responsive Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Development Project in the North of Sri Lanka.",
    "The Colombo convening and learning event was attended by women entrepreneurs in the North showcased at the Mini-Expo, Government representatives, Board of Investment, ICTA, Women in Management, active incubators and accelerators, private sector, the finance sector, development partners, ILO, UNDP, international and local NGOs, business development service providers and investors. The learning component of the event comprised valuable insights on the recently published Regional Human Development Report (RHDR), with a focus on Sri Lanka by UNDP and Defining Women Heads of Households by the research unit of Viluthu. The events also held several panel discussions with institutions with strong entrepreneurship incubation and acceleration programs, women entrepreneurs from the Northern Province and ecosystem actors who support the journey of women entrepreneurs. The event also featured MSME booths at the Mini Expo.",
    "The Jaffna event was graced by Northern Province Governor P. S. M. Charles, Additional District Secretary K. Shrimohan, development partners, women\u2019s rights organisations, various Government officials, NGO coordinators and NGO Secretariat Director General Sanjeewa Wimalagunawardena.",
    "Addressing the forum, Linda Ehrichs, Charge\u2019 d\u2019 Affaires of the High Commission of Canada said that inclusive growth and lasting change cannot be achieved without the full and equal participation of women as economic actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Building on the long-standing relationship between Canada and Sri Lanka, Canada\u2019s support for the GRIT project continues to advance empowerment of women towards economic growth that works for everyone.",
    "GRIT\u2019s strength hinges on key partnerships, driving project implementation on the ground. In collaboration with Hatch, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading Innovation and Entrepreneurship development organisation, Yarl IT, with over 10 years of experience fostering the entrepreneurship and technology sectors in the North, LIIN, Sri Lanka\u2019s very first impact investment firm, DMZ, a world-leading incubator for tech startups around the world and the Criterion Institute, over the past two decades, has worked with investors, governments, and civil society organisations to design financial solutions to advance social justice, gender equality, and socio-economic development goals, GRIT adopts a multi-stakeholder approach, engaging entrepreneurs, their employees, families, community members, incubators, accelerators, business development services, fund managers, women\u2019s rights organisations, private sector entities, Government bodies, and development partners.",
    "Leading immediately after the convening and knowledge sharing event, some of the follow-up activities of the project include an ecosystem mapping, sector specific studies to understand support functions required by entrepreneurs coached by incubators and accelerators, a needs assessment of women entrepreneurs, a setting up of a MakerSpace and an impact investing summit. GRIT will organise periodic learning, sharing and convening events with stakeholders of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, facilitating partnerships, incentives and collaboration that will in turn harness the opportunities of a nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem towards a more robust ecosystem.",
    "\u201cLanka Impact Investing Network (LIIN) is excited to collaborate with WUSC on the GRIT project, blending women\u2019s empowerment in Northern Sri Lanka with climate action through impactful investments. We aim to enhance gender equality and sustainable growth by supporting environmentally conscious, women-led enterprises. This collaboration targets reducing inequality and fostering economic resilience, setting a new standard for a gender-responsive, environmentally sustainable business ecosystem. Our joint effort amplifies a commitment to creating inclusive opportunities for women, youth, and the planet. This initiative marks our dedication to a sustainable and equitable future.\u201d - A representative from LIIN.",
    "\u201cWe welcome this timely initiative by WUSC and are delighted to co-curate and deliver GRIT - which is envisioned to be a multi-year entrepreneurship development project targeting primarily female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka\u2019s post-conflict areas which have been historically underserved.\u201d - Hatch CEO Brindha Selvadurai Gnanam",
    "\u201cThe Yarl IT Hub Community is grateful to WUSC for initiating the GRIT program, aimed at nurturing a Gender Responsive Entrepreneurial ecosystem in the North of Sri Lanka over a six-year period. We firmly believe that embedding innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship at the grassroots is a pivotal strategy for catalysing profound social transformation within our communities, particularly those overcoming significant challenges. The timing could not be more opportune, given the interest and building momentum in these areas. We are excited to be part of this journey, contributing actively to fostering significant positive impacts in the lives of many.\u201d - A representative from Yarl IT",
    "WUSC (World University Service of Canada) is a Canadian non-profit organisation that improves education, economic opportunities, and empowerment for all young people.
