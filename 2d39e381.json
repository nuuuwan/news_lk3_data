    "Redoubling support for war-stricken Ukraine is the \u201csingle best\u201d way to aid the global economy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday, along with boosting emerging economies and tackling debt distress.",
    "Yellen also said on the sidelines of a G20 finance ministers summit in India she would \u201cpush back\u201d on criticism there was a tradeoff between aid to Ukraine and developing nations.",
    "\u201cEnding this war is first and foremost a moral imperative,\u201d she told reporters in Gandhinagar, which is hosting a wider G20 summit. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the single best thing we can do for the global economy.\u201d",
    "Yellen also pointed to efforts to tackle debt distress faced by struggling economies, bank reform and a global tax deal, and warned it was \u201cpremature\u201d to talk of lifting tariffs on China.",
    "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, both global breadbaskets that together exported almost a quarter of the world\u2019s wheat supply, triggered shockwaves in economies worldwide by sending prices for food and fuel shooting up.",
    "G7 leaders promised at a summit in Lithuania on Wednesday to support Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia\u2019s invasion.",
    "Any discussion on Ukraine is awkward for G20 host India, which has not condemned Russia\u2019s invasion but is also part of the Quad grouping alongside Australia, the United States and Japan.",
    "Yellen also cited debt restructuring progress in Zambia, which she discussed with Chinese officials last week on a visit to Beijing, and said she expected Ghana and Sri Lanka debt treatments would be finalised soon.",
    "She said it was still too soon to lift restrictions placed on China during a trade war launched by former US president Donald Trump.",
    "\u201cTariffs were put in place because we had concerns with unfair trade practices on China\u2019s side, and our concerns with those practices remain, they really haven\u2019t been addressed,\u201d Yellen said.",
    "\u201cPerhaps over time this is an area where we could make progress but I\u2019d say it is premature to use this as an area for de-escalation.\u201d",
    "Yellen pointed to other work tackling debt distress and the reform of multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and other regional lenders, in efforts she said could unlock $200 billion over the next decade.",
    "More than half of all low-income countries are near or in debt distress, double the case in 2015, she said.",
    "G20 finance chiefs and central bank heads are due to meet on Monday and Tuesday and World Bank chief Ajay Banga warned of a \u201cdeep mistrust... quietly pulling the Global North and South apart at a time when we need to be uniting\u201d.",
    "The climate change crisis, post-pandemic recovery efforts, the war in Ukraine and a lack of progress in the fight against poverty were creating divisions, Banga said.",
    "\u201cThe Global South\u2019s frustration is understandable,\u201d Banga said in an op-ed.",
    "The International Monetary Fund said finding common efforts to tackle the weak global economy would be crucial.",
    "\u201cThe world will be looking for joint action to address rising economic fragmentation, slowing growth, and high inflation,\u201d the IMF said in a statement last week.",
    "The G20 will also discuss cryptocurrency regulations, as well as making access to financing to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change easier for developing nations.",
    "\u201cIn the Global North, climate change means emissions reductions,\u201d Banga said.",
    "\u201cBut in the Global South, it is a matter of survival, because hurricanes are stronger, heat-resistant seeds are in short supply, drought is destroying farms and towns, and floods are washing away decades of progress.\u201d",
    "A newly agreed first step on a fairer distribution of tax revenues from multinational firms reached by 138 countries on Wednesday is also set to be delivered during the G20 talks.",
    "Multinationals, especially tech firms, are currently able to shift profits easily to countries with low tax rates even though they carry out only a small part of their activities there."
