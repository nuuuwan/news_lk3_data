    "Colombo Additional Magistrate Bandara Ilangasinghe has ordered the issuance of summons to Sri Lanka Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) former Chairperson Janaka Ratnayake and his wife, Kumari Yasoda Silva, to appear before the court on 10 December.",
    "The order issued on Monday relates to the non-payment of over Rs. 3 million in Value Added Tax (VAT) owed to the Government. The case stems from allegations that a computer service provider, managed by the couple in the Kirulapana area, failed to settle VAT obligations amounting to Rs. 31,846,248.24 in tax arrears, along with Rs. 1,851,658.37 in income tax arrears, covering the period from 2016 to 2018.",
    "Despite the summons, the respondents did not appear in court previously, instead sending another director of the company to represent them. Counsel Dinesh Perera, representing the Inland Revenue Commissioner General, urged the Court to summon Ratnayake and his wife directly, emphasising the need for their presence to address the substantial unpaid tax.",
    "The Colombo Additional Magistrate reviewed the request and subsequently issued the order."
