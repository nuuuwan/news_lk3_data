Training also plays a pivotal role through the Leading for Safety (LFS) initiative, under which over half of the combined full-time employees (FTE) and contractors have been trained, with successful completions recognized in the Annual Award Ceremony. The organization demonstrates its commitment to ongoing risk assessment and incident mitigation through a 100% participation and closure rate in Safety Improvement Reports (SIR). Additionally, the practice of conducting 20 Health & Safety Walks annually ensures continuous scrutiny and improvement of safety practices within the office premises.",
    "A crucial factor in the safety excellence at AB Mauri Lanka is the active engagement and recognition programs in place. The Annual Award Ceremony is essential for recognising individual and team safety champions and reinforces the commitment to celebrating and encouraging safe behaviour and practices. Capability development is also a key focus, with the EHS Manager\u2019s continuous professional development and training programs like \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d enhancing the quality and delivery of safety education. Family engagement initiatives, such as the H&S Art Competition for employees\u2019 children, foster an understanding and appreciation of safety from a young age.",
    "Sharing the robust safety culture beyond the premises is a priority for AB Mauri Lanka, and thus several customer-centric events were organised as part of the Target Zero Safety Award celebrations.

Additionally, an event with Five Star Bakers centered on enhancing safety protocols within their operations, highlighting AB Mauri Lanka\u2019s commitment to extending its safety practices industry-wide.",
