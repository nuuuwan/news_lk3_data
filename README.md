### Sri Lanka’s ambitious governance and macro-linked bonds explained

Sri Lanka’s restructuring of $12.55 billion in international bond debt is set to lead to the launch of a series of new, as-yet-untested instruments linked to economic growth and governance.

Observers say it is one of the most complex set of instruments ever arranged in a restructuring. The bonds aim to give the country additional debt relief if the economy falters and to encourage it to improve its governance.

The governance-linked bond (GLB) is the first of its kind and is designed to reward Sri Lanka for transparency and effective economic management by reducing the interest on its debt. To earn that reduction, Sri Lanka must meet targets, or key performance indicators (KPIs), seen as indicating better governance.

The first KPI demands that Sri Lanka exceed a baseline ratio set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for total revenue to GDP in both 2026 and 2027, which the Fund has projected at 15.3% and 15.4% respectively.
