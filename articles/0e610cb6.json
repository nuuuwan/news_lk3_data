    "Postal workers\u2019 strike entered the third day yesterday, with the government refusing to negotiate with the strikers until they call off their trade union action and agree to talk on its terms. The government has said in no uncertain terms that the postal workers will have to use the biometric attendance system, and there will be no revision of their overtime. In other words, it has told the strikers that heads it wins and tails they lose. Time was when the JVP tore into governments for laying down such conditions for negotiations with trade unions. Power exerts a corrosive influence on principles and reasoning.",
    "Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, announcing the government decision not to negotiate with strikers, lashed out at the postal workers for defying rules and regulations governing attendance and overtime in the state sector. There are some public institutions where the biometric attendance tracking systems are already in use, and therefore it defies comprehension why all state employees are not made to register attendance electronically. Equally, everything possible should be done to prevent overtime frauds in the state sector. However, some health workers have refused to use the biometric attendance systems, trotting out various excuses, and 213 machines imported at a cost of Rs. 31 million for them to record attendance electronically are idling. Shouldn\u2019t the government take action to make all health workers use those machines before asking the striking postal workers to do so?",
    "Dr. Jayatissa has also told the striking postal workers that if they cannot comply with the Postal Department\u2019s rules and regulations, they will have to look for employment elsewhere. This, we believe, is a veiled threat, which reminds us of President J. R. Jayewardene, who refused to heed the voice of trade unions and terminated at least 50,000 workers who took part in the 1980 general strike. Having sacked so many workers and driving some of them to suicide, the Jayewardene regime bragged that the elephant (meaning the UNP) had only shaken its trunk! Interestingly, the JVP pulled out of that workers\u2019 struggle at the eleventh hour on some flimsy pretext. At that time, it was on very intimate terms with the repressive UNP government, which released its leaders from prison in the late 1970s so much that its critics called JVP  Jayewardene Vijeweera Peramuna.",
    "Non-academic workers of the state universities staged a token strike yesterday against a reduction of overtime and a delay in enhancing the distress loan facility. They are likely to go on a continuous strike unless their demands are granted. Some school teachers have also been protesting. State workers voted for the NPP overwhelmingly as evident from the postal vote results in the last three elections; the NPP made various promises to them. Their honeymoon with the NPP government is apparently coming to an end. Farmers are also up in arms, demanding better prices for their paddy, and sugarcane cultivators and transporters are on the warpath, flaying the government for what they describe as a sinister move to close down the state-owned sugar factories and denying them their dues. It is a case of chickens coming home to roost for the JVP, which fostered a strike culture in the public sector while it was in the Opposition. The leaders of the JVP\u2019s trade union wing are now in Parliament, paying lip service to the workers\u2019 cause; their waistlines are bulging just like those of their Opposition counterparts whom the JVP once accused of living the good life at the expense of the public. Addressing the media, Vice Chairman of the Sri Lanka United National Businesses Alliance Susantha Liyanaarachchi yesterday tore a Deputy Minister to shreds for ignoring a delegation of his association at Parliament. He claimed the deputy minister who had wept buckets for the poor people in the run-up to last year\u2019s elections had been sighted enjoying good food Western way, in the company of two females, in the parliamentary canteen. This indicates the disillusionment of many NPP supporters, who had high expectations.",
    "Doomed is a government that succumbs to the arrogance of power. Ministers in the current administration exude hubris and give trade unions short shrift. Labour disputes are best resolved through negotiations, and strong-arm tactics are counterproductive. The government should get the striking postal unions around the table, and negotiate a settlement. As for attendance, all state employees, especially the health workers, should be made to use the electronic attendance tracking systems so that no room will be left for allegations of discrimination.",
    "Most of all, it is incumbent upon the current \u2018leftist\u2019 government to dismantle the strike culture it fostered and promote responsible trade unionism, while upholding workers\u2019 legitimate rights.",
