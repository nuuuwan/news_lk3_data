    "The 10th edition of the event will see 12 automatic qualifiers. These will include the joint hosts along with the top 8 teams from the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup 2024.",
    "Being the hosts, India and Sri Lanka will directly qualify for the tournament, while teams finishing in top 8 spots in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 will qualify for the next edition as well.",
    "If India and Sri Lanka finish in the top 8, six other teams will qualify for the T20 World Cup 2026, if India and Sri Lanka finish at a position lesser than 8th in the 2024 edition, they will qualify along with teams finishing in top eight positions.",

    "The 2024 prestigious tournament will set a new record in cricket as, for the first time in cricket history, 20 teams will be taking part in an international event. Therefore, the apex cricket body is interested in keeping the tournament a 20-team event in 2026 as well.",

However, in knockout matches, a minimum of 10 overs must be bowled in the second innings to constitute a game."
