    "New Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon assumed duties in his new role this morning (Nov,30).",
    "Tennakoon was serving as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) in charge of the Western Province at the time of his appointment yesterday (Nov.29).",
    "Speaking to the media last evening, Acting IGP Tennakoon vowed to eradicate the drug menace and organized criminal gangs in the country. He also said he would prioritize safeguarding the national security.",
    "The appointment was made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe pursuant to the powers vested with him. Accordingly, SDIG Tennakoon will serve as the Acting IGP for a period of three months.",
    "Meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena told Ada Derana yesterday that President Wickremesinghe has informed the Constitutional Council of the new Acting IGP.",
    "Tennakoon\u2019s appointment comes days after former police chief C.D. Wickramaratne decided to finally retire from the police service with effect from November 25, after receiving four service extensions as the IGP this year. He was initially supposed to enter retirement on March 26, however the Head of State had extended Wickramaratne\u2019s tenure by 3 months, by way of a gazette issued in April.",
    "Later, on July 09, he received another 3-month service extension, followed by two 3-week extensions granted on October 13 and November 03. The position of the police chief remained vacant for a few days following the retirement of Wickramaratne.",
    "Against this backdrop, the Sri Lankan Catholic Church has deplored the appointment of Tennakoon as the Acting IGP. Addressing a media briefing yesterday, the spokesperson of the Colombo Archdiocese Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini said the Catholic Church deems this appointment \u2018an insult\u2019 to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks."
