  "original_title": "Why Channel 4 TV Whistleblower  Azad Maulana Fled from Sri Lanka  Via India to  Seek Asylum in Switzerland.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "This article is the third and final of a trilogy  about  the coordinated attacks by suicide bombers  on the Easter Sunday of 21 April 2019. Young men with explosives targeted three Churches and three Luxury hotels in what has come to be known as  Sri Lanka\u2019s easter bombings .The explosive attacks in Colombo,Negombo and Batticaloa  resulted in 269 persons including  45 foreign nationals being killed and over 500  sustaining injuries.",
    "Various  conspiracy theories have been in circulation for many years  about the Easter bombings. Chief among these is  the one which alleges  that an official or officials of Sri Lanka\u2019s intelligence services had manipulated the misguided  Muslim youths into launching the attacks with the  ulterior objective of facilitating the return to power of former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa as President.",
    "This conspiracy theory received a tremendous boost in 2023 when Britain\u2019s Channel 4 TV aired the documentary \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s Easter bombings\u201d in its \u201cDispatches\u201d program on Tuesday 5 September 2023. Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP) leader Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillaiyaan\u2019s former secretary and ex-TMVP spokesperson Mohammed Milhilar Mohammed Hanzeer alias Azad Maulana was the whistleblower who made the controversial disclosures about his erstwhile boss",
    "The Oxford dictionary defines a whistleblower as a \u201csource who makes public information about alleged wrongdoing, typically by or within the organisation in which they are employed. A person blowing the whistle to journalists\u201d. The Cambridge dictionary describes a whistleblower as \u201ca person who tells someone in authority about something illegal that is happening, especially in a government department or a company.\u201d",
    "Whistleblower Azad Maulana (spelled as Mowlana and Moulana also) hailing from Maruthamunai in the Eastern province had reportedly  fled to Europe and sought political asylum in Switzerland.",
    "Appearing  on TV in 2023 , Azad Maulana made some startling disclosures  against former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, State Intelligence Service head Maj-Gen Suresh Sallay and Rural Road Development State Minister Chanthrakanthan known widely as Pillaiyaan. Several allegation were levelled s in the documentary concerning the April 2019 Easter bombings and the murders allegedly committed by the Govt sanctioned killer squad \u201cTripoly Platoon\u201d. Gotabaya, Suresh and Pillaiyaan have all  denied the allegations. Furthermore Maulana has been accused of concocting a false story to help him gain political asylum abroad.",
    "In recent times there has been a lot of interest in the man known as Azad Maulana . There  is much speculation in the media  that Azad Maulana  is being interviewed by Sri Lankan officials regarding the Easter bombings. It is also being suggested that he would soon give evidence  in Sri Lanka regarding the Easter bombings.",
    "It is against this backdrop that this column -with the aid of earlier writings \u2013  has been focusing on Azad Maulana in this trilogy.The first article was published on 18 April 2025 under the heading \u201c TMVP leader Pillaiyaan\u2019s arrest, 2019 Easter bombings and Azad Maulana\u2019s revelations\u201d. The second article was published under the heading \u201cEaster bombings conspiracy theories and importance of Azad Maulana\u2019s testimony\u201d. In this third article the focus would be on  on how and why Azad Maulana  allegedly left Sri Lanka and became a refugee in the West.",
    "I have not been able to converse directly  with Azad Maulana so far but have been communicating with several informed sources ranging from residents of his village Maruthamunai to activists from International non -governmental organizations familiar with all aspects of his case.  The three articles in this series have been pieced together on the basis of information gathered from these  informed sources.",
    "At the outset, it must be emphasised that all allegations made by Azad Maulana  on Channel 4 TV are yet to be verified and authenticated. Moreover, they have been denied as falsehoods by those whom the allegations were levelled against especially Maj-Gen Sallay.",
    "The charge made against Sallay by Maulana hinges around an alleged meeting at Karadippooval in Puttalam between the intelligence chief and Zahran Hashim the National Thowheeth Jamaath (NTJ) leader and livewire behind the Easter bombings.",
    "Maulana\u2019s allegation as stated in the documentary is essentially conjecture and inference based on that meeting.",
    "However, it must be said in fairness to Suresh Sallay that he has denied being in Sri Lanka at the time of the  the meeting",
    "As stated earlier , Mohammed Hanzeer alias Azad Maulana had bourgeoned into being an indispensable aide to  Chandrakanthan alias Pillaiyaan. He was Pillaiyaan\u2019s personal secretary as well as spokesperson of the TMVP. Maulana being reasonably proficient in Tamil, English and Sinhala was the interpreter cum translator on whom the monolingual Pillaiyaan relied upon when dealing with certain political leaders,   senior Govt officers , and security and intelligence officials.",
    "When Pillaiyaan was incarcerated for  five years over the killing of Batticaloa MP Joseph Pararajasingham, it was Azad who visited Pillaiyan regularly  with Court permission. When in Batticaloa, Maulana would visit Pillaiyaan on a daily basis. Maulana conveyed what was happening within TMVP circles to Pillaiyan and also passed on Pillaiyaan\u2019s instructions to party members. Maulana also coordinated all legal work regarding Pillaiyaan\u2019s case.",
    "Everything was hunky-dory for Hanzeer until the fateful Easter Sunday bombings of April 2019. According to Maulana, he was remorseful when it became known that Zahran and other  NTJ operatives were responsible for the heinous attacks on Churches and Tourist Hotels.",
    "As Hanzeer claimed in the Channel 4 documentary, he had purportedly arranged a first meeting between Sallay and Zahran. He also claimed that Suresh Sallay had telephoned him on the day of the bombing and asked him to transport someone from the Taj Samudra Hotel.",
    "Hanzeer could not do so as he was in Batticaloa then. It was learnt later that the person at Taj Samudra was the bomber who died in the Dehiwela hotel explosion.",
    "When he met Pillaiyaan in jail after the bombings, the TMVP Leader had supposedly told him to keep quiet about all this and to speak to no one about it.",
    "In 2019 November Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected President. In the aftermath of the bombings, the electorate yearned for a strong man to keep the country safe.",
    "Months after  the April 2019 Easter bombings, the political grapevine had been buzzing about suspected links between the National Thowheed Jamath bombers and high officials in Sri Lanka\u2019s intelligence services. Popular gossip was about a possible nexus between Govt officials and the Islamic bombers. It was rumoured that the Easter attacks were a conspiracy to bring Gota to power. Conspiracy theories are galore in Sri Lanka and there were few takers for this then.",
    "In March 2021 during a debate in Parliament, then  opposition MPs Anura Kumara Dissanayake (JVP) and Manusha Nanayakkara (SJB) made several allusions about top intelligence officials being implicated in the Easter bombing conspiracy. In April 2021 the then SJB Parliamentarian Harin Fernando made several sensational disclosures in Parliament about the alleged involvement of a high intelligence officer in the April 2019 attacks.",
    "Harin Fernando was careful not to mention names explicitly, but it was inferred that the references were to Major-General Suresh Sallay the head of the State Intelligence Service (SIS). Sallay had been earlier the chief of Military Intelligence. He served as Minister Counsellor in Sri Lanka\u2019s High Commission in Malaysia after the Sirisena -Wickremesinghe Govt gained power in 2015. In 2019 Suresh Sallay went to India for a course in Defence studies and was in New Delhi when the Easter bombings took place.",
    "In October 2021 there was an international webinar held over Zoom about the Easter Sunday attacks, The Catholic Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith and the well-known catholic Clergyman Fr. Cyril Gamini participated in the discussions. Some of the comments made alluded to the alleged involvement of Maj-Gen Suresh Sallay in the bombings. Subsequently, Gen. Sallay filed a defamation lawsuit against Fr. Cyril Gamini alleging that some of the remarks made by the clergyman had tarnished his (Sallay\u2019s) reputation.",
    "A few  days after the Webinar, Gen.  Suresh Sallay telephoned Hanzeer Azad Maulana and wanted to meet him.  Azad Maulana met Sallay on 15 October 2021.According to Maulana, Sallay had played video clips of the Parliamentary speeches by Harin Fernando and other opposition MPs to Hanzeer. He had also shown clips of the Webinar comments by Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and Fr. Cyril Gamini.",
    "The SIS director had then allegedly told Hanzeer \u201cOnly you, I and Pillaiyaan know about my meeting Zahran and other NTJ members. Did you reveal this to others? Why are the MPs and Catholic priests making these accusations linking me with the bombers?\u201d",
    "According to Hanzeer, he had denied telling anyone else about the Puttalam meeting. Sallay had then checked Hanzeer\u2019s cell phone. After about three hours of verbal interrogation, Sallay allowed Hanzeer to leave.",
    "Azad Maulana says he was deeply disturbed and distressed by this ordeal. He had never seen Suresh Sallay being so angry and tough. Hanzeer telephoned Pillaiyaan in Batticaloa and told him of what had happened. The TMVP leader had told him not to worry and that he was coming to Colombo the following day and would meet Sallay and sort it out. Pillaiyaan arrived in Colombo the next day 16 October 2021..",
    "It had been the usual practice for Hanzeer to accompany Pillaiyan when he went to meet Sallay. But on this occasion, Pillaiyaan met Sallay without Hanzeer. It was through Pillaiyaan\u2019s driver Amalan that Hanzeer got to know Pillaiyaan had met Sallay. Pillaiyaan later told Hanzeer that Suresh Sallay was suspicious of him (Hanzeer) for leaking information about the purported Zahran meeting.",
    "Pillaiyan  asked Azad Maulana to come to Batticaloa for a meeting on 17 October 2021. Before his departure, Hanzeer says he got a call from a Muslim friend in an intelligence unit. He had warned Maulana that there was a plot to kill him through a bogus \u201caccident\u201d in Batticaloa and advised him not to go. Maulana had then told Pillaiyaan that he had fallen sick suddenly and could not come to Batticaloa.",
    "Azad Maulana was now worried about his life being in danger from the TMVP and/or intelligence. He decided to escape from Sri Lanka. Realizing that delaying his departure from Sri Lanka could endanger his life, Azad Maulana went to India first.  He reportedly left Sri Lanka for India  on 19 October 2021.",
    "Hanzeer Azad Maulana\u2019s  intention was to seek a humanitarian visa from Switzerland. Switzerland grants humanitarian visas to individuals on the following grounds.",
    "* The individual\u2019s life and physical integrity are directly, seriously and tangibly endangered in their home country or country of origin.",
    "* The individual is clearly in direct danger and not merely at risk because they belong to a potentially endangered group.",
    "* The individual no longer has any other options and their situation requires the urgent intervention of the Swiss authorities.",
    "Subsequently Mohammed Hanzeer alias Azad Maulana flew to Europe and sought political asylum. It is learnt that an international human rights organization based in Geneva was of great assistance to Azad Maulana in relocating to Europe.",
    "After moving to Europe Azad Maulana went to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and made a detailed statement to a panel from the OHCHR Sri Lanka Accountability project. He took five days to testify. The Project mandate is \u201cto collect, consolidate, analyse and preserve information and evidence and to develop possible strategies for future accountability processes for gross violations of human rights or serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sri Lanka, to advocate for victims and survivors, and to support relevant judicial and other proceedings, including in Member States, with competent jurisdiction\u201d.",
    "Apart from the OHCHR, Maulana has also made statements to several other Human rights organizations and international NGOs. It is learnt that though Maulana fled from Lanka in a hurry he took along with him much \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d relating to several war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations. Apparently what was revealed in the Channel 4 film was only the tip of the iceberg.",
    "It could be seen therefore that Azad Maulana has the capacity and potential to provide much information regarding the 21 April 2019 attacks.The importance of Azad Maulana\u2019s testimony \u2013 to prove or disprove the \u201cEaster bombings for Gota victory\u201d conspiracy theory \u2013 is  being increasingly recognised,",
    "At the same time there is growing realisation that the allegations made by Azad Maulana would be worthless in practical terms in a court of law until and unless Azad Maulana himself backs it up by testifying himself in a Sri Lankan tribunal and being cross examined by lawyers. He could even  do this from afar by electronic methods too. Hence many people especially some representatives of the Catholic Church are now demanding that Azad Maulana should be questioned or probed on what he has told the UK Channel 4 TV.",
    "The problem here is that Azad Maulana is not willing to cooperate with the Sri Lankan Judicial system alone. He is willing to testify only before an Independent International Investigation. The April 25th 2025  article by this writer in the \u201cPolitical Pulse\u201d column related  in detail,  the statements made by Azad Maulana on Channel 4 and at a public meeting in Geneva.",
    "In those, Azad Maulana clarified his viewpoint explicitly. This is what he said: \u201cAs a witness to the planning of several terrorist attacks, political assassinations and kidnappings in Sri Lanka, I am willing to testify in investigations into these crimes. I do not believe, however, that the authorities in Sri Lanka have an interest in revealing the truth. I will therefore only bear witness before an international independent investigation.\u201d",
    "It appears therefore that Mohammed Hanzeer alias Azad Maulana is likely to testify about the Easter bombings in an international investigation only. Under suchmmcircumstances the chances of Azad Maulana returning to Sri Lanka and cooperating with the Sri Lankan legal system seems a very remote possibility Given the fate of   Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne alias  \u2018Ganemulla Sanjeewa,\u2019, can Azad Maulana be faulted for his stance?",
