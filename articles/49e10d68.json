  "original_body_lines": [
    "Democracy is often hailed as a system of government where the rule of law prevails over the rule of individuals. One of its most defining features is the principle that no one is above the law \u2013 not even the highest executive authority.In recent decades, several democratic countries have demonstrated this commitment by arresting or prosecuting former heads of state for crimes ranging from corruption to abuse of power. These cases, while politically charged, underscore the resilience of democratic institutions and the importance of legal accountability.",
    "In democratic societies, the rule of law is foundational. It ensures that laws apply equally to all citizens, including presidents and prime ministers. This principle is not merely theoretical \u2013 it has been tested and proven in various high profile cases where former leaders were investigated, charged and even imprisoned. However, in some countries like Sri Lanka, law enforcing agencies face a formidable challenge when required to apply these laws against privileged individuals. This drama is now being enacted with the arrest of Ranil Wickremasighe a former president for misusing state resources.",

In August 2009, he was formally indicted on three counts of corruption. While acquitted on the central charges in July 2012, he was found guilty of breach of trust and received a suspended one year prison sentence in September 2012.",
    "In January 2012, Olmert was further indicted for allegedly taking bribes related to construction projects during his time as mayor of Jerusalem.

    "Nethanyahu\u2019s fourth term was marked by investigations into bribery and corruption allegations involving him and his inner circle.

One case involved trading political favours for gifts like cigars and champagne (emphasis added) The other case involved seeking favourable coverage from a newspaper in exchange for undermining a rival paper.(emphasis added) In December, charges were recommended against Nethanyahu in a fourth case alleging he advanced regulatory policies for a telecommunication company in exchange for positive media coverage. In February the attorney general announced he would pursue the recommended charges against Nethanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, subject to a hearing.",
    "In 2017, during an investigation into corruption allegations, Nethanyahu remarked that he is proud to be the prime minister of a country where the rule of law applies to everyone including the prime minister. The statement underscored the strength of Israel\u2019s legal and judicial systems which can hold even the highest officials accountable.",
    "Ranil Wickremasinghe \u2013 Former President and Prime Minister arrested for alleged misuse of State funds for a foreign trip. Ongoing.",

    "In 2024, Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of felony, found guilty of thirty four (34) counts related to  falsifying business records. The case sparked an intense political debate but also highlighted judiciary\u2019s willingness to act independently.",
    "While these cases affirm the strength of democratic institutions, they also reveal the following complexities involved in prosecuting former leaders:-",
    "*\u00a0 Political Polarisation :- Legal proceedings against former heads of state often deepen political divides, with supporters viewing them as persecution and opponents as justice. This tendency is very visible in Sri Lanka, India and even in the US, the temple of democracy; but not so much un the UK. This is one of the fundamental issues the framers of the new constitution should take into account and rectify.",
    "*\u00a0 Judicial Independence :- The credibility of such prosecutions hinges on the impartiality of the judiciary. Any hint of political motivation can undermine public trust. Public confidence in Sri Lanka\u2019s judiciary which had reached its nadir has shown a remarkable recovery after the installation of the JVP/NPP government in September/November 2024.",
    "*\u00a0 International implications :- Arrests and trials of former leaders can affect diplomatic relations and global perceptions of a country\u2019s stability. While political instability has been a major reason for the country\u2019s inability to attract direct foreign investments from the days when Sir John Kotalawala was the Prime Minister in the 1950s despite its much hyped strategic location in the Indian Ocean, the arrest of a former president will deliver a powerful message to the world to show the new government\u2019s determination to enforce accountability.",
    "The arrest and prosecution of executive heads of state in democratic countries serve as powerful reminders that democracy is not merely about elections \u2013 it is about accountability. These cases, though rare and often controversial, reinforce the idea that leadership comes with responsibility; and that even the most powerful must answer to the law. As democracies continue to evolve , the rule of law remains their most vital safeguard against tyranny and corruption.",
