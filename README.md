### Qatar suspends role as mediator between Israel and Hamas

*2024-11-10 07:51:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103287/qatar-suspends-role-as-mediator-between-israel-and-hamas) ┬╖ `en`

Qatar has suspended its work as a mediator in ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, officials say.

The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel тАЬshow their willingnessтАЭ to negotiate.

It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza.

Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that HamasтАЩs political office in Doha тАЬno longer serves its purposeтАЭ were тАЬinaccurateтАЭ.

тАЬQatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,тАЭ a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.

тАЬQatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.тАЭ

### Tamil political theater in the North should be cleaned -Jaffna of the National People's Power. Karunanathan Ilangumaran Chevi, the primary candidate of the election district

*2024-11-10 07:39:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198291) ┬╖ `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



Tamil political theater in Jaffna needs cleaning. Karunanathan Ilangumaran Chevi, National People's Power candidate, criticizes false promises and corrupt politics. Aims to implement 13th Amendment and promote democracy. Promises to address past injustices and serve people's interests.

ЁЯЯй

Tamil politics has been dominated by the north, with false promises as a partner of Sri Lanka's fraudulent politics. The survivalist politics continues even after tens of thousands of youth and women died. The Tamil political arena should be cleaned up to the National People's Power. Election district chief candidate Karunanathan Ilangumaran said in a speech to Weerakesari.

Jaffna of the National People's Power. The full form of the interview with the district chief candidate Karunanathan Ilangumaran Weerakesari

Question: What is the reason for you to enter politics without any political background?

Answer: Politics seems to be buried within this question. Politics is for ordinary people in our language. I have contributed to the People's Liberation Front for over 10 years, its trade union movement and the national people's power.. I have been involved in the street struggles. Our political merits, including the uprising of 2022. Not the face of arrogance.

### GLIMPSES OF COLONIAL CEYLON (1935 тАУ 1947)

*2024-11-10 04:47:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/glimpses-of-colonial-ceylon-1935-1947/) ┬╖ `en`

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical anecdotes by LC Arulpragasam)

This is not meant to be a history of the colonial years, but rather a cherry-picking of childhood memories for their quaintness rather than for their historical truth, for socio-cultural insights rather than for historical facts. I can only touch on some cultural oddities of the English-speaking middleclass of those times, since I knew no other. Likewise, I can write only of the last years of colonial rule, since I lived through no others. I write as тАШan old man in a hurryтАЩ, because at the age of 88 years, I doubt that there will be others left to recount these tales.

### Difficult Dealings with Strong Political Personalities

*2024-11-10 04:42:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/difficult-dealings-with-strong-political-personalities/) ┬╖ `en`

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Pieris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Senior public officials have often to act as buffers between ministers, other important political actors, and other stakeholders in society. On many occasions, one had to absorb a significant degree of shock and act as a facilitator, mediator or referee. A rousing example of this side of oneтАЩs responsibilities came by courtesy of Mrs. Vivienne Goonewardene, the LSSP Member of Parliament for Dehiwela-Galkissa and wife of Mr. Leslie Goonewardene, Minister of Communications.

### Chandra Arulpragasam тАУ The enigma that was my father

*2024-11-10 04:42:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/chandra-arulpragasam-the-enigma-that-was-my-father/) ┬╖ `en`

When my son was 11 years old and in middle school, he chose to write about his grandfather, starting his essay with the statement, тАЬmy grandfather is an enigma.тАЭ I am not sure whether to his young mind my father was so much a puzzle, being both a super -cool grandpa and an exacting teacher, or just simply unpredictable. My father was someone who could relate to his grandchildren only when they were old enough to debate the merits of the separation of state and church or play a championship game of chess. But he also had wonderful adventures which fired my sonтАЩs young imagination.

### When Sir John Kotelawala visited St. JosephтАЩs College

*2024-11-10 04:37:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/when-sir-john-kotelawala-visited-st-josephs-college/) ┬╖ `en`

Seventy-four years ago, Fr. Peter A. Pillai OMI, a distinguished educationist and the Rector of St. JosephтАЩs College, proposed the groundbreaking idea of constructing an Olympic-standard swimming pool at the school. This initiative met with resistance from some old boys and parents. At that time, no school in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) had an Olympic-size pool, let alone a sub-standard swimming facility. The announcement of this ambitious project took the school community by surprise and marked a significant moment in the institutionтАЩs history. Fr. PillaiтАЩs vision aimed not just to enhance the schoolтАЩs facilities but to foster a culture of sports and physical education, paving the way for future generations.

Anticipating Kamala Harris winning the US presidency, the original title of my article was The Woman Behind the 47th President of the United States. Most unfortunately and surprisingly to us, Donald Trump won the election. However, defeated Kamala has a couple of achievements to her name. She is the first woman, Black American and South Asian American to be elected Vice President of the US, District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California. And more importantly she is young, healthy, vibrant and next time around may overcome obvious prejudices in the minds of the American voting public and garner the honour of being first woman president of the US. Four years hence?

### MONKS IN CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS

*2024-11-10 04:29:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/monks-in-confrontational-politics/) ┬╖ `en`

Whether the participation of monks in representative politics is permissible (or proper), has been a matter of periodic discourse in the media.

In preparing this note, I can claim no expertise (nor authority), on the discipline or set of rules for the Maha Sangha. Incidentally, I personally prefer to be considered as тАЬone who seeks to follow the Dhamma,тАЭ rather than as a тАЬBuddhistтАЭ.

The ordained ones have themselves chosen to enter the Community referred to collectively as тАЬThe (Maha) SanghaтАЭ They have voluntarily resolved to abandon the lay life and to observe the rules of conduct (more than two hundred), included in the Vinaya Pitaka.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the тАЬforest dwellerтАЭ (vanavasa) tradition prevails, where the monk lives alone, often in a natural cave, and devotes himself to continuous meditation and solitude, with minimum contact with others. In the commoner monastic tradition, a community of monks live together, with each engaging in his own spiritual practices.

Due to my deep involvement in the entertainment industry and showbiz, several leading Western musicians in Sri Lanka became my friends from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties. One of those friends was Sohan Weerasinghe, the leader of Sohan & The XтАЩPeriments, featuring Estelle and Judy.

In 1991, I received an unexpected call from Sohan. тАЬMr. J, I just recorded a new English song with the band at my studio.

Much has been written on the life and work of Prof. Keerthi Nissanka Seneviratne by his academic colleagues, generations of his admiring students and those who knew him as a sincere friend. He is no stranger to the medical academic community in Sri Lanka.
