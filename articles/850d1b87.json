    "The void left by Sri Lankan suppliers was effectively occupied by Indian tea exporters, solidifying India\u2019s role as Iran\u2019s",
    "On 30 July 2025, President Donald Trump announced a 25% reciprocal tariff on imports from India, to take effect from 1 August (later formally deferred to 7 August). The justification cited included India\u2019s high internal tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, and its continued procurement of Russian military equipment and oil, particularly in the context of the ongoing Ukraine conflict.",
    "Sri Lanka, too, was targeted under the same reciprocal tariff framework, facing a 20% tariff on its exports to the United States, effective 7 August 2025.",
    "In Sri Lanka, opposition politicians expressed strong criticism in the beginning, arguing that the Government had failed to engage meaningfully with the Trump administration on tariff-related discussions\u2014especially in contrast to the proactive negotiations undertaken at that time by the Indian side. They noted that Sri Lanka lacked a coordinated diplomatic strategy during the period following President Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d proclamation, when the tariff structure was first proposed.",
    "However, the latest revision, which reduced Sri Lanka\u2019s originally proposed tariff rate (reportedly as high as 44%) to 20%, is now seen as placing the country on a more level playing field. Still, in the absence of a formal trade agreement and given President Trump\u2019s unpredictable policy stance, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how US trade measures may evolve further. According to media reports, Sri Lanka is inclined to explore options to import US oil and agricultural commodities in an effort to maintain or possibly reduce the announced tariff rate.",
    "This article will explore how India strategically outmanoeuvred Sri Lanka in the Iranian tea market during the period of sanctions, and how it financially capitalised on discounted Russian oil, both of which had significant implications for regional trade dynamics.",
    "In the shifting geopolitical and economic landscape of the 21st century, few countries have displayed the kind of strategic economic agility that India has. Leveraging global crises and disruptions, India has managed to convert vulnerabilities into opportunities\u2014especially in its trade engagements with sanctioned states like Iran and resource-rich powers like Russia. At the same time, its South Asian neighbour, Sri Lanka, has been mired in economic hardship, political volatility, and institutional inertia. Two key trade domains\u2014tea and petroleum\u2014illustrate how India\u2019s assertive foreign economic policy created gains at the expense of Sri Lanka\u2019s missed opportunities.",
    "Tea trade with Iran: India\u2019s gain amid sanctions, Sri Lanka\u2019s missed bargain",
    "Tea has long been one of Sri Lanka\u2019s principal export commodities. Its premium \u201cCeylon Tea\u201d brand has dominated Middle Eastern and Central Asian markets for decades. Among its most loyal buyers was Iran, which imported tens of thousands of metric tonnes annually from Sri Lanka. In 2013, Sri Lanka exported over 38,420 metric tonnes of tea to Iran. However, by 2020, this figure had dropped drastically, with devastating consequences for the island\u2019s already fragile export economy.",
    "The turning point came after 2018, when the United States re-imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran following the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These sanctions primarily targeted Iran\u2019s oil and financial sectors, making it difficult for traditional trading partners to transact in US dollars.",
    "India, anticipating the geopolitical shift, activated a Rupee-Rial payment mechanism through UCO Bank in Kolkata\u2014a state-run institution previously used for Indo-Iran trade. This allowed India to continue exporting non-sanctioned goods, such as tea, basmati rice, and pharmaceuticals, to Iran without violating US restrictions. This institutional foresight yielded immediate results. In 2018, India exported roughly 24.7 million kilograms of tea to Iran. By 2019, this number surged to over 50 million kilograms, effectively doubling in a single year. Iran quickly became India\u2019s second-largest tea importer, absorbing nearly 20% of India\u2019s total tea exports that year. Indian exporters also benefitted from Iran\u2019s preference for whole-leaf orthodox tea, which matched India\u2019s production strengths.",
    "Sri Lanka, which had historically dominated the Iranian tea market, found itself struggling to maintain its trade link. In 2021, Colombo announced a tea-for-oil barter arrangement with Iran. This deal was designed to repay an outstanding oil debt of $ 251 million by exporting tea instead of settling it in hard currency. While the agreement was innovative and technically in compliance with international sanctions (since tea is not a restricted commodity), it ultimately floundered.",
    "The main reasons for its failure were bureaucratic inefficiency, declining tea production due to climate and fertiliser bans, and lack of institutional mechanisms similar to India\u2019s rupee-rial channel. As a result, Sri Lanka\u2019s tea exports to Iran fell to just 14,730 metric tonnes by 2020\u2014a 60% decline from 2016.",
    "India, meanwhile, stepped in to fill the vacuum. By 2020, Sri Lanka\u2019s share in the Iranian tea market had dropped from 47% in 2016 to about 25%. The void left by Sri Lankan suppliers was effectively occupied by Indian tea exporters, solidifying India\u2019s role as Iran\u2019s preferred supplier of orthodox tea.",
    "Petroleum trade: India\u2019s refining edge and Sri Lanka\u2019s growing dependence",
    "India\u2019s second major economic gain came in the petroleum sector, particularly following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As Western sanctions isolated Russia from global energy markets, India emerged as a key customer of discounted Russian crude. But India did more than just purchase\u2014it refined and resold.",
    "Indian refineries such as those in Jamnagar (Reliance Industries), Vadinar (Nayara Energy), and Paradip (IOCL) began purchasing large volumes of Russian Urals crude at up to 30% discounts. These crude consignments were processed domestically and re-exported as refined petroleum products\u2014including gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel\u2014to countries that had banned direct purchases from Russia.",
    "Between December 2022 and December 2023, India exported over $ 6.65 billion worth of refined petroleum products derived from Russian oil. While much of this was destined for Western markets, several developing countries, including Sri Lanka, became indirect beneficiaries\u2014or, as some analysts argue, dependent consumers\u2014of this arbitrage strategy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s plight in 2022 is well-documented. With foreign reserves dipping below $ 50 million and widespread shortages of fuel and essential goods, the country entered a state of economic emergency. The Government defaulted on its debt, leading to plummeting creditworthiness and difficulty accessing international fuel markets.",
    "Sri Lanka made overtures to Russia to directly procure discounted crude but failed due to the absence of sovereign guarantees and logistical preparedness. The country turned to India, which responded by extending multiple lines of credit, including a $ 500 million credit line for fuel.",
    "From 2020 to 2024, India\u2019s refined petroleum exports to Sri Lanka surged dramatically:",
    "By the 2023\u201324 fiscal year, petroleum products accounted for 17.04% of India\u2019s total exports",
    "Although official figures don\u2019t trace the origin of the crude used in Indian refineries, it is widely accepted that a significant portion of the fuels exported to Sri Lanka were processed from discounted Russian oil. This positions India as both a beneficiary and a gatekeeper of global energy realignments.",
    "The contrasting outcomes of India and Sri Lanka in these two trade segments highlight a deeper reality: the ability to benefit from global crises depends on institutional capacity, diplomatic adaptability, and economic preparedness.",
    "Institutional infrastructure: Payment channels like the rupee-rial mechanism enabled India to continue sanctioned-era trade.",
    "Strategic neutrality: By abstaining from condemning Russia at the UN, India preserved its energy ties while maintaining global flexibility.",
    "Refining capacity: With some of the largest refineries in Asia, India could process crude at scale and export high-value products.Sri Lanka\u2019s missed opportunities:",
    "Inadequate payment systems: No alternative mechanism to conduct trade with sanctioned countries.",
    "Delayed policy responses: Barter deals and crisis management plans often lacked speed and follow-through.",
    "Overdependence: Reliance on Indian fuel, food, and aid underlined the risks of asymmetric interdependence in regional diplomacy.",
    "India\u2019s gains in tea and petroleum trade are not accidental\u2014they are the result of calculated decisions, institutional foresight, and diplomatic agility. Whether through expanding exports to Iran amid sanctions or refining and redistributing discounted Russian crude, India transformed the crisis into leverage.",
    "For Sri Lanka, the story has been more sobering. Once dominant in Iran\u2019s tea market and self-reliant in regional trade, the country has seen its economic sovereignty curtailed. In both the tea and energy sectors, it ceded ground to India\u2014ironically, a partner with whom it shares deep historical, cultural, and geographical ties.",
    "The key takeaway is clear: in an era of uncertainty, agility and readiness determine who reaps the rewards and who bears the costs.",
