  "original_body_lines": [
    "SriLankan Airlines, together with its leisure arm SriLankan Holidays and the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau (SLCB), recently hosted a group of senior journalists from some of South India\u2019s most prominent media outlets: Deccan Chronicle, Tourism India, Malayala Manorama, Sun Group TV, Mathrubhumi Newspaper, DT Next, and Provoke Magazine.",
    "The week-long adventure offered the journalists an immersive experience of Sri Lanka\u2019s stunning coastal belt, from the shores of Negombo to Galle, with a shopping stop in Colombo. The group embarked on an exciting safari through Udawalawe National Park, strolled through the winding, historic fortifications of Galle, and visited sacred Kovils and other iconic landmarks during their tour.",
    "SriLankan Airlines has long championed familiarisation (FAM) tours for Indian journalists, reinforcing Sri Lanka as the ultimate quick escape for Indian travellers. With India being Sri Lanka\u2019s largest source market for inbound tourism, the airline continues to pull out all the stops to keep this vital connection thriving."
