    "Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror) - Steps have been taken to provide 1,000 air rifles this year to farmers to prevent crop damage caused by animals, the Agriculture and Plantation Industries Ministry said.",
    "A research conducted by the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agricultural Research and Training Institute has confirmed that 30\u201340 percent of the crops are currently being damaged by Toque monkeys, monkeys, giant squirrels and peacocks.",
    "Although the Ministry has requested that the Animal Friendly Associations suggest alternative paths to prevent damage from wild animals, so far not a single positive alternative has been presented.",
    "The decision was taken following requests from farmers to provide at least air rifles to save their crops from these animals.",
    "Following the instructions of Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, the Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority took steps to implement this programme.",
    "Accordingly, the Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority has taken steps to provide air rifles to the farmers on the basis of a 50 percent loan relief from 2023.",
    "Last year, 750 air rifles were issued to farmers, and based on the success of the programme steps have been taken to issue 1,000 air rifles this year.",
    "Air rifles have been very successful in crop protection to drive away Toque monkeys, monkeys and giant squirrels. But the farmers say that air rifles are no so successful to drive away peacocks and wild elephants."
