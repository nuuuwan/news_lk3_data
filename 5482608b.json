    "In a statement, the SLBA noted that the Dr Weerasinghe\u2019s public announcement covered important issues, and included a categoric assurance that the forthcoming Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) or Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) will not impact financial system stability and will not in any way adversely affect depositors in banks or non-bank financial institutions.",

    "\u201cThe Governor also mentioned that during the five-day holiday, banking services will be available for customers as usual via ATMs, online and other digital channels,\u201d the SLBA noted, and pointed out that \u201cMeanwhile, capital and liquidity ratios of the banks remain above the regulatory requirements and banks pay close attention to these indicators.\u201d",
