ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s energy sector is expected to undergo significant changes, guided by social and economic reforms under the island nation’s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government. Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The NPP’s policy platform strongly emphasizes environmental sustainability and energy independence. The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPP’s policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. ​

ECONOMYNEXT – Both local and foreign investments in Sri Lanka are likely to face shifts that reflect new priorities in economic and social reforms under President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government after the November 14 parliament polls.

Such moves are likely to help in curbing deep rooted corruption at the expense of some delays, they say. This could affect investment in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and utilities, where state influence may increase to ensure alignment with public needs and national priorities​.

### EXPLAINER: Possible policy impacts on Sri Lanka’s banking sector after parliament polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Under Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government, Sri Lanka’s banking sector is likely to experience significant changes and challenges as it navigates policy shifts focused on economic redistribution, social reforms, and restructuring. Here are five potential impacts on the banking sector after the parliament polls, in which NPP is believed to have an edge:

The NPP has historically advocated for stronger state control over strategic economic sectors, including banking. Under Dissanayake, the sector may face increased regulation and scrutiny aimed at reducing perceived corruption, addressing financial mismanagement, and protecting consumer interests. This could lead to a more restrictive operational environment for banks, with potential impacts on profitability and compliance costs. ​

Total complaints received by the commission since the election was declared on September 26 was 2,999.

The number of incidents are considerably less compared to the 8,683 reported in the previous parliamentary election in  August 2022.

Historically, Sri Lanka has seen violent incidents sometimes leading to deaths, in the run-up to general elections as not just candidates from opposing parties, but also inter-party contenders vie for preference votes (manapa pora). (Colombo/Nov13/2024)

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake faces a range of key political risks and challenges, particularly given his position as the leader of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People’s Power (NPP), a historically leftist alliance.

Here is a detailed overview of the major political risks and policy dilemmas for Dissanayake’s government after forming an extended NPP government beyond the current three-member cabinet:

"Parents dispute suicide claim for son. Cite his helpful nature & love for life. Seek justice rather than accepting death as self-inflicted."

🟩

The death of two students of an international school in Colombo's luxury series has caused great controversy and many questions.

Although many claimed suicide, the parents of one of the students who died, Joro Singh's parents, have rejected it and have reported that there have been many misunderstandings.

They have shared their memories of Givon and have reported the events that caused him to die.

The attitude of Jivon, who helped others, was the cause of his death on July 2 at luxury.

Jivon tried to help someone who was in need of his help that day. It was his natural attitude.

However, due to his dedication to help others, we have decided to respond to the false information about his death.

Givon did not commit suicide, and his immense love for life and the attitude of thinking favorably were his characteristics, and we are trying to protect his memories and ensure that his character is understood.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Elon Musk to a role aimed at creating a more efficient government, handing even more influence to the world’s richest man who donated millions of dollars to helping Trump get elected.

Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency, an entity Trump indicated will operate outside the confines of government.

Trump said in a statement that Musk and Ramaswamy “will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.”

Trump said the new department will realize long-held Republican dreams and “provide advice and guidance from outside of government,” signaling the Musk and Ramaswamy roles would be informal, without requiring Senate approval and allowing Musk to remain the head of electric car company Tesla social media platform X and rocket company SpaceX.

However, after a recent inspection by the minister, authorities have decided to remove the container trucks from the port and send them out, causing traffic jams, especially in areas such as Orugodawatta and Thotalaga.

He further emphasized that this decision had put both the drivers and the containers at risk, as there have been threats to their safety.

“The Inspector General of Police and the Director General of Customs had been informed. Accordingly, they were stopped at the port premises and sent through a system,” he added.

Government faces economic crisis; IMF assistance program controversial. New administration avoids abusing state resources for elections. Minority representation crucial post-conflict. Women's quotas debated. Terrorism Act divides Tamils/Muslims vs Sinhalese. Power devolution needed for national security and law reform.

Like everyone, the government knows that the economic crisis continues to be harshly embedded in the midst of the possibility of re -climbing. National experts and international experts have pointed out this as the International Monetary Fund has said that the country is on the knife.

The action taken by the government in transporting the country through such a situation includes the action of the International Monetary Fund's assistance program.. Although the main opposition opposed the aid plan, the previous government negotiated and obtained it. The government also considered it a great success. Today's government is not involved in self -interest that can lead to massive costs, like the previous government.

The government has expressed great admirable order and control by not abuse of state resources for election purposes. This shows that today's government leaders act as a law -abiding rule, unlike the previous leaders who considered themselves as law.

Chandrarathna Bandara’s most recent novel Piyāsara Samaya,of which the title might be loosely translated as A Time for Flying (or even a Time to Flee), is a thought-provoking novel which offers the reader a space to connect their lived experience with the narrative. It deals with the socio-political realities which were our lived experience as Sri Lankans in the recent past. The novelist’s previous work Premānishansa received the Swarnapusthaka award and the Vidyodaya award for best novel in 2022. Piyāsara Samaya which came out this September has themes which are in common with Premānishansa and the novel is set in such a way that the narrative deals with recent happenings in Sri Lanka. However, what is most noteworthy is its contribution to the literary genre of diasporic writing or novels of expatriation.

The novelist introduces two protagonists and through their characters offers many insights to certain aspects of life.

I have always been struck by two distinct moments in history. First, in June 1865, during the tenure of President Abraham Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the United States of America. And yet, there were slaves who were reluctant to embrace the associated freedoms. They appeared to be too attached to their chains.

Then, in July 1945 C.W.W. Kannangara introduced an act in parliament to ensure free education for all Sri Lankans. He was compelled to debate for hours extolling the virtues of this move. There were many who attempted to throw sand in his wheels. Among the elites there were even those who argued that if this piece of legislation was passed, they wouldn’t be able to find a boy to pluck coconuts on their extensive properties.
