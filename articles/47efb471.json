    "\u201cIt must be noted that the Ministry of Defence plays a leading role in preventing human trafficking and illegal drug trafficking. The three armed forces, including the Navy, have been pivotal in combating the drug menace, which has received significant attention recently, through the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of narcotics.",

    "Rehabilitation centres have been established in Attidiya, Anuradhapura, Kamburupitiya, and Kurunegala to provide medical rehabilitation and lifelong care for these war heroes.",

This measure ensures that justice is served for all soldiers disabled during the war.",

However, another group of people has travelled to this area through brokers in Dubai, and 54 more individuals remain to be rescued.",

Diplomatic requests and appeals were made, both officially and as a former military officer, to secure their release. The Defence Secretary of Myanmar has informed me that the Prime Minister has advised to intervene and take all necessary steps to address this issue.",
    "Additionally, there is a concern regarding former military personnel caught in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Defence of Russia on this matter. We have also requested the Russian Embassy to notify the Ministry of Defence if any ex-military personnel have applied for tourist visas to Russia.",
    "In addition to this, the Ministry of Defence also oversees disaster management activities in the country. The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) serves as the National Centre for Landslide Risk Management under the Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Defence. Currently, NBRO is identifying and monitoring landslide-prone areas in Sri Lanka, issuing early warnings, and conducting mitigation activities.

So far, stabilization has been completed at 46 of these sites.",
    "Furthermore, the three armed forces are providing labour for various religious shrines and school renovations across the country upon request and will continue to do so in the future. They are also actively involved in disaster response, including immediate actions to reduce the impact of natural disasters, rescuing affected individuals, providing relief, preparing for disaster situations, implementing mitigation strategies, and resettling displaced persons. They identify vulnerable areas and evacuate people to minimise loss of life, though property damage.",
