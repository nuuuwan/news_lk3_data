    "Army personnel have been deployed to ensure that daily functions at hospitals remain uninterrupted after a series of strikes were launched by the health sector trade unions.",
    "The measure was taken after a request was made by the Health Ministry from the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage, said the Media Division of Sri Lanka Army.",
    "Accordingly, army troops have been deployed to the national hospitals in Colombo and Kandy; teaching hospitals in Kalubowila, Karapitiya, Mahamodara, Peradeniya and Kurunegala; and the government hospitals in Matara, Balangoda, Eheliyagoda, Nawalapitiya, Badulla, Gampola and Mirigama hospitals.",
    "Nearly 500 personnel of the army have reportedly been assigned to carry out the services at the hospitals while the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army instructed all the commanders of the defence forces to arrange for dedicated troops to be deployed to hospitals in case of an emergency.",
    "Earlier today, it was reported that the army personnel had stepped up to cover the duties at the Badulla Hospital. Accordingly, despite the token strike launched by the health sector trade unions, the services of the doctors, nurses and issuance of medicinal drugs remained uninterrupted, Ada Derana correspondent said.",
    "When inquired by Ada Derana, Director of the Badulla Hospital, Dr. Palitha Rajapakshe stated that the junior health staff of the hospital had left after completing their night shifts and that the rest of the staff had not reported for duty in the morning.",
    "Nevertheless, the emergency treatment services will continue as usual, the hospital\u2019s director said further, adding that all doctors of the Badulla Hospital have been deployed for 24-hour service.",
    "Furthermore, Dr Rajapakshe emphasized that this measure only intends to save the lives of the people and not to sabotage the trade union action. He also urged the public to bring the patients in critical condition to the hospital immediately, without keeping them at home due to the ongoing strike action.",
    "Against this backdrop, the day-to-day functions of many hospitals across the island have come to a standstill, owing to the trade union action launched by several health sector employees demanding an allowance of Rs 35,000.",
    "Several health sector trade unions, including the hospital administration and junior health staff, launched a joint strike action effective from 06.00 a.m. today (Jan. 11) protesting the government\u2019s decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs 35,000 and failure to provide them with a similar allowance.",
    "Meanwhile, the trade unions affiliated with the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) launched a 48-hour strike last morning (Jan.10). The token strike which commenced at 8:00 a.m. was joined by the Public Health Inspectors\u2019 Union (PHIU), Association of Sri Lanka Ophthalmologists, Family Health Services Union, Government Nursing Officers\u2019 Association and several other trade unions as well.",
    "The professionals in Supplementary Medical Service also engaged in a 24-hour token strike on Tuesday (Jan. 09) in protest of the government\u2019s move to not grant the allowance increase to them.",
    "The professionals in paramedical and supplementary medical services have vowed to resort to a continuous strike if the government fails to address the issue.",
    "On Monday (Jan.08), the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000."
