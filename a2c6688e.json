    "A Chinese warship that arrived in Colombo on August 10 will be docking at the Colombo Port until August 12, the Sri Lankan Navy has said, exactly a year after the visit of a Chinese vessel caused diplomatic tensions between New Delhi and Colombo.",
    "The Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy warship \u2018Hai Yang 24 Hao\u2019 is at the port of Colombo on a \u201cformal visit\u201d, according to a media statement from the Sri Lankan Navy. The 129 metre-long-ship is manned by a crew of 138 members, and is helmed by Commander Jin Xin, the Navy said, amid local media reports of \u201cinitial resistance\u201d from India.",
    "The Colombo-based newspaper Daily Mirror on August 11 reported that Chinese authorities had sought permission for the vessel\u2019s visit earlier, \u201cbut Sri Lanka delayed permission because of resistance from India.\u201d",
    "However, when contacted, Sri Lankan officials said India had not raised any concern over the PLA warship\u2019s visit, through official channels. \u201cIndia is fully aware of the vessel\u2019s visit and has not expressed any concern over it. India and Sri Lanka are on the same page,\u201d Ministry of Defence spokesman Col. Nalin Herath told The Hindu.",
    "Navy Spokesman, Captain Gayan Wickramasuriya said all foreign vessels followed the same procedure before docking at a Sri Lankan port. \u201cThe local embassy is required to write to the Foreign Ministry seeking permission, then the Foreign Ministry clears it after consultations with the Defence Ministry. Subsequently, the Ministry of Defence directs the Sri Lankan Navy. This is how it works,\u201d he said. The Indian High Commission in Colombo is yet to respond to The Hindu\u2019s request for comment.",
    "On July 17, 2023, Sri Lanka\u2019s Cabinet approved a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, for a \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d for granting diplomatic clearance to foreign sea vessels and foreign government or military aircrafts visiting Sri Lanka.",
    "The move came after Indo-Lanka ties witnessed a strain in the wake of the Chinese military vessel\u2019s visit last year. On August 16, 2022, China\u2019s satellite tracking vessel Yuan Wang 5 arrived at Sri Lanka\u2019s southern Hambantota Port, despite India and the U.S. voicing concern over the military ship\u2019s visit. The pressure put Colombo on a tricky diplomatic wicket, as it urged China to defer the vessel\u2019s visit. India raised concern with the Sri Lankan side at the highest levels, even as it extended crucial financial assistance for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery, following a severe crisis.",
    "China is actively engaged Sri Lanka\u2019s ports in Hambantota and Colombo. In May this year, Sri Lanka roped in the state-owned China Merchants Group to build a logistics complex at the Colombo Port, with an estimated construction cost of nearly $400 million.",
    "When asked, the MEA spokesperson said that while he had seen reports of a Chinese ship in Colombo harbour, he was unsure if it is a warship. \u201cThe government carefully monitors any development having a bearing on India\u2019s security, interests and takes all necessary measures to defend them,\u201d MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi added."
