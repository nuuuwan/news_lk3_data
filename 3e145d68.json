    "Ampara District MP and former TV news anchor S.M.M. Muszhaaraff made a scathing attack on the public sector employees of this country in Parliament yesterday.",
    "He said that only 15 percent of the state sector employees were efficient and the rest were wasting their time in offices. He stressed the immediate need for a better mechanism to supervise state sector employees.",
    "In any country, public sector employees represent only three percent of its population but in our country this number is double. Politicians over recruit to the public sector on the eve of elections to ensure their re-election and to promote their political party. They don\u2019t care at all about cadre vacancies nor do they care whether the public sector is profit-making or not. Our population is 22 million but the strength of our public sector is 1.5 million. The overall efficiency of the public sector is only 15 percent. Then how can our country progress, he asked.",
