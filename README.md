The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to prioritise and enact critical legal reforms to strengthen the rule of law in Sri Lanka.

In a written appeal, AHRC Policy and Programs Director Basil Fernando highlighted significant shortcomings in the country’s legal and judicial systems that require immediate attention. The organisation outlined three key areas for reform to ensure justice, transparency, and accountability.

The AHRC called for the daily hearing of serious criminal cases in High Courts to address judicial delays and expedite justice delivery. This, it argued, would significantly improve the efficiency of the judiciary.

Second, the organisation stressed the urgency of introducing comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. Such reforms are essential, the AHRC said, to rebuild public trust in governance and ensure greater accountability across all levels of Government.

Wickremesinghe remains active in politics despite others retiring. His economic policies implemented by current president. Wickremesinghe led government during 2022 financial crisis, helping short-term recovery. Unlike other ex-presidents, Wickremesinghe enjoys better relations with Western nations.

🟩

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe may act as the main person who challenges this government. Former parliamentarian Udaya Kammanpila said that the world's countries, which have become bankrupt over the short term in the short term, are consulting with Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Does not completely retire from politics. We are involved in operating politics. Sri Lanka's Sri Lanka PA was defeated in 2024 with the support of the majority of the 2020s.. Similarly, the National People's Power, which received 3 seats on that day, has won 159 seats today so something can happen in politics.

Former President Mahinda Rajapakse retires from politics. Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa has been paid attention to the leadership of the Sri Lanka PA.

### Sri Lanka’s IMF deal: Turning point, but caution is key

The IMF deal marks the beginning, not the end, of its journey

While Sri Lanka’s IMF deal offers hope, the risks are real. Political instability could derail reforms, as vested interests resist change. Reform fatigue, too, is a genuine concern—if the public does not see tangible benefits soon, support for the program could waver. Globally, external shocks—rising interest rates, slowing trade, or geopolitical tensions—could further complicate the recovery. The Government must proceed with caution. An IMF deal is not a panacea; it is a foundation on which Sri Lanka must build its recovery. Strong institutions, consistent policies, and effective communication will be critical in navigating these risks

### Rumpus about campus qualifications

*2024-12-22 23:52:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rumpus-about-campus-qualifications/4-770884) · `en`

A highly qualified politician without integrity or empathy can cause more harm than an unqualified but ethical leader

Sri Lanka’s Parliament is ablaze with a fiery debate over questionable campus qualifications, with the spotlight now on the JVP/NPP. Since voters placed their trust in the party as champions of honesty, integrity, and anti-corruption, the party now finds itself entangled in a web of controversy. Their rise to power on a platform of transparency has hit a stumbling block, as allegations of fabricated academic credentials leave them scrambling for cover, raising eyebrows and questions about their credibility.

It is important to emphasise that in past governments, such questions and investigations were often curtailed immediately, sometimes with verbal and physical threats. Therefore, citizens must welcome this change. However, the ability to question alone should not be considered a success.

Fear not, Mr. President, you may not speak the language of the King but you speak the language of the heart

Firstly, a very Merry Christmas to you and yours. This year it must be a very different Christmas for you. You seem to have been a good boy and Santa came early for you. All your Christmases came at once. It is good to see that now you are playing Santa Claus and distributing goodies all around. Some are gleefully dreaming of their bright and shiny new cars in the near future! Hopefully you are making sure that all those naughty little boys and girls who brought our country down to the lowest ebb will also receive their just desserts in due course.

### Central Bank, NGO Secretariat and weaponisation of Financial Action Task Force

As FATF has pointed out, blanket and arbitrary measures can drive financial flows underground, thereby undermining the entire purpose of the FATF standards and instead increase terror financing risks

Two entities play a visible and critical role in State attempts to place repressive controls on CSOs; the NGO Secretariat and the CBSL. The third entity that is the driver of these attempts but has largely operated in the shadows is the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The issuance of the 12 December instructions by the NGO Secretariat, indicates the MOD is slowly becoming visible and its role in State attempts to control CSOs/NGOs is being legitimised

### Removing ban on vehicle imports: Is it a prudent plan?

*2024-12-22 23:41:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Removing-ban-on-vehicle-imports-Is-it-a-prudent-plan/4-770881) · `en`

The highest risk is not the decision to import vehicles but linking the tariff income as a source of funding to pay the proposed salary increases, because if dollar outflow is going to be significant destabilising the existing macroeconomic stability, there is no way to contain vehicle imports as such restriction will reduce the targeted tariff income jeopardising the Government plan to provide money for salary increases without increasing taxes

The Government’s plan to lift the ban on vehicle imports is out. But it is not a prudent plan, perhaps it cannot prevail. Sometimes it might create macroeconomic chaos and uncertainty among the vehicle importing entrepreneurs. Any policy that cannot be sustained or justified in view of  strengthening the macroeconomic environment of the country is usually treated as a bad policy.

SEEDS was one of our development partners in all the four districts and SMTI was one of the training institutions that helped us to empower the beneficiaries whom we called our development partners.

During police interrogations, the bus driver claimed that the bus door had opened, causing him to lose balance and nearly fall out. In an attempt to hold on to the steering wheel, he was unable to regain control, leading to the crash.

Police have discovered that someone had later deleted the CCTV footage recorded during the accident. However, using advanced technology methods, the police successfully recovered the footage, which they say provides critical evidence regarding the incident.
