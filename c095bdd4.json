    "There, President\u2019s Counsel Faisz Musthapha had appeared before the court on behalf of the defendant Oshala Herath, whereas the petitioning party raised objections over that, mentioning that there is no possibility of lawyers appearing on behalf of the respondent before issuing the notice of suit.",
