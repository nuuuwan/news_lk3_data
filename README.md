### Towards building a digital tourism fortress

*2024-11-12 03:58:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Towards-building-a-digital-tourism-fortress/14-769154) · `en`

Tourism stands as a cornerstone of the Sri Lankan economy, drawing visitors from across the globe to experience its diverse landscapes and cultural heritage. The traveller entry system to the country serves as a gateway, streamlining arrivals and boosting tourism revenue. However, the efficiency and convenience of this system must be balanced with robust security measures since the country’s framework of managing its borders processes vast amounts of sensitive data.

As Sri Lanka prioritises seamless tourist services and experiences, safeguarding its systems from digital threats become increasingly important.

*2024-11-12 03:56:01* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Why-recall-Ambassador-Udaya-Indrarathna-Diplomatic-asset-for-Sri-Lanka/14-769153) · `en`

The recent recall of Ambassador Udaya Indrarathna from his post in Abu Dhabi has sparked questions about the criteria used to define “political appointees.” Widely regarded as one of Sri Lanka’s most effective ambassadors, Indrarathna has garnered respect as a skilled diplomat and earned a reputation as one of the top diplomats in the United Arab Emirates. Many even consider him worthy of the title “Dean of Ambassadors,” recognising his exceptional service and influence in the region.

Throughout his career, Indrarathna has exemplified dedication and integrity, bringing his vast expertise, influential connections, and strategic vision to the forefront of Sri Lanka’s international representation. He has strengthened diplomatic ties and secured critical funding for Sri Lanka, achievements that underline his impact. In a short period, he has elevated Sri Lanka’s profile within the Middle East, a region where his extensive network has proven invaluable.

Neither party recognises the dire need to strengthen existing undergraduate programs or develop student support systems at State universities

For nearly two decades, State universities have been under siege. They were targeted by a deliberate campaign of discreditation. Various ‘expert committees’ were set up by incumbent governments to deliberate on the problems in higher education, with minimal involvement of university communities. The sector was increasingly politicised, with undue State involvement in recruitments and appointments.

The complaint is based on statements made by Hanzeer Azad Maulana, a former aide to Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP) leader Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, also known as Pillaiyan. In the Channel 4 documentary, Maulana accuses Salley of being involved in the attack. Fr. Silva’s complaint calls for an independent investigation into these revelations.

### Politicisation of Foreign Service: Multidimensional and systemic challenge

Much of what is sought to be achieved on the foreign relations front would depend on who the ‘right persons’ are to be entrusted with the responsibility of representing Sri Lanka. This is not about missions only, it is also about what should have been the diplomatic powerhouse of Sri Lanka – the Foreign Ministry. I mean the collective, not one individual. It would do well to consider merit alongside probity, astuteness, temperament, maturity and resilience as among criteria for appointment of right persons. These are missing attributes in the Foreign Service nowadays, temperament undoubtedly topping the list. What is denoted by ‘right’ here is the right mix, and not being politically on the right side. The latter of course was the cause of many diplomatic misadventures in the recent past

It was not reported that any of the agencies present at the meeting with the President held on the 14th has commented or qualified the President’s emphasis for a specific sustainable program. This does not mean that nothing has happened in the past or no institutional and regulatory arrangements are in place. Sri Lanka is abundant in the solutions and technologies and legal and institutional network required addressing disaster management

I have worked with all the Executive Presidents except President Gotabaya Rajapaksa (I have no idea whether it was his luck or mine) in different capacities during my tenure in the public service and even afterwards. The way they managed or rather mis-managed the economy was different from one to the other. Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa’s management style was unique, flawless and foolproof. He monitored and followed up each and every decision he made.

He was speaking at a media briefing held at the Jaffna Media Center on Monday (11).

The President who came to Jaffna has made some comments. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who arrived in Jaffna before the presidential election, said that if his party government was formed, he would do many issues, including the repeal of the Terrorism Act.. But when Anura Kumara Dissanayake is currently in power, the general secretary of the party makes no comments.
