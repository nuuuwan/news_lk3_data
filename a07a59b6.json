    "\u201cWe will not support the domestic debt restructuring programme if the government goes ahead with a debt haircut which is more or less writing off debts. We also stress that the depositors should be safeguarded. We have already said the government should not lay its hands on the EPF and ETF. We will support it only if the government agrees to the line which we have drawn up,\u201d Dr. de Silva told a media briefing.",
