    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (CBK) has called on the government to prioritize recovering stolen wealth from the Rajapaksa family before resorting to tax increases, particularly for the middle class.",
    "In a recent statement, CBK acknowledged the need for government revenue but argued against burdening the middle class with additional taxes.",
    "She pointed to Sri Lanka's low tax rate compared to other countries and suggested focusing on recouping lost funds instead of increasing taxes.",
    "\"People who earn money don't want to give because of the habit of giving everything here,\" she said, highlighting the cultural context of tax compliance. \"But I am against charging these taxes to the middle class.\"",
    "CBK offered a specific solution: investigating and recovering money allegedly stolen by the Rajapaksa family and stashed abroad.",
    "\"The World Bank has ways to get them,\" she stated. \"If the looted money is recovered, the people would not have to pay taxes like this.\"",
