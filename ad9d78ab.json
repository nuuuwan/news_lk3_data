    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will guarantee a 9 percent return on the Employment Provident Fund after a restructure of its bond portfolio, to make government debt sustainable, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka Treasury is proposing to restructure portfolios of provident funds with new bonds which will pay 12 percent until 2025 going down to 9 percent thereafter.",
    "Current member balances would be unaffected by the restructure. Returns below 9 percent would be topped up by the government if necessary.",
    "There are discussions ongoing whether to change the provident fund law to guarantee a 9 percent return, Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "With inflation around 5 percent the fund would get a positive return.",
    "The offer to exchange new funds will be made to other provident funds like the Employees Trust Fund. (Colombo/June28/2023)"
