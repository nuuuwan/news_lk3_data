    "MAS Holdings, a global leader in apparel manufacturing, commemorates a significant milestone: 20 years of the Women Go Beyond (WGB) initiative. Established in 2003, WGB has been instrumental in empowering women within MAS and its communities worldwide, challenging conventions, and championing resilient women. Over the past two decades, it has made a profound impact, supporting thousands of women globally. Addressing critical issues such as gender-based violence (GBV), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), and economic empowerment, WGB has worked to change the mindset and infrastructure that prevents women from competing on an equal platform. This anniversary is a testament to MAS\u2019 commitment to gender equality and the enduring relevance of WGB\u2019s mission.",
