    "During the 32nd volunteer mobilisation, 27 dedicated volunteers from The Pearl Protectors collected 15 kg of nurdles from",
    "the Mount Lavinia shoreline, continuing efforts to protect Sri Lanka\u2019s marine ecosystems",
    "Between May and June 2021, the MV X-Press Pearl incident released over 1,680 tons of nurdles into Sri Lanka\u2019s marine environment. This event is regarded as the largest single incident of marine plastic pollution in history, with severe and long-lasting consequences for ecosystems, fishing industries, and coastal communities.",
    "Sri Lanka has national environmental laws administered by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) under the Ministry of Environment. These laws are based on the \u201cPolluter Pays Principle\u201d, which has been applied in past environmental cases. Public interest organisations, such as the Environmental Foundation Ltd. (EFL) and the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), have filed lawsuits to protect affected communities and ecosystems.",
    "However, Sri Lanka lacks specific legislation classifying nurdles as hazardous waste or regulating their transport and spillage. While existing laws could broadly cover marine pollution, there is a legislative gap in addressing nurdle spills, cleanup protocols, and liability.",
    "Following the disaster, Sri Lanka submitted a proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to classify plastic pellets as \u201cdangerous goods.\u201d If approved, this would require stricter regulations under the IMDG Code regarding packaging, labelling, and transportation. The proposal, supported by international environmental NGOs, was discussed in IMO PPR Sub-Committee meetings in 2023.",
    "This is a critical step, as nurdles, despite their documented harm to marine ecosystems, food chains, and coastal economies, are still treated as harmless cargo under current shipping standards.",
    "Sri Lanka responded aggressively through legal channels. In 2025, the Supreme Court held the ship owners and operators liable for $ 1 billion in environmental restoration and community compensation. The ruling was based on strict liability and environmental restoration principles, bypassing negligence claims. While this sets a strong precedent, enforcement remains slow, leaving affected communities struggling economically.",
    "In 2025, another nurdle spill occurred along Sri Lanka\u2019s northern, western, and southern coastlines after a container vessel, MSC ELSA, sank off the coast of Kerala, India. Heavy nurdle pollution was observed in Jaffna, Mannar, Kalpitiya, Negombo, Colombo, Wadduwa, and Bentota, demonstrating how nurdle spills far out at sea can impact Sri Lanka\u2019s marine ecosystems as transboundary marine litter. Environmental and civil society groups are now demanding better monitoring, regulatory reforms, and stronger cross-border pollution control.",
    "Key legislative gaps remain, including the absence of defined regulations for nurdle transportation within and across the sea in Sri Lanka, mandatory insurance requirements for carriers, standardised cleanup protocols, and a framework for addressing transboundary pollution.",
    "The Sri Lankan Government must strengthen legislation on nurdle transport and spills while aligning with international regulations. This includes implementing risk management plans for marine pollution, advocating for stricter IMO regulations on nurdle transportation through ships, and enhancing local enforcement and regional cooperation to combat cross-border spills.",
    "While international efforts are crucial, local legal reforms are urgently needed. Relying solely on court rulings will not prevent future spills; proactive legislation and global collaboration are essential to mitigate this growing environmental crisis.",
