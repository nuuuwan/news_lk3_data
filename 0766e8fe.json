    "In the backdrop of a controversial letter circulating on social media about the Customs Chief\u2019s revoking of forfeiture of seized gold jewellery on a request by MP Vajira Abeywardena, the Customs yesterday said anybody could make an appeal directly or indirectly to the Customs regarding any forfeiture of goods.",
    "An official letter issued by the Customs Director General dated May 03, 2023, addressed to the Director of Customs in charge of the\u00a0 Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) states the details of Customs\u00a0 Case No: BIA/Case/011/2023 and Appeal No: Cus/App/11/2023.",
    "The letter states that it was in reference to an appeal dated February 27, 2023, made to the former Minister of Internal Affairs\u00a0 Vajira Abeywardena against the inquiry order in the mentioned Customs\u00a0 case.",
    "The letter further states, \u201cUpon Appeal Committee\u00a0 recommendations, I hereby set aside the previous forfeiture order given\u00a0 by the Supervising Officer by virtue of powers vested in me under the\u00a0 provisions of Section 2 of the Customs Ordinance.",
    "I also, hereby order to release the gold jewellery on\u00a0 recovery of applicable taxes prevailed at the time of the seizure.\u00a0 Please take necessary actions required to comply with this order and\u00a0 report to the DC (Appeal) of the same once the required actions are\u00a0 taken, in order to finalize the appeal process regarding this appeal,\u201d\u00a0 the letter was undersigned by Customs DG P.B.S.C Nonis.",
    "When contacted, Customs Spokesman Senior Director Sudaththa\u00a0 Silva told the Daily Mirror yesterday that there was no such\u00a0 pressurizing or influence made on the Customs Chief by MP Abeywardena, but the latter had made a formal appeal.",
    "The said case was related to a female returning to the country in February who was intercepted by the Customs at the BIA\u00a0 Arrival Terminal for trying to smuggle in six gold bangles and two gold\u00a0 chains, which were said to be worth over Rs.15 million.",
    "At the Customs inquiry, it was decided that the female has\u00a0 brought the goods unlawfully and the goods were ordered to be forfeited\u00a0 with a fine of Rs.100,000.",
    "The said female had however brought the matter to MP\u00a0 Abeywardena afterwards and the MP had reportedly brought it to the\u00a0 notice of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as the Minister of Finance.",
    "Following a direction of the President, MP Abeywardena had\u00a0 made an appeal to the Customs DG about the gold jewellery and the case\u00a0 was referred to the Customs Appeal Committee by the latter, Sudaththa\u00a0 Silva said.",
    "With the recommendations of the Customs Appeal Committee\u00a0 the Customs Chief had ordered the release of the gold jewellery back\u00a0 to its owner subject to the fact that its due taxes are paid.",
    "The spokesperson said that anybody could make an appeal to\u00a0 the Customs DG if they feel the order given at a Customs inquiry was not\u00a0 fair by them and there\u2019s a due process to regain the seized or\u00a0 forfeited goods. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)"
