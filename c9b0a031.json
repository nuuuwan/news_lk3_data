    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The lack of consumer marketing was a hinderance for the development of tourism in Sri Lanka, hospitality experts said at a panel discussion held recently.",
    "\u201cThe travel agents know what we offer but we are not, even in a good year, positioning this destination by communicating to consumers. The decision maker for a holiday in Sri Lanka is the consumer. Our consumer communication has been absolutely non-existent,\u201d Founder of Resplendent Ceylon, Malik Fernando, said.",
    "\u201cTravel agents are uniformly in love with this country; so there\u2019s no need to reinforce that Sri Lanka is an amazing place, there\u2019s no need to say Sri Lanka is safe to a travel agent because they know it \u2013 they\u2019ve got contacts.",
    "\u201cWe need to talk to the decision maker, who is the consumer.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen there is no significance given to PR and marketing, the internet gives significance to old news,\u201d Fernando pointed out.",
    "Alan Christie, Area General Manager for Radisson Hotels who was participating in the same panel discussion concurred: \u201cThe British foreign office says that there are riots in the street and medical shortages.",
    "\u201cOne of the largest tour operators came to us and said they were going to put charters out of the UK again. They canceled it the last minute. And what was the reason? \u2018Medical shortages in Sri Lanka.\u2019 My question \u2018Where did you get this information?\u2019 \u2018Well online \u2013 the British foreign office still says there\u2019s riots in the street, there\u2019s medical shortages\u2019. German says the same thing Swiss says exactly the same thing,\u201d Christie said.",
    "\u201cIf you look at some of the travel advisories, in Sri Lanka\u2019s case, because we\u2019ve not sent out positive messages ourselves, these advisories take undue significance. That becomes the single source of information we have to counter,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "Earlier this month, Sri Lanka\u2019s minister of tourism, Harin Fernando, said that they would be starting an international marketing campaign developed by public relations firm Ogilvy. (Colombo/Dec29/2023)"
