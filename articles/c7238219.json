    "Provincial Councils and Local Government Deputy Minister Ruwan Senarath yesterday said the Government intends to import 2,000 double-cab vehicles early next year to improve transport facilities for officials heading State institutions, especially in the hinterland.",
    "According to him, the move is aimed at enabling officers, particularly those attached to local authorities, to reach villages and communities more effectively in order to carry out development work.",

    "He further noted that additional machinery and equipment would be distributed to strengthen local operations, with funding already allocated for the program.",
