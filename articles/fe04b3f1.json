    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The United Kingdom has removed references to a possible attack in Arugam Bay from its regular travel advice, while Israel has also reduced its threat level while Israel has slashed a threat level of 4 to 2, following arrests of several suspects, a media report said.",
    "The UK travel advice was updated, with references to a possible attack on Arugam Bay removed.",
    "Israel media reports said a state agency removed its own travel warning to citizens.",
    "\u201cThe National Security Council, which publishes travel advisories, said it was lowering the warning level for Sri Lanka\u2019s Arugam Bay area from four, which indicates a highly credible threat, to two, indicating a milder occasional threat,\u201d the Times of Israel newspaper said.",
    "According to an affidavit filed in US federal court late last week, an Afghani man named Farhad Shakeri, recruited by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told the FBI on October 28 that he and an accomplice had been ordered to plan a mass shooting attack against Israelis in Arugam Bay.",
    "\u201cThe accomplice, whom the filing identified as one of three people arrested by Sri Lankan authorities a day after the warning was issued, had agreed to provide AK-47s and other weapons for the attack, according to the complaint,\u201d the report said.",
    "\u201cThe accomplice was unnamed, but was said to have served prison time with Shakeri in the US.\u201d"
