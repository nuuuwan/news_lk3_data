    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s public sector wage bill will rise to 0.2 percent to 3.8 percent in 2025, under increments proposed by a committee, the Finance Ministry has said.",
    "In 2023, the public sector wage bill was 3.4 percent of GDP down from 4.0 percent in 2022 and it rose to 3.6 percent in 2024, the statement said.",
    "Under proposed increments it will rise to 3.8 percent in 2024 which will be below the 2022 level.",
    "But tax revenue are expected to go to 15 percent, with motor vehicle imports also relaxed.",
    "The salary hike would be made within the recurrent primary expenditure (before interest), of 12.7 percent of GDP.",
    "As a result Sri Lanka would be able to run a primary surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2025 under the IMF program.",
    "It was not possible to increase the salary again in 2023 as Sri Lanka had to keep within the IMF program targets and it can only be done in 2025 as revenues improve, the Finance Ministry said.",
    "If the salaries were to be hiked mid in the current economic size, a 3 percent hike in VAT was required, the statement said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank busted the currency from 184 to 360 to the US dollar in the last flexible inflation/potential output targeting exercise in the pursuit of 5 percent inflation and a belief that growth requires \u2018price pressure\u2019, which has now been legalized in a new law.",
    "After an attempt at floating the currency failed due to a surrender rule, the currency collapsed to 360 to the US dollar. It has since been allowed to appreciate to 300 to the US dollar.",
    "Salaries of both state and private sector workers were destroyed in real terms and real incomes of remittance receiving families were preserved as inflation spiked to 70 percent.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s already bloated public sector expanded after 2004 due to giving jobs to unemployed graduates and also expansion of the military to fight the civil war.",
    "The Finance Ministry said in order to attract talent, the real salaries had to go up but the public sector had to be \u2018right sized\u2019."
