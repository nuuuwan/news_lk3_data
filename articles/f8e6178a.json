    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s application to become a member in the BRICS has been rejected by the group\u2019s current membership, but its request to become a member of BRICS\u2019 New Development Bank (NDB) has been accepted, the cabinet spokesman said.",
    "Established in 2015 by BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), the NDB is a multilateral development bank aimed at mobilising resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other\u00a0emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs).",
    "Sri Lanka applied for the membership of BRICS when its delegation led by Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardena took part in the BRICS summit last month held in Russia.",
    "BRICS, an economic and political group has been gaining increasing relevance in recent years.",
    "It poses several potential challenges to the global dominance of the United States and the central role of the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance.",
    "\u201cThere are nine countries which are holding membership in BRICS. Sri Lanka applied for membership at the BRICS summit. But the nine member countries have decided not to entertain any new membership this time,\u201d Herath told reporters at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing held on Wednesday (06) in Colombo.",
    "\u201cWe applied for membership only close to October summit. We also spoke to foreign ministers of many countries to back us. Those countries also backed us. But when the summit decided not to expand membership, we won\u2019t get that opportunity,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut we applied to get the membership of the NDB Bank which comes under BRICS. We have got an opportunity to implement that. It should be decided by Sri Lanka government. We will be deciding at the Cabinet in the future,\u201d Herath said.",
    "\u201cWe have sent this (approval) to the Finance Ministry. We will decide this based on the Finance Ministry assessment.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere are countries like that. For instance, if you take Bangladesh, it is not a member of BRICS. But it is a member of the NDB Bank. Similarly we also, as a country, are trying to get the membership. We will discuss this to get the approval through Finance Ministry.\u201d",
    "NOTE: The Foreign Ministry issued a statement on November 10 saying that  Sri Lanka\u2019s application would be considered later (link to story here). The Russian Embassy also issued a statement saying the bid would be considered by BRICS \u201cin due course in full consultation and consensus\u201d along with other countries who have also applied.",
    "One of the primary goals of BRICS has been to reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar in international trade. Member nations have been exploring the use of local currencies in trade settlements, reducing exposure to dollar volatility and U.S.-imposed sanctions.",
    "The BRICS nations established the NDB to offer an alternative source of funding for infrastructure and development projects, which were traditionally dominated by Western-led institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.",
    "By providing such alternatives, BRICS countries challenge the influence of the U.S. and the West in global finance (Colombo/November 07/2024)"
