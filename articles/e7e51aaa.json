    "\u201cThe Board observed that inflation is likely to remain well below the target of 5 per cent over the next few quarters, potentially recording deflation in the immediate future driven by changes to administratively determined prices and easing of supply conditions,\u201d the central bank said giving \u2018cost-push\u2019s style reasons.",
    "\u201cAccordingly, the latest projections confirm that headline inflation is likely to be below the target by a notable margin in the forthcoming months while core inflation is projected to remain around the current levels on average.\u201d",
    "However other analysts have pointed out that the central bank has operated deflationary monetary policy since late 2022 and also allowed the exchange rate to appreciate, (a strong external anchor)providing exceptional monetary stability helping keep prices down.",
    "That part of inflation is not monetary is a doctrine that emerged among Anglophone macro-economists and took off in 1970s. Classical economists who call the un-anchored policy, \u2018monetary policy neglect\u2019 have blamed the belief for Western central banks triggering Great Inflation of the 1970s.",
    "The late 1970s IMF program for the Cambridge-economics driven UK contained a wage ceiling (5 percent), contributing to social unrest and what was called the \u2018winter of discontent\u2019.",

    "The flat or falling prices has led to widespread support for the IMF program with many spokesman warning political parties not to go off the program, though there have been unhappiness over socialist-style progressive capital consumption taxes (personal income tax) triggering out migration.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s prices are also helped by tighter US policy which has deflated energy commodities (coal, fuel, and food commodities like wheat) since the Fed started quantity tightening and rate hikes.",
    "The falling or stable prices have also increased disposable income adding to salary increments that usually come a year or two after the central bank busts the currency by inflationary open market operations triggering a currency crisis, providing a strong foundation for economic activity to recover to previous levels.",
    "\u201cThe latest economic indicators suggest that the robust growth outcome recorded in the first half of 2024 is likely to continue through the remainder of the year resulting in a higher growth for 2024 than initially projected,\u201d the central bank said.",

    "The Board arrived at this decision after carefully considering the recent and",
    "expected macroeconomic developments and possible risks and uncertainties on the domestic",
    "and global fronts with a view to ensuring that inflation aligns with the target of 5 per cent over the",
    "medium term, while enabling the economy to reach its maximum potential. The Board observed",
    "that inflation is likely to remain well below the target of 5 per cent over the next few quarters,",

    "As per the GDP estimates published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the economy is estimated to have grown by 4.7 per cent (year-on-year) in Q2 2024, following an expansion of 5.3 per cent (year-on-year) recorded in Q1 2024.",

    "Market lending interest rates continued to decline in line with the current accommodative monetary policy stance. Along with this decline, credit to the private sector by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) has expanded notably since May 2024, with sectoral data for Q2 2024 indicating a broad-based growth across all major economic sectors.",
    "Looking ahead, the expansion of credit to the private sector is expected to continue supported by lower market lending interest rates and the anticipated recovery in domestic economic activity.",

GOR stood at US dollars 6.0 billion (including the swap facility from the People\u2019s Bank of China) at end August 2024. The continuation of the Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF-EFF) and early finalisation",

    "The Board noted that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is yielding the expected outcomes, particularly in terms of the continued easing of market lending interest rates, expansion of credit to the private sector, and a strong rebound in domestic economic activity amidst a low inflation environment.",
    "The Monetary Policy Board will continue to monitor and assess incoming data on inflation developments and other macroeconomic variables and will adopt data-driven policies as required, going forward."
