    "With just a day left for the August 1 deadline set by the Donald Trump administration to wrap up agreements with its trading partners, the American President on Wednesday announced 25 percent tariffs \u201cplus a penalty\u201d for India.",
    "In a post on his platform Truth Social, Trump said India\u2019s own protectionist policies over the years had meant America had \u201cdone relatively little business with them\u201d.",
    "\u201cAlso, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia\u2019s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE \u2014 ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!\u201d he wrote.",
    "However, he did not clarify what exactly the \u201cpenalty\u201d would entail beyond the newly announced 25 per cent tariff.",
    "The United States and India have been discussing a trade deal for months, but no final agreement has been reached. Trump has been pressing for greater access for American goods to the Indian market. He has often made similar demands in other trade negotiations.",
    "Trump imposed a 26 per cent tariff on Indian goods, while announcing his \u2018Liberation day tariffs\u2019 in April. Although steep, the levy was lower than the total 104 per cent imposed on China, 49 per cent on Cambodia, and 46 per cent on Vietnam."
