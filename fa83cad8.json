  "original_body_lines": [
    "US intelligence agencies found no direct evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic stemmed from an incident at China\u2019s Wuhan Institute of Virology, a report declassified.",
    "The four-page report by the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI) said the US intelligence community still could not rule out the possibility that the virus came from a laboratory, however, and had not been able to discover the origins of the pandemic.",
    "\u201cThe Central Intelligence Agency and another agency remain unable to determine the precise origin of the Covid-19 pandemic, as both (natural and lab) hypotheses rely on significant assumptions or face challenges with conflicting reporting,\u201d the ODNI report said.",
    "The report said that while \u201cextensive work\u201d had been conducted on coronaviruses at the Wuhan institute (WIV), the agencies had not found evidence of a specific incident that could have caused the outbreak.",
    "\u201cWe continue to have no indication that the WIV\u2019s pre-pandemic research holdings included SARS-CoV-2 or a close progenitor, nor any direct evidence that a specific research-related incident occurred involving WIV personnel before the pandemic that could have caused the Covid pandemic,\u201d the report said.",
    "Intelligence officials have been pushed by lawmakers to release more material about the origins of Covid-19. But they have repeatedly argued China\u2019s official obstruction of independent reviews has made it perhaps impossible to determine how the pandemic began.",
    "The newest report is likely to anger Republicans who say the administration is wrongly withholding classified information and researchers who accuse the US of not being forthcoming.",
    "The origins of the coronavirus pandemic have been a matter of furious debate in the US almost since the first human cases were reported in Wuhan in late 2019."
