    "Students in Sri Lanka seeking overseas employment now have a unique opportunity to gain a competitive edge in the Japanese telecommunications construction industry. EXEO Global Pte Ltd., in partnership with SALA Enterprises, has launched a series of seminars aimed at equipping young adults with the necessary ITEA (Information & Telecommunications Engineering Association) telecommunications skills. These seminars, conducted in collaboration with the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission of Sri Lanka, focus on the opportunities available in Japan\u2019s telecommunications sector and the steps required to secure a Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) visa.",
    "Speaking to the media, EXEO Global\u2019s Program Manager, Watanabe, highlighted Japan\u2019s growing need for skilled workers due to its aging population. \u201cThe Japanese government has opened its doors to recruit talent from Asia, offering employment opportunities at the same level as Japanese citizens. This initiative not only benefits Japan\u2019s economy but also provides secure employment and welfare benefits for workers,\u201d he explained.",
    "Chinthaka Wijewicrema, Managing Director of SALA Enterprises, emphasized Sri Lanka\u2019s potential as a key market for skilled labor. \u201cThe seminars aim to educate participants about the SSW visa, the required skills and certifications, and the legitimate application process. This will help clarify doubts and provide insights into working and living in Japan,\u201d he said.",
    "The seminars are part of a broader initiative by ITEA and JAC (Japan Association of Construction Human Resources), with EXEO Global as their appointed partner. From 2024 to 2025, these seminars will be conducted across 10 Asian countries, with Sri Lanka identified as a preferred market for high-quality candidates.",
    "This initiative not only opens doors for Sri Lankan youth to build rewarding careers in Japan but also strengthens bilateral ties between the two nations. For those interested in the telecommunications construction industry, this is a golden opportunity to gain valuable skills and secure a promising future abroad.",
