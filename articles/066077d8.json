The project has six research centres in key regions (Panama, Sigiriya, Kotagala, Belihuloya, Kilinochchi, and Kalawana) providing island-wide coverage. Activities carried out by these research centres are operated under three main pillars: research, conservation, and awareness.",

Established in 1963, the ATBC brings together researchers, conservationists, and students from around the world to foster collaboration and share knowledge on tropical biology, promoting research, education, and practical conservation efforts to address the challenges facing tropical biodiversity. Prof. Kudavidanage is the current Sri Lankan representative of the ATBC Asia Pacific chapter.",
