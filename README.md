A killer has been jailed for 37 years for murdering his wife with an axe in front of their teenage children, in what a judge has described as a brutal and horrific attack.

Dinush Kurera, 47, blinked and looked straight ahead as Victorian Supreme Court Justice Amanda Fox handed down his sentence today.

Kurera claimed he was acting in self-defence when he repeatedly stabbed his wife Nelomie Perera with an axe and knife at her Melbourne home on December 3, 2022.

But a jury rejected his story and in August found him guilty of murder after only three hours of deliberations.

Justice Fox described the fatal attack as brutal and horrific, saying Kurera had clearly been in a rage.

“You were motivated by anger and saw everything of the prism of entitlement and ownership,” she said in her sentence.

“In your mind, Nelomie deserved to be killed for leaving you, excluding you from your house and seeing other men.”

### Sri Lanka rupee depreciates to 292.70/293.00 to US dollar, bonds up

*2024-12-19 10:06:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-rupee-depreciates-to-292-70-293-00-to-us-dollar-bonds-up-195081/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee depreciated steeply to 292.70/293.00 to the US dollar in the spot market, from 291.25/50 to the US dollar the previous day, while bond yields were up, dealers said.

Analysts had warned that if excess liquidity was allowed to build up, including from acquisition of dollars, the currency will weaken when they are used for imports as domestic prices are pushed up from higher demand.

If domestic demand and credit is pushed up from liquidity from central bank dollar rupee swaps the same consequence will happen as there was no commitment to defend the currency against excess liquidity under a so-called flexible exchange rate.

Flexible exchange rates, coupled with money printed to reach high cost of living targets, have triggered social unrest and also sovereign default in reserve collecting central banks.

A bond maturing on 15.09.2027 was quoted at 9.75/80 percent.

A bond maturing on 15.02.2028 was quoted at 10.10/15 percent.

The cost of not having electricity is almost always higher than even the cost of buying emergency power. How can a government allow such matters to be controlled by foreign companies or governments?

Connectivity of electric grids and building a pipeline are to “continue to be considered” but Anura didn’t sign-off on these projects which would ensure a dangerous, vulnerable dependence.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to raise withholding tax on deposits to 10 percent from 5 percent but exemptions will be given for lower income brackets, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.

Depositors who earn less than 150,000 rupees a month can get a direction from the Department of Inland Revenue to get an exemption, he said.

Others whose income tax bracket is below 10 percent, will be able to reclaim the extra taxes, he said.
