    "RCyAF/ SLAF, Air Ceylon, Air Lanka, Singapore Airlines Ltd, SriLankan Airlines Ltd. Former Member, Accident Investigation Team CAASL, Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) Representative for \u2018Aviation\u2019",
    "(This article was first published in The Island over 20 years ago. It is reproduced given its relevance to the current situation in the light of the Air India Boeing B787 crash on 12 June 2025.)",
    "In 1852, a Balloonist crashed in France. Although criminal proceedings were contemplated it was declared that since his descent was involuntary, he would be exempt from any court action. Besides that, when he was losing altitude he had shouted for help! When in September 1908, Orville Wright crashed and killed Lt. Thomas E Selfridge (the first Air Crash victim of a powered aircraft), no criminal action was taken against the pilot.",
    "However, as time went on it was not only the birds and fools that flew. Air travel became a big business. Keeping the aircraft flying cost money. More and more aircraft were now traversing the air on inter-continental flights and the equipment got larger. A single accident could kill a large number of people. (An accident, by definition is an event without apparent cause, an unexpected event, an unintentional act, chance, an unfortunate episode or a harmful event.)",
    "Litigation against pilots involved in accidents started in 1956, when a French DC 6 crashed in Cairo, just before landing killing 49 passengers and 3 crew members. (The Crew was on duty for 22 hours!) Eight years later the Captain was found guilty of manslaughter and charged 5,000 francs. This was the first time a Pilot in Command was classified as a \u201ccriminal.\u201d The court gave due consideration to the fact that the crew had been on continuous duty for a long time. The recommendations of Annex 13 had been ignored.",
    "Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention pertaining to accident investigation came into force in 1951. It was developed from the original article 26 of 1944. Without question this was a landmark in terms of international cooperation in accident investigation. The Manual of Aircraft Accident Investigation developed from these recommendations outlines the objectives. \u201cIt is essential that all those concerned with an accident investigation should appreciate that the object of the investigation is to save lives and damage to property in the future by ascertaining the real causes of the accident and that the inquiry is not being held simply to find the culprit or assess blame.\u201d It goes on to say \u201d An accident investigator is neither authorized nor required to arrive at findings of \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d his duty is to discover all relevant facts and he has no obligation to fix the guilt, apportion blame, or recommend punishment\u201d.",
    "Now that a precedent was created, many cases were to follow. Capt. Russell F Kane of AerLingus, a practising lawyer, provides the following list.",
    "In 1963, a de Havilland Otter crashed into a mountain in bad weather killing nine people. Two years later the Captain was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a three -year stay of execution of sentence.",
    "In 1964, the pilot in command of a TWA B 707 was charged with criminal negligence. When his aircraft struck a powered roller following an abandoned take off in Rome, Italy. The takeoff was aborted when an engine fire warning sounded. The warning subsequently proved to be false. In the fire following the crash 45 people died. The pilot was later exonerated from criminal responsibility",
    "In 1968, a B 727 crashed in marginal weather on an approach into Taipei. Fifteen people were killed including the wife of the American Captain. The pilots were charged with manslaughter and professional negligence. Their licenses were revoked and they were forbidden to leave Taiwan. The criminal courts acquitted the defendants and released them from jail.",
    "In 1969, a YS 11 slipped off the end of the runway following a landing at Mayasaki Airport in Japan. Seven people were severely injured. The captain was sentenced to one year in prison in 1978 with a three-year stay of the sentence.",
    "In 1972, a YS 11 \u2013A, flown by the co-pilot crashed into the sea during an approach into Athens airport. The Captain was charged with manslaughter but was later acquitted.",
    "In 1972, a DC 8 ran off the side of a runway during takeoff from the Haneda airport, Japan. Fourteen people were injured. The Captain was later sentenced to eight months in prison with a three-year stay of the sentence.",
    "In 1974, in Nairobi, Kenya a Lufthansa B 747 crashed immediately after liftoff. The safety investigation concluded that the leading edge flaps were not extended. Seven years later the Flight Engineer only was tried and acquitted. The German court could not rule out the fact that the impact and the resulting fire had altered the position of the switches.",
    "In 1977, a Caravelle belonging to a Swiss carrier crashed into the sea during a night approach into Funchal in Portuguese Madeira Islands. Thirty-six people died. The pilot in command who was carrying out a routine check on the other pilot was occupying the right seat. Seven and a half years after the accident both pilots were tried in Geneva and found guilty of negligence. The pilot in command was sentenced to two years in prison, the other pilot was sentenced to 18 months. They appealed the court ruling. The sentences were never served because the statute of limitations for prosecuting the pilots had expired.",
    "Capt. Kane observed that the last two cases show that the pilots may be prosecuted in more than one jurisdiction. The state where the accident occurred waived prosecution in favour of the State of Registry.",
    "In 1979 a Swiss DC 8 ran off the end of the runway following a landing at Athens. The Greek investigating body\u2019s report found pilot error to be the only factor contributing to the accident. In January 1982 the pilots were charged. A trial under the criminal code was scheduled for April 1983. Both pilots were found guilty and sentenced to five years and two months in prison. On an appeal supported by the IFALPA the court acquitted the First Officer of all charges and reduced the Captains sentence to three years.",
    "In 1983 following an accident of a B 707 in Ankara, the Captain and Co Pilot were tried under the Turkish criminal law. The outcome of the trial is unknown.",
    "In 1983, an AVENSA DC 9 in Venezuela suffered a fracture of the landing gear resulting in a fatal accident. Their crime was an ILS approach on a NOTAMed unreliable system \u2013 a fact of which they were not advised. The failure of the left landing gear, which had been noted to have cracks (contained in the Deferred Defects for over six months), changed a long landing into a fatal accident, The Venezuelan pilots were originally sentenced to fifteen-years, a subsequent appeal reducing the charges to culpable homicide and the sentence to eight years. Eventually the President of Venezuela granted them a pardon.",
    "In 1986 a Captain of a TU134A on a scheduled passenger flight in the Soviet Union reportedly ordered his crew to shutter the cockpit windscreen by taping paper and sunscreen. in place. He wanted to attempt a simulated blind landing. The landing flare began at 25 feet and the Aircraft slammed into the runway, broke into pieces and caught fire. The Captain was tried and found guilty. He received the maximum possible sentence of fifteen years in prison.",
    "In August 1987, a B 737 on a cargo flight hit power lines on takeoff at Mexico City. More than fifty people on a highway were killed. Steps have reportedly been taken towards criminal prosecution.",
    "In Feb 1997 a Sri Lankan Air Force AN 32 aircraft overran the runway, on takeoff at Ratmalana. The Russian Flight Engineer was charged with manslaughter. The Sri Lankan pilot in command who was the longest serving operational pilot never flew with the Air Force again!",
    "As one can see there is also a big interval of time between the event and the final outcome. Meanwhile the pilot has to put his career on hold and languish in a feeling of guilt. It is also true that many have fallen ill while waiting for the verdict. That is why some say that if the accident does not kill you that the inquiry surely will!",
    "Somewhere in the UK, in a Royal Air Force hangar a sign -board says it all \u201cTo err is human but to forgive is not RAF policy!\u201d How true. One must consider oneself lucky to have an incident/accident -free career. Macarthur Job a retired Australian Accident Investigator and Pilot quotes from the Bible \u201cthere but for the will of God go I\u201d",
    "For over fifty years Civil Aviation has been subjected to three great international conventions (Chicago, Tokyo and Warsaw). The details of day-to-day operations are organized under nineteen ICAO Annexes and associated guidance material. Unfortunately, many states have chosen not to ratify certain parts of the Conventions and \u201cto declare a difference\u201d with the ICAO Annexes.  Once they have done that their local laws will apply in the chosen areas.  Many airline pilots today fly legally blind and do not know that between the state of registry and the state where the incident/accident occurred the more restrictive law shall apply. . For example, if one follows the limit of eight hours \u201cbetween the bottle and the throttle\u201d (the limits of the Sri Lankan Air Navigation Regulations) and has an accident in Mumbai, one will be guilty of flying under the influence of alcohol, as the limits in India are twelve hours between!",
    "All crewmembers who were found guilty were going about their job to the best of their ability. Certainly, the Pilots didn\u2019t fly with the intention of crashing. In contrast, a Surgeon, when he loses a patient on the operating table, is not charged with manslaughter. The big difference is that the Surgeon usually loses one life at a time while the pilot may lose much more sometimes including his own. It is accepted that no other job in the world is regulated to this extent. After obtaining the pilots\u2019 qualifications, they have to prove twice a year that they are healthy enough to fly. They have to prove twice a year that they are qualified to occupy the pilot\u2019s seat to the Licensing authority of their country. They have to demonstrate to the Aviation Authorities\u2019 pilot instructor/supervisor that he can cope with all the emergencies that come their way. They have to prove that they can fly solely with reference to instruments and that they are aware of all the safety procedures of the Cabin crew by an exam once a year. Then they have to prove to their employer that they are flying the airplane in the way the airline wants following their standard operational procedures (SOPs). Apart from this proof of qualification they are subjected to the same over and over again through the course of their careers.",
    "Capt. Laurie Tailor, in his book \u201cAir Travel. How safe is it?\u201d says thus \u201cSome member states of the ICAO follow that (Annex 13) concept, but in other countries the investigation and the following inquiry were regarded as the starting point for the apportioning of blame and subsequent litigation. Procedures that follow can lend themselves to that practice.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith technical evidence being challenged by persons who are not competent to make assessments as to its value and criminal code legal procedures with the concept of prosecution, defence, hostile witnesses and guilt, taking precedence over finding the cause(s) of the accident and how to prevent a similar accident\u201d",
    "It was just a few days ago we read of a local Magistrate rejecting an official investigation report of a Sri Lankan Air Force helicopter accident with a Minister on board!",
    "This \u201cOld Timer\u201d has seen many pilots being given a hard time by lawyers at inquiries, who are absolutely clueless on technical matters. For instance, questioning in an inquiry to a company B 737 accident in Madras (now Chennai) where one landing gear collapsed proceeded thus:",
    "\u201cCapt. Xxxx, When did you know that you were flying to Madras on this flight?\u201d",
    "\u201cSo Capt. Xxxx , I put it to you that you had two full weeks to check the Serviceability of the airplane!!\u201d",
    "Some of these inquiries can get rather hilarious as long as you are not the pilot under investigation! When the Captain of the Swissair crash, at Athens declared that at the latter stages of the rollout that he took over the braking, from the First Officer, the Presiding Judge thought that the Captain and the First Officer changed seats while the aircraft was rolling along the runway!",
    "Another alarming development is the involvement of Law Agencies such as the CID and the FBI in the accident/incident investigations. These parallel investigations sometimes work at cross-purposes. At a law symposium in 1973 concerns were raised because the \u2018Law\u2019 was interfering with the accident inquiry in accordance with Annex 13. The Report states, \u201cAs just one case in point, consider the situation of the Head of an aviation safety office who found himself in jail one day because he was interfering with the local Police investigation of a particular aviation accident in his own country!\u201d Where there is death and destruction the police assume that it is their duty to carry out independent investigations. This is the story in Sri Lanka. Our DGCA follows the CAA (UK) practice.",
    "Capt. Ian Frow of the British Air Line Pilots Association says, \u201cNone of this is new. What is new is the increased enthusiasm for Aviation Authorities around the world to apply criminal sanctions to pilots who make mistakes. Our own CAA is now well down the path. In their case their attitude is encouraged by the Political and Consumer Groups who after Zeebrugge (the cross channel Ferry Boat disaster), Clapham Junction (the Rail crash), various holiday Coach accidents and some events of our Industry are demanding \u2018Safer Transport\u2019. Political neglect and under-funding have created a CAA which often has neither the ability nor the will to pursue tough targets like Airlines and Aircraft Manufacturers who are frequently implicated in accidents nominally put down as \u2018crew error.\u2019 Instead it takes the soft option and goes after the Flight Deck Crew, who as a group would never consciously act in a manner likely to cause an accident. It is not, however, totally unknown for both Manufacturers and Operators, when Commerce rules, to take a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d with Safety\u201d",
    "So, is having an air accident a crime? It certainly looks like it from the front end of the aircraft! This is exactly why Air Safety experts are worried about \u201csigns of the times\u201d. After an accident or incident, the Accident Investigator has to rely on the help of the Pilots involved in the accident to reconstruct the chain of events that led to the event. Now if the Pilots are going to be legally liable they will certainly not give the full story to the Investigator. As someone put it a \u201cdamned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t scenario\u201d.",
    "It was only a few days ago that a Captain of an US submarine was requesting immunity from prosecution when giving evidence in an accident with a Japanese Trawler. As expected, the request was not granted.",
    "Unfortunately, many in our Industry assume that airline flying is inherently safe. The truth is while technology improved the \u201cHuman Factors\u201d remained the same. It is hard to comprehend that intelligent people in high places think that \u201cpunishment\u201d is an effective deterrent.",
    "The Pilot Associations have already put their defenses up. They recommend to their membership to make statements like \u201cBefore making a report or statement of any kind, I wish to exercise my right to consult with my Association representative and/or attorney\u201d to be made, after an accident or incident.",
    "The world is not perfect but we could strive for change. Given below is what the IFALPA is asking the ICAO and the lawmakers of the world to accept.",
    "\u201cEvidence given at the technical investigation should be considered as privileged and not be available for use in any subsequent disciplinary, civil, administrative or criminal proceedings nor for any public distribution.\u201d",
    "\u201cEvidence other than the final report should not be made available to any body, which seeks to establish civil, criminal or administrative responsibility or apply disciplinary measures. Nor should any of this information be available for public distribution.\u201d",
    "\u201cRecords used in the reporting of near accidents or incidents, voluntary or mandatory, anonymous or not in a voluntary or mandatory system, shall not be made available for the purpose other than accident prevention. In no case shall the identity of the persons involved be disclosed to the public.\u201d",
    "\u201cAny provisions relating to prosecution for violating of Air Navigation Regulations (ANRs) or Criminal Laws should be covered in legislation that is separate from the aircraft accident investigation legislation and, when foreign pilots are involved, should encompass the principal of \u201cTransfer of Prosecution,\u201d where appropriate, to the state in which such pilots were licensed.\u201d",
    "Our National Carriers Air Ceylon, Air Lanka and SriLankan have been extremely fortunate to have not had a \u201cbig one\u201d where there was destruction to life and property and the pilots survived. Urgent lobby is needed to get the relevant laws, to protect the pilots from criminal action, into place.",
    "So, until it is realised by all and sundry that criminal action is not the answer to improving Air Safety it is a good idea to plead lack of \u201cmens rea\u201d which simply means, \u201cI did not mean to commit a criminal act Your Honor\u201d",
