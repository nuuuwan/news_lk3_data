    "Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle endorsed Kamala Harris\u2018 bid for president on Friday in a roughly one-minute long video that captured a private phone call between the couple and the current vice president.",
    "\u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\u201d Obama told Harris.",
    "\u201cI am proud of you. This is going to be historic,\u201d the former first lady told Harris.",
    "Talking into a cell phone and cracking a few smiles, Harris expressed her gratitude for the endorsement and their long friendship.",
    "\u201cThank you both. It means so much. And we\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too,\u201d Harris said.",
    "The campaign said the video was the actual call, not a reenactment.",
    "Harris\u2019s surprise bid against Republican rival Donald Trump continues to gain steam from supporters, donors and politicians less than a week after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race amid slumping poll numbers.",
    "Obama, the first US Black president, remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party even after more than a decade has passed since he was last elected.",
    "Obama has lent his support to Biden during big-money fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign.",
    "The endorsement could help activate and sustain energy and fundraising for Harris\u2019 campaign and it signals he is likely to get on the campaign trail for Harris once she is officially the presumptive nominee.",
    "Obama initially withheld his endorsement even as Biden, his former vice president, anointed her as his heir apparent. Obama reportedly did not want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee."
