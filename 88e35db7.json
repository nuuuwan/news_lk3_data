    "SLPP MP Ranjith Bandara told a news conference that the government should not try to please someone by fully implementing the 13A and that no room should be left for any conspiratory forces to take the country into their grip.",
    "He said certain political parties do not really represent ordinary people but they have continued to advocate for a separate territory, language and culture and added that they have not changed at all.",
    "The MP said the government must grant power that has already been vested with provincial councils instead of talking about granting more powers.",
    "\"There are so many discrepancies in provincial schools and the health sector. We need to fully implement powers already vested with provincial councils. Let\u2019s hold the PC election and let people decide who can implement powers in provincial councils,\" he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
