    "The rest of the patients were clinically confirmed to have been infected with the disease.",
    "He said seven cases confirmed that they had been infected with the disease.",
    "Dr. Perera further said that the reason for the spread of the disease was that people had not received their immunization vaccines.",
    "However, the Daily Mirror learns that most of the children were not given immunization vaccines due to religious reasons.",
    "Moreover, he said there is a possibility of the virus spreading among those who had not been vaccinated, which would be a threat to society.",
    "The government used to administer the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccines to children within nine months and after they turned three years old.",
    "However, there is a possibility of those who had not been immunized being infected with measles.",
    "Therefore, the doctor requests the people to get themselves vaccinated immediately to prevent the spread.",
