### MTI Consulting recommends Cabinet  restructuring with a ‚Äòstart-up‚Äô mindset

*2024-11-18 03:09:34* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/MTI-Consulting-recommends-Cabinet-restructuring-with-a-start-up-mindset/14-769360) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions

Post watershed election that has the potential to transform Sri Lanka socio-economically, MTI Consulting has recommended a radically different approach to restructuring the Cabinet of Ministers.

How nations, both developed and developing, structure their cabinets is often based on legacy practices with incremental, ad-hoc changes. There is very little ground thinking, first principles, and future-proofing (which are considered effective in organisational structuring) that goes into such a process.

In this backdrop, Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions, even considering rationalisation and consolidation where needed.

### I will provide dedicated service - Satyalingam

*2024-11-18 02:45:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199027) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



P. Sathalingam accepts National List seat, vows dedicated service to people. Cites past failures due to opposition campaigns. Aims to address Wanni region's needs. Will continue as party General Secretary. Promises impactful work over next five years.

üü©

"I will accept the confidence of the party and dedicate the service to the people of this area," Parliamentarian P. Sathalingam said.

He said this while commenting to the media after the National List seat of the TNA.

A massive responsibility has been imposed on me. When I was a member of the Provincial Council I had made many development plans. But people rejected me for something. There is many reasons for that.

Opposition parties and rivals presented fake campaigns against me. It was a cause of failure. My career is not politics. I am a doctor. If the party did not give this post, I was in the intention of acting as a state official again.

Wanni Having is a territory where the systematic genocide is taking place. So the party has provided this seat to know the need for a Member of Parliament who can perform it.

I will accept the confidence in me and dedicate my service to the people of this area. Thanks to the people who did not vote in that way. Thanks to the party.

### Sajith's weakness is the cause of the fall of the United People's Power - Sarath Fonseka

*2024-11-18 02:36:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199026) ¬∑ `ta`

Sajith Premadasa's weak leadership caused United People's Power's downfall, says Sarath Fonseka. Party members left due to informal management. Without a strong leader, people chose National People's Power instead.

üü©

The situation is due to the failure of Sajith Brahmedasa formally managing the leadership of the United People's Power.. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Sajith Premadasa did not act properly as the leader of the United People's Power but also the leader of the opposition.

I quit because of the weakness found in the leadership of Sajith Premadasa. As well as many senior members left the party. The two positions he held did not engage in formal administration.

So if the other members of the party want to choose Harsha de Silva as the leader. They cannot act as a strong opposition party led by Sajith Premadasa.

Due to the lack of an alternative, the people have chosen national power. Even those who voted for the cylinder in the last presidential election have chosen national people's power this time. He said the United People's Power should now fulfill its responsibility.

### Economic Challenges Of New Government: Road Ahead Not Smooth, But Treacherous

At the General elections held last week, voters from all over the country have overwhelmingly selected the candidates fielded by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake or AKD as legislators to frame laws for a five-year term. In his journey to presidency, AKD‚Äôs supporters sang the theme song of which an appropriate rendering in English will be, ‚ÄòToday the whole nation in a single file will hand the country over to Anura to usher prosperity to people‚Äô. But the election results showed that it was not in a single file but without the support of the marginalised citizenry from the upcountry, and the north and the east. Like a true statesman, delivering his victory speech at the Elections Secretariat, AKD admitted that he had been endorsed by some sections in society but there are those who had not voted for him. He said that he will serve all the people without any division or discrimination as their President[1].

### Hela Apparel Holdings reports significantly improved results in Q2

Hela Apparel Holdings PLC has announced a significant improvement in its financial performance during the quarter ended 30 September, with a return to operating profit for the first time in eight quarters.

This positive result highlights the recovery of demand conditions in its key export markets and underscores the successful outcomes of its ongoing restructuring exercise, the company said in a statement.

The Hela Group‚Äôs revenue surged by 36.5% year-on-year to Rs. 23.4 billion in the second quarter of FY 2024/25. This was primarily driven by the contribution of the recently established Brand Licensing Division, following the acquisition of UK-based Focus Brands in January 2024. Sales for the existing private label manufacturing division were also supported by the ongoing recovery in demand from its key brand partners across the US and Europe.

The paddy and rice prices seem to be a political game but can be sorted out to a greater extent based on more coherent policies, planning and implementation mechanisms. Paddy and rice prices are socially sensitive issues that cause headaches for any government at different periods of the year. It is a pride of Sri Lankans to consume the rice produced locally. However, when the need arises, we will not hesitate to import rice to bridge the gap based on the requirement

### What has democracy got to do with unproductive coconut land?

It is unlikely that democracy will yield greater returns solely because of the moral fortitude of the agents entrusted with governing on our behalf

It is broadly accepted that the Sri Lankan coconut industry, especially the smallholder segment, is highly unproductive. It has been reported that the average yield per hectare in Sri Lanka is less than half the yield in Andhra Pradesh where the climatic conditions are not dissimilar. This problem is not new.

Thirty years ago, I was asked to evaluate several information projects including the coconut information system managed by the Coconut Research Institute. The information system was exemplary, but I concluded that it all seemed pointless because the end objectives of producing more coconuts and improving the livelihoods of the growers were not being achieved. During the entire period of study, yields were declining. I was not asked to conduct evaluations after that.

The importance of achieving debt sustainability without compromising the welfare and long-term interests of Sri Lanka‚Äôs populace is clear

Lender awareness that Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt exceeded Government revenue by a factor of 10 underscores a stark instance of predatory lending practices. This highlights a profound failure to adhere to established norms of responsible lending, which require creditors to assess a borrower‚Äôs capacity to repay before extending further credit. By continuing to extend loans under such unsustainable conditions, creditors blatantly disregarded these principles, exacerbating Sri Lanka‚Äôs financial vulnerability and contributing to its current debt crisis. This pattern of lending not only violated ethical standards but also undermined the spirit of shared accountability between lenders and sovereign borrowers

This is a historic occasion in Sri Lanka because in the past no Sri Lankan leader has been able to unite the country through the power of the ballot in this manner. Their attempt at doing so by the power of the bullet has miserably failed. But along with this electoral record which has elevated AKD and his supporters to the highest pedestal of the reign of power, there is an unshirkable responsibility cast on him as well

Unlike in the past, voters cannot afford to remain aloof as mere onlookers and critics of what the Government does ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

When the date for election was announced there were murmurs among a group of Buddhist monks that the date would fall on a Poya Day, that it would be a day for people to attend to their religious rituals and meditation and that therefore the polling date be postponed. But the Election Commissioner stuck to his guns and as proved by the results voters thronged in hundreds of thousands not to the temples but to the polling booths and delivered an unassailable mandate to their favourite party of choice, National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) under the leadership of their favourite son, Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD).

It was indeed as the Chinese would say a mandate of heaven delivered on a Poya Day through the voting citizenry. To the Buddhists at least, NPP‚Äôs historic victory and the enormity of its size would appear a divinely blessed outcome.

### Ballot unites Sri Lanka in 2024

This Government and this President have the best opportunity in decades to truly unify the country like none other ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

How with the overwhelming mandate from the people of the north and the east, the NPP has a unique opportunity to unite the country

The Rajapaksa family was duly credited with uniting the country after winning a relentless war with the LTTE. In May 2009 the war was won and the country was declared united as one.

But for years afterwards, racism continued to feature in political campaigns and while the peace was won, question marks persisted regarding the hearts and minds of the northerner. And doubts remained regarding their actual integration with their southern brethren.

2024 may be seen as a watershed moment in Sri Lankan history as a Presidential election was fought where racism was not an issue. Language and religion did not play a role and none of the candidates had a divisive agenda.

### Sri Lanka also conquered the series with New Zealand;The 6th consecutive series of Sri Lanka's earnings on home soil

*2024-11-17 23:37:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199025) ¬∑ `ta`

Sri Lanka wins 6th consecutive home series against New Zealand. Key performances from Mahish Deekshana and Kusal Mendis. Sri Lanka sets target of 210/7, NZ reaches 209/all out. Mahish Deekshana takes 3/31, Jevri Vendasee 3/46.

üü©

Sri Lanka won the 2nd ODI match between Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Pallekele, Kandy on Sunday.

With this victory, Sri Lanka won the three -match international ODI series, which made the 6th consecutive success on home soil.

Also, for the first time after 10 years on home soil, Sri Lanka has made 5 series in a single year.

In this victory, Mahish Deekshana's all -round match and Kusal Mendis played a key role.

Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to win 210 runs, losing 7 wickets in 46 overs.

Avishka Fernando (5), Betham Nissank (28) and Kamindu Mendis (0) lost by 23 runs.

Kamindu Mendis, who was raised to the 4th line, faced only 3 balls, losing the game and disappointed with the fans.

Subsequently, Sarid Asalanga (12) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (8) lost the game with fewer runs.

Gusal Mendis and Janith Liyanage both tried to restore the team in the 6th wicket. But when the two shared 39 runs, Janith Liyanage lost 22 runs.
