    "Landmark commemorations of 80 years were marked this year on May 8th and August 15th. They are named VE Day and VJ Day\u2013Victory in Europe Day and Victory over Japan Day respectively. These Days are opportunities to commemorate the sacrifices and achievements of the second world war generation.",
    "The Allied Forces marched into Germany and Hitler committed suicide in his bunker with Eva Braun; while the American Fleet particularly, fought the war in the Pacific against Japan which battled ruthlessly in the name of their Emperor \u2013 Hirohito. He announced Japan\u2019s surrender to the nation on August 15, 1945, in a broadcast known as the \u2018Jewel Voice Broadcast\u2019 according to the Nuclear Museum \u2013 the first time an emperor had addressed the public via radio.",
    "What comes sharply to mind is the horrendous nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which finally cowed down the Japanese who had moved far westward bringing many South East Asian countries under their control and stood stationed at the very entrance to India. Also remembered are their kamikaze pilots who loaded their aircraft with explosives and made deliberate suicidal crashes on enemy targets like ships in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.",
    "I decided to write my memories of World War II years though it betrays my age. However, I am proud to be as old as I am. I presume not many are still alive and writing as I am hence this article to inform the present generations who don\u2019t even recall the Korean or Vietnam wars, to know how things were in this colony of the British Empire when almost the entire world was embroiled in war. Ceylon gained its independence from the British Raj in 1948 while India self-ruled a year earlier. Thus, both countries were involved in the war. At first it was that many joined the Allied Army \u2013 more the Indians like the warrior Gurkhas. I had a distant relative who was a soldier in Sudan. Later the involvement of our nations was severer.",
    "Ceylon became an important axis when the South East Asia Command (SEAC) was established in November 1943 as a major Allied military command to oversee operations against Japan in SE Asia; to liberate occupied territories and ultimately defeat the Japanese forces in the region. Led by Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, it encompassed a vast area including the Malay Peninsula, Burma, Siam, Sumatra, India and Ceylon. Lord Mountbatten moved to India and set his headquarters in Delhi in September 1943, but in April 1944 moved his headquarters and himself to buildings within the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens. He was often seen in Kandy, especially of a morning horse riding in Udawattakele.",
    "The first intimation of war to this very young child \u2013 me \u2013 was my brother, just older, posting a board at the entrance of our play tent in our garden on Peradeniya Road, Katukelle, with the words \u201cWar is declared\u201d. It must have been September 1, 1939, the ominousness completely lost on me. But the dread and anxiety increased in adults with the passing months, reaching a peak once SEAC was established. Kandy was awash with soldiers of all skin colours and uniforms. Dreaded most were the black soldiers who had the real crinkly hair and were very dark black. One remembered sight was seeing a sea of red lights \u2013 glow of lit cigarettes \u2013 and hearing boots as hordes of soldiers walked along the down road in Katukelle as Mother had me accompany her to the back door of our neighbour\u2019s home to borrow some ginger. The soldiers were not clearly discernible, only the red glow of their cigarettes.",
    "We, kids, had fun showing V signs with our first two fingers to passing armed personnel in large vehicles. Those at the back behind half doors would throw candy, chocolates and chewing gum to us \u2013 veritable rare luxuries then.",
    "Total black-out was ordered, so we had thick curtains on our windows and closed doors early, not only to prevent any chink of light escaping but to not give the slightest excuse for soldiers to enter our open front verandah. They were wont to do this, particularly since the Burgher family next door had soldiers visiting them with goodies and enjoying evening singsongs with Joyce, the young daughter.",
    "Air raid practices came often. The wail of the siren placed on the road had us closing doors and windows and us kids creeping under beds. Air raid shelters were strategically built to get people down in them during these practices in preparation for a real air attack, since the Japanese were approaching ever closer.",
    "Mother would not consider at all going into a shelter with two grown daughters, the eldest now safely married. \u201cNot even if it means dying here at home, all of us together\u201d was her opinion since advances being made to her girls by randy co-sharers of a shelter was a fate worse than death to ultra-conservative Mother.",
    "We in school had practices too. Miss Allen, our Girls\u2019 High School Principal, would blow long and loud on her whistle which was the sign for us to place a pencil across our mouths and creep under our desks with fingers pressed on ears. I was a tot in the KG. Many a kid would fall asleep so that after Miss Allen went round the school inspecting classes and blew her whistle as an all-clear, the teacher had to go around waking sleepers.",
    "Shortages of foodstuff increased. We had no butter, cheese etc; no luxuries at all. Raw rice, even paddy could not be transported unless one had a permit for the purpose. So Mother had to get this permit from the Kachcheri to get her due share of pounded paddy from her village. Mrs Soysa down the road was in a bad way. Her husband, in rage, had tried to kill her but a son intervened. Mr Soysa shot himself. She would plead with mother for some rice. But it was dangerous. Her plight being severe, the plan devised was for her elder son Teddy to tap on our front room window at dusk and a parcel of grain would be passed to him.",
    "Mention needs to be made of O E Goonetilleke who played a vital role during WWII and later became Governor General of Ceylon. I quote; \u201c\u2026 the Civil Defence Commissioner, second only to the Commander-in-Chief, Geoffrey Layton. Also appointed Commissioner of Food, tasked with securing vital food supplies during the conflict. Additionally, he was involved in negotiations for Ceylon\u2019s post-war self-rule, including discussions with the Soulbury Commission.\u201d",
    "On Easter Sunday April 5, 1942, Japanese dropped bombs in Colombo but their planes were repulsed. A month previous, Mother realized staying in Kandy was hazardous, so we moved to my brother-in-law\u2019s sister\u2019s home in Katugastota where my newly married sister lived temporarily. We were a huge crowd there but our family of Mother and four children were welcomed. We returned to Kandy even before VJ Day since Japan was being defeated.",
