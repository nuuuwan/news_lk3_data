    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he is committed to advancing Sri Lanka\u2019s gem industry within the next two years, but does not believe in granting tax exemptions to do so.",
    "\u201cThe government\u2019s focus on gem re-export, value addition, and augmenting foreign exchange inflows necessitates a modernized gem industry. While tax relief has been a customary request, merely granting concessions without substantial sectoral growth is inadequate,\u201d Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division at the opening of the \u201cGem Sri Lanka 2024\u201d Gem and Jewellery Exhibition today (11).",
    "\u201cThe key lies in concurrent development and strengthening of economic foundations for everyone involved in the industry, alongside fostering knowledge enhancement for gem polishers,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cI strongly oppose the proposal to grant tax exemptions merely for individuals to amass personal wealth. My objective is to foster substantial growth in the industry over the next two years, with a particular focus on benefiting the communities in Beruwala, Ratnapura and Laggala.",
    "\u201cThis approach should not only contribute to the national welfare but also ensure widespread prosperity within the industry.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe highlighted plans for modernization within the gem and jewellery sector to transform it into a sector that contributes to the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings.",
    "Wickremesinghe has been emphasizing the need for a new economic system geared towards exports.",
    "In his budget speech he said there would be a comprehensive policy framework formulated for the gem industry.",
    "\u201cIn the forthcoming two months, efforts are underway to craft this policy framework, signalling a stride toward the prosperity of our nation\u2019s gem industry. Sri Lanka, with its vast potential in gems, stands poised for remarkable progress.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs Ian Fleming once immortalized diamonds by saying \u201cdiamonds are forever,\u201d we proudly affirm that Sri Lanka\u2019s gems, including the enduring sapphires, share a timeless legacy.\u201d",
    "The exhibition, organized by the China Fort Gems and Jewellery Trade Association and hosted at the Bentota Cinnamon Bay Hotel, will run until January 13. (Colombo/Jan11/2024)"
