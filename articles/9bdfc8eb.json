    "The writer\u2019s attention was drawn to the recent press release issued by the Elections Secretariat on the above matter, as it is one of the 3 main reasons distorting the country wide \u2018equal value of vote\u2019 envisaged, under a real Proportional Representation (PR) system. From time to time since 2015 Election, the writer as a sovereign voter has been updating his package of crucial Reforms /\u2018System changes\u2019 to rationalise and simplify our existing political and electoral systems by highlighting an analysis of the results of 2015 and 2020 General Elections. They were published in the Sinhala and English National Press. The writer was also invited for a presentation to senior Election Dept. Officials at the Elections Secretariat by the former Chairman of National Election Commission (NEC) in 2017. The package was also submitted to all relevant Cabinet appointed and Presidential Commissions, a Parliamentary Select committee and voter dedicated civil organizations and activists.",
    "Since1989 General Election, the real objective of PR arithmetic system has been defeated by the following tinkerings to the Constitution and the relevant Acts, under the pretext of a so-called \u2018Stable Government\u2019.",
    "i) Allocation of 196 MP seats have been pre-determined, based on the number of registered voters at District level.(Refer para. below on Vanni and Gampaha District results)",
    "ii) Awarding 22 so-called \u2018Bonus\u2019 seats\u00a0 to District Winners considering the valid votes polled by all parties in each District and",
    "iii) Imposing a minimum vote requirement of 5% at\u00a0 District level (Since reduced from 12.5% \u200b\u200bto 5%)to all parties to favor\u00a0 major parties, thereby ejecting a large number of valid votes.to the \u2018wastepaper basket\u2019.",
    "It is abundantly clear from the Table below that the \u2018Equality of Vote through proportionality\u2019, which the voters expected, was not reflected in the number of parliamentary seats won by the Parties.",
    "As the \u2018equality of the Ballot\u2019 referred to in Article 93 of the Constitution can only be preserved by proportionally distributing the 196+29 seats in the Central Parliament, the writer has proposed to determine the National quota of Parties based directly on their national vote %, (Officially issued by NEC along with the Summary of General Election results), and re-distribute such National quotas immediately to the Districts based on their respective District vote %.",
    "Accordingly, Column 9 in\u00a0 Table below analysing\u00a0 the 2020- General Election results, shows the hitherto unnoticed but significant differences between the official (tinkered)results (column 4) and the results obtained using 100%\u00a0 PR Arithmetic(column7) determining\u00a0 the Party quotas from 196 seats. Additionally, the warped results obtained by extrapolating the seat level results as per pre-1978 FPP system published by print media (Column 10), blatantly exposes the inequality of vote.",
    "Table- 2020 -General Election Results Analysis: Official (tinkered); 100% proportional (PR) and pre-1978\u00a0 FPP system.",
    "Columns 7 to 9: Based on data published on 06-08-2020 on NEC website.",
    "Column 10: Seat level results extrapolated from national Newspapers 09- 08-2020.",
    "According to the Table above, if 100% PR arithmetic was applied to ensure \u2018vote equality through proportionality\u2019 at the 2020 Election, the SLPP would get only 133 seats,\u00a0 which is less than a 2/3rd\u00a0 majority. JJB would have increased its seats from 3 to 9 and UNP would have won 5 seats instead of 01National list seat. OPPP would have enjoyed a reasonable increase of 1 to 2 seats. ITAK would see a decrease from 10 to 07 seats and EPDP would see a justified decrease from 2 to 1 seat. Also, the real proportional results pave the way for 5 more parties to enter Parliament extending inclusivity.",
    "When focusing on the vexed caption, Vanni District comes to the fore especially due to NEC\u2019s pre-determined allocation of 6 MP seats. As a result, EPDP party, with a meagre 11,310 votes at District level, enjoyed the luck of winning 01 seat out of 196 MP seats despite badly losing all 3 constituencies in the District. Eventually, having won 01 more MP seat and the Kayts constituency from Jaffna District, EPDP won 2 seats out of 196 MP seats with a national tally of only 61,464 votes. Ironically, as shown in the Table 3 Parties that won a higher number of National votes than EPDP(Column 4), ended up with only 01 Parliamentary seat while another received none out of 196 seats.",
    "On the other hand, JJB despite mustering 61,833 valid votes from Gampaha District alone, gained only 01 Parliamentary seat. Furthermore, as shown in the Table, the JBB, which obtained 445,958 votes and ranked 3rd under the national Party tally, won only 3 seats including 01 National List seat. On the other hand, the UNP having received 249,435 national votes did not get even 1 seat out of 196 due to not receiving votes exceeding the 5% District limit. It won 01 seat from the National list, due to the application of 100% proportional arithmetic.",
    "Against such backdrop, the authorities have now added insult to injury, by pre-allocating 6 seats to Vanni District equaling that of Jaffna District which has got a cut of 01 seat from its previous pre-allocation of 7, despite having a registered voter base nearly double that of Vanni District.",
    "It is a serious infringement on the fundamental \u2018equal value of vote\u2019 required in a democratic election. Even if other less important variables such as land size, terrain, accessibility and ethnicity were considered, one cannot simply justify a trade- off of such magnitude leading to a highly anomalous situation.",
    "Before concluding, the writer wishes to educate the voters with attendant benefits from the above proposal.",
    "i. Ensures \u2018equal value to vote through proportionality\u2019 in North, South, East and West of the country..",
    "ii. The rational, transparent determination of Party seat quotas at National level for redistribution among Districts based on actual valid votes strengthens the confidence of the populace in the Electoral system.",
    "iv. The authorities can make these changes quite easily and transparently.",
    "v. This system can be easily adopted for Provincial Council elections sans complicated mixed voting systems.",
    "Finally, having\u00a0 noted with concern that, A)Some of the critical voter-friendly \u2018system changes\u2019 have escaped the recent submissions by a few sincere writers to the press ;B) The voter \u2018System Change\u2019 package, including the above proposal, has not received due attention of the Cabinet, Parliament and President appointed\u00a0 Commissions/Committees, civil organizations and relevant authorities for nearly 10 years, the writer fervently\u00a0 appeals to all \u2018Country first Political Parties / Alliances\u2019 to include a summary of the voter package of \u2018System changes\u2019 in their Election manifestos , enlisted as follows.",
    "i. Entry of \u2018Country first-Political Professionals\u2019 under a robust \u2018Meritocratic Representative Democracy\u2019 sans Preference and complex \u2018Mixed Member Voting\u2019 (MMV) Systems;",
    "ii. Rational representation of Women and Youth in Parliament and PCs. iii. Election of at least 01 MP to each of 160 electorates without compromising the \u2018Equality of vote through proportionality\u2019.",
    "iv. Entry of 29 \u2018Senate Quality\u2019 National list members to the Parliament sans voting powers.",
    "vi. Moderating registration of \u2018Mushroom\u2019/unscrupulous/Decoy Political parties hiding behind human rights, by imposing stringent eligibility and high cash deposit requirements.",
    "vii.Branding the \u20185 year Party Election Manifesto\u2019 as a prosecutable document with a monitorable, time-lined 5 year action plan\u00a0 subject to an Audit procedure.",
    "viii. Holding General and PC Elections and the relevant Referenda on the same day to ensure cost effectiveness of the systems. Electronic voting system to be considered.",
    "ix. Preventing all people\u2019s representatives from involving in all matters relevant to their selection process, Salary/ benefits etc. summoning gross \u2018Conflict of Interest\u2019.",

    "xii. Objectively strengthening PCs with additional powers, if necessary, to forge \u2018Sri Lankan ness\u2019 and rationalise the role and benefits of MPs.",
    "xiii. Depoliticising LG Election to ensure unbiased and uncorrupt service to the people through election of acceptable \u2018Independent\u2019 candidates in the locality as per \u2018Grama Raajya\u2019 concept, with the formation of \u2018Jana Sabha\u2019s\u2019(JS) at \u2018Grama Niladhari Division (GND) level, as proposed by the National Movement for Social Justice(NMSJ). Low cost Elections can be conducted by Divisional Secretaries.",
    "xiv.Installing a \u2018Sustainable National Cabinet\u2019 system to foster \u2018Sri Lankan ness\u2019 by allocating portfolios to seat- wining parties based on their National Vote % at the General Election. The same % method to be adopted for allocating Provincial portfolios.",
    "xv. Abolishing\u00a0 Executive Presidency from a specified date along with the passage of the voters\u2019 \u2018System Change\u2019 package covering both Political and Electoral systems through a single Referendum leading to election of a \u2018Hybrid Non-executive President(HNP) with limited powers, from 3-5 candidates proposed by the Constitutional Council/Other special panel, with voting by MPs and PC members. The Post will have powers to appoint and direct Provincial Governors to ensure execution of relevant Parliament approved Acts/ Laws/Budgets/ Programmes within specified time frames sans red tape.",
    "Note: Hold PC Election and the said Referendum too on the same day.",
    "xvi. New Executive President to prioritise approval of above critical \u2018system Changes\u2019 through a petition to Supreme Courts calling a Referendum as proposed by the LEADS Forum, failing which, resort to item Nos. ix, x and xi above.",
    "Note: Writer\u2019s detailed methodology and benefits from above \u2018System changes\u2019 have been published in the Press. Also available as a free E booklet on request.",
    "Since the disillusioned sovereign voters of the new generation cannot wait for long, this package of positive system changes need to be legalised without further delay. The writer and the people look up to the new President determined to make a real \u2018System Change\u2019 in the Parliament and the Government, which are the epicenters of Corruption, Theft and Mismanagement, and other \u2018country first\u2019 political parties, authorities, civil organizations and activists who are equally committed. The writer and the people strongly believe that by putting the \u2018House of Parliament\u2019 in order and streamlining the Governance structure as proposed above, will surely eradicate corruption and theft and re-build public confidence in the new system\u00a0 that will break the shackles of convention, towards a prosperous and a peaceful Country fostering \u2018Sri Lankan ness !"
