Parliament, May 08 (Daily Mirror)- No airline in the world is making any profits and it is a situation inherent to all airlines, Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today.

He told Parliament that airlines even in rich countries such as Air India, BOAC and Swiss Airlines were not profit making and some were sold out.

Responding to a question by SJB MP Hesha Vithanage, the Minister said Air India was sold out to Tata due to losses and added that Emirates was provided some USD 2 to 3 billion by the government every year.

He said a small country like Sri Lanka is not in a position to maintain an airline in that manner.

"We have no funds to purchase aircraft. We cannot invest a large capital. We take flights on lease. We need to join with a group which can bring in a large capital so as to continue the airline to ensure the job security of 6,000 employees," he said.

### Australia raises minimum savings for student visa, warns on fake recruitment

SYDNEY, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

### Sri Lanka ‘free’ visa costs US$21.61 under VFS Global deal: legislator

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s ‘free’ visas issued to several countries are being charged 21 US dollars by VFS Global, a private contractor hired without competitive tender, opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said.

“Visa cost is zero. Then here is a service free of 18.50 for a free visa,” Bandara told parliament Wednesday. “There is another charge for 3.11 dollars.

“So they are taking 21.65 dollars for a gratis visa when a tourist comes to Sri Lanka. When we go to Singapore we get a free visa. So nothing is charged from us. Not a single dollar is charged as a service fee.”

Bandara claimed companies have been incorporated in the UAE to do the deal with Sri Lanka.

Bandara questioned why the deal was given to VFS Global when Mobitel had offered to do the system for 1 dollar.

“A massive game is being played,” Bandara said. “This government has a life of 4 months. Are they going to collect money in their death?”
