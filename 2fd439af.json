    "In their vastly entertaining satire \u20181066 And All That\u2019, presented as \u201cA memorable history of England\u201d, coauthors W.C. Sellar and R.J. Yeatman argue that \u201chistory is not what happened \u2013 it is what you can remember\u201d.",
    "At the end of each chapter, there is a mad quiz... to discern what their readers have sadly learned (\u201ccomprising all the things you can remember\u201d).",
    "And in one memorable test paper, they ask: \u201cWhat can you remember?\u201d To which, they suggest, the answer is: \u201cNothing!\u201d Ergo, their conclusion: \u201cHistory is now at an end...\u201d",
    "We, having singularly, collectively, and repeatedly failed to learn the lessons of history, are doomed or condemned to repeat (by memory \u2013 or its failure) its distinctively memorable bits, which we\u2019d all rather forget.",
    "In lighter (\u20181066\u2019) vein today, we present a studied \u2013 yet, mercifully brief (1948\u20132023) \u2013 history of Sri Lanka.",
    "We focus on its models of state, to argue that the most memorable thing about it is how many sea-changes in civics and governance we\u2019ve undergone, while remaining decidedly a riches-to-rags story, and strange at that...",
    "Do you remember how we got from there to here? What do you remember?\u2019",
    "Bliss it was that dawn to be alive, to be young and free was very heaven. Sadly, it was not to last 10 years! But in the full first blush of self-governance, the Dominion of Ceylon was demonstrably \u201cthis other Eden, demi-paradise\u201d.",
    "Is there anyone alive today, who can remember that heady feeling? Or more importantly, guide our destiny to profit from such a gift again?",
    "That we were debt-free and determined to fulfil the potential of becoming a model Crown Colony \u2013 the envy of Singapore \u2013 made our new democracy a toast of the Commonwealth town.",
    "Now we remember (those of us who do or can) those halcyon days with nostalgia-fuelled bittersweet tears.",
    "It was an under-represented democracy at best, however, for a polity that was granted universal adult franchise in 1931 while more \u2018advanced civilisations\u2019 withheld the grant.",
    "The elite dominated the upper echelons of state, as well as administrative and civil service ranks: a legacy of colonialism.",
    "These constituted the shackles and trappings, from which the landed gentry who ruled the land did not desire manumission \u2013 either for themselves as the lords of all they surveyed after 443 years of bending the knee under the yoke of imperial mercantilism, or for others who continued in neo-feudal servitude.",
    "Most memorable: being an island in the sun in a postwar Commonwealth straddling fading Empire",
    "There was a serpent in our socio-politically tiered Garden of Eden. No democratically-elected government has forgotten to deploy that venomous creature in the pursuit of its own ends for 75 years.",
    "That is the serpentine slithery-ness of ethno-nationalism, ethnic exceptionalism and party-political particularism, whereby a majoritarian ethic was propagated and perpetuated.",
    "And that it undermines the general well-being of the polity didn\u2019t seem to bother the elites \u2013 in the UNP as much as the SLFP \u2013 too much.",
    "Do you remember that even back then, the UNP \u2013 originator of the \u2018Sinhala Only\u2019 policy courtesy JR in the House in 1944, to the consternation of its initial egalitarian ethos (\u2018freedom from the fetters of imperialism\u2019 was one of its founding tenets) \u2013 was not very much different from the SLFP, with its eventual Official Languages Act of 1956?",
    "An era in which coalition politics reached its zenith \u2013 or nadir, depending on whether you won or lost the hotly-contested elections of the time.",
    "It was also a recipe for executive overreach and the responsorial rescinding of the civil rights of socialist matriarchs.",
    "As well as the emergence of presidentialism following the new republic\u2019s only referendum to date \u2013 under an autocrat at home, and a democrat abroad: JR, whose Caesarism inspired a slew of successors to the most abused political office in the land \u2013 there were the countervailing moves towards political balance between the Old Left and the New Right Wing.",
    "Do you remember the division, separation and balance of powers? (2 out of 3 is a pass-mark!)",
    "Not satisfied with making a shambles of newly-independent democratic status as Ceylon, the erstwhile Commonwealth flag-bearer, our coalescing nation went on to become the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.",
    "But despite its feeble attempt at fancy nomenclature, civic life was",
    "only nominally socialist, given the then administration\u2019s determination to experiment with free-market economics;",
    "and slowly but surely transforming from a republic once defined by values into a regime now driven by adventurers.",
    "Most memorable: Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project showcases \u2018Growth, Development, Progress,\u2019 as the new GDP",
    "Into the milieu of dynastic elites, inroads were made in the name of elevating the status and security of the lower common denominators.",
    "\u201cAbout time,\u201d sighed the hoi polloi in their respective vernaculars, while the vulgar \u2013 and violently armed \u2013 mobs breathed fury...",
    "In the south, at emerging statism in policymaking, for all its social democratic lip-service; in the north, at authoritarianism and a refusal (despite that friendly neighbourhood army of occupation to help us make up our minds) to bow the knee to devolution!",
    "Caught, between a rock and a hard place, the tyrant state responded with an iron fist... ironically, referred to as the \u2018welfare state\u2019 \u2013 although \u2018warfare state\u2019 suits it better; for those who remember the era of bombs in buses and trains, assassinations at political rallies and failed putsches in a deeply-divided parliament.",
    "Sea-change: a power shift from elitism in national leadership to open socio-economics",
    "Most memorable: the Democratic Social Republic beginning to earn its social democrat stripes",
    "A new hope for cooperation between the major party-blocs in a nominally bipartisan electorate was sabotaged by a deadly cocktail of one-upmanship.",
    "There was also a clash of egos as much as ideologies, and the souring of a political marriage of convenience.",
    "Which \u2013 perhaps for a first time since independence \u2013 harboured a chance for \u2018peace with justice\u2019 among the island\u2019s melting-pot of castes, creeds, communities and contesting ideologies.",
    "Most memorable: Ranil and Chandrika showing how it takes two to tango, tangle and come untangled",
    "Tolling the death-knell for genuinely bipartisan politics, came that man and his machine which had swept everything in its path from Medamulana to Mullaitivu (politically), and from Kataragama to Kilinochchi (religiously).",
    "The dynastic political movement that was the Rajapaksa regime proved a heady mix of majoritarianism, paternalism, patronage politics and emergent ethno-nationalism that would set the nation ablaze in the next decade.",
    "A cardinal opportunity to shape a sincerely inclusive and pluralist society that eschewed petty, party-political and narrowly partisan governance was lost.",
    "It was when demonstrably the most popular leader to emerge since independence chose, cynically, to define \u2013 and divide \u2013 a nation along ethnic, cultural, linguistic and \u2018loyalty-to-race-and-religion\u2019 lines... again.",
    "What price populism, O \u2018Father of a Nation\u2019, and at what costs? (\u2018Mathakada?\u2019 \u2018Daeng saepada?\u2019)",
    "Most memorable: \u2018There are no races, only those who love the country\u2019",
    "Ambition to rule \u2013 note: not govern, or administer; but utterly dominate a cowed and suitably impressed polity \u2013 led the Master of the Realm (MR) to make a false move.",
    "Early polls opened up the electorate to a rare (and later, as it came to be recognised, maleficent) conjunction of political stars.",
    "The planetary alignment of the UNFGG and an SLFP-breakaway brought a mixed bag of results \u2013 from the good (democratic institutions, checks and balances, law and order safeguards); to the bad (cronyism/nepotism \u00e0 la \u2018the old boys\u2019 network\u2019); and the ugly (white-collar crime, insidious coups).",
    "Who remembers defending the democratic rights of a poor ousted prime minister now? How has his ethos changed from then?",
    "Most memorable: Hora Deal \u2013 by almost all card trick players, from kings to knaves to jokers in the pack",
    "Widespread frustration with wasted opportunities to restore faith in so-called \u2018good governance\u2019 \u2013 fuelled by the administrative and security disasters of the Easter Sunday bombings \u2013 led to an unprecedented majority of the electorate placing their faith in a supposedly efficient and technocratic candidate.",
    "Emergence of elitism (vide. Viyathmaga, and that brand of favouring hand-picked professionals and academics for top governmental jobs) and growing militarisation of state institutions paved the road \u2013 with not-so-good intentions and worse policy decisions.",
    "Fertiliser fiasco, disastrous fiscal policies leading to defaulting on sovereign debt repayments due first, then bankruptcy being declared \u2013 these among other push-and-pull factors led to the Aragalaya, and people\u2019s sovereignty \u2018voting with their feet\u2019.",
    "Where were you when the people stormed the palace? Remember, remember, the 9th of July...",
    "Most memorable: \u2018I am the law\u2019; \u2018I am the state\u2019; \u2018After me, the deluge\u2019",
    "Despite what was smuggled past a strongly united nation as being \u2018regime change\u2019, the policies of the government \u2013 and the ranks of the legislature at least \u2013 remained the same...",
    "This entrenched the status quo and consolidated the consociational democracy that favours elites, serves high-powered vested interests, socialises losses to state coffers, privatises profits for big business, and forfeits safeguards for the marginalised.",
    "Sea-change: from constitutionalism to the exercise of popular sovereignty in the absence of right-of-recall"
