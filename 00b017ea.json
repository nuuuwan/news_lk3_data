  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Road Development Authority (RDA) has informed the street food vendors at Kimbulawala to remove their stalls and vacate the location by Friday (Dec. 08), according to the vendors.",
    "The Kimbulawala street food vendors further stress that although a written notification has been given in this regard, the reason for the decision to vacate the area has not been specified.",
    "Earlier in August, the RDA had asked the Kimbulawala street food vendors to remove their stalls within a period of 14 days, citing that the stalls had been built without permission, in a way that obstructs vehicular movement on the roads.",
    "The RDA further emphasized that the decision was arrived at in consideration of the increasing number of complaints received daily, expressing concerns about road accidents that have occurred in the area as a result of these mobile street food establishments.",
    "Previously, the Urban Development Authority had decided to remove these stalls, but later gave permission to continue to run their businesses after an agreement was reached between the food stall venders and the relevant authorities.",
    "At the time, the venders had agreed to move the stalls slightly back from the main road, but some of the stalls are still blocking the road, as per previous statements made by the RDA.",
    "Against this backdrop, the Public Health Inspectors (PHIs), who carried out inspections in the street food stalls established in Kottawa and Thalawathugoda areas last week, had taken legal action against 14 food stalls, while 06 other stalls were warned over selling unhealthy food that were unfit for human consumption."
