  "original_body_lines": [
    "The present government is revoking the privileges of former presidents out of a sense of revenge rather than real policy, according to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "The former President made this statement in response to a question posed by journalists after attending an event held in Colombo.",
    "\u201cThe greatest privilege we had was what the people gave us. As long as that exists, there\u2019s no issue if any official privilege is taken away.\u201d",
    "When asked about his preferred choice, former President Rajapaksa said he will pick Medamulana over Wijerama any day.",
    "On July 31, the Presidents\u2019 Entitlements (Repeal) Bill was gazetted.",
    "The Bill has been drafted to revoke special privileges extended to former Presidents and their widows.",
    "Last month, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to draft legislation aimed at repealing the Presidents\u2019 Entitlements Act No. 4 of 1986 and the Parliamentary Pensions Law No. 1 of 1977, effectively ending special privileges extended to former Presidents, their widows and former MPs.",
    "Meanwhile, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the government is responsible not only for the safety and security of former presidents but also for the general public, in response to questions raised in relation to the move by the present administration to remove the entitlements of former Presidents and their family members.",
    "Responding to an inquiry made on whether the government would continue to ensure the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Dr. Jayatissa assured that necessary steps will be taken based on intelligence and security reports.",
    "Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said, \u201cIn this matter, no one has been given special treatment. A general decision was made concerning all former presidents and their spouses. The government has a responsibility not only towards former presidents but also to ensure the safety of all citizens. This is a topic that is regularly discussed at the National Security Council (NSC). Intelligence and security reports are taken into consideration. Our decisions are based on a thorough review of such reports regarding the security of former Presidents. Additionally, there is a court ruling pertaining to the security of the former president. Taking all of this into account we are implementing this.\u201d"
