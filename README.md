Sri Lanka’s banks were hit by bad loans from Coronavirus pandemic and the currency crisis and default.  Banks also had to provide for sovereign bond restructuring, though they were spared of rupee bond restructuring. As a result bond yields are now falling.

“That said, revenue is perhaps the main concern in Sri Lanka.” – IMF Official at the latest staff level meeting with the Government of Sri Lanka

The IMF’s explanation of Sri Lanka’s recent foreign exchange crisis is fiscal and monetary mismanagement; fiscal excesses funded by Central Bank printing. The solution proposed by the IMF is to reduce the budget deficit (‘fiscal consolidation’) and prevent the Central Bank from printing money to finance it. Particular emphasis is placed on the attainment of a primary budget surplus – Government revenue minus expenditure less interest and amortisation payments, and particular emphasis in respect of the attainment of this primary surplus is placed on increasing taxes. The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) is quoted by the IMF (2023) as committing itself to,

### Sustainability neglect may stunt tourism growth in  Sri Lanka: Intrepid Travel Chief

A global leader in responsible tourism raised concerns on lack of focus on sustainability in the tourism sector, which in turn could impede the current growth momentum in the medium term.

Intrepid Travel Chairman and Co-Founder Darrell Wade, who was recently in Sri Lanka, said the current status of the tourism industry, in terms of sustainability, is worrisome, primarily because of the drive for growth.

“We understand that it’s good for the economy, jobs, balance of payments, all sort of things. But if the growth is too fast and doesn’t factor sustainability, then that’s a major problem. We haven’t seen enough attention on sustainability (in Sri Lanka),” Wade told Mirror Business during his recent visit to Sri Lanka.

Although Sri Lanka may sustain the current growth momentum for the next two to three years, he expressed concern that it would not be sustainable beyond four to six years, if sustainability is not factored into the tourism strategy now.

### Hopes of peace dashed as confused US faces dogged Netanyahu

*2024-04-04 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Hopes-of-peace-dashed-as-confused-US-faces-dogged-Netanyahu/172-280126) · `en`

With public opinion that is increasingly supporting a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, in March, both US President Biden and his Republican challenger Trump appeared to be toeing a softer line on Gaza

A survey done in February found that around two-thirds of voters supported the US calling for a permanent ceasefire and a de-escalation of violence in Gaza

The US is blowing hot and cold on its policy on the Gaza war and is showing inconsistency in its actions. In contrast, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doggedly pursuing his uncompromising line on the war, disregarding rising opposition and even a revolt by the ultra-orthodox Jews in his homeland.

The net result of all this is that the prospects of peace in Gaza have receded further. And with Netanyahu bent on attacking Rafah, with a  huge population of locals and refugees from other parts of Gaza, more deaths and destruction are on the cards.

### World Health Day: ‘My Health, My Right’

Sri Lanka’s public health service is facing one of its worst crises since independence. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna government need to give much more priority to help the public health service recover; because as the cliché goes: “health is wealth”.

With public health trade unions staging regular strikes during the past two years, poor people have had to travel a long way to a public hospital only to be told that the nurses, attendants and other paramedical staff are on strike and that the people need to go back without treatment. The crisis involving former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella made the situation worse with the importation of substandard drugs from fictitious companies. The tragedy is that this is happening in the country which produced Prof. Senaka Bibile who was widely regarded as a prophet of modern medicine, and proposed a solution to the drug crisis.

Indian National Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge hit back at the Indian Prime Minister questioning why his party did not take back the island during its past ten years in power

The issue involving Kachchativu becomes a hot political debate in India when elections are around the corner

In the course of the debate, Indian Prime Minister Modi slammed DMK party saying that the new details emerging on the matter have “unmasked” the party’s double standards

It is quite common that the issue involving Kachchativu, a tiny island in the Palk Straits between India and Sri Lanka, becomes a hot political debate in India–particularly in the state of  Tamil Nadu–when elections are around the corner in that country.

This time around, ahead of Lok Sabha elections, it has been raised; and the debate heated after remarks by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi placing blame on the Indian opposition over the agreement that ceded the island to Sri Lanka.

### The intelligent public might not be interested in Kachchativu

At present people are intelligent and have different yardsticks to judge the capacity of potential candidates when the time comes for casting their votes at the elections

There was a time when the people of this island were in love with Sinhala-Buddhist leaders who sported a mustache. Now people are in love with the intellectual capacity of people

There is a school of thought that the clergy must also be represented in parliament. And so must be people involved in education, health sector, power and energy, agriculture and, very importantly, sports

It’s also interesting to see whether the Kachchativu issue, which is hot news and a burning issue at present, would provide an impetus for presidential hopefuls to gain some mileage out of it

### Zakath and tax: A comparative view

It is really amazing to note that the zakath system, which came into effect 14 centuries ago, is still compatible with the modern tax system

Zakath is the direct tax that Islam has imposed upon every Muslim who has annual net wealth exceeding a threshold. Income tax is also a direct tax that the Government imposes on every person who has an annual net income exceeding a threshold.

It is clearly evident from the definition that both zakath and tax have similarities as well as differences. The purpose of this study is to give the readers a comparative understanding of zakath and the tax system as the Muslims traditionally pay their zakath during this month of Ramazan, which is the ninth month of the Muslim (lunar/Hijri) calendar, which is 354 days while the Gregorian calendar is 365 days.

It is underlined here that the laws and practices were taken from the Sri Lankan context in authoring this article.

“The Royal College Primary, Nation’s premier Primary School, is flouting the Ministry’s clear instructions on refraining collecting funds from parents. It circumvents it by using Parent-Proxies and has been collecting massive amounts, suspected to be over a hundred millions of rupees each year,” Dissanayake has alleged.

The author of this letter Lorenz Pereira with Ranil Wickremesinghe during Royal College’s 125th anniversary

I applaud the ex-Principal of Royal College R.M.M. Rathnayake for his subject article (https://island.lk/a-former-royal-college-principal-defends-maintenance-of-secular-values-in-the-school/) that partly contributes to us old Royalists becoming aware of current “happenings” at Royal. I believe that I can confidently assume that Rathnayake is a devout and respected Buddhist and an educationist and Principal par excellence.

As such he has the credentials to be seriously considered. On the other hand, I being so remote from the scene am really not in a position to be ultra-judgemental.

I strongly believe that these issues of concern must be brought to the notice of old Royalists. It is then up to each one of us to make our own judgements and respond accordingly, if need be.

For the continued betterment of Royal, they can no longer be swept under the carpet.

The spirit of the Sutta signifies a teaching that is exempt from fanaticism, bigotry, dogmatism, and intolerance. Any attempt at deviating from the secularism that has been practiced for quite some time at our alma mater would only lead to the downfall of this hallowed institution.
