    "A British parliamentary committee has accused former Prime Minister Boris Johnson of repeated contempt of Parliament for deliberately misleading MPs about violations of COVID-19 restrictions by him and his staff.",
    "In a 106-page report released on Thursday, the House of Commons Privileges Committee offered a blistering account of how Mr. Johnson misled Parliament in relation to six social gatherings in his office during lockdown restrictions in 2020 and 2021, and how he was \u201ccomplicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe came to the view that some of Mr. Johnson\u2019s denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the committee and the House, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor these reasons we conclude that Mr. Johnson\u2019s conduct was deliberate and that he has committed a serious contempt of the House.\u201d",
    "The committee added that there was \u201cno precedent for a Prime Minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House.\u201d",
    "The report concludes a tumultuous year for Mr. Johnson, and it will likely reopen deep divisions within the Conservative Party.",
    "Mr. Johnson was forced out as party leader and prime minister last summer in part because of the controversy over \u201cpartygate.\u201d He has also made no secret of his dislike for Rishi Sunak, who took over as leader and Prime Minister last October. Mr. Johnson has blamed Mr. Sunak for leading the push against him and the two have clashed recently over Mr. Johnson\u2019s bid to appoint several former aids and supporters to the House of Lords.",
    "In a final flourish, Mr. Johnson abruptly resigned as an MP last week in an attempt to pre-empt the committee\u2019s findings. He issued a scathing indictment of the committee\u2019s work, calling it a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
    "The committee said Thursday that had he not stepped down, it would have recommended his suspension from Parliament for 90 days, one of the longest sanctions on record. The suspension would have also triggered a by-election in his riding.",
    "The committee further recommended that Mr. Johnson should not be entitled to a former MP\u2019s pass to Westminster, which would have given him unfettered access to Parliament.",
    "All seven committee members \u2014 four Conservative MPs, two Labour MPs and one Scottish National Party MP \u2014 signed the report which has been referred to the House of Commons. A free vote of MPs will be held Monday on whether to approve the report\u2019s findings and proposed sanctions.",
    "\u201cIt will be a painful process and a sad process for all of us, the task that we face on Monday,\u201d said Penny Mordaunt, the government leader in the House of Commons. \u201cBut all of us must do what we think is right and others must leave us alone to do so.\u201d",
    "The committee had been investigating Mr. Johnson for 14 months over statements he made in Parliament about parties in Downing Street during the height of the pandemic when the country was under tight rules restricting social contact. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police issued 126 fines \u2013 known as fixed penalty notices \u2013 to 83 government staff for breaches of lockdown rules. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Sunak, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, each paid one \u00a350 penalty.",
    "Mr. Johnson told the House of Commons and the committee that no rules had been broken and that the gatherings \u2013 which included a birthday party and several farewell events for resigning staffers \u2013 were work-related functions.",
    "He enraged committee members last week after he was given an early copy of the report on a confidential basis. He immediately went public with the findings, lashed out at the committee, and announced his resignation.",
    "In its report on Thursday, the committee said Mr. Johnson\u2019s actions amounted to further contempt. The former prime minister didn\u2019t merely criticize the fairness of the committee\u2019s procedures, the report said, \u201che also attacks in very strong, indeed vitriolic, terms the integrity, honesty and honour of its members. This attack on a committee carrying out its remit from the democratically elected House itself amounts to an attack on our democratic institutions.\u201d",
    "In a lengthy rebuttal, Mr. Johnson shot back at the committee on Thursday and called the report \u201crubbish,\u201d \u201cderanged,\u201d \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and \u201ca load of complete tripe.\u201d He reiterated that the events were work-related and within the COVID-19 regulations in place at the time.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe that what we were doing was wrong, and after a year of work, the Privileges Committee has found not a shred of evidence that we did,\u201d he said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThis is a dreadful day for MPs and for democracy,\u201d Mr. Johnson added. \u201cThis decision means that no MP is free from vendetta, or expulsion on trumped up charges by a tiny minority who want to see him or her gone from the Commons.\u201d",
    "A handful of Tory MPs came to Mr. Johnson\u2019s defense on Thursday and said they would not support the sanctions. \u201cI am appalled at what I have read and the spiteful, vindictive and overreaching conclusions of the report,\u201d said Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith.",
    "But others said it was time for the party to move on. \u201cThe longer this public pantomime drags on, the more Boris loses support from a once very loyal base,\u201d said Tory MP Tobias Ellwood. \u201cHe was loved by members across the country but this is changing before our very eyes. There\u2019s now disappointment, even anger that the party, the activists are left to pick up the pieces.\u201d"
