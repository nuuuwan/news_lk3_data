    "The Sri Lanka Country Update provides an overview of the current religious freedom conditions in Sri Lanka and key observations from USCIRF\u2019s 2023 delegation to the country, such as religiously motivated land disputes, registration challenges, and the use of discriminatory legislation to target and detain religious minorities. It includes a summary of proposed amendments to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the Anti-Terrorism Act, the Online Safety Bill, and the enforcement of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act.",
