  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court today (01) granted leave to proceed with a fundamental rights petition filed against former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, several former cabinet ministers, and other respondents.",
    "The petition alleges that during the tenure of the previous government, stocks of phosphate from the Eppawala deposit were released for export at prices significantly lower than the standard market rate to several companies allegedly linked to those in power, thereby violating fundamental human rights.",
    "A total of 32 respondents including former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, former Cabinet Ministers, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), the Director General of the GSMB and the Attorney General have been named in the petition.",
    "The petition was considered today before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices Janak de Silva, Priyantha Fernando, and Sampath Abeykoon.",
    "Dr. Ravindranath Dabare, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, told court that the Lanka Phosphate Company had acquired phosphate stocks in violation of a 2000 Supreme Court directive relating to the Eppawala phosphate deposit.",
    "He further alleged that phosphate stocks were sold for export at prices significantly below the global market price per metric ton to a number of companies with close ties to those in power.",
    "According to him, this resulted in substantial financial losses to both the state and the public.",
    "He also revealed that former State Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, who was in charge of the subject at the time, had exerted pressure on the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and other state institutions to issue the necessary permits for the release of the phosphate.",
    "After considering the submissions, the Supreme Court bench scheduled the petition to be taken up for hearing on March 9."
