    "Reveals over 27,000 cases of missing persons considered by past commissions of inquiry",
    "OMP has received over 21,000 complaints relating to missing persons",

    "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) submitted its Parallel Report to the United",
    "Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearance ahead of the Committee\u2019s 29th session to be held from 22 September to 3 October.",
    "At this session, the Committee is scheduled to review Sri Lanka\u2019s fulfilment of obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (\u2018Convention\u2019). The HRCSL\u2019s 25-page report contained several key observations and recommendations on Sri Lanka\u2019s implementation of the Convention.",
    "The HRCSL recalled that enforced disappearance of a person amounts to a gross violation of human rights. The phenomenon has taken place in all parts of Sri Lanka and has impacted all communities, particularly in the context of insurrections in the South and the armed conflict in the North and East. The HRCSL also recognised the important efforts of families, activists, and civil society representatives in continuously calling for truth and accountability for enforced disappearance over many years. It specifically recognised that, despite economic challenges and care responsibilities, and having to deal with threats and intimidation, women have led efforts to organise to raise awareness and to advocate for truth and accountability with respect to enforced disappearance in Sri Lanka.",
    "The HRCSL\u2019s report detailed past and recent interventions of the HRCSL with respect to investigating enforced disappearance, monitoring places of deprivation of liberty, engaging state authorities and other institutions including the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), advocating for policy reform, and protecting and promoting the rights of families of the disappeared and civil society representatives. The report recalled the past findings of the HRCSL during special investigations and inquiries conducted in 2003, 2006, and 2012. It also presented the facts concerning the recent alleged enforced disappearance of Gonapinuwala Kapila Kumara De Silva in 2024, and its recommendations with respect to this case. Additionally, the report highlighted the challenges faced by families of the disappeared and civil society representatives, including threats and intimidation from state officials and limited progress in court proceedings.",
    "Relying on official statistics released by the Sri Lankan state in the past, the HRCSL\u2019s report recalled the fact that over 27,000 cases of missing persons were considered by past commissions of inquiry, and that the OMP has received over 21,000 complaints relating to missing persons. The report also cited the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s findings with respect to over 1,000 incidents of disappearances of persons after such persons had surrendered to security forces on 17 and 18 May 2009.",
    "The HRCSL\u2019s report specifically highlighted the problem of impunity in Sri Lanka. It cited official data from the early 2000s where the identification of perpetrators in over 1,600 cases and the institution of over 300 cases in the High Court ultimately led to only twelve convictions.",
    "The HRCSL\u2019s report presented a detailed appraisal of Sri Lanka\u2019s implementation of articles 1-25 of the Convention. It specifically examined the provisions of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, No. 5 of 2018 (\u2018Enforced Disappearance Act\u2019), which incorporates the provisions of the Convention into domestic law and prohibits enforced disappearance in Sri Lanka. The report also details the recent performance of the OMP and the Office for Reparations.",

    "c) Introduce necessary legislative reform to ensure that habeas corpus cases and cases under the Enforced Disappearance Act before the High Court are prioritised to enable their expeditious conclusion;",
    "d) Include \u2018widespread and systematic enforced disappearance\u2019 as a specific offence under the Enforced Disappearance Act;",

    "f) Formulate compensation guidelines for pecuniary, non-pecuniary, and exemplary damages for victims of enforced disappearance drawing from international standards;",
