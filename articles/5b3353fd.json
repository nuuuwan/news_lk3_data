    "It was 65 years ago on June 29, 1959, that a batch of 378 students from all parts of Ceylon entered the portals of the world\u2019s most beautiful campus of the time of the then University of Ceylon situated on a spectacular site in Peradeniya, just four miles from the historic city of Kandy. We had passed the University Entrance examination conducted by the university itself, to read for our different degrees in Arts, Oriental Languages, English, Law etc.",
    "Our batch of 1959 was special for two reasons. We were the last totally English medium batch to enter the university and the first where all students were admitted directly without a viva voce or interview. Previously, the students were selected both directly and some after facing a viva voce.",
    "Though 65 years have passed, we have not forgotten the wonderful experience we had during the three or four years we spent on that beautiful campus. It is sad that many of our batch mates are no longer alive to recall the glorious time we had as residential undergraduates.",
    "Those who entered Peradeniya before us and our own batch will remember we belonged to the University of Ceylon, the country\u2019s only university of the time established by the Ordinance No. 20 of 1942 and situated in Colombo. It was in the early 1950s that a campus of the University of Ceylon was established in Peradeniya.",
    "The single university continued until 1959 when two other universities, Vidyodaya (now the University of Sri Jayewardenepura) and the Vidyalankara Universities (now University of Kelaniya) were established by the Vidyodaya University and Vidyalankara University Act No. 45 of 1958.These two universities were created by upgrading the two famous Pirivenas that were then functioning.",
    "That time we spent at Peradeniya was one of the most unforgettable periods of our lives. The friendships that we cultivated will never be erased from our minds. It would interest those who followed us much later to read for their degrees how the undergraduates were selected in our day.. We sat the University Entrance examination which was conducted by the University of Ceylon at four centers, Colombo, Kandy, Jaffna and Galle with the Department of Examinations having nothing to do with it. Thank Goodness!",
    "However, if any candidate wanted to obtain the Higher School Certificate (HSC) he/she had to sit the extra paper at the same examination and if successful received the HSC certificate from the Department of Education. The results of the examination were not sent either to the schools or the candidates\u2019 homes. They were published in the daily newspapers. As such, our results appeared in the The Ceylon Daily News of Wednesday March 11, 1959.",
    "Thereafter, after the lapse of a period of time, the successful candidates received letters from the university informing them of the date of commencement of sessions of the academic year, the hall of residence allotted to them and the date to report to the hall.",
    "There was also a leaflet indicating what we had to bring with us such as a raincoat and cape, etc. and the things that we should not do. One such requirement was that ceiling walking was prohibited. This was a little puzzling to us, but we understood what it meant later on when we were on campus.",
    "All undergraduates who were privileged to enter Peradeniya at the commencement of the campus had the best of time in a university in Sri Lanka. All undergraduates then lived in the halls of residence throughout their university career even if their homes adjoined the campus.. Many of those who entered from schools in and around Kandy could have easily travelled from home. But the university rules did not permit that. This was to our advantage. Living on campus was an unforgettable experience,",
    "During our time in Peradeniya the halls of residence for men were Arunachalam, Jayatilaka, Marrs, Ramanathan and Marcus Fernando. The women lived in James Peiris, Sangamitta and Hilda Obeysekera Halls. During our final year in 1961-62 (third year in the case of those who had opted to do a special degree), a new hall named after DR Wijewardena was opened close to the Kandy-Colombo railway line.",
    "With this building being opened, there was a change in respect of occupation of some halls. Ramanathan was converted into a women\u2019s hall and James Peiris was made a hall for men. The newly opened Wijewardena Hall too became a men\u2019s hall. With this change, the male undergraduates who were in Ramanathan Hall were transferred to James Peiris and Wijewardena Halls.",
    "Situated between the Hantana Hill on one side and the Mahaweli River on the other, the location of the campus was spectacular. The landscaping was meticulous done and aesthetically pleasing. When the flowering trees were in bloom along the Galaha Road and the creepers laden with yellow flowers hanging down from the mara tree at the \u201ckissing bend,\u201d it was a sight to behold.",
    "Having entered the portals of the hallowed university which was \u201cmore open than usual\u201d according to the late Duke of Edinburgh who declared the buildings open in April 1954 as indicated by a plaque at the entrance to the Senate building (the Duke may have said this as the campus was already functioning), the new entrants settled down in their allotted rooms and got to know their roommates whom some were meeting for the first time as they came from different schools. Some undergraduates were lucky to get classmates from secondary school as their roommates in the halls. All the freshers arrived in their respective halls before lunch time on the first day using trains, buses, hiring cars and private family vehicles.",
    "Meal times were announced by a bell being rung by a hall servant. We met all the freshers who were our hall mates in the dining hall for the first time that day. For one week only the freshers were on campus and was had a wonderful time before the seniors arrived. We mixed with out batch-mates, playing various sports, hiking up Hantana and attending socials.",
    "All freshers dreaded the following week when the seniors arrived. However, we found that the rag was not as bad as anticipated. In our hall it was only a handful of seniors who were allowed to rag. The reason for this, we later found, was that the batch immediately before ours had not been ragged, and if one does not face a rag, one cannot rag. Anyway, the rag that we underwent was not at all humiliating or frightening as what happens in universities at present. In fact, we enjoyed the rag, and it also helped us to get to know the seniors and become friends for the rest of our stay on the campus.",
    "We, as undergraduates were very fortunate to have two to share a room. In the two older halls, Arunachalam and Jayatilaka. we had a washbasin inside the room so that the occupants did not have to go to the common bathrooms for their early morning ablutions such as shaving and washing their faces. We were also fortunate to have all three meals in the hall.",
    "For breakfast we were served different menus such as bread with eggs, pulses, milk rice, hoppers, etc. Lunch was always rice and curry which was not plated but served in dishes for self-service. These dishes were replenished as soon as they were empty. Whereas, for dinner we had courses, and rice and curry once a week. At that time all provisions, including dry rations, eggs and chicken were imported from India through the University Supplies Division.",
    "Once a month we had a high table dinner, when someone from outside was invited to address the undergraduates on a current topic. At this dinner, the Warden and the Sub-Wardens, the President of the Hall Society and the Secretary occupied seats at the high table along with the invited guest.",
    "The undergraduates of one hall could go to another hall by prior arrangement with friends to have dinner in that hall, which a few of us used to do on a day when there was rice and curry for dinner.",
    "The university had medical facilities with a Health Centre with three doctors, Dr. Wijetunge as the Chief Medical Officer, and Dr. Uduwela as a full-time Medical Officer(MO) and Dr. (Mrs.) Ram Aluvihare as a part-time MO (as she was the Warden of Sangamitta Hall). There were two nurses and two attendants for the male and female wards. Believe it or not, these facilities were available for the undergraduates for a paltry sum of Rs. 10 for the year!",
    "Every week the dhoby (we used to call him \u201cWashington\u201d) used to come in his Morris Minor car bringing the laundered clothes and to take the soiled linen. He used to visit the campus almost every day as he had to serve all the halls of residence. And here again we were charged Rs. 10 for the whole year for this luxury!",
    "The sports facilities available were unbeatable. The sports arena extended from the Galaha Road (which ran through the campus) down to the railway line near the Sarasavi Uyana station. The tennis courts and the volleyball court abutted the Galaha Road. We also had an athletics field with a cinder track (may have been the only one in Sri Lanka at that time) which adjoined the hockey field. Beyond that on a lower level was the circular cricket ground and at the far end the soccer and rugby playing field.",
    "In addition to these outdoor playing areas, there was a huge gymnasium for all indoor games such as basketball, netball, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton. There was also a billiard table. During our time all these facilities were very well used. It is a pity to hear that most of those who have graduated recently from that university have not participated in any sports activities at all.",
    "The Peradeniya hockey team in our final year won the Inter-Club hockey tournament conducted by the Kandy District Hockey Association undefeated. This was the first time the university had won this championship. It was only after a lapse of a decade or so that this feat was accomplished by the university again. It was also during that year that four players from the Peradeniya hockey team were selected to participate as members of the University of Ceylon team in the All-India inter University Hockey tournament which was conducted in Ahamedabad in Uttar Pradesh. The team spent about a month playing matches in Ahamedabad, Mumbai and Pune, having travelled by ship both ways.",
    "While on the subject of sports, I would like to mention one cricket match we played against a leading school in Kandy from which there were three coloursmen (all three in our batch) in the university team. When we won the toss, some of our teammates had got hold of a car and gone to the town. When they came back, we had been dismissed for a humiliating 37 runs! However, we were able to stave off defeat and return to the campus though not very happily.",
    "Almost all sports in Peradeniya were administered by the undergrads themselves. The captain of a team was responsible for arranging all matches, transporting teams if the matches were played away from the campus, providing meals if required, and conducting the practices.",
    "The captain had to obtain the money from the Director of Physical Education (DPE) for the expenses. On completion of the match, he/she had to submit the balance to the DPE with the receipts of payments made. At present all these are handled by the Instructors of Physical Education (IPE) in charge of the respective sport. There are coaches from outside to train the undergraduates in their sport.",
    "The captains and the vice-captains formed the Sports Council, and the office bearers were elected by them. All matters pertaining to sports were handled by the Sports Council, which included the election of the captains and vice captains, conducting the Colours Nite and Colours dance. A number of our batch-mates were captains and vice-captains of various sports.",
    "They were- Athletics-Captain N. Puvimanasinghe, Badminton- Captain N De Silva, Cricket-Captain M Kurukulasooriya, Vice-captain A Rambukpotha, Football Vice-captain GS Hidelarachchi, Netball- Captain Miss Ranee Saverimuttu, Hockey- Captain N Warakaulle, Vice-captain SB Ekanayake, Swimming Captain A Muttucumaraswamy, Volleyball Captain AB Wijepala, Wrestling Vice Captain PA Senaratne. Many our batch-mates were awarded university colours in the various sports.",
    "The university was not devoid of cultural activities. There were dramas staged in the open air theatre (now referred to as the wala) below Hilda Obeyekera Hall where the actors were all undergraduates. The charge to watch a play was 50 cents. There were weekly film shows in the Arts Theatre and some reputed films were screened for the benefit of the undergraduates. The cost of a ticket for a film show was also 50 cents. In addition to the dramas and films, we also had debates, in English and Sinhala. These were between two teams of undergraduates or between two teams of teachers. These are rare or not heard of now as no one is interested in this type of activity.",
    "Politics in the campus at that time was a different kettle of fish to what prevails today. It was only the male undergraduates who were involved in politics, some to the extent of failing their final examination and earning the prefix \u201cpol\u201d to their names. The students who were interested joined one of three groups available at that time. They were the LSSP aligned group who were called Trotskyites, the MEP group and the Communist group, referred to as \u201cCommies\u201d. Many undergraduates joined a group because their friends were there and not that they were really interested in politics. In our final year, the Demsoc group was formed, which was aligned to the UNP.",
    "One can imagine how things can change when we found that some ardent Trotskyites held important positions in the then UNP government and the pioneers of the Demsoc group joining an SLFP government.",
    "Annual elections for the positions in the Student Union were very interesting depending on candidates pitted against each other. Our batch had the best contested election for the top post of President when Ille and Nihal ran for it in the second term of the 1961-62 academic year. A few of our batch mates were elected to the posts of President and Vice President (VP). They were: TAL Fernando as VP in the first term in 1960-61, Sirimega Wijeratne as President and Kamini Wickramasinghe as VP in the second term of that year; Mohan Edirisooriya as President in the first term of 1961-62, P Illayperuma as President and Piyaseeli Samaranayake as VP in the second term and Jackson Karunasekera as President in third term of that year.",
    "The election of the office bearers of the Student Union was conducted after the elections to the Hall Societies. At the end of the election of office bearers of the Student Union, they were invited by the Vice-Chancellor to tea at the Lodge. This was the only chance an undergraduate had of visiting the Lodge.",
    "The most noteworthy things to mention were that the undergraduates never pasted any posters nor drew any graffiti on the walls when there were protests unlike what happens at present. One exception was during the protest march to Kandy when Patrice Lumumba was assassinated.",
    "The men undergraduates wore long trousers and shirt with shoes to attend lectures and the women were dressed in either saree or dress. It was a pleasant sight during the day when the ladies went to for lectures and back to their halls of residence as they were colourfully dressed and almost all had bright coloured umbrellas against th sun. It was a a colourful parasol parade along the Galaha Road.",
    "The four-storied Library was just opened when we entered and was the best in Sri Lanka at that time. Many undergraduates made use of the facilities, some even after dinner as the library was open till 8.00pm. There were some who stayed on during the vacations to do their reading in the library.",
    "There were seven First Classes in our batch. After graduation a large number held very important positions, both in the public and the private sectors. Of those who did Law, there was a Judge of the Supreme Court, and two in the Court of Appeal, and a few eminent lawyers in the private Bar. A fair number joined the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and ended up as Secretaries of Ministries whilst one was the Secretary to the Prime Minister.",
    "We had four ambassadors, three from within the Foreign Service and one from outside. The other important positions held were Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue, Controller of Immigration and Emigration, Chairmen of Corporations, Chairman of a State Bank, and Principals of schools (both government and private), Professors of Universities (both local and foreign), Deans of Faculties, Chancellor of a University and Senior Deputy Inspectors-General of police and a Registrar of a University. A large number emigrated to seek greener pastures and did well in the countries they were domiciled in.",
    "These were indeed the glory days of the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya and we had the privilege of enjoying it. It is very doubtful that undergraduates in Sri Lankan universities at present or in the future will ever get the opportunity to enjoy university life as we did. Those three or four years of luxury, so to speak, spent in the salubrious surroundings at Peradeniya and the friendships cultivated there will always remain with us.",
