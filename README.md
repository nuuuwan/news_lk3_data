### Arugam Bay; hidden currents

*2024-11-25 01:05:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Arugam-Bay-hidden-currents/4-769617) · `en`

There has been growing public concern over the recent weeks, about happenings in Arugam Bay (AB). This analysis adds to the discourse.

Democratic states are obliged to protect all people within its borders, whether citizens or non-citizens. Non-citizens include tourists on short stays, subject to the law of the land they visit.

Informed sources report that Jewish places of prayer have been set up for Israeli tourists in AB. Though few would object to people at prayer, this raises a concern. Why would tourists on short stays want this, when they can pray in their rooms?

A likely answer links two possibilities. Some of these tourists are here to stay longer and have been permitted to do so. And, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the construction or designation of a Jewish place of prayer for Israelis. The stringent regulations governing the establishment of new places of prayer or worship for our own citizens, makes this favour even more puzzling.

AKD, in his President’s address, disproved his critics. However, after the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, it is the economy stupid that is going to loom over Sri Lanka making it AKD’s biggest challenge

*2024-11-24 20:55:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199587) · `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Rajitha Senaratne accuses Ranil Wickremesinghe of appointing a committee to investigate Ravi Karunanayake's appointment to the National List seat. Wickremesinghe denies knowledge of the affair, contradicting Karunanayake's claim. The New Democratic Front is considering candidates for the remaining National List seat, with Kanjana Wijesekera being a top choice. The SLFP has also requested a National List member, causing a delay in the final decision.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe could not know the affair sent to Ravi Karunanayake's name to the National List. Former parliamentarian Rajitha Senaratne said that Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee to investigate her action.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the new Democratic Front office in Colombo on Sunday (24).

Two National List seats were available to the new Democratic Front in the parliamentary election. Ravi Karunanayake has taken one of them. None of the leading party members know about the affair he received. Ravi Karunanayake has said that Ranil Wickremesinghe had informed Wickremesinghe in advance regarding the matter.. If Ranil Wickremesinghe is aware of this, why should the committee be set up to investigate his action.

Ranil Wickremesinghe was the ongoing opposition to the issue. No one in the party is holding Ranil Wickremesinghe as a hostage. So can no one can hold him hostage. But Ranil Wickremesinghe can hold the hostage.
