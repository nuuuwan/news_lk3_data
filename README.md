NPP MP Nilanti Kothachi yesterday (21) said that the people have the right to believe in the truth or false.

Speaking at an event in Kalutara, he said that the people have the right to look at the adverse side of the government's good things and that the government will never prevent the democratic right.

"You have a full right to make any truth false and no false. That's your democratic right. You have the right to see the negative side when the government does something good. Moreover, you have the right to appreciate a leader, government, company or individual community when doing harmful actions, тАЭhe said.

### Ministry assures quality of MOP fertilizer donated by Russia

*2024-12-22 10:43:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104413/ministry-assures-quality-of-mop-fertilizer-donated-by-russia) ┬╖ `en`

The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands, and Irrigation has issued a statement assuring the quality of the Muriate of Potash (MOP) fertilizer stock donated by a Russian state-owned company.

The statement addresses concerns raised by farmers and farmer organizations regarding the color of the fertilizer.

After analyzing the composition of the imported stock and verifying other standards, it has been confirmed that the fertilizer meets the required quality standards.

The ministry explained that the color of the fertilizer is influenced by the mineral salts in the deposit. Specifically, the presence of iron oxide gives the fertilizer a red color, while its absence results in a white color. The variation in color does not affect the fertilizerтАЩs functionality and provide the same amount of potassium, it said.

This clarification is based on findings from soil scientist Renuka de Silva, whose report confirmed that the fertilizer is safe and effective for use.

### Two US Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent тАШfriendly fireтАЩ incident, US military says

*2024-12-22 08:58:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104408/two-us-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-apparent-friendly-fire-incident-us-military-says) ┬╖ `en`

Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent тАЬfriendly fireтАЭ incident, the U.S military said.

Both pilots were recovered alive, with one suffering minor injuries, but the incident underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become after a year of ongoing attacks on shipping by YemenтАЩs Houthi rebels despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area.

The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting YemenтАЩs Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. militaryтАЩs Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was.

тАЬThe guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18, which was flying off the USS Harry S. Truman,тАЭ Central Command said in a statement.

### Dynasties of Deceit: The PhilippinesтАЩ Curse

*2024-12-22 02:52:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dynasties-of-deceit-the-philippines-curse/) ┬╖ `en`

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, crafted in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution, was supposed to mark the dawn of a new democratic era. The ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., after decades of corruption, repression, and dynastic rule, was a victory for the Filipino people, or so they were told. Yet, the Constitution, supposedly a tool for dismantling the oppressive old order, contains a glaring, unimplemented clause: Article II, Section 26, which bans political dynasties. Nearly four decades later, this promise remains a cruel joke, the prohibition nothing more than a symbol of a nation shackled by its own feudal past. Political dynasties thrive unabated, and the Philippines remains trapped in a cycle of oligarchy, where power is passed down like a family heirloom, not earned through democratic means.

I first met Ronnie de Mel (1925-2024) less than six months before his passing. At the time, he was 98 years old and confined to a wheelchair, yet his memory and sharp intellect were as formidable as ever. The purpose of our initial meeting was to interview him for information about another former politician with whom he had worked somewhat closely in the legislature. De Mel hailed from a different eraтАФthree or perhaps four generations before mine. Despite the age gap, his critical thinking and incisive responses often made more sense than those of many of his successors. In his most recent book Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha commented de Mel was тАЬтАжintellectually head and shoulders above all subsequent Finance MinistersтАЭ. It is no exaggeration to say that de Mel was one of the architects of Sri LankaтАЩs Open Economy, introduced in 1977.

Sri Pada, aka AdamтАЩs Peak and Samanala Kanda, is the fifth tallest peak in Sri LankaтАЩs Hill Country at 2,243 m or 7, 359 ft. The mountain rises from its foothills grown commercially with tea, and soars as a conical shaped single rock whose peak now has been flattened to accommodate viewing areas and buildings, including a temple where the monks in charge live. It is under the religious purview of the Saman Devale in Ratnapura. Needless to mention is the fact that its fame is due to the footprint at the very summit, gold painted.

I need now to recount my sailing adventures, or shall we say, misadventures. Although I had never sailed before, I did not think twice before I shoved off on my own. On my first effort, with the wind at my back, I unfurled my sails in goose-wing style and was soon hurtling along at a whistling pace. I cannot describe the exhilaration of being one with the water and the wind, with the wind at my back and the gurgle of water in my wake. After about two hours, I reached the other side of the lake near Trevignano, just as the sun was setting.

Although her political aspiration was тАЬto lighten the burden on the suffering massesтАЭ Sirimavo soon found that the economic realities would not allow her a free hand. In the early sixties the terms of trade, which had been favourable in the fifties, declined sharply. The Korean war boom had run its course. The rise in the price of tea had plateaued and the trend was now downwards. Our external assets were diminishing and when Felix became finance minister he had no alternative but to cut down on imports drastically.

### Ranil skips two presidential elections backing common candidates Fonseka and Sirisena

MahindaтАЩs victory (in 2005) marked an inflection point. He did not abrogate the ceasefire agreement he had inherited, and even engaged in a round of negotiations with the LTTE. At the same time, he allowed the Sri Lankan military a freer rein. In December 2005, for instance, the navy retaliated to an LTTE bombing by attacking a residential area in the northern town of Mannar.

In 2006, the JVP, then in MahindaтАЩs alliance, filed a case in the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of an earlier merger of the Tamil-dominated North and East, effected in 1987. Fighting escalated and the ceasefire collapsed. Mahinda and Gota тАУ by then appointed the secretary to the ministry of defence тАУ followed the LTTEтАЩs example by opting for a strategy of total war.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka has to avoid тАШstop-goтАЩ (boom-bust) cycles involving unsustainable monetary and fiscal stimulus that lead to crises, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana has said after Fitch upgraded Sri Lanka from default status.

Sri Lanka completed a restructuring of sovereign bonds on December 20, and the country was classified as CCC+, 5 levels above restructured default.

тАЬAll the hard work and sacrifice, particularly by the people of Sri Lanka, has now paid off and Sri Lanka has the opportunity for a fresh start in the New Year,тАЭ Siriwardana said in an x.com post.

тАЬHowever, this growth cannot come at the expense of economic stability,тАЭ Siriwardana said.

тАЬAll too often in the past, whenever the economy has stabilized following a shock, we are too eager to provide unsustainable fiscal and monetary stimulus to re-invigorate growth.

Its economy is recovering after receiving an International Monetary Fund rescue package and imposing austerity reforms aimed at repairing the governmentтАЩs ruined finances.

Leftist Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.
