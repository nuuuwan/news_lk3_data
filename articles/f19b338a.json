    "It was sheer luck that saved former President Donald Trump\u2019s life on Saturday. He escaped a bullet by a hair\u2019s breadth while addressing an election rally in Pennsylvania. He dropped to the ground holding his ear behind a lectern after the first shot was fired, and then only the Secret Service agents swarmed on him, forming a human testudo of sorts. The shooter was shot dead in no time, and subsequently identified. A bleeding Trump was whisked away by the Secret Service personnel. The incident left a Trump supporter dead and two others critically injured.",
    "Saturday\u2019s unfortunate incident is a stark reminder that US political leaders are as vulnerable as their counterparts elsewhere however protected they may be. The US has lost several leaders including heads of state at the hands of gunmen, the most prominent being Presidents Abraham Lincoln and J. F. Kennedy. Not even the Secret Service, which boasts well-trained personnel, sophisticated weapons, and state-of-the art technology, can ensure US leaders\u2019 safety all the time. Assassins have to be lucky only once unlike their targets who have to be lucky all the time.",
    "Messages have been pouring in from all over the US as well as other countries, condemning Saturday\u2019s heinous attack and wishing Trump a speedy recovery. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have said violence has no place in the US. There must be no place for violence in any part of the world, and all countries must be free from assassinations and coups engineered by the world powers driven by their economic and geopolitical interests; political assassinations and other such acts of barbaric violence plague many developing countries that are rich in oil and minerals or located in strategic locations in the world.",
    "Speculation has been swirling in Washington that Trump will do a Stephen Cleveland, the only US President to serve two non-consecutive terms (from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897). Incumbent President Joe Biden has proved that he is no match for Trump in the presidential race since his disastrous performance in a recent debate, which reportedly boosted Trump\u2019s chances of victory. The Democrats find themselves in a quandary. Many of them want Biden replaced with some other candidate, but Biden is determined to contest. So, those who want Trump stopped cannot achieve their goal through the ballot, and the bullet that grazed his right ear came as no surprise. However, the motive for the abortive attempt on Trump\u2019s life has not yet been established. It is also not known whether the shooter was a lone wolf or a member of an organisation.",
    "One may recall that a warning of a possible attempt on Trump\u2019s life came last month. Steve Bannon expressed his serious concern about Trump\u2019s safety. A Trump advisor and former White House strategist, he warned that there might be an attempt to eliminate the Republican candidate physically before November. Pointing out that Trump was being likened to Julius Caesar, in some quarters, Bannon said it was a bid to enable the would-be assassin to engage in self-consolation a la Brutus. It is doubtful whether the Secret Service took his warning seriously. If it had done so, it would have taken better precautions on Saturday. Eye witnesses have gone on record as saying that they saw the gunman on a roof and alerted the police, but in vain. The shooter fired from a rooftop about 200 to 250 yards from the podium where Trump was speaking. How come he was able to get so close to his target and there was no Secret Service presence on that particular building? Another grassy knoll?",
    "Trump may be blamed for anything but promoting war. The US is currently spending billions in military aid to keep wars going in some other countries much to the glee of the Washington-based hawks. Was Saturday\u2019s failed assassination bid part of a strategy to safeguard their interests? It is too early to draw conclusions. However, one thing is now clear; the shooter\u2019s bullet, which was intended to fell Trump, is very likely to propel him to victory, provided he is better protected.",
