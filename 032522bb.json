    "In today\u2019s world, businesses across Sri Lanka and beyond face the challenge of rising energy costs. DIMO Energy has swiftly responded to this challenge by exploring the avenues of cogeneration solutions that optimise heat dissipation. Many industries during their production processes, generate heat. This excess heat can convert into energy. By investing in cogeneration plants, such as those for garment or cement factories, the important industries can utilise the produced heat to generate steam, which, through steam turbines, is then converted into energy.",
    "DIMO Energy also actively pursuing agrivoltaics, which involves the installation of solar plants on agricultural fields. Under this approach, solar panels are integrated into agricultural fields, enabling the cultivation of specific plants that thrive when shielded from direct sunlight. This innovative technique minimises the environmental trade-offs associated with solar energy production.",
    "DIMO Energy\u2019s collaboration with strategic partner Siemens, is present across many points of the power supply chain in Sri Lanka. DIMO Energy is behind the construction of a remarkable 70% of the country\u2019s grid substations\u2014a fact not widely known.

    "DIMO Energy pioneered the successful commissioning of the country\u2019s first micro-grid project at the University of Moratuwa. This achievement sent a strong message to entrepreneurs seeking reliable and self-sufficient power solutions, and demonstrated that DIMO Energy stood ready to provide cutting-edge technology at their doorstep. The company\u2019s \u201cDI-Solar\u201d renewable energy solution provides customers with long-lasting rooftop solar panel installations, backed by DIMO\u2019s proven industry track record.

    "DIMO has also positioned itself as a key player in utility-scale renewable energy projects, gaining the trust of customers as a turnkey EPC contractor and developer. With this solid foundation, DIMO is well-positioned for the next stage of growth in its Renewable Energy business. The Sri Lankan Government has set an ambitious target of meeting 70% of the country\u2019s power generation needs through renewable energy sources, leading to rapid development in the sector. Given the unavailability of fossil fuel energy sources in Sri Lanka, the volatility of global fuel markets, higher thermal fuel costs, and the growing emphasis on environmental and extended producer responsibilities and sustainability, local enterprises are compelled to embrace renewable energy sources.",
    "Amidst the remarkable progress Sri Lanka has made in its journey towards economic recovery, the country is now primed to attract investments for rapid industrial development, thanks to its geographical advantage and competitive factors of production. Such expansions will create a significant demand surge for power, with industries seeking reputable organisations that can provide total solutions for their electrical power related needs.
