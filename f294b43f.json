    "Criticises Minister for his indifference towards recent deaths and health care crisis",
    "Says if not opposition will band together to bring a no-confidence motion against him",
    "In the wake of a series of highly contentious patient fatalities within state hospitals and alarming allegations surrounding the importation of substandard drugs, the main opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday revealed its intention to present a motion of no confidence against the Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.",
    "SJB MP Dr. Kavinda Jayawardena speaking to the media yesterday said there are serious doubts regarding the trustworthiness of the current Health Minister.",
    "\u201cThe citizens of the country have raised concerns and doubts if he, along with the Health Secretary, is working together with the drug mafia,\u201d he said. Jayawardena called on Government Ministers and MPs to bring forward a no-confidence motion against their colleague.",
    "\u201cIf we present the motion, the Government will take measures to shield these corrupt individuals. If Government MPs genuinely care for the well-being of the people in this country, they themselves can initiate it. However, if they do not, we will proceed with the no-confidence motion. We urge Government MPs, who have been elected by the people, to support us in this endeavour,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, during a press conference held yesterday, SJB MP Ajith Mannapperuma strongly criticised the Minister for his apparent indifference towards the recent deaths and the crisis in the healthcare service. \u201cIs this the appropriate response expected from a Minister entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the healthcare service of the country? What purpose does such a Minister serve?\u201d he asked.",
    "The MP said the people are fast losing their trust in the state health service due to the drug shortages and importation of substandard medicines. \u201cThe Minister is responsible for this,\u201d he said.",
    "Mannapperuma issued a demand for Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to resign from his position, warning that the opposition would unite and initiate a vote of no confidence against him if he failed to do so.",
    "The MP said the party will also lodge a complaint with the World Health Organization (WHO) seeking action against those accountable for undermining the healthcare service in the country."
