Ruwanchandra, emphasized that Alphaliner, a prominent research publication in the shipping industry, recognized Colombo Port as the world\u2019s fastest-growing port in the first quarter of 2024 due to its remarkable operational performance and 23.6% growth rate.",

    "Addressing a press briefing held under the series titled \u201cTwo Years of Progress and Way Forward\u201d, held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (29), Secretary to the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Services further elaborated:",
    "\u201cTo begin with, I would like to highlight the significant progress in the operational performance of the Colombo Port, which achieved an impressive growth rate of 23.6% in 2024. As a result, Alphaliner, a leading research publication in the shipping industry, recognized the Colombo Port as the world\u2019s fastest-growing port in the first quarter of 2024. We accomplished this progress despite various trade union actions, which did not hinder our operations.",
    "In 2023, the Sri Lanka Port Authority reported a profit of USD 100 million, and in just the first quarter of 2024, it has already made a profit of USD 50 million.",
    "All four terminals have significantly contributed to these operations, with on-going efforts to enhance their operational capacity. Construction of the Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) and the Western Terminal is in progress, with the Western Terminal expected to begin operations in February 2025.",
    "Additionally, development work is underway at the Eastern Terminal and Northern Port. Meanwhile, development projects are being carried out at Trincomalee, Galle, and Kankasanthurai ports.

Therefore, many short-term and long-term measures are currently being implemented to improve facilities for 8 to 9 million passengers.",

Additionally, 30 more counters will be added to the departure area of the new building, along with the construction of four e-gates each for arrivals and departures, streamlining the immigration and emigration processes.",
