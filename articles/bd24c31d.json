    "Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) - The construction of Sri Lanka's first ever wildlife tunnel to prevent elephant-train collisions will begin on March 1 in the Kasikota area of Galgamuwa, Gatadivula, the Transport and Highways Ministry said.",
    "They said the number of elephants killed due to train collisions is increasing and it has become an environmental and development issue that has attracted national and international attention.",
    "\"Various government and non-government organizations have proposed and implemented various solutions, but as a country, we are still trying to prevent elephant-train clashes,\" the Ministry said.",
    "\"During the last few years, between 150 and 200 wild elephants have been killed due to train collisions while roaming around the railway lines.",
    "\"It was proposed to develop an old culvert near the place as a wildlife tunnel, but due to some technical problems, it was proposed to construct a new wildlife tunnel at 'Alimankada'.",
    "However, as the first step in the national operation to prevent elephant-train conflict, a policy decision was taken to construct the proposed wildlife tunnel under the Maho-Omanthai Railway Development Project, which is being implemented with the financial assistance of the Indian Credit Line.",
    "The project will protect the lives of about 200 wild elephants. This project contributes to preventing railway accidents, protecting railway property, and ensuring the safety of railway passengers."
