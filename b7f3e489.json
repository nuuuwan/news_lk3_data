    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed deep concern over a recent rise in arbitrary arrests, police raids without proper warrants, and extrajudicial killings.",
    "In a statement, the BASL underscored the importance of due process and the rule of law, urging authorities to promptly rectify these issues and restore public trust in the justice system.",
    "The statement said, \"The police raids, including the demolition of property carried out without valid search warrants and/or valid search orders, whilst flagrantly violating established legal protocols, render them unlawful. Such actions not only undermine the bedrock principles of justice, but also erode public confidence in the integrity of law enforcement agencies.\"",
    "The statement strongly condemned the prospect of extrajudicial killings, emphasizing that even convicted criminals have a right to due process and life as per Article 13(4) of the Sri Lankan Constitution.",
    "The BASL also noted a disturbing trend of arbitrary arrests without proper investigation or legal procedure.",
    "The BASL expressed deep concern over recent statements by the Public Security Minister implicating certain lawyers as conspirators with drug offenders.",
    "The Association highlighted the need for police accountability and transparency in legal proceedings. Unchecked impunity creates an environment where no individual feels secure, regardless of their involvement.",
    "The statement stressed the importance of steadfastly upholding the rule of law and due process for building a just and equitable society for all Sri Lankans.",
