The development of the country's infrastructure was based on foreign and local loans and donations. Due to being unable to pay the loan installments, the loans that were promised by countries were rejected. The funds that were to be received from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank were suspended until the debt restructuring process is completed,\" he said.",
