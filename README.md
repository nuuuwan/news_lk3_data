ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Over 17.1 million voters in Sri Lanka are eligible to cast their votes to elect a 225-member parliament in the November 14 polls amid the sovereign defaulted nationтАЩs partially completed debt restructuring and unfinished economic reforms.

The NPPтАЩs policy platform has resonated strongly with voter segments disillusioned by the economic crises and prior administrations, analysts say.

The election campaign was dominated by debates over the state of economy, corruption, and experience.

SLOTS polling of voter intent conducted by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) since the Presidential Election through 8 November has suffered from an increased level of response bias.

тАЬThis has been due to respondentsтАЩ over-reporting support for the NPP. This has resulted in large uncertainty and a significant bias in favour of the NPP in the resulting vote intent estimates,тАЭ said IHP in a statement.

тАЬNonetheless, we are releasing estimates based on these polling data in the interests of transparency. We advise that these estimates are likely to be associated with a large margin of error, and caution should be taken when interpreting them. As with any opinion poll, they should not be regarded as a prediction of the final election result,тАЭ it added.

### Two defendants acquitted from murder case after 27 years

*2024-11-14 01:44:36* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Two-defendants-acquitted-from-murder-case-after-27-years/56-769230) ┬╖ `en`

The North Central Province Predecessor High Court Judge and incumbent Kuliyapitiya High Court Judge Manoj Thalgodapitiya has ordered the acquittal of two defendants indicted before the Anuradhapura High Court for a murder that took place in Rajanganaya 27 years ago.

The defendants, identified as Dadigamage Premasiri alias тАЬUkkuwaтАЭ and K. Wasantha Kumar alias тАЬK. Wasantha,тАЭ both residents of Rajanganaya, were acquitted due to insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution.

The High Court Judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the allegations against the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt.

The case, which dates back to 29 October 1997, was initially brought to the Anuradhapura High Court under Section 296 of the Sri Lanka Penal Code Ordinance by the Attorney General, accusing the two defendants of committing the offence within the Anuradhapura HCтАЩs jurisdiction.

### Relieving Tired Eyes

*2024-11-13 23:37:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/relieving-tired-eyes/) ┬╖ `en`

Steep two tea bags (black or green tea) in a mug of boiled water for 02 to 04 minutes and then remove the tea bags, and press out the excess water from the bags.

Let the tea bags cool slowly at room temperature or chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

Your cold brew might give you a refreshing jolt, but a caffeine fix for the skin can also help calm blotchiness or swelling.

Start by freezing some brewed coffee in an ice cube tray. Once the coffee ice is ready, spend a few minutes gently rubbing an ice cube: under your eyes, along your brows, across the bridge of your nose, and from the outer corners of your eyes to your temples

Place the slices over your closed eyes for about 15 minutes.

As an alternative, try cold spoons. They can help constrict blood vessels and reduce areas of under-eye darkness.

### Will the 2024 General elections redefine Sri LankaтАЩs political future?

This election is expected to be a defining moment for Sri Lanka, with outcomes that could significantly impact its political and economic trajectory in the coming years тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The upcoming General elections in Sri Lanka are pivotal, given the countryтАЩs complex political and economic landscape. Several key factors are shaping expectations for the outcome.

First, economic challenges remain a critical concern. Sri LankaтАЩs economic recovery from a severe debt crisis and inflation surge has been slow, with many citizens still experiencing financial hardship. This context has led to frustration with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as many view its policies as ineffective in alleviating economic pressures. This dissatisfaction may boost Opposition parties like the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP), who have gained traction with promises of economic reforms and anti-corruption measures.

### TrumpтАЩs triumph: American Revolution/counter-revolution and world order

President Trump actually thought that Kamala Harris, a feminist progressive-liberal, was a тАЬradical-leftist, Marxist, Socialist, CommunistтАЭ.

The Trump administration and a Republican Senate are going to regard a JVP-NPP regime in the Indian Ocean headed by JVP leader Anura Dissanayake, pale-pink NPP frill, crony corporate d├йcor and all, differently from the way a Democrat White House and Senate did.

The multidimensional triumph of Donald Trump is an outcome I hardly applaud, but as a political scientist and former diplomat, I cannot fail to note its magnitude, even epic character, and respect the political achievement.

Was it a counter-revolution or a revolution? Critics would argue the former; fans, the latter. It is like those two-dimensional pictures we had as postcards or key-tags when we were schoolkids. It all depends on which side you tilt it; which angle you view it from.

Now after so many years we have to shamefully admit that in this age of religious ostentation, hypocrisy, superstition and orthodox thinking where priests of all faiths are gaining influence and getting political patronage for opinions, there is now a deep gap between the Nehruvian understanding of scientific approach and its practical application and implementation in the Indian context.

While today there is a deluge of superstitious clerics and leaders everywhere in the country, about seventy years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had foresightly emphasised that, тАШPolitics led me to economics and it was from that that I was inspired by science and knowledge to adopt a scientific approach to problems and life.

This had resulted in a serious delay in the clearing of the containers at the port.
