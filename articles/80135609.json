    "My subject this morning is Leelananda De Silva with comments on his book The Long Littleness of Life: a memoir of government, the United Nations, family and friends, published 2016. I read it then but re-read it this week and am more impressed and desirous of sharing my feelings and opinion with others. Hence this article, with of course Leelananda\u2019s permission to go ahead and write but not in praise, he strictly stipulated.",
    "I consider him a \u2018Man for all Seasons\u2019 with its positive connotation of \u201ca man who knows who he is, quick minded, urbane, meticulous, cheerful, admirable.\u201d Leelananda is all these plus more. To me the most obvious are his concern for others; his love of sharing camaraderie and often having a host of friends and relatives to meals; his simplicity and genuine empathy and ever outstretched hand to the less privileged. While re-reading his book I was reminded afresh that he had been a close advisor and assistant to PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike; walked the world and talked with presidents and dissidents; served globally; and here I am trading insults laughingly when we meet. That alone is proof of the simplicity of the man.",
    "I wrote some years ago about a fine man doing much to spread the Buddha Dhamma since he deserved being made more widely known. Result? Stupid women mostly, phoned his wife with condolences! They read the name, thought the worst. A trait in us Sinhalese? Jumping to hasty conclusions after skimming something or hearing gossip; ever ready for the macabre. This incident I include here to preclude any such crass mis-reading. Are people to be written about only posthumously, I ask with brutal frankness?",
    "As detailed in his book, he was born in Aranwala, Ahangama, in 1936 to well to do parents but was closer to his maternal grandparents with whom he spent the first twenty years. Schooling was at Mahinda College, Galle, where he developed three passions: books, history and cricket. All through his adult life he was a voracious reader and collector of books, so he possesses a vast library on diverse subjects, the most favoured being biographies and slanted toward personalities like those of the Bloomsbury Group of Maynard Keynes, Virginia Stephens and family, Leonard Woolf and peripherally E M Forster.",
    "He entered the University of Peradeniya in 1955 and graduated in 1959, which years he terms \u201cthe golden years\u201d. He read for an Honours Degree in Economics. Much later, he also had an year at the London School of Economics where he earned a Diploma in Development Administration.",
    "He joined the Land Commissioner\u2019s Department in 1960 and served for seven years attached to various kachcheries as District Land officer (DLO). In 1967 he was requested by the Permanent Secretary, M Sri Kantha, to join the Ministry of Lands as Assistant Secretary. C P de Silva was Minister. In 1970, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs who had been his lecturer in Peradeniya, wanted him to join the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs as Senior Asst. Secretary. Leelananda accepted the offer and writes that those seven years (1970-77) were the \u201cbest years of my life.\u201d",
    "It seems to be the pinnacle of his career in home territory to work very closely with Mrs Bandaranaike and very many distinguished persons. In 1974 he was organizer and Secretary General of the 30th annual sessions of ESCAP held in Colombo. Mrs B appointed him Secretary of the Economic Committee of the Colombo Non-Aligned Summit in August 1976. Before the Summit and after, he accompanied the PM overseas for NA Summits and other conferences; plus attended two Commonwealth Summits. He was deeply involved in International Economic Relations at that time.",
    "Then a change. He left for Geneva to take up the post of Executive Secretary for the Third World Forum till 1980. Through 1980 to 2013, Leelananda roamed the world as a UN Consultant, working on different assignments and projects for UNCTAD, UNDP, FAO, IFAD, ESCAP and other UN organs. He went on assignments to very many countries. You name a country from Rome to Africa, Nepal to Burma and China, and of course the UK and US, and he had been there and in other places and met the local cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me \u2013 heads of state, government officials, society. He names them and often writes about them so his book is a veritable directory of VIPs of the years covered. He insists he was never a staff member of the UN; he worked for it as a consultant.",
    "Leelananda and Rukmal, with their daughter Amali living with them or visiting, resided in Nyon near Geneva from 1978 for 13 years; he busy with UN assignments and she teaching in an international school when a porcelain plaque designed and made by her was presented to visiting Princess Caroline of Monaco. They then moved to Windsor and lived for 22 years \u2013 1991 to 2013 \u2013 in their own home close to Windsor Castle, visiting Sri Lanka annually and doing much service and donating generously when the tsunami devastated our coastal areas.",
    "Then the decision to return to Sri Lanka permanently to their home in Layard\u2019s Road, Colombo 5, with Rukmal concentrating on her social service, painting porcelain and gardening, and Leelananda completing his book, contributing articles to print media, and generally catching up with hordes of friends and acquaintances. I must sneak in here that they seemed to have kept open house while resident wherever overseas, since from conversations gathered very many families spent holidays with them.",
    "I was intrigued with the title of the book: The Long Littleness of Life. Pondering on it you get the full significance \u2013 Life, long or short, is in the final analysis so full of the little things: happenings, people, lucky incidents and reverse, troubles even, which enrich existence. Leelananda had in memory this quote from a letter of Frances Cornford, wife of a Cambridge don and granddaughter of Charles Darwin.",
    "In his preface he notes down the three reasons for the biography, first being his love of writing \u201cand why not write about my career which has been unusual\u2026\u201d Second was that in his 50 year career and after, he met so many persons. \u201cI would like their names to be recorded somewhere and why not I do it?\u201d The third reason: \u201cVirginia Woolf so aptly said, \u2018Nothing has really happened unless it has been recorded.\u2019\u201d The wonder is that this memoir is written almost wholly from memory. He regrets he never maintained notes nor kept diaries, though he is a collector of diaries by others.",
    "Godfrey Gunatilleke, Sunethra Bandaranaike, Alan R Roe (Univ of Warwck), Lakdasa Hulugalle (UNCTAD) and Dame Joan Margaret Anstee (first woman Under-Sec Gen of UN) have contributed great tributes to the memoir and its author as given at the end of the book. I quote from the first named.",
    "\u201cThere are some unusual features that render Leelananda\u2019s memoirs a unique piece of writing. In a neat, well-organized sequence, we move through three phases of his life as student, administrator and international consultant set in three contexts: the rural, the national and the global. Thereby he is able to depict an enormously complex universe of relationships in the life span of a single individual \u2026 (but) avoids the ego-centric quality which flaws many an autobiography.\u201d Gunatilleke also adds that H A de S Gunasekera announced when Leelananda joined him in the Planning Ministry: \u201cHe was one of my brightest students.\u201d",
    "The man emerges from the pages of the book comparatively fully portrayed. A conscientious efficient worker, whether within the Ceylon/Sri Lanka bureaucracy as second in command or boss; successful overseas in many capacities and positions, always within his best known subject areas \u2013 economics, public administration, development and rural societies.",
    "I quote from the end of the last Chapter of Leelananda\u2019s book titled Envoi in which he includes a stanza he found pensive and meaningful, from Australian poet, Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-1870)",
