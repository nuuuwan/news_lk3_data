  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers has green lighted a proposal by Women and Child Affairs Ministry to allocate Rs. 25 million for 2025, with provisions for subsequent years to be included in future annual Budgets.",
    "The funding aims to support temporary care homes that provide protection and rehabilitation for victimised women countrywide.",
    "At present, the Ministry operates 10 temporary care homes in Gampaha, Rathnapura, Moneragala, Colombo, Matara, Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Jaffna and two in Anuradhapura. A new facility is also set to open in Nuwara Eliya in January 2025, extending the program\u2019s reach to address growing demand.",
    "Since 2020, these care homes have provided assistance to 2,852 victimised women. However, the Ministry has faced financial constraints incurring Rs. 60.35 million in expenses for administrative and maintenance purposes, whilst receiving only Rs. 37.69 million in the Budget. As a result, unpaid bills amounting to Rs. 22 million remain pending.",
    "The Ministry has been managing administrative and operations costs for some care centres, while others rely on contributions from women\u2019s welfare-oriented organisations. \u201cThis collaborative approach has ensured the continued protection and rehabilitation of women in need, despite financial shortfalls,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "He said, the Ministry\u2019s focus will remain on securing adequate resources to meet growing demands while ensuring the effective management of care homes across the country."
