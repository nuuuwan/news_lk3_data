### Reconciliation with no political solution does not believe

*2024-05-28 16:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184679) · `ta`

Despite the end of the war 15 years ago, unresolved issues persist, particularly in the North and East. Economic struggles and international scrutiny, including calls for war crime prosecutions, highlight ongoing challenges. President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to address these by focusing on development and reconciliation, visiting the affected areas and promoting major projects. However, concerns over devolution and past rights violations remain, with the upcoming presidential election potentially influencing policy directions.

🟩

The fifteenth anniversary of the end of the war has clearly revealed that the war may have come to an end, but that the relevant issues did not end. There is a sense of practice outside the North and East, which was the domain of military operations. The memory of the war is going near. This situation has led to the hope that the government can pay attention to the economic downturn of the government, especially in the lives of the people who are still increasingly affected by other problems.

Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, there was also the hope that he could win the international pressures from the Human Rights Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council as he had close ties with the leaders of the West.
