    "In a new year ahead, we hope for a sea-change into something rich and strange",
    "It has long been the contention of this writer that English-Language Theatre (ELT) in Sri Lanka has great potential as a vehicle to engage with civics and government critically in the larger national interest.",
    "Since 1994, when I first proposed a consortium of the creative and critical arms of the performing arts to this end, there have been few takers and even fewer serious contenders where ELT has spoken truth to power.",
    "Many valuable and valiant attempts have been made \u2013 from politically-angled dramatizations of Shakespeare, through slapstick passed off as satire, to original pieces spanning a spectrum of sub-genres such as existential plays, stand-up comedies and (God help us) even musicals.",
    "But most have failed to pass muster because in the main they have sought more to please those whom they consider their primary stakeholders \u2013 members of cast and crew, and their families and friends (ELT is quite incestuous in a sense) \u2013 rather than critically engage the powers that be with serious content.",
    "It does not help society as a whole if ELT \u2013 unlike its Sinhala counterpart, which is far more subversive and serious about their stagecraft \u2013 that impresarios are more mindful about making a splash with amusements and entertainments, and making a handful of shekels where feasible, rather than making a change to the often abysmal status quo that cries out for critical engagement.",
    "In a new year ahead, we hope for a sea-change into something rich and strange.",
    "Today, let\u2019s look at the possibilities held out by the re-run of a play that hit the boards in November 2023 and will see Feroze Kamardeen (FK) reprise his eponymous role in Grow Up Nana (GUN) this weekend at the Wendt.",
    "Grow Up Nana \u2013 no comma, no exclamation mark! \u2013 is a comedy that\u2019s ostensibly about Sri Lankan Muslims (SLMs) as they are acronymously known in this production by StageLight&Magic (SLM). Which also brought theatre audiences gaga about gags, giggles and grand gestures the happy farce of the Freddy franchise and that vehicle with potential for sociopolitical change: Pusswedilla.",
    "In the short span of under two hours (for this relief many thanks; the night is still young, and we have other fish to fry), FK AKA Nana goes to town in his characteristic style on a plethora of the ills that plague his community: the SLMs (not StageLight&Magic but Sri Lankan Muslims and their many idiosyncracies).",
    "The SLMs throughout the length and breadth of the sunny isle we inhabit \u2013 so blissfully unaware of our own foibles but so sharply sensitized to others\u2019 foibles \u2013 get short shrift from one of their own.",
    "And it is \u201cnasty, brutish and short\u201d (like early humanity in general, in Hobbes\u2019 Leviathan) in instances. But overall it is necessary, brutally honest and sweetly to the point \u2013 a welcome change for FK, who tends to meander like Leander.",
    "Okay, I do too \u2013 point taken! To the \u2018res\u2019 (the play is the thing) then?",
    "A lot of the early parts of the play are self-referential (for e.g. \u201cIn my theatre career I have been blessed by the Almighty to have written all those plays and since my first \u2013\u00a0 Pusswedilla, in 2007 \u2013 I have spoken to all of you in many different voices\u201d; \u201cIn Pusswedilla I have been blessed to have had some of the finest comic actors in theatre on stage breathing life into my scripts\u201d; \u201cYes there are many voices in my head but tonight is different: tonight I have no performer to speak through; tonight is just me\u201d).",
    "But once he gets going on \u2018Self and the Other\u2019 \u2013 the role of ethnics in society \u2013 one tends to forgive him that initial excess.",
    "There are other peccadilloes to fend off too, one feels, such as being forgetful of the part played by dominant figures who failed spectacularly to deliver the nation-state in keeping with their reputation as political messiahs.",
    "FK reminisces: \u201cI have had the unique experience of watching Pusswedilla seated right next to H. E. Mahinda Rajapaksha. And whatever faults MR may have \u2013 in his sense of planning, sense of project management, sense of budgeting, sense of governing, whatever \u2013 his sense of humour is fine.\u201d",
    "This is the problem with much of Pusswedilla\u2019s brand of humour. It tends to stamp picaresque villains as loveable rouges and exonerate them on the basis that some of their mannerisms were once considered funny. Aiyo Nana, \u2018mathaka nae\u2019?",
    "But despite the almost-loving glance back in pseudo-fondness, FK has the last laugh, and that is where he employs humour to good effect and use. Of MR, he avers: \u201cHis sense of humour is sometimes cruel I think. Like the time he played that really cruel practical joke on all of us. Like when he pranked the whole nation? What else did you think Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s presidency was? Obviously it went a bit too far, but that\u2019s the problem with",
    "And in similar vein, Nana mints comedy gold by dint of an episode of Pusswedilla by fake-remembering the time GR allegedly wished to drive the family car because \u2018Big Brother\u2019 was doing it. And despite the fact that he \u2013 GR not MR \u2013 was not a qualified \u2018driver\u2019, yet took over the steering the \u2018vehicle\u2019. Get it?",
    "According to proceedings in Pusswedilla: \u201cThirty seconds later, the car is against a coconut tree, sibling is producing organic fertilizer and Pusswedilla is going, \u2018Appachchi! Malli caar eka haeppuwaa! Galle Face geniyanna epaa!\u2019\u201d",
    "Yet that titbit was only an appetizer. The main course, of course, is nitwit SLMs. And Nana begins by investigating \u2018The Aunty Network,\u2019 which is \u201ca sprawling network with allies, partners, spies, enemies, warring factions, new alliances. I am sure other communities have it, but we have the most organized and most powerful one of them all.\u201d",
    "Now, he has the audience on his side, and the stage is set for a roast, which is at it should be. For all good satirists must be able to laugh at themselves and their own follies first.",
    "But to say as Nana does that \u201cThe Aunty Network wields it [point-scoring gossip and the art of verbal warfare] with the dexterity of a Mujahideen soldier handling a Gatling at the back of a white Toyota double cab while it\u2019s moving up the Khyber pass\u201d is only an hors d\u2019oeuvre.",
    "The smorgasbord of ethnic valence has a host of other delectable offerings in GUN.",
    "Nana says: \u201cWe have children to get married off. That\u2019s another strange phrase we use in our community: \u2018married off\u2019. They are trying so hard to get their son \u2018married off\u2019. Not just married, \u2018married off\u2019. As in now, that monkey is \u2018off\u2019 my shoulders, somebody else\u2019s problem now.\u201d",
    "This is clever as it makes the audience sympathetic yet suddenly self-conscious about what oddities the argot and jargon of their communities contain!",
    "Then, Nana enters the SLM minefield of \u2018nikah\u2019 (marriage contract) and \u2018waleema\u2019 (wedding reception). And in doing so with witty and insightful quips, quotes and anecdotes, holds up the mirror of folly in the face of his fellow SLMs. It also sets the stage for FK, later, to criticize the practices of his community \u2013 progressive? (not a compliment!) \u2013 when it comes to divorce.",
    "\u201cTwo important things to remember about Islamic weddings: one, the girl does not give a dowry; it\u2019s the guy who is supposed to give it \u2013 it\u2019s called the \u2018mahar\u2019; and two, the girl does not change her name to her husband\u2019s name\u2026 she keeps her father\u2019s name\u2026 because Islam recognizes that you can in fact have more than one husband in your lifetime but you will always have only one father.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn our country, for some strange reason, women are not present at the nikah ceremony. I think it\u2019s about time we changed that. And let me be clear on this: without the girl\u2019s consent, the marriage cannot take place, it is not valid. So because she has to consent and because nothing can happen without it, here is a revolutionary idea\u2026 why don\u2019t we let her be present for the ceremony? And maybe \u2026 let her sign the document that is technically her own marriage certificate. I mean it\u2019s not like the birth certificate where it\u2019s impossible to have the holder sign it, no? This is a partnership entered into by and between two consenting adults in the eyes of the Almighty Himself. Let",
    "Midway, Nana attends SLM funerals. However, that is not before he has poked some fun at the pretentious Sri Lankan habit of sussing out one\u2019s old school as a traditional form of social sniffing.",
    "\u201cSo, as the more perceptive ones amongst you may have already guessed, I am Muslim. And I am not a Thomian! You won\u2019t believe the number of times people have",
    "\u2018Oh, DS is in Colombo 7? Ah, how did you get into English theatre?\u2019",
    "\u2018See you later, machang, I was speaking to some other people\u2026\u2019",
    "En route to the funeral, Nana dissects SLMs for their attitudes and approaches to \u201cthe whole PDA thing\u201d (Public Display of Affection) and PDW (Public Display of Wealth). Apparently, the Holy Prophet, Peace Be Upon Him (PBUH), was in favour of PDA but not PDW.",
    "\u201cOf course, PDA only with the approved people \u2013 okay? I mean, you can\u2019t have PDA with your secretary and go home and expect to live, no?\u201d And then again: \u201cWhat the Holy Prophet did not like or never approved was PDW, Public Display of Wealth. Strangely, we seem to excel in that and one of the areas that we do it extensively is, of course, at our weddings. Can\u2019t do it at our funerals, no?\u201d",
    "\u201cGo to an Islamic funeral. Actually, go to two. A very rich man\u2019s \u2018janaza\u2019 (that\u2019s what the body and the funeral are both called) and go to a poor man\u2019s one. It\u2019s all the same. Same cloth, same box, same sized grave: it\u2019s a very big eye-opener. We bring nothing and take nothing except our good deeds. And nothing in life is permanent, sort of like \u2018aniccawata sankhaara\u2019. [Sly parallel being drawn] Our funerals do not allow for any PDW, no big show of wealth. They are very simple, very quick, very cheap: the billionaire and the pauper all get the same\u2026 same coffin, same prayer, same",
    "This commentary on death helps Nana to springboard into his pithy and pointed observations on sex, love, marriage and divorce.",
    "But that story in Part II of how ethnics can provoke not only minority communities to self-reflection but majoritarian societies to sea-changes in everyone\u2019s best interests."
