Bradman takes final bow after a period on intense political manoeuvering

Ranil’s strength, according to the Constitution, came from his supremacy in Parliament. With great managerial skill he managed to keep at all times a sizable majority in place. The UNF never lost a vote in Parliament during those two years (Ranil was PM). The UNF itself was a coalition bringing together five parties which contested the election together. It must have brought much credit to his political acumen and management skills that in spite of severe stresses and strains, the UNF held together. It was also quite remarkable in a country where party political loyalties are notably fickle, that during the period of his government there was not a single resignation from party or office.

“They look close to dead,” says Sri Lankan farmer Shantha Dissanayake looking at his pruned mango trees.

“They looked close to dead,” says Sri Lankan farmer, Shantha Dissanayake, about his mango trees.

“However, this experiment has turned out to be a complete success.”

Shantha has spent a lot of time worrying about elephants stomping over his mango orchards. But he became even more scared when agricultural experts came from abroad and hacked his trees down to relative shadows of their former selves. The trees are much shorter than before, with fewer but wider branches that allow sunlight to boost fruit quality and naturally prevent plant diseases.

Zengxian Zhao, the man who cut the trees in the first place, laughed at Shantha’s memory of the event. “He was initially shocked, but he’s been convinced and is spreading the word,” said Zengxian, an expert on crop cultivation.

There is no rosy picture on the horizon for Asia, nor for much of the planet. West Asia will continue to burn, its embers fanned by the possibility of fresh escalations with Iran, even as the Gaza war drags towards a brutal close by the first quarter of next year. Ukraine remains the grand theatre for warmongers, with NATO edging towards deeper intervention against Russia, threatening to drag the world into a legal and moral limbo from which there may be no escape. Latin America fractures under its own contradictions: Argentina sinks into crisis under Javier Milei’s economic experiments, while Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, Brazil’s Lula da Silva, and others tilt eastwards in defiance of Washington’s grip.

1. The transition from British Colonial rule to Sri Lanka’s Independence came in stages. The Donoughmore Constitution of 1931 paved the way for the grant of Universal Adult Francise and for elections to the State Council. This gave rise to Political Parties amongst which Ceylon National Congress, the precursor of the United National Party, was in the vanguard for the struggle for Independence from colonial rule. There were other left wing Political Parties as Sama Samaja Party, and the Communist Party, Tamil Congress.

### Some faces and lives from the mid 20th century

*2025-10-04 19:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/some-faces-and-lives-from-the-mid-20th-century/) · `en`

I have lived in exile in the United Kingdom for more years than I care to remember. Now, in retirement, my thoughts often drift back to my youth recalling the faces and names that once filled the media and shaped our lives, in our island paradise.

The mid-twentieth century was a time of great upheaval, shaping not only the course of nations but also the lives of ordinary people like us. In Ceylon, the Second World War and the struggle for independence from British rule cast long shadows over our families and communities. These were the years in which we grew—from infants in our mothers’ arms to adults carrying the weight of responsibility in a changing world. It was a period of transition and enormous transformation.

As a newly independent nation, unity among all its people was crucial for progress and prosperity, although at times this wisdom was overshadowed by the chaos of politics.

### Lumumba alumni gather for nostalgic 50th anniversary

*2025-10-04 19:49:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lumumba-alumni-gather-for-nostalgic-50th-anniversary/) · `en`

In the latter part of 1970, a group of us left for Moscow on scholarships—young, eager, and filled with dreams. Five years later, in 1975, we returned home with flying colours. Today, more than half a century later, some of us remain active in our professions, many have retired, while a few have drifted away from contact—and sadly, some are no longer with us.

From the very first day we set foot in Moscow, our lives changed forever. That moment marked the beginning of a new chapter and a turning point in our personal journeys. The initial days were challenging—adjusting to the harsh Russian winter, adapting to a new culture, and finding our footing in an unfamiliar land. Yet, the years we spent at the prestigious Peoples’ Friendship University (then Lumumba University) with students from across the globe in the Soviet Union were nothing short of transformative.

Thank you. Last year I came briefly after being away for nearly 20 years. Now I’m delighted to be back again.

I first visited your county when I was 14-years old when my parents took me to the UK. Our ship  stopped in Colombo for a day. I remember travelling from Fort to the Mount Lavinia Hotel and seeing all the coconut trees on each side of the road. I notice that there are none there now. Then I came in 1976 as a monk and I ended up staying for 20 years. I became a monk in India but it was in Sri Lanka that I learned Buddhism at a deeper level.

Hasala – Over the last decades you have become quite well-known for your writings. How and why did you start writing?

### #SriPOP - The Sound of a New Sri Lanka

*2025-10-04 16:49:00* · [`newsfirstlk`](https://english.newsfirst.lk/2025/10/04/sripop-the-sound-of-a-new-sri-lanka) · `en`

In Stein Studios, in the outskirts of Colombo, a dancer moves as if the earth itself is breathing beneath her feet.

It’s human — imperfectly perfect, like the heartbeat that drives it. A drum echoes, a synth sighs, and something ancient awakens.

It’s not a beat born in a studio, nor a formula cooked up for virality.

It’s a call — a return — to the rhythm that has always pulsed through this island’s soul.

To understand #SriPop, you have to first understand the strange, beautiful chaos of Sri Lanka’s musical DNA.

From the Portuguese-inspired baila that once drifted through coastal taverns, to the rabana circles of rural women who drum while they laugh and sing, to the Nada Bhera & Yak Bera— the ceremonial drumming that summons gods and courage alike — this island’s music has never been entertainment alone. It has always been spiritual architecture, a way of being, of remembering, of belonging.
