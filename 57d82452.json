    "The debate on the no-confidence motion on Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella is likely to be delayed as the ruling party and the Opposition have failed to reach an agreement on when the debate should take place, informed sources said.",
    "The Daily Mirror reliably learned that the Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha and the ruling party had wanted the debate held on Thursday, August 10, 2023, but the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa had disagreed.",
    "\u201cThe SJB and Mr.\u00a0 Premadasa are of the opinion that the adjournment debate on Sri Lanka Cricket\u2019s spending on the T20 World Cup should be given priority instead,\" the source added.",
    "It was also reported that Minister Rambukwella is also agreeable to the debate being taken up this week itself.",
    "The no faith motion on Minister Rambukwella is sponsored by the SJB. (Yohan Perera)"
