    "Sarvajana Balaya leader MP Dilith Jayaweera emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to diversify its export basket and to engage in regular and comprehensive dialogue with trade partners such as the US as a post-crisis management strategy.",
    "Referring to the modification of the U.S. tariff rates earlier today, the parliamentarian hailed it as \u201cpositive progress\u201d, from the 44% reciprocal tariff announced on April 02.",
    "\u201cAs I shared with the President, during the party leader meeting, as a post-crisis management strategy we need to engage in regular and comprehensive dialogue,\u201d he said, adding that it is a position he always maintained, \u201cprimarily to pre-empt this kind of shock in the first place.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs we receive this positive news, we must be aware that steps to diversify our export basket, in terms of quantity, quality and export locations, have seen little to no progress,\u201d the MP said in a post on \u2018X\u2019.",
    "Jayaweera pointed out that the tariff-driven economic shock will be severe, but warned, \u201cwhat\u2019s more concerning is the government\u2019s lack of progress in grasping the ongoing volatility.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe need to bear in mind that in comparison to the 2024 (Jan-May) figures, the 2025 trade deficit has widened by over USD 500 million, a testament to the expansion of consumer habits over growing local production,\u201d he added."
