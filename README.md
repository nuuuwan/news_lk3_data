In a post on his official Facebook page, Rajapakse pointed out that the bond between a leader and the public was beyond politics and it was rooted in confidence and mutual respect.

"I have been well aware of their love because they spent most of my life. This love with no profit motives is worthless. It is not only a political relationship, but a heartfelt bond, it is difficult to break it. Efforts to undermine it will still strengthen it, ”he said.

Throughout the public, he said that he had experienced "the greatest happiness that could be a leader" and that he thanked everyone for his respect.
