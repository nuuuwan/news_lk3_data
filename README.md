(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar, memoirs of  Bradman Weerakoon)

My acquaintance with S W R D Bandaranaike was only through the press reports of his election campaign. That was before he came to the prime minister‚Äôs office in the Fort (now housing the foreign ministry at Republic Square), on an April morning, after the swearing in of his Cabinet at Queen‚Äôs House. His eloquence as a speaker, especially his Independence Day speech in 1948, was deeply imprinted in my mind.

Throughout a gruelling campaign he had shown extraordinary skills of perseverance in the face of severe odds, and the ability to persuade large masses of ordinary people to believe in his cause. I wondered how he would be to work with after I had experienced the rather easy going style of Sir John. There was also the serious business to be faced of how soon he would be able to make his election slogan of `Sinhala Only‚Äô as the official language in 24 hours come true?

No president ever wanted to be the president of the United States as passionately as Washington. He deemed the pinnacle of his achievement to be the winning of independence from England and paving the way to the Federal Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he sat as its presiding officer till 1787. He most reluctantly accepted the presidency in 1789, and again in 1793. But in 1796, he was firm in his refusal, as he considered the presidency to be just an epilogue to his career, not his greatest achievement.

The wrath of a nation can be a fearful thing. In 2022 we saw its evolution and culmination in our own ‚ÄúAragalaya‚Äú, which sent the then president, a so called ‚Äúbattle hardened‚Äù war veteran and ‚Äúwarrior-statesman‚Äù, first in to exile and then to precipitate retirement.

We saw it again, just a couple of weeks ago, in the election of Sri Lanka‚Äôs ninth executive president, a villager from deeply rural Tambuttegama, the son of a surveyor‚Äôs assistant. That he was the first student from Tambuttegama Central College to gain university entrance, is another factor which attests to the absence of privilege and personal resources. His election is also an extension of the ‚ÄúAragalaya‚Äù, and a logical evolution of that movement, but without the drama and histrionics and, instead, that energy, that anger, legitimately channeled in to a quiet civic purpose.

Gajanayake urged him to announce his appointment only after the first session of the new parliament after the general election, though he was considered a talented officer while in the service of Abeysekara.
