The Sri Lankan government's lack of political commitment to meaningful accountability and justice is also noted, along with the ongoing impact of Sinhala Buddhism and human rights-affecting laws.

Mar. 5 (ICC) - The island nation looks set to give the nod to experienced players when deciding on their squad of 15 for the June event.

Chief selector Upul Tharanga has revealed Sri Lanka will favour experience over youth when deciding who will represent the side at this year's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

The 2014 T20 World Cup champions caused a shock recently when they recalled experienced wicket-keeper-batter Niroshan Dickwella for their ongoing T20I series with Bangladesh and Tharanga indicated this would be the norm ahead of this year's 20-over showcase in the USA and Caribean in June.

It means the likes of left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage and fellow youngsters Vijayakanth Viyaskanth and Shevon Daniel may have to bide their time and wait for further opportunities at the top level according to Tharanga.

"In T20s we need a wicket-taking option, which is why we opted for Jeffrey (Vandersay) over someone like Dunith (Wellalage)," Tharanga said.

### France becomes only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as constitutional right

*2024-03-05 09:04:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97734/france-becomes-only-country-to-explicitly-guarantee-abortion-as-constitutional-right) · `en`

French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in France’s constitution, making it the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

The historic move was proposed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years, and the vote during a special joint session of France’s parliament drew a long-standing ovation among lawmakers.

The measure was approved in a 780-72 vote in the Palace of Versailles. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975.

Many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. While a small group of protesters stood outside the joint session, there were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by Macron within hours of the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.

*2024-03-05 01:30:26* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-hardware-software-of-reconciliation/) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing a conference of over 300 members from inter-religious committees from across the country summed up his plan for national reconciliation in less than 20 minutes. The president was clear in his articulation. He spoke with no notes. There were no superfluities in his speech. He noted how racism and bigotry have become convenient tools for politicians to wield power and for religious leaders to maintain their authority. He pointed to lessons learned from prolonged use of these divisive tactics, which ultimately led the country into a devastating conflict. He took two questions from the audience and before the organisers of the conference could even thank him on stage he left the podium for his next meeting.

### Gaza war, Red Sea crisis and sea of issues for merchants

*2024-03-05 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gaza-war-Red-Sea-crisis-and-sea-of-issues-for-merchants/172-278222) · `en`

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza.

The Red Sea crisis, which is having a great impact on international trade, is unlikely to end anytime soon despite the US-led naval and air forces’ hitting Houthi targets in Yemen.

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. And that appears to be a far cry.

Neither the Israelis nor Hamas is willing to give in. Israel will not stop its brutal offensive until Hamas releases the 100 hostages it still holds, and Hamas will not release them so long as there is no ceasefire in Gaza.

Myself, MPs Hector Appuhamy and Nisroshan Perera were lobbying for justice for the Easter Sunday bomb victims

The Catholic vote had gone in favour of the UNP in the past. however SJB had captured a great portion of these votes in 2020

The Government promised to bring in Scotland Yard and carry out an international probe, but it has not kept its promise

It has reached a state where MPs in the Samagi Jana Balawgaya (SJB) have begun to admit that there are divisions within the party. One of the MPs who accept that there are disputes in the party is MP for Gampaha District Dr. Kavinda Jayawardhana. In an interview with Daily Mirror, the MP called for unity within the party. He stated that unity is of paramount importance when facing challenges posed by other parties during upcoming elections.

In January 2016, in a rare show of accountability, the General Secretary of the Government and Provincial Council Public Service Trade Union Federation, Ajith. K. Thilakarathne had taken up an issue of time squandered by public sector employees with the then President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. No trade union leader had dared before to complain against his own members.

In a letter addressed to both the leaders, Thilakarathne had pointed out that 60 percent of the 1.5 million public servants (both under the central government and provincial councils) were engaged in browsing the Internet, Face Book and other entertainment sites using the office computers and their own smart phones for over two hours of their daily eight-hour duty.

Also in attendance, to provide the right music for such an occasion, will be Esric Jackson with the band No Limit.

### Curiosity never killed the cat in a culture of ‘question’ and ‘challenge’

Exemplary, and effective leadership is grounded, amongst others, in an insatiable desire to do things differently

Whilst acknowledging the importance of policies, procedures, and processes in maintaining discipline and order in an organisation, I also believe that it must have, parallelly, a deliberately structured platform, vehicle, or mechanism to arouse the curiosity, harness new ideas and ignite the innovation DNA of its leaders and employees. A haven for those individuals who, routinely, question existing norms and push for incremental improvement and innovative solutions. History shows that organisations have benefitted from these challengers

We have all had the experience of a dreary boss who, with his/her stifling, and controlling behaviour, routinely shot down our, and our team’s, progressive ideas in an environment where all that mattered to the boss was to get the job done by the stipulated timeline and in line with the prevailing rules and procedure.

During the event, a number of experts from Pharmaceris shared their knowledge, expertise and treatment methodologies available in Sri Lanka for the treatment of Alopecia. Alopecia, commonly known as loss of hair, is a growing issue among middle-aged and older Sri Lankans. Research has shown that loss of hair has a negative impact on a person’s mental and emotional health as they may struggle with feelings of unattractiveness and be self conscious in social situations or avoid them altogether. It could cause issues of self esteem and may even lead to depression at times, thereby greatly disrupting the individual’s way of life.

### Policymakers and academics have long rejected the quantity theory of money

*2024-03-04 23:04:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Policymakers-and-academics-have-long-rejected-the-quantity-theory-of-money/4-759152) · `en`

Many modern quantity theorists accept that central banks do not target and control the cash base, but rather set interest rates leaving the market to determine the quantity of cash put into the system. They argue, however, that in setting interest rates central banks can, and do, target the money stock with a view to controlling inflation. Critics of the modern quantity theory of money have long argued that the money stock depends on loans, i.e., when a commercial bank makes a loan they debit the account of the entity they are lending to, and when commercial banks need cash to meet reserve requirements the central bank has to accommodate this demand

The modern quantity theory of money is basically an explanation of inflation (and the external balance) by an increase in the quantity of money held by the public, the ‘money stock’ that is due to an increase in the cash injected into the system by the central bank of a country (an increase in the ‘cash base’ of the system).
