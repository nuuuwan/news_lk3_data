The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $100 million policy-based loan to support Sri Lanka’s water supply and sanitation sector reforms to enhance the country’s resilience to climate change impacts and promote long-term sustainability.

The Water Supply and Sanitation Reform Program, composed of two subprograms of $100 million each, will contribute to a more resilient and sustainable delivery of water supply and sanitation services.

Subprogram 1 will establish policies and strategies nationally and for the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) while the subprogram 2 will support the implementation of reform actions and guidelines.

“Efficient delivery of safe and reliable water supply in Sri Lanka is limited by fragmented water resources management and exacerbated by climate change. This significantly affects the daily life of Sri Lankans—many of whom do not have access to piped water supply,” said Senior Urban Development Specialist Pedro Almeida.

### Congruence between compensation philosophy and generic strategy is key to staying competitive

From poor morale to low employee retention rates, the negative ripples of underpaid employees can be widespread and difficult to reverse

Notwithstanding the greatness of the organisation’s culture or the exciting variety in its benefits package, the probability of an employee performing per expectations at remuneration below market is extremely low. Performance-based compensation which pays for success is a way of avoiding increases in fixed pay which arise from factors which are unrelated to success. A compensation philosophy and strategy which is in sync with the generic operating strategy are musts. If a company is unable to match the market, it must exit the business. Simple as that

### Anura against post-1977 economy, dodgy on devolution, can’t resolve crisis

While AKD and the JVP-NPP have changed, they haven’t metamorphosed into enlightened economic modernisers. A key marker in a brand-new document confirms that. Without a rectification on this fundamental issue contained in what the NPP designates as a ‘Framework’, it would be very dangerous to the economy to vote for Anura as President this month. That key issue is the attitude to the economic transformation of 1977, i.e., Sri Lanka’s adoption of an Open Economy --before Thatcher and Reagan did

“…This trend was exacerbated after 1977 due to unplanned and unwise economic policies & corruption…”
