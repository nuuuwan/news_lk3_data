    "Achini Hansamali is a popular figure on social media, especially as a photographic model, and she is also a very keen reader of The Island newspaper.",
    "In fact, she has appeared in our Glam Scene and has also been featured in our Chit-Chat column.",
    "In 2023, she was crowned Miss Sri Lanka For Queen Of The Islands.",
    "Well, Achini is in the news again and this time the spotlight is on her debut film \u2018Elada Braa.\u2019",
    "Says Achini: I recently had the privilege of being part of the film \u2018Elada Braa,\u2019 where I played the role of \u2018Saara\u2019. This was my first film experience, and it was a memorable one.",
    "\u201cAs \u2018Saara\u2019, I may have had limited screen time, but the experience was invaluable. I feel honoured to have acted alongside incredibly talented senior artists who made this journey unforgettable.\u201d",
    "From a 21-year-old newcomer to being part of this project, Achini says she feels blessed.",
    "\u201cThe journey began over a year ago, and I believe I did my best as \u2018Saara,\u2019 despite it being my very first experience. I was really nervous, but I was very happy, too, as I was fortunate to work with senior artists, which was a great learning experience for me.\u201d",
    "Despite being a comedy, Achini went on to say that \u2018Elada Braa\u2019 has a beautifully crafted story that makes it suitable for all family members to watch together, adding \u201cand, funnily enough, my character was something like a gangster lady.\u201d",
    "According to Achini, the makeup artists did an exceptional job, transforming her with a wig that looked incredibly realistic.",
    "\u201cMy character\u2019s look was so convincing that many people asked if I had cut my long hair for the role!",
    "\u201cAs a model, I\u2019m used to working in front of the camera for photoshoots and fashion shows, but acting in a film was a different experience altogether. It wasn\u2019t easy, but I hope I did my best as \u2018Saara\u2019.\u201d",
    "When she was crowned Miss Sri Lanka For Queen OfThe Islands 2023",
    "This experience has sparked a desire in her to explore more acting opportunities, especially in films where she can play diverse and challenging characters, she says.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d love to take on roles that push my creative boundaries and allow me to grow as an actor. If teledramas offer interesting characters that resonate with me, I\u2019d consider them as well.\u201d",
    "\u201cSeeing myself on the big screen, for the first time, was a dream come true,",
    "\u201cMoreover, watching the film with my parents was a special moment. They\u2019ve always supported and encouraged me to pursue my passions, and I\u2019m grateful for their presence in my life.",
    "\u201cI also need to mention that I owe my selection for this film to Director Pujitha Senarathne Gunathilaka, and it was also a pleasure working with Pubudu Chathuranga, who was very humble throughout the shoot.",
    "The premiere of \u2018Elada Braa\u2019 was 28th August, 2025, at the Roxy Cinema, in Wellawatte.",
