  "original_body_lines": [
    "The grand old firm George Steuart has moved into the 190 \u2019s and is standing tall notwithstanding recent reversals as COVID and the country\u2019s bankruptcy.",
    "Few if any in the world will match that and I bow to the current Chairman and Board.",
    "When James Steuart, the Founder, a man of impeccable integrity, bequeathed his prime ten-acre property in 1870 to the Bishop of Colombo, he made it conditional that the proceeds from their sales should go to propagating his religious faith and to alleviate the suffering of people through a program of public welfare. Today, the Cinnamon Grand, St. Thomas Prep, Scotts Kirk Church are among the very prestigious building\u2019s standing on it.",
    "That benevolent gesture and his integrity became the foundation and philosophy of George Steuart in the ensuing years and invoked their share of blessings.",
    "How else could a company exclusively in plantation management for 140 years, have weathered the collapse of the coffee industry, two world wars, the nationalisation of plantations with no compensation to the Agency Houses, two brutal domestic insurrections, and the devastation caused to Steuart House by the Central Bank bomb. It was a privilege to have been with the firm through the last four vicissitudes and to have contributed towards each recovery.",
    "Today is a reflection of those precious values initiated by the Founder being firmly upheld by the company\u2019s outstanding personnel over the decades. A story of success made possible by their resilience and the inspirational leadership that was always synonymous with George Steuarts.",
    "As the firm enters yet another crucial decade, the sentiments of a Senior Partner Sir Thomas Villiers, of Adisham fame comes to mind: \u201cSee that ye hold fast the heritage we leave you.\u201d",
    "Indeed, the succeeding generations while meeting the many challenges have certainly lived up to that expectation."
