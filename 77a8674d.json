    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Provinces should utilize the powers granted by the 13th Amendment for economic development, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said, adding that devolution should not merely be a political concept but an economic reality.",
    "\u201cIf we examine the provisions of the 13th Amendment, there is ample authority to establish a robust local economy. We pledge not to intervene in those affairs,\u201d Wickremesinghe said at a dinner gathering with professionals in Jaffna on Thursday (4).",
    "\u201cThrough devolution, we can harness these powers and foster development. While devolution is often discussed in political terms, it\u2019s essential to enact laws that empower regions. Vocal advocacy without financial resources holds little value.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe acknowledged that the Western Province is the sole region capable of substantial independent spending, while others are financially dependent.",
    "\u201cThis situation warrants reconsideration. By utilizing the powers within the 13th Amendment, each province can chart its course to development. Put these powers into action.\u201d",
    "Decentralization would lead to the establishment of local and regional economies in various provinces, Wickremesinghe said, adding that there could be \u201cdistinct economies for the South, Central, North, and North-Western provinces, each capitalizing on its unique potential for agriculture, tourism, and other sectors.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe highlighted the potential for renewable energy in the Northern Province, and outlined plans for modernizing agriculture, initiatives to boost tourism, including cruise tourism and themed trails focused on religious and cultural sites.",
    "The Northern Province could be a hub for education, Wickremesinghe said, encouraging the establishment of universities and educational institutions. (Colombo/Jan5/2024)"
