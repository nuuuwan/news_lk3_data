    "On June 26, 2024, the OCC and Sri Lanka finalized the MoU, based on the main parameters of the debt treatment agreed in November 2023.",
    "The progress on the MoU had enabled the IMF staff to present to the IMF Executive Board the second review of Sri Lanka\u2019s EFF arrangement and thus open the way for approval of the third disbursement under the arrangement.",
