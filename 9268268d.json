    "Highlighting a dramatic rise in the use of performance-enhancing drugs at school and club level, Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) Director General Dr. Seevali Jayawickrama said that an intelligence office had been set up within SLADA with the help of Sri Lanka Police.",
    "A Senior Superintendent of Police has been appointed to overlook this intelligence operation, that would attempt to find out information of those who use and provide performance-enhancing substances during national meets and various practice sessions.",
    "\u201cA total of 1000 police officers have already been engaged in this intelligence operation, and once adequate laws are in place, this programme will be extended to enable all police officers around the island to find information and report it to the intelligence office,\u201d Dr. Jayawickrama said, at the conclusion of the 18th Asia/Oceania Region Intergovernmental Ministerial Meeting on Anti-Doping in Sport.",
    "Ministers from eight countries across the Asia/Oceania region and delegates from more than 36 countries participated in this event which was organized by SLADA in collaboration with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).",
    "\u201cEight athletes have tested positive for these performance-enhancing substances in 2022 alone, with three athletes already testing positive this year,\u201d he said adding that these positive tests had come from athletes engaging in rugby, weightlifting, powerlifting and athletics.",
    "\u201cWe have found that school rugby has become more vulnerable to doping mainly because of the huge pressure put on schools and their coaches by old boys, who heavily invest in the schools\u2019 sporting programme,\u201d Dr. Jayawickrama said.",
    "\u201cCoaches are under pressure to perform and produce immediate results and it is from that pressure that they influence these school children to take performance enhancing substances.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have found this to be the case with athletics as well,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately those who are caught refuse to disclose who is providing them with these banned substances, so no matter how many dopers we identify we are unable to find the root of the problem.\u201d",
    "Dr. Jayawickrama added that SLADA had been successful in catching dopers among athlete who could potentially represent the country at the Asian Games.",
    "\u201cWe have targeted the Asian Games and focused on ensuring that those who represent the country are clean of any drugs,\u201d he said.",
    "Dr. Jayawickrama also lauded the discipline of para-athletes who, despite winning medals at the Paralympics, Commonwealth Games, World Championships and Para-Asian Games, have not returned any positive tests indicating the use of performance enhancing substances.",
