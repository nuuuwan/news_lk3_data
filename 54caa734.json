    "\u201cI can say with great confidence that I have discussed (the matter) with the ICC. In a phone conversation, they informed that they will lift our ban soon. We have to receive the letter from them. I think we will be able to get it this week. I will present all the charges against Shammi Silva to the ICC at that same time,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "\u201cIt is the ICC\u2019s money. It is not the Sri Lankan government\u2019s money. Therefore, we have a small problem. But there is a law that we have brought in this country. That is the anti-corruption law.\u201d"
