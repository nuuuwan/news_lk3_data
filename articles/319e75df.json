  "original_body_lines": [
    "The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has requested the public to use water sparingly in light of the prevailing arid weather conditions.",
    "Deputy General Manager of the NWSDB Anoja Kaluarachchi explained that in the event the current extreme dry weather continues for the next two months, it is likely that water will have to be supplied on a shift-basis.",
    "However, she assured that sufficient water levels are currently available, and explained that the NWSDB is merely requesting the public to use water sparingly, as a precautionary measure.",
    "Kaluarachchi noted that thus far, no restriction or limitation of water supply has been implemented in any areas, and thus urged for consumes to call the 24-hour NWSDB hotline 1919 in the event such issues are experienced."
