    "In a groundbreaking move, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Ltd (SLICGL) has set a new global precedent by launching the world\u2019s first dedicated recognition and achiever scheme for general insurance sales professionals, the General Insurance Pinnacle Achiever (GIPA) Award. The landmark initiative shines a spotlight on the art of general insurance salesmanship, paving the way for expansion into international standards in sales excellence.",
    "Celebrating 60 years of strong market presence, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Ltd identified a crucial gap within the industry \u2013 the absence of a global, independent platform that specifically celebrates the dedication and success of general insurance sales professionals, promotes their development, and sets general insurance sales standards at the industry level.",
    "While the life insurance industry has established benchmarks including the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) and training programmes authorized by the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association (LIMRA), no equivalent exists for general insurance sales professionals.",
    "Moreover, while many large multinational insurers conduct internal sales awards in high level of events, none focus solely on recognising and developing general insurance salesmanship capabilities at a global level. GIPA aims to address this imbalance. Taking a proactive step, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Ltd is bridging the void, conceptualizing the global-first GIPA initiative, and giving due credit to general insurance salesmanship with a more sustainable approach in terms of business success and in terms of its contribution to industry sustainability.",
