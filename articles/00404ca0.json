    "A police sergeant has been sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 20,000 for taking a bribe of Rs. 500 from a trishaw driver for not instituting legal action against the latter over a traffic violation. The case, filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) against the errant cop, was heard before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis. The sergeant, found guilty on four rounds, has been ordered to serve the sentences concurrently in one year.",
    "It is hoped that aforesaid jail term, which is welcome, will have a deterrent effect on other corrupt cops who are also responsible for the increasing number of road accidents, which claim about seven to eight lives a day. The Fort Chief Magistrate\u2019s judgment has struck a responsive chord with the ordinary Sri Lankans who wish for the restoration of the rule of law.",
    "Now that a policeman has been sentenced to RI for taking a bribe of Rs. 500, what should be the punishment for the bribe takers who make millions of rupees by allowing the procurement of substandard and fake pharmaceutical drugs, and thereby endanger the lives of thousands of poor patients?",
    "It has now been revealed that the Cabinet was misled into approving emergency purchases of fake drugs, which have claimed several lives and cost the state coffers dear. The malefactors pretend that butter wouldn\u2019t melt in their mouths, and their kith and kin are claiming that their human rights have been violated! Life imprisonment will be too lenient a punishment for such heartless characters who are enriching themselves at the expense of poor patients\u2019 lives.",
    "Shouldn\u2019t those who cut corrupt deals, stole public funds, ruined the economy and bankrupted the country, inflicting untold suffering on the public be jailed for life? They have remained above the law and retained their hold on power.",
    "Those who neglected their duties and failed to prevent the Easter Sunday terrorist bombings in 2019, despite repeated warnings thereof, have not been punished. About 275 people including children perished and more than 500 others sustained injuries in those terror attacks which could have been prevented. What should be the punishment for them?",
    "The COPA (Committee on Public Accounts) has ordered that the CID be called in to probe a racket where a large amount of rotten fish was imported purportedly for manufacturing fertiliser in violation of the Customs Ordinance. The importer of rotten fish also deals in canned fish, the parliamentary committee has said. What should be the punishment for such serious transgressions?",
    "Bakery owners continue to fleece the public by selling loaves of bread which are consistently short weight. The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) does not conduct raids regularly. Are the CAA officials getting their palms greased? Who will probe them and bring them to justice? Shouldn\u2019t corrupt officials be sentenced to the same punishment as errant traders and bakers?",
    "Big-time millers are accused of creating an artificial shortage of rice to jack up prices and make a killing during the upcoming festive season. This, they do every year, with impunity. What action will the CAA take against these unscrupulous millers who are making unconscionable profits by exploiting both the farmer and the consumer alike?",
    "Chairman of COPF (Committee of Public Finance) Dr. Harsha de Silva has revealed that the milk powder pricing formula he was instrumental in preparing some years ago has been deep-sixed so that importers can exploit consumers. Shouldn\u2019t those who have facilitated the exploitation of the public in this dastardly manner be brought to justice?",
    "There are many other sharks swimming freely in the ocean of corruption that Sri Lanka is, and only sprats get netted.",
