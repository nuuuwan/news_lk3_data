### State-hood and survival: Tamils, Palestinians and self-determination

*2024-10-26 00:50:21* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/State-hood-and-survival-Tamils-Palestinians-and-self-determination/4-768427) ¬∑ `en`

Do Sri Lankan Tamil demands for a separate State or even ‚ÄòEelam‚Äô have the same status and legality within the international system as a Palestinian State?

Ultimately, the relative strengths and legitimacy of Palestinian claims to State-hood vs. Tamil claims to State-hood are based on the balance between the right to self-determination of one group vs. the right to maintain the existing territorial integrity of the other group. An interesting point to note is that in this thought experiment, the Northern Tamils are more analogous to the Jews than to the Palestinians. If this sounds counterintuitive, it is because comparisons of the two projects for State-hood are tenuous, as are attempts to make the rationale for one, a precedent for the other

### Peradeniya University student struggle of 1975-‚Äô76 and State suppression

*2024-10-26 00:46:57* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Peradeniya-University-student-struggle-of-1975-76-and-State-suppression/14-768426) ¬∑ `en`

The death of Peradeniya University student W.M. Weerasuriya, who was shot dead by police on 12 November 1976 during a student protest, was the beginning of the end of the then Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Her Government which took office in 1970 was deeply unpopular by then but the killing of Weerasuriya let loose public anger at her and led to the routing of the SLFP-led Government in the 1977 general elections.

Rajasinghe Bandara was a fellow student at the Peradeniya University at the time and decades later he has written about the experience and the State suppression of students in a book released recently on the 1975-1976 student movement.

Bandara who is now domiciled in the UK has written with a sense of personal loss on the authoritarian manner in which the student movement was crushed by the then Government and blood was spilt on the grounds of the University of Peradeniya.

### Potential Consequences Of Targeting Tourists

*2024-10-25 15:50:01* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/potential-consequences-of-targeting-tourists/) ¬∑ `en`

A group of 22 Israeli nationals departed from Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on Wednesday, October 23, due to heightened security warnings about potential terrorist threats in the Arugam Bay area. This evacuation follows increased vigilance across Sri Lanka, prompted by travel advisories from multiple embassies, including those of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Israel. These warnings specifically advised caution in regions like Arugam Bay, which has recently attracted a significant influx of Israeli tourists due to its reputation as a premier surfing destination.

The targeting of tourists, including those of Jewish descent, in Sri Lanka‚Äîor anywhere else‚Äîmust be unequivocally condemned. Such acts jeopardize innocent lives, tarnish a nation‚Äôs international reputation, and undermine its social and economic stability.

Ratan Tata, 86, former Tata Sons president, left property to foster dogs & staff. Unusual in India, common in West. Willed assets to lifelong care of Tito, his German Shepherd. Also gifted to long-time employees & assistant. Awards to future generations.

Writing property for dogs in Western countries is nothing new. But in India, it is very rare to write property. Ratan Tata has written property to everyone who has been with him till the end.

Tito adopted a foster dog 6 years ago. Ratan Tata had a different dog in the same name. Following the death of the dog, the newly adopted dog raised the same name. He has written property to maintain this tito for a lifetime.

Sri Lanka faces challenges in achieving strong, stable recovery. IMF Director Krishna Srinivasan notes progress but emphasizes need for further reform efforts and loan compliance. The new government prioritizes protecting vulnerable sectors. Long-term stability remains uncertain.

üü©

Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Department of Asia, said that Sri Lanka has to travel long before going on the path of a strong and stable recovery.

There is currently a widespread concept, and the unanimous concept is found. Sri Lanka has traveled a long way in carrying out the reforms found in Adalabadam in 2022, and has some successful success. All of you know it.

The new government has issued a dedication that the most severely striking expanses will be protected.

The next step is to reach the official compliance with all loans.

You have to go a long way before you go on the path of a strong and stable recovery.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka will revisit and discuss the Adani renewable energy project when a government delegation visits New Delhi in January next year on the invitation of the Indian government, a ruling National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) member said.

Before the presidential election the NPP said it will approve any projects without open tenders and review the Adani project approved under the previous government.

The aircraft, A32-673, was earmarked for donation to the Sri Lankan Air Force in May 2023. It will be supported in Sri Lanka for 12 months by Australia, before responsibility is turned over to the Sri Lankan Air Force.

It will be used to perform maritime domain awareness missions by the Sri Lankan Air Force, complementing a King Air 360ER provided by the US Government in early October.

A32-673 was fitted with an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance pod before delivery to the Sri Lankan Air Force.

### Sri Lanka given diesel saving fishing boat tech, advanced cooling to cut fish loss: FAO

*2024-10-25 12:37:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-given-diesel-saving-fishing-boat-tech-advanced-cooling-to-cut-fish-loss-fao-184884/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì The Food and Agricultural Organization and Norway have designed a bow which can be retrofitted to Sri Lanka‚Äôs multi-day fishing boats to cut fuel use, and also launched cooling system to cut fish losses.

Sri Lanka multi-day fishing boats typically carry ice to cool fish. This practice compromises quality, leading to post-harvest losses.

This results in an average quality loss of 41.4 percent in the catch from Sri Lanka‚Äôs multi-day fisheries, according to the Fish Loss and Waste (FLW) Assessment conducted by FAO in 2022‚Äì2023.

To address this challenge, FAO has installed an advanced cooling system on a newly constructed multi-day fishing vessel to ensure fish are kept at optimal temperatures throughout the voyage.

‚ÄúThis technology strengthens the resilience of fishing operations, ensuring higher-quality fish products reach the market while reducing waste and spoilage,‚Äù FAO said in a statement.
