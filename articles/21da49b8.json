  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Advocata Institute welcomes the decision by the Cabinet of Ministers, on the proposal of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policy, to formally close 33 non-operational State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) under Phase 2 of the government\u2019s state-sector reform program.",
    "The move, to be implemented through a Special Liquidation Unit under the Ministry of Finance, is a first step toward eliminating waste, improving fiscal discipline, and redirecting scarce resources to more productive sectors of the economy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s SOEs, numbering over 400 across 33 sectors and employing nearly 250,000 people, account for around 4.5% of the country\u2019s total public debt (guaranteed debt by treasury). Of these, around 130 have commercial interests, while the remainder are statutory or non-commercial entities. This press release focuses exclusively on the commercial SOEs plagued by weak management, political interference and a lack of transparency. The IMF has identified SOEs as a core governance and fiscal risk.",
    "Shutting down entities such as Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Lanka Cement PLC, Selendiva Investments Ltd, and Magampura Ports Management Company (Pvt) Ltd provides a premise for the government to pursue a broader rationale for SOE reform: addressing economic failures, supporting development, and safeguarding national interests. State ownership is warranted only where there is a clear economic or strategic justification\u2014typically when market failures prevent private actors from efficiently providing goods or services. The number of entities retained as SOEs should therefore be significantly reduced, focusing solely on those that are strategically important or justified by clear economic, strategic, or development objectives.",
    "While closures are essential, reform must also correct distortions due to a lack of competitive neutrality\u2014 the principle that all firms should compete on equal terms. SOEs that still hold significant positions in their markets, often enjoy state guarantees, preferential finance, or regulatory exemptions unavailable to private competitors.",
