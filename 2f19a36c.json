  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Islamic State group (IS) has said it carried out a bomb attack in Iran on crowds marking the anniversary of spymaster Qasem Soleimani\u2019s assassination by the US.",
    "The attack in Kerman in southern Iran killed 84 people and wounded many more.",
    "The death toll was revised down on Thursday morning by the head of Iran\u2019s emergency services from an earlier figure of 95.",
    "Iran initially said that Israel and the US must have been behind the attacks.",
    "IS made the claim via its channels on Telegram. The group later released an image on its news outlet Amaq showing two masked men, who it said were responsible for the attacks.",
    "The report stated that the first suicide bomber detonated his explosives belt among a gathering of people and that the second bomber triggered his explosives about 20 minutes later.",
    "IS named the attackers as \u201cOmar al-Muwahhid\u201d and \u201cSayfullah al-Mujahid\u201d. They are generic names that make it hard to ascertain if the attackers were Iranians or foreigners.",
    "IS has attacked civilians and security forces in Iran on a number of occasions in recent years.",
    "It welcomed the 2020 death of Gen Soleimani, whose militias fought against the group in Iraq for years.",
    "Earlier, President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s political deputy, Mohammad Jamshidi, blamed Israel and the US. However, the US said it had no indication that Israel was involved and dismissed any suggestion that Washington was involved.",
    "And as many Middle East watchers said at the time, this was not the way Israel operates inside Iran.",
    "Attacks there that have been presumed to be orchestrated by Israel\u2019s external spy agency, Mossad, have nearly always been precisely targeted assassinations of prominent nuclear scientists or military figures.",
    "It would not be in Israel\u2019s interests to squander its precious intelligence assets inside Iran by blowing up civilian mourners.",
    "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a \u201charsh response\u201d to the attacks.",
    "\u201cCruel criminals must know that they will be strongly dealt with from now on and undoubtedly there will be a harsh response,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement on Wednesday evening.",
    "Now that Islamic State (IS) has claimed they were behind it, even naming two suicide bombers they say were involved, an apology from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard is highly unlikely. The Tehran regime\u2019s hostility to the US and Israel is visceral and manifests itself on many fronts: in Lebanon, Iraq, Gaza and Yemen.",
    "Soleimani was seen as the most powerful figure in Iran after the supreme leader before he was killed in a US drone strike in neighbouring Iraq in 2020.",
    "Wednesday\u2019s attack comes amid heightened tensions in the region after the deputy leader of the Iran-backed Palestinian group, Hamas, was killed in an apparent Israeli drone strike in Lebanon.",
    "Footage broadcast by Iranian state TV showed large crowds were taking part in a procession along a road lined with banners featuring Qasem Soleimani when the explosions happened.",
    "People could be heard screaming and then seen running away in panic after one of the blasts.",
    "Iranian media reported the first bomb was detonated around 15:00 local time (11:30 GMT), about 700m (2,300ft) from the Garden of Martyrs cemetery around the Saheb al-Zaman mosque, in the eastern outskirts of Kerman.",
    "The second bombing took place about 15 minutes later, around 1km away from the cemetery, targeting people who had fled the first, they said.",
    "Kerman province\u2019s governor told state news agency Irna that both blasts happened outside security checkpoints and that authorities were sure they were caused by bombs. But he said it was not yet clear whether they were detonated remotely or by suicide attackers.",
    "The hardline Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, earlier cited sources as saying that \u201ctwo bags carrying bombs\u201d were apparently detonated \u201cby remote control\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe were walking towards the cemetery when a car suddenly stopped behind us and a waste bin containing a bomb exploded,\u201d a witness was quoted by Isna news agency as saying.",
    "\u201cWe only heard the sound of the explosion and saw people falling.\u201d",
    "As commander of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, Soleimani was an architect of Iranian policy across the region.",
    "He was in charge of the Quds Force\u2019s clandestine missions and its provision of guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence and logistical support to allied governments and armed groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas.",
    "Then-US President Donald Trump, who ordered the 2020 drone strike, described Soleimani as \u201cthe number one terrorist anywhere in the world\u201d and alleged that troops under his command had murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen over the previous two decades.",
    "Iran\u2019s government accused the US of an act of international terrorism and issued arrest warrants for Mr Trump and other officials."
