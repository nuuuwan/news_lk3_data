    "Cleantech (Pvt) Ltd, a leading provider of integrated waste management solutions, recently launched a ground-breaking project to encourage recycling and environmental sustainability in the suburban areas surrounding Rajagiriya, Angoda, Battaramulla, Narahenpita, and Kolonnawa.",
    "The main impact on these areas is a lack of recycling facilities and inappropriate waste dumping, which is a significant waste management issue. Taking this into account, Cleantech (Pvt) Ltd introduced an innovative electric bicycle fitted with a carriage, which is part of a pilot project, to deal with this matter. This e-bike will collect recyclable materials such as PET, plastic, electronic waste, and paper, directly from households and businesses in the area, which in turn, would help reduce pollution and promote a healtheir planet for future generations.",
    "With the launch of this e-bike, the Rajagiriya Sampath Piyasa recycling hub is upgraded as a convenient center for environmentally responsible citizens and corporations to drop off their recyclables providing a responsible solution. The e-bikes\u2019s capability to get through narrow streets and isolated areas makes it easier for households and businesses to take part in recycling efforts.",
