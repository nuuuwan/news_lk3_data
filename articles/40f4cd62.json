    "The Inter University Students\u2019 Federation (IUSF) has renewed its call for the government to allocate more state funds for education\u2014at least 6% of GDP; this is a demand Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya herself made when she was a prominent member of the Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Associations (FUTA). Dismissing the proposed educational reforms as ill-conceived and retrogressive, the ISUF has condemned what it describes as a government move to close down low-enrolment schools. He has reminded the government that the election manifesto of the NPP promises to ensure that every family will have a primary school, located within a three-km radius from its residence.",
    "The NPP government, which appears to treat its mandate as  carte blanche, has chosen to ignore protests. Power makes rulers impervious to reason, and at times drives them to act in such a way that they end up having to outrun protesters baying for their blood, as we saw here in 2022, in Bangladesh last year, and in Nepal very recently. There is no defence against a tsunami of public anger.",
    "General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers\u2019 Union (CTU) Joseph Stalin has made a very serious allegation. He says the Ministry of Education (MOE) has blatantly violated a Supreme Court (SC) order. A circular the MOE has issued specifying that the number of students per class in a public school is 45 runs counter to a 2012 SC order that the number students per class be limited to 35, with effect from 2016, Stalin has said, pointing out that the proposed educational reforms have also set the number of students per class at 35. It is hoped that the MOE will provide an explanation and/or take remedial action if it has violated the SC order in question.",
    "The closure of small, rural schools is not of recent origin. It has happened under successive governments, and reams have been written about it. However, the NPP government, led by the \u2018Marxist\u2019 JVP, was expected to handle the issue differently by addressing the root causes thereof instead of continuing the policy of closing down schools. But the current administration has chosen to emulate its predecessors.",
    "In July 2025, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, during a parliamentary debate on educational reforms, said 98 state-run schools had been without any new admissions for years. Pointing out that about 15% schools had fewer than 50 students each, and many others had fewer than 100 students each, he said a strategy to overcome the problem might necessitate the permanent closure of some of those seats of learning. According to teachers\u2019 trade unions and organisations dedicated to protecting universal free education, most of these low-enrolment schools are situated in rural areas.",
    "Research on school attendance in Asia and Africa has brought out fairly strong evidence that poor accessibility to school leads to higher drop-out rates. Besides, as we argued in a previous editorial comment on the proposed educational reforms, the government must refrain from plunging head first into closing down the low-enrolment schools; instead, it should make a serious effort to explore ways and means of making them attractive to more students who cannot attend urban schools for reasons other than transport issues. Otherwise, there might be an increase in the school dropout rate in the rural sector.",
    "During the aforementioned parliamentary debate, President Dissanayake lamented that the school dropout figures had risen from 16,673 in 2019 to 20,759 in 2022, before plateauing at 20,755 in 2024. Everything possible must be done to bring these figures down in the shortest possible time. A steep school dropout rate is much more than a mere statistic; it is a symptom of systemic social issues. The closure of more rural schools is likely to worsen the problem of dropouts by making access to school difficult.",
    "The CTU General Secretary has urged the government to abandon its plan to cluster selected schools in some education zones in Colombo. A haphazard clustering of schools will affect both students and teachers badly, he has warned. What the government has reportedly undertaken is a delicate task to be carried out cautiously, if at all, with the concurrence of all stakeholders. The Education Ministry panjandrums should exercise restraint, without acting like the proverbial bull in a china shop.",
