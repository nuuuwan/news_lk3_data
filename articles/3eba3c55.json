  "original_body_lines": [
    "Wickremesinghe had explained the reasons as to why he did not want a SJB\u00a0 crossover at this point of time to both party leaders as well as\u00a0 potential SJB defectors. Ranil said that he was planning to contest the\u00a0 Presidential election as an independent non -party candidate backed by\u00a0 an assorted alliance of parties, groups and individuals.\u00a0 He would\u00a0 declare his candidacy in June or early July. When that happened\u00a0 Ranil\u00a0 wanted\u00a0 everyone including SJB MPs to support him by joining\u00a0 the\u00a0 alliance backing him. As such he did not want crossovers at this\u00a0 juncture.",
    "It appears therefore that Ranil will proclaim his presidential candidacy\u00a0 in June or early July. This will be followed by the formation of an\u00a0 alliance or coalition of parties, groups and individuals supporting his\u00a0 candidacy. The spadework would have been done already. Therefore the\u00a0 alliance would be active almost immediately. Thereafter\u00a0 parties and\u00a0 persons can join it or associate\u00a0themselves with it.",
    "May Day was at one time a significant event of the workers, for the workers and by the workers.\u00a0 It is not so nowadays where the working class has been relegated to the back seat. The political class has taken over. The rhetoric however echoes and re-echoes on May Day but the reality is different. The May Day events have been turned into a political exercise where competing political parties engage in a show of strength by mobilising huge crowds.",
    "May 1, 2024 saw-according to some newspapers-41 May Day rallies, meetings or seminars being held throughout the country. Other newspapers\u00a0 lowered the number to 22. Pride of place was given to Colombo where the UNP, JVP/NPP, SLPP and SJB\u00a0 held their rallies. All four parties had big crowds but the attendance was highest at the JVP rally. Furthermore the JVP rallies in Matara and Anuradhapura also had large crowds. Compared to the \u201cThun Sinhala\u201d rallies the JVP rally in Jaffna was a poor show.",
    "The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) which is the largest trade union representing plantation workers of\u00a0 Indian descent held its rally in Kotagala. The CWC is a constituent of the Government headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. CWC General Secretary Jeevan Thondaman is a Cabinet Minister in the Government.\u00a0 Ranil Wickremesinghe was the chief guest at the huge CWC rally.",
    "President Wickremesinghe brought \u201cglad tidings of\u00a0 great joy\u201d to the workers\u00a0 gathered in Kotagala.\u00a0 He announced\u00a0 to a wildly cheering audience that the daily wage of plantation workers had been raised from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,700. The 700 rupee increase amounted to a 70% pay rise. The president displayed a copy of the Gazette proclamation to the people. The plight of the plantation workers has prompted many to describe them as the \u201cwretched of the up-country earth\u201d. The daily wage increase would no doubt\u00a0 provide a degree of economic relief to them.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe also addressed the UNP rally at Maradana in Colombo. There were no grand announcements as in the case of the Kotagala rally. President Wickremesinghe spoke about the difficult situation in which he took over as President and of the economic progress achieved so far. Ranil repeated his appeal\u00a0 to the main Opposition parties to\u00a0 cooperate with the Government in uplifting the country economically. He urged the SJB and JVP to work with him in implementing the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again, Ranil made no pointed reference to the forthcoming presidential election or about his plans to contest polls.",
    "Both the SJB and UNP May Day Rallies were disappointments in another sense. Prior to May Day there was much speculation in the media that a number of MPs from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)\u00a0 would climb the SJB stage on May Day thereby indicating they had defected from the SLPP. Likewise there was speculation that some SJB Parliamentarians would mount the UNP stage on May 1st. Neither of these anticipated crossovers took place.",
    "I do not know why the much-touted appearance of SLPP\u00a0 Parliamentarians\u00a0 on the SJB stage did not happen. Despite the speculation, I had not written anything about it as I felt it was highly improbable.\u00a0 However, I did refer to the possibility of some SJB parliamentarians mounting the UNP stage on May Day in the second part of this article published last week. As such I probed the nonappearance of the Telephone Party MPs\u00a0 and learn the reasons for the non -event.",
    "Apparently arrangements had been made for\u00a0 fourteen MPs\u00a0 \u00a0from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to cross over to the Government side by appearing on the UNP stage on May Day. Ten of these were persons who had been Cabinet ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers in the \u201cGood Governance\u201d Government headed by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe from 2015 to 2019. The SJB hierarchy had suspicions about this. Some SJB Bigwigs were engaged in \u201csweet and sour\u201d talks with the potential dissidents to prevent them from pole vaulting.",
    "In an unexpected turn of events the crossover did not take place. This was not because of pressure by the SJB high command. It was due to the intervention of President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself. When Ranil got to know about the crossover plan hatched by his UNP colleagues, he had vetoed it. The UNP leader had communicated with his party deputies involved in the exercise and told them to call it off. He had also got in touch with some of the SJB parliamentarians concerned and asked them to delay their defection plans.",
    "Wickremesinghe had explained the reasons as to why he did not want a SJB crossover at this point of time to both party leaders as well as potential SJB defectors. Ranil said that he was planning to contest the Presidential election as an independent non -party candidate backed by an assorted alliance of parties, groups and individuals.\u00a0 He would declare his candidacy in June or early July. When that happened\u00a0 Ranil wanted\u00a0 everyone including SJB MPs to support him by joining\u00a0 the alliance backing him. As such he did not want crossovers at this juncture.",
    "This was why the SJB Parliamentarians\u00a0 did not appear on the UNP platform as expected. Nevertheless some top SJB figures were conspicuous by their absence on the SJB party stage on May Day. As far as the UNP Mayday was concerned only one MP elected on the SJB ticket in 2020 was present on the UNP stage. This was\u00a0 Badulla district MP Vadivel Suresh.",
    "The outspoken Vadivel Suresh\u00a0 has been estranged from Sajith Premadasa for several months.\u00a0 Suresh had organized a meeting of Tamil plantation workers in the Badulla district. Sajith was scheduled to address it. Thousands of worker had forfeited their half-day pay in order to attend the event. Sajith had backed out at the last minute saying he was ill. To Suresh\u2019s chagrin, the Badulla district MP discovered that Premadasa had lied to him about being sick.\u00a0 The leader of the Opposition had gone to a meeting with Sinhala people in the Moneragala district.",
    "Angry over this deception and the shabby treatment meted out to the Badulla district Tamil plantation workers, Suresh demanded that Premadasa apologize to the workers. Sajith agreed but\u00a0 did not do as he promised. Suresh therefore began functioning independently. He has been voting with the Government in Parliament. More\u00a0 importantly Suresh is the General Secretary of the influential Lanka\u00a0 Jathika Estate Workers Union (LJEWU). This has now been brought back under the aegis of the UNP. Hence Suresh\u2019s appearance on the UNP stage was no surprise but not much\u00a0 notice was taken of it.",
    "There was however another surprise. Though MPs elected on the SJB ticket did not cross, a single MP elected on the SLPP ticket did cross over on May Day. Moneragala district MP\u00a0 Gayashan Nawananda mounted the UNP stage on May Day.\u00a0 Moreover he brought\u00a0 800 supporters\u00a0 along with him for the UNP rally. Nawananda, a nominee of Vasudeva Nanayakkara on the SLPP List in 2020\u00a0 has declared himself an independent after the \u201cAragalaya\u201d.",
    "Nawananda\u2019s\u00a0 presence with 800 supporters was indeed a pleasant surprise to the UNP. Since President Wickremesinghe did not want defections or crossovers at this juncture, Nawananda was not lionised as he ought to have been at the UNP rally. Speaking to reporters the Moneragala MP said\u00a0 it was President Ranil Wickremesinghe who can steer the country forward during these trying times. The MP said\u00a0 his support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe should be considered as his support for the country.",
    "Ranil\u2019s decisive action in stopping or postponing the SJB MP crossover at this point in time is due to his evolving strategy in facing the 2024 presidential poll. As stated in the second part of this article last week, Ranil Wickremesinghe intends to project himself on a personal level as a presidential candidate because he regards himself as the best choice. He does not want to be a party nominee. Ranil\u00a0 told\u00a0 Party members that this election would not be a party vs party election. It would be more of a clash between personalities.",
    "Therefore, Wickremesinghe would not have a party label. Instead, he would be an independent\u00a0 non-party common candidate (Nirpakshika Podu Apekshaya) backed by a group of parties, organizations and key individuals. He would come forward as a \u201cnational candidate\u201d backed by people from all ethnicities, religions, regions and all walks of life. In short, Wickremesinghe would be an independent candidate backed by a coalition or alliance.\u00a0 \u00a0He will have the backing of the alliance but will not be an alliance candidate.",
    "What is importantly noteworthy is that Ranil will be an independent, non-party candidate and not a nominee of the coalition or alliance. This coalition or alliance would not be a collection of political parties alone. It would be an assortment\u00a0 of parties, segments of parties and party individuals. People may join forces cutting across party lines or political alignments. Party members and groups would \u201cDe-align\u201d from earlier stances and \u201cRe-align\u201d in support of Wickremesinghe.",
    "There was a time when Ranil was toying with the idea of getting some MPs of the SJB to join his Government. He interpreted that move as a re-unification of the UNP rather than the fragmenting of the SJB. Most MPs of the SJB were from the UNP or aligned with the UNP who had split with the grand old party and\u00a0 hitched their wagons to the Sajith Premadasa star only because they wanted to win elections. Very few of them were hostile or opposed to Wickremesinghe.",
    "Ranil\u2019s attempts to get back some SJB parliamentarians were proving successful when Basil Rajapaksa threw\u00a0 a spanner in the works. The SLPP insisted that if an SJB MP was brought into the Government and made a minister, it must be evenly matched by an SLPP MP also being appointed a minister. Earlier Ranil had resisted all attempts by Basil to get some SLPP stalwarts inducted into the Cabinet. Among these was Kalutara MP Rohitha\u00a0 \u201cRatharang\u201d Abeygunawardena.",
    "When\u00a0 SJB Kalutara MP Dr.Rajitha Senaratne was about to join the\u00a0 Government, \u201cRatharang\u201d\u00a0 demanded that he too should be made a minister. Appointing Ratharan as a minister was disfavoured by Ranil. So Rajitha\u2019s crossover was put on hold.",
    "Ranil was dependent on SLPP votes in Parliament but he wanted to have the ministers he preferred in Cabinet. Basil Rajapaksa wanted to keep Ranil dependent on the SLPP. He did not want Wickremesinghe to strengthen himself by getting MPs from the SJB or elsewhere. In this tricky situation Ranil chose not to bring in new ministers. Thus even the UNP\u2019s solitary MP Wajira Abeywardana was not made a minister.",
    "With the\u00a0 Presidential election drawing near Ranil\u2019s evolving strategy to win the presidency too began\u00a0 changing. Instead of getting MPs from other parties to break away and support him as\u00a0 individuals or\u00a0 in groups, Ranil wanted\u00a0 them to do so en masse. Instead of garnering support in trickles, he wants a flood. Instead of creating ripples, Ranil wants a wave. What Ranil wants to implement is a wave strategy to win.\u00a0 He wants a \u201cRanil Ralla or pro-Ranil wave of support from multiple parties and MPs. He wants to ride the crest of this wave to win the 2024 Presidency.",
    "It must be noted that\u00a0 Ranil has\u00a0 not openly declared his candidacy so far. When questioned, he sidesteps or diverts. As Bill Clinton famously said \u201cIt\u2019s the economy stupid\u201d, Ranil too emphasises that reviving the economy is of paramount importance. So when asked about the presidency, he talks about the need to repair the economy and emerge as a non-bankrupt nation first. That is his vision and mission. Contesting the presidency is to continue with that mission. Thus it is open knowledge that Ranil Wickremesinghe will throw his hat into the presidential stakes ring when he is satisfied that a milepost in economic progress has been reached.",
    "It appears therefore that Ranil will proclaim his presidential candidacy in June or early July. This will be followed by the formation of an alliance or coalition of parties, groups and individuals supporting his candidacy. The spadework would have been done already. Therefore the alliance would be active almost immediately. Thereafter\u00a0 parties and persons can join it or associate themselves with it.",
    "This is where\u00a0 Wickremesinghe\u2019s envisaged wave strategy comes in. The UNP,\u00a0 Dinesh Gunawardene\u2019s MEP, Thondaman\u2019s CWC,\u00a0 Devananda\u2019s EPDP,\u00a0 Athaulla\u2019s NC, Pillaiyan\u2019s TMVP who are all part of the Government will join the alliance and declare support.",
    "On another level the group of SLPP cabinet ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers led by Prasanna Ranatunga would declare support. The\u00a0 \u201cindependent\u201d group of SLPP dissidents led by Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and SLPP Backbencher group led by Nimal Lanza will also follow suit.",
    "Ranil\u2019s main target however is the UNP break-away SJB and the Tamil and its\u00a0 Muslim party allies. According to UNP circles talks have been almost finalised in this regard.\u00a0 A large number of MPs from the SJB will start joining the pro-Ranil alliance in groups and as individuals.\u00a0 \u00a0Thereafter the Tamil and Muslim parties aligned with the SJB like the Rishad Bathiudeen led\u00a0 ACMC, Rauff Hakeem led SLMC and Mano Ganesan led TPA are also expected to join the alliance.",
    "This process\u00a0 by itself\u00a0 would be akin to a wave of support for Wickremesinghe who hopes to ride the crest of this winning wave. He does not want trickles or ripples . He wants a wave or a \u201cRanil Ralla\u201d.",
    "There are however some key questions.\u00a0 Will all the parties and groups back this\u00a0 pro-Ranil alliance \u201c as expected?\u00a0 Will there be splits in some parties due to this? What will the Tamil nationalist parties representing the North -Eastern\u00a0 Tamils do? Above all, how will the Rajapaksa led SLPP respond to this? Finally what are the chances of the Wickremesinghe Wave-Ranil Ralla strategy succeeding?\u00a0 These questions will be delved into in greater detail in the fourth and final part of this article."
