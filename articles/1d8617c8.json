    "According to data from the Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka\u2019s fruit consumption highlights a growing demand that exceeds current domestic production capabilities. With an annual requirement estimated at 19.6 million metric tons, efforts are underway to bridge this gap through increased agricultural output.",
