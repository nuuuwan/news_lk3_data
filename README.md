### Honduras ex-President Hernandez sentenced to 45 years in prison on US drug conviction

Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses.

The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds.

A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution.

He also said jurors saw through Hernandez’s “polished demeanor” during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense.

### Restriction of Credit: Will the news truly harmony with Sri Lanka?

*2024-06-27 08:08:08* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cpv3dy0wgnwo) · `si`

Sri Lanka has successfully restructured $10 billion in loans with major official bilateral creditors, aiming to alleviate its economic crisis. This move, however, raises questions about the country's financial stability and the credibility of such announcements amidst ongoing economic challenges.

The restructuring includes significant debts owed to China, India, and Japan, among others, but excludes commercial sovereign bonds totaling around $14.73 billion. The government's optimism contrasts with concerns over the sustainability of the debt and the potential impact on the country's creditworthiness.

### Can the presidential election without 'flowers, temples'' can't win?

*2024-06-27 04:02:10* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cd11r2vdkydo) · `si`

Buddhism's influence on Sri Lanka's politics is profound, from its introduction by King Devanampiya Tissa to modern politicians leveraging Buddhist symbols and practices for electoral gains. Historical figures like King Dutugemunu and SWRD. Bandaranaike utilized Buddhist support effectively. However, critics argue that this reliance on religious symbolism for political advantage risks undermining the true principles of Buddhism and could lead to societal decay.

🟩

History testifies that the Devanampiya introduced Buddhism in Tissa since the king of Tissa.

Accordingly, the kings ruled by the kings of Lakdiva have seen that the civilians acted accordingly.

Archaeologists have also pointed out that Buddhism has directly affected the building of a civilized society without a specific religious discipline.

The Constitution of Sri Lanka shall be Buddhist?

The dental relics brought to Sri Lanka about the 4th century BCE later became a symbol of state.

The king controlling the Lakdani relics early in the early days was assigned to a symbol of protecting noonomity.

Meanwhile, the facts of the history sources appear that the monk's direct blessing has been given to King Dutugemunu to unite the country.

King Dutugemunu had a good relationship with the Maha Vihara.

However, many historical analysts think that the Mahavamsa, who is a small space for the Maha Viharaya, who have not been a close role in the Maha Vihara.
