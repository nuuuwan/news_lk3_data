    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will see no tariff revision on electricity in the foreseeable future as the government has decided to revise prices biannually in January and July, Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said.",
    "\u201c[The state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)] has planned for an uninterrupted supply of power islandwide throughout the year with no scheduled power cuts. Currently, full capacity of available power plants are in use for power generation,\u201d the minister tweeted on Monday August 07.",
    "Wijesekara said a meeting had been held at the president\u2019s office yesterday with the CEB and the Irrigation Department. Options related to ensuring a continuous power supply with no scheduled power cuts and the maximum water that can be released for agriculture will be shared with the cabinet of ministers on Monday, he said.",
    "\u201cDetails related to the power generation for next 12 months, release of water for agriculture, hydro power capacity, thermal power options available will be shared and discussed,\u201d he said.",
    "Paddy farmers in the Walawe zone of Sri Lanka have been protesting for over two weeks over the authorities not issuing water for agriculture in order to release water from the Samanala Wewa to the Udawalawa Reservoir. Providing an uninterrupted supply of power to the Southern Province was cited as the reason.",
    "Minister Wijesekara said discussion to settle the dispute between the land owner and the CEB to complete the ADB financed Polpitiya-Hambantota transmission line has been set for August 11 by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).",
    "\u201cThe 150-km transmission line connecting the southern province has come to stop in the last three months due to a dispute over the government valuation for a 650 meter stretch of land the lines are connected through.",
    "\u201cIf the dispute is settled the work can be completed in four days. The CEB has already paid 2,500 other individuals compensation on government valuation and completed the work in the 150 km stretch over those areas,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Aug07/2023)"
