    "President of the Government Medical Officers' Forum Dr. Rukshan Bellana charged that Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was soliciting bribes, causing the downfall of the health sector of the country.",
    "The senior medical administrator also alleged that the Director General of Health appeared to be more focused on taking part in foreign tours rather than attending to his duties.",
    "\"We exposed the Minister's attempt to offer the Director General of Health Services a seventh tour this year,\u201d Dr. Bellana charged.",
    "\"On some days, he lands in Sri Lanka in the morning, and by evening he is on another flight. We wonder if he is the Health Services Director General of Sri Lanka or of the World Health Organization. That's how frequently he travels,\" Dr. Bellana said."
