  "original_body_lines": [
    "A new economic team, representing SL has gone into a meeting with the IMF. A President Media Division release dated October 2, 2024, says that the IMF visit was to hold discussions on the progress of the IMF programme and the release of the fourth tranche and that the following \u201ceconomic team\u201d has been appointed by the new government for discussions with the IMF.",
    "This is the team \u2013Anil Jayantha, Chair of the NPP Economic Policy Council & Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs & Finance, Duminda Hulangamuwa, Senior Advisor to the President, Sunil Handunnetti, JVP Politician, Seetha Bandara Ranathunga, Sunil Gamage, Nandasiri Keembiyahetti, O. G. Dayaratne Banda and Amarasena Athukorala.",
    "I spoke about this new team and their possible role in discussions with the IMF, with a prominent SL economist, who had, since 2015, been educating the Sri Lankan people about economics, that fabled subject, about which the majority of not only the Sri Lankan people but also Sri Lankan politicians, know little.",
    "\u201cDid you see the NPP team that met the IMF? Much like a Gota Viyathmaga team\u201d,",
    "I told this US economics professor and ex Central Banker from Sri Lanka, Vdhura Tennekoon, Assistant Professor of Economics at Indiana University, USA. He is also known more widely as economatta (\u0d89\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0db1\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7\u0dcf), his popular blog and facebook page ID. )",
    "\u201d Yes. But who else do they have? These are the economists they have,\u201d",
    "\u201cWhere is Mahinda Siriwardene (the Treasury Secretary) and Nandalal (Governor Central Bank)?\u201d, I responded.",
    "\u201cThey will be in the team anyway. The issue I see is, how helpless two of them will be.\u201d, Professor Tennekoon replied.",
    "\u201cYou said these people will stay on course,\u201d I reminded Professor Tennekoon of what he had consistently claimed in his articles. \u201cWith people like Dr. Keembiyahetti on the team, wouldn\u2019t that be challenging?\u201d",
    "(A bit of context, Dr. Nandasiri Keembiyahetti is a teacher of economics at Sri Lanka\u2019s University of Ruhuna. He does not have much truck with wholesome, liberal, capitalist concepts of the economy such as market forces determining the price of goods. Recently, when the price of eggs went down, immediately after the ascension of the new regime, he posted a single line on his Facebook page- \u201cSo now you see into whose pocket that extra Rs 10 went!\u201d meaning that the old lot had pocketed Rs 10 per egg and when the new lot assumed power, they had stopped, leading to the immediate egg price drop. However, when the egg price started going up again, Dr. Keembiyahetti prudently refrained from saying that the new lot too had now started pocketing their share!)",
    "\u201cIf they [Nandalal and Siriwardene] stay silent and allow the NPP team to talk, it is like endorsing those views. That will make them fools. If they talk against the team, it will be portrayed as a betrayal of people\u2019s mandate,\u201d Professor Tennekoon went on, referring to the dilemma that the liberal economists, Nandalal and Siriwardene will face in those meetings.",
    "This \u201cMandate Fright\u201d is actually what forced the Central Bank to disregard the best interests of the SL economy and obey the unsound directives of the government during the unfortunate Gota years, and even during the more fortunate (but just as unsound) Mahinda years. It was exactly to prevent politicians, waving the people\u2019s mandate card, from frightening the Central Bank into compliance with political agendas against their better judgement, that the Central Bank Independence Act was enacted.",
    "Ominously, the NPP economic expert Harshana Sooriyapperuma, asked if they accept an independent Central Bank, only hemmed and hawed at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce economic forum, held to determine which party catered to the best interests of the Sri Lankan economy during its current knife edge recovery phase.",
    "\u201cThey [Nandalal and Siriwardene] have to participate because of their official roles,\u201d Professor Tennekoon went on.",
    "\u201cDid you foresee this? You didn\u2019t did you? You thought those people who expect the NPP to make a mess of IMF negotiations will be surprised and disappointed,\u201d I asked pointedly, for in Prof Tennekoon\u2019s economatta articles he had always painted a fairly optimistic picture of the IMF program under an NPP government.",
    "\u201cThis team was expected to represent the government. Who else could have? So, that is not a surprise.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo what could happen?\u201d I asked hoping for a soothing answer, instead of which I got this,",
    "\u201cAt the meeting they will realize that they do not have much room to negotiate,\u201d adding",
    "\u201cbut the team is \u2019stronger\u2019 than I thought. It looks like they are determined to negotiate with the IMF.\u201d",
    "\u201cI always felt you were too optimistic about these people carrying on as usual.\u201d, I said referring to economatta\u2019s unwillingness to renounce the NPP in his articles as economic bad news.",
    "Professor Tennekoon responded, \u201cThe IMF team is not in a \u201cnegotiation mode\u201d as they think. They are professionals, not politicians, and not prepared for or skilled in negotiations.",
    "\u201cI am optimistic because either way it is good for the country.\u201d",
    "Not trusting this optimism, I ventured, \u201cCould the same thing that happened when Basil and Cabraal were at helm and came out with their own analysis contrary to the IMF assessment happen? \u201cEither way, good for the country!\u201d",
    "Professor Tennekoon replied, \u201cThere are two possibilities; (a) They will come to an agreement with IMF and things will proceed as should be; (b) No agreement and the programme will not continue. The government will have to face the consequences quickly. They will not have a voice anymore among the people. That is good from a long term perspective.\u201d",
    "Professor Tennekoon also admits that he was pessimistic when Ranil Wickremesinghe became president and claims he has been proved right.",
    "I asked, \u201cWhy were you pessimistic when RW became president?\u201d",
    "Professor Tennekoon gave me a \u2018you have to lose to win and win to lose\u2019 type of answer;",
    "\u201cRW has been doing the right thing but without a clear mandate from people. I think the assumption of his and the people around him was that he will have the people\u2019s mandate when they could see results. He has clearly shown results that people have seen but his actions were not endorsed by the people. No policy action is successful without people\u2019s mandate. If RW won this election, he could have been successful in implementing the required reforms.\u201d",
    "\u201cPerhaps, people haven\u2019t seen this,\u2019 I protested, \u201cmaybe, more time was needed.\u201d",
    "\u201cPeople had two issues,\u201d Prof. Tennakoon answered, \u201cthe economic crisis was just one issue. People had an issue with the political culture and many of them thought if the latter is fixed the economy will thrive. They have to learn by trial and error. No other way. That can only happen (under the circumstances) if NPP can rule for several years.\u201d",
    "\u201cI think the Yahapalana government was a mistake. So many groups were together simply to defeat MR but MR was still popular. If he had another chance, the economy would have collapsed earlier. Somewhere in 2016 or 2017,\u201d Professor Tennekoon surmised, delving into the backstory before delivering his prediction on the current situation, \u201cPeople will realize that the political culture is not everything. Then the economy will be their focus.\u2019",
    "\u201cYou said none of this before elections\u201d, said I, \u201cYou said whoever comes will have to follow the IMF program, no choice.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes. I still say that,\u201d insists Professor Tennekoon, \u201cIf the government deviates, the economy can\u2019t survive long.\u201d",
    "\u201cI think all those people in the \u201ceconomic team\u201d are unorthodox economists, right?,\u201d I asked, voicing bewilderment at the new government\u2019s want of economists (Neither Anil Jayantha nor Harshana Rajakaruna are professional economists). Only Duminda Hulangamuwa is liberal. But he is not an economist,\u201d I went on.",
    "Agreeing with me that as far as he knows, the new economic team does seem to be afflicted with an overdose of unorthodoxy, Professor Tennekoon raised a red flag: \u201cThe more serious issue is who do they represent? Anil Jayantha and Hulangamuwa, as I know, have been appointed as advisors and therefore they may represent the President and through the President the government and people of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cBut what about others? They are an economic council of a political party, not of Sri Lanka. I don\u2019t think they have any power to negotiate with the IMF on behalf of Sri Lanka. Maybe the President has delegated that power to the economic council of his party.\u201d",
    "This brought up important question. What exactly was the purpose of this IMF visit and what was the \u201ceconomic team\u201d doing in these discussions? \u201cDid this IMF team come here for the review (the third review) prior to releasing the fourth tranche?\u201d I asked Professor Tennekoon.",
    "He replied,\u201dI saw somewhere that this is a courtesy visit. That usually happens after a government change when a country is in an IMF program. I saw nowhere that they came for the review. They will make a public statement soon.\u2019",
    "It turns out that they did not really come for the review. According to the press release issued by the IMF after the visit, \u201cThe IMF team will continue its close engagement with Sri Lanka\u2019s economic team to set a date for the third review of the IMF-supported program.\u201d",
    "According to Harsha de Silva, ex-MP, too, the third review which has to precede the fourth tranche will only happen once the new government has presented the new Budget. He said this at an interview with Neth News.",
    "I then asked Vidhura Tennekoon the most burning question on everyone\u2019s mind; \u201cNow, about AKD saying we want to go to IMF targets through alternative ways, while giving tax relief to people, is there any meaning to this ? Are they planning to use Ranil\u2019s over performed primary surplus to give tax relief or are they planning to use income obtained from plugging major tax leaks in places such as Customs and Excise? (This is what they said before elections)\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Professor Tennekoon admitted, \u201cProbably the first way.\u201d",
    "I asked him then, \u201cChathuranga Abeysinghe said, in an interview before elections, that they were going to plug a massive leakage and that was how they plan to cover losses incurred through VAT and other cuts. Is that a viable route?\u201d",
    "\u201cCollecting unpaid taxes is a part of the usual process,\u201d said Tennekoon matter of factly.",
    "\u201cThe faces of the team who met with the IMF team gives an idea about what happened there,\u201d he said.",
    "I asked, \u201c\u2018Maybe they are going to cut VAT and shift the burden to the better-off via income tax.\u201d",
    "\u201cAlso perhaps increase spending on aswesuma, health and education?\u201d I asked, for these are ways of \u201crelieving people\u201d too.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see. Whatever it is, it should be within the IMF parameters,\u201d concluded Professor Vidhura Tennekoon sensibly.",
    "I will end with a final fact. The NPP, as stated by them before the election, aims to increase government revenue above the 15.3% (of GDP) benchmark set by the IMF. The NPP wants to increase revenue, because their economic and political agenda demands a higher primary expenditure by the government than the 13% (of GDP) limit set by the Public Finance Management Act No. 44 of 2024.",
    "In order to increase government expenditure and still maintain the primary surplus of 2.3% (of GDP) target set by the IMF as essential for debt sustainability, the new government must increase revenue. It has no other choice. How will they do this while cutting taxes? This is the million dollar question. This is the question the voters should have asked ourselves when Gota promised tax cuts. We didn\u2019t ask them. Calamity followed. Here\u2019s another looming tax cut. We have to question and question. Our survival depends on it.",
