    "Addressing a party event in Panadura, Mr. Ranawaka said the then government reduced the import tax on sugar from Rs. 50 to 25 cents a kilo, that resulted in a scam enabling seven importers to earn Rs. 16 billion in undue profits.",
    "He said both the Committee on Public Finance and the Committee on Public Accounts had recommended the government to recover the loss but no action has been taken yet.(Kelum Bandara)"
