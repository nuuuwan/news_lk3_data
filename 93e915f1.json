    "Sri Lanka faces a critical challenge in combating non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and malnutrition, which have significant implications for public health and national development. Despite the launch of a multisectoral action plan in 2016, NCD prevalence continues to rise in the country. Concurrently, the recent Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index by the Department of Census and Statistics indicates that malnutrition remains a pressing issue.",
    "Recognising the urgency of addressing these concerns, the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS) hosted a Policy Dialogue focused on tackling the challenges posed by NCDs and malnutrition. The event, titled \u2018Strengthening Policies for Controlling NCD Risk Factors and Malnutrition,\u2019 convened a diverse group of experts, policymakers, and stakeholders to explore strategies for improving the food environment and combatting these pressing issues through enhanced fiscal and regulatory policies.",
    "The discussion was informed by several IPS research studies funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) highlighting the importance of strengthening fiscal policies and regulations to promote healthy diets in Sri Lanka. These studies emphasised the significance of periodic reviews and adjustments of tax rates to maintain the effectiveness of the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage tax (SSB tax). The role of consumer awareness in making healthier choices, particularly regarding the Traffic Light Labelling (TLL) system, was also highlighted, along with the need for the industry to produce healthier alternatives. However, the studies revealed gaps in the coverage and awareness of the TLL system, as it does not include milk-based products.",
