    "RIOCOCO Lanka Private Limited, a globally known manufacturer of coco medium for plant growth, recently donated a high-tech computer laboratory to Nalanda College in Colombo at a cost of more than Rs. 20 million. The laboratory with more than 50 computers, which was built on the concept of RIOCOCO\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Shan Halamba, who was the head prefect at Nalanda College in 1993/94, was inaugurated on 10 November. It was built on the guidance of the school\u2019s Principal, U.D. Iran Champika de Silva.",
    "At a time when it was almost unimaginable to set up a soilless growing medium manufacturing operation, Halamba were convinced of the country\u2019s potential to produce high quality, uniform and consistent coconut growing medium. They founded the RIOCOCO in 2004, which made a speedy success within a short span of time. It has been expanded to more than 65 countries by present. It is currently running a global operation and working with some of the largest hydroponics greenhouse crop producers in the world. RIOCOCO is recognised as one of the foremost soilless growing medium manufacturers in the region, and also as the highest quality single origin growing medium supplier in the world.",
