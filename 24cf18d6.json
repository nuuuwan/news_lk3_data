    "Had it not been for the advice of his father, Pakistan captain Babar Azam would not have been playing in the Lanka Premier League (LPL), instead choosing to travel to Canada for their Global T20 League.",
    "Incidentally, Babar Azam scored the first century of this season\u2019s LPL on Monday, also taking over from Tim Seifert as the leading run scorer.",
    "Babar Azam had informed his father during the recent bilateral Test series against Sri Lanka that he would love to play in the Canadian League.",
    "He had informed his father that whatever he would be paid for playing for ten days in the Canadian league would be almost the same as what he would earn playing 25 days in the LPL.",
    "Confirming the same, Babar's father Azam Siddique said, \"I had told him to participate in the LPL because the Asia Cup matches and also the three ODIs against Afghanistan are to be played in Sri Lanka. It would only be wise to play in Sri Lanka (rather than Canada).\u201d",
    "\"Yes, he could have played in Canada for ten days and a rest for another 15 days. However, I convinced him to get acclimatized with the conditions besides getting ready for the bilateral series against Afghanistan team and the Asia Cup to follow.\u201d",
    "The 29-year-old Babar was scheduled to lead the Colombo Strikers team but requested the management to appoint a local captain which is how Niroshan Dickwella was named as the captain.",
    "The Global T20 League concluded on Sunday, with the Montreal Tigers beating the Surrey Jaguars."
