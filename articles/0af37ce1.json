    "SLPP MP Samanpriya Herath told Parliament that people have faced serious issues in the Kurunegala district as youth who are languishing in junctions and roads are also taken to police stations and charged under Act 54 of the Criminal Procedure.",
    "He said eleven youths were arrested over a brawl in Narammala yesterday and five of them including a school boy had been charged under Act 54.",
    "\"The Acting OIC of the Narammala Police is acting very unreasonably. Action should be taken against him. When these youths are charged under Act 54, they come back to society as drug addicts. The Yukthiya operation is good. But, some police officers misuse it,\" the MP said.",
    "He urged the Public Security Minister to look into this matter and take action.",
