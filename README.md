### Workplace Mental Health: A Foundation For Growth & Inclusivity

Does mental health and well-being impact productivity, creativity, and absenteeism in the workplace? The answer is a resounding yes. Poor mental health can significantly hinder an employee‚Äôs ability to focus, innovate, and collaborate effectively, leading to decreased productivity. Depression and anxiety alone result in the loss of approximately 12 billion workdays each year, costing the global economy around US$1 trillion annually. On the other hand, when employees are mentally healthy, they tend to be more engaged, resilient, and creative, contributing to higher organizational performance.
