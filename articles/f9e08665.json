    "Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror) - The National Unity Alliance (NUA) has called for the initiation of a Presidential Commission to thoroughly investigate into the tumultuous saga of SriLankan Airlines.",
    "The NUA expressed serious concerns regarding the government's recent endeavours to sell the beleaguered national carrier, shedding light on the staggering debt exceeding USD 1 billion that plagues the airline.",
    "Attributing these financial woes to years of mismanagement exacerbated by political interference, the NUA underscored the pivotal role played by the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Specifically, the NUA recalled the appointment of Rajapaksa's brother-in-law to the chairmanship of SriLankan Airlines, despite lacking any pertinent experience or expertise in aviation management. The result, according to the NUA, was nothing short of a disastrous mishandling of the national airline's affairs.",
    "Expressing dismay over the absence of any inquiry or Presidential Commission to scrutinize the actions of the former chairman and the mismanagement that ensued, the NUA raised suspicions of a concerted effort to conceal the transgressions of the Rajapaksa administration.",
    "The absence of transparency, they argued, only perpetuates the cycle of impunity and shields wrongdoers from being held accountable.",
    "\"If there is to be pure transparency, one needs to have a full inquiry,\" remarked a spokesperson for the NUA.",
    "\"The people of Sri Lanka deserve to know the truth behind the collapse of their national airline and the reckless squandering of their hard-earned money,\" they added.",
    "Emphasizing the urgency of the situation, the NUA cautioned against the prospects of salvaging SriLankan Airlines in its current state, asserting that any viable solution would necessitate a radical restructuring to ensure efficiency and fiscal responsibility."
