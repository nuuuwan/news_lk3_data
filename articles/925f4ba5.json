    "Israeli Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is preparing to implement the \u201cfirst stage\u201d of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to end the war in Gaza.",
    "A statement from the prime minister\u2019s office Saturday said Israel would work \u201cin full cooperation\u201d with Trump to end the war in accordance with its principles.",
    "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
    "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip after Hamas said it had accepted some elements of his plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.",
    "Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.",
    "There was no immediate response from Israel, which is largely shut down for the Jewish Sabbath, and Hamas\u2019 response fell short of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s demands that the group surrender and disarm. Israel had earlier accepted Trump\u2019s plan in its entirety.",
    "Trump welcomed the Hamas statement, saying: \u201cI believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.\u201d",
    "\u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it\u2019s far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
    "Hamas said aspects of the proposal touching on the future of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian rights should be decided on the basis of a \u201cunanimous Palestinian stance\u201d reached with other factions and based on international law.",
    "The statement also made no mention of Hamas disarming, a key Israeli demand included in Trump\u2019s proposal.",
    "Trump appears keen to deliver on pledges to end the war and return dozens of hostages ahead of the second anniversary of the attack on Tuesday.",
    "Key mediators Egypt and Qatar welcomed the latest developments, and Majed Al Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said they would \u201ccontinue discussions on the plan.\u201d",
    "A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he \u201curges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that \u201cthe release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!\u201d",
    "The main organization representing the families of Israeli hostages said Trump\u2019s demand to halt the fighting \u201cis essential to prevent serious and irreversible harm to the hostages.\u201d It called on Netanyahu \u201cto immediately begin efficient and swift negotiations to bring all our hostages home.\u201d",
    "Earlier, Trump had warned that Hamas must agree to the deal by Sunday evening, threatening an even greater military onslaught.",
    "\u201cIf this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,\u201d Trump wrote Friday on social media. \u201cTHERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.\u201d",
    "Under the plan, which Trump unveiled earlier this week alongside Netanyahu, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages \u2014 around 20 of them believed to be alive, within three days. It would also give up power and disarm.",
    "In return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction. Plans to relocate much of Gaza\u2019s population to other countries would be shelved.",
    "The territory of some 2 million Palestinians would be placed under international governance, with Trump himself and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it. The plan provides no path for eventual reunification with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state.",
    "Palestinians long for an end to the war, but many view this and previous U.S. proposals as strongly favoring Israel.",
    "Trump\u2019s proposal \u201ccannot be implemented without negotiations,\u201d Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official based outside of Gaza, told the Al Jazeera network on Friday.",
    "The Hamas statement said it was willing to return all remaining hostages according to the plan\u2019s \u201cformula,\u201d apparently referring to an exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It also reiterated its longstanding openness to handing power over to a politically independent Palestinian body.",
    "But Abu Marzouk said it might be difficult for Hamas to release all the hostages within 72 hours, because it could take days or weeks to locate the remains of some of the captives.",
    "He said Hamas was willing to hand over its weapons to a future Palestinian body that runs Gaza, but there was no mention of that in the official statement.",
    "Another Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Araby television that Hamas would refuse foreign administration of the Gaza Strip and that the entry of foreign forces would be \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
    "Israel has sought to ramp up pressure on Hamas since ending an earlier ceasefire in March. It sealed the territory off from food, medicine and other goods for 2 1/2 months and has seized, flattened and largely depopulated large areas.",
    "Experts determined that Gaza City had slid into famine shortly before Israel launched a major offensive aimed at occupying it. An estimated 400,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks, but hundreds of thousands more have stayed behind.",
    "Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian office, said she saw several displaced families staying in the parking lot of Shifa Hospital during a visit on Thursday.",
    "\u201cThey are not able to move south because they just cannot afford it,\u201d Cherevko told The Associated Press. \u201cOne of the families had three children and the woman was pregnant with her fourth. And there were many other vulnerable cases there, including elderly people and people with disabilities.\u201d",
    "Most of Hamas\u2019 top leaders in Gaza and thousands of its fighters have already been killed, but it still has influence in areas not controlled by the Israeli military and launches sporadic attacks.",
    "Hamas has long insisted it will only release the remaining hostages \u2014 its sole bargaining chip and potential human shields \u2014 in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Hamas must surrender and disarm.",
    "Thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, attacking army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They abducted 251 others, most of them since released in ceasefires or other deals.",
    "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.",
    "The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.",
    "The offensive has displaced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population, often multiple times, and left much of the territory uninhabitable.",
    "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have tried to end the fighting and bring back the hostages while providing extensive military and diplomatic support to Israel."
