    "\u201cScrapping the Executive Presidency is a complicated and difficult process. There is no way we can do it through the present Parliament. It is also an exercise in which the people of this country have to be engaged in,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "\u201cHowever we have proposed introducing a new electoral system for electing members to Parliament. Accordingly, we propose to elect 160 members through the \u2018first past the post\u2019 system and to appoint a certain number of MPs from the National List and the rest through a Proportionate Representative (PR) system. However, some want the number of MPs elected under \u2018first past the post\u2019 system reduced to 150 while some others want it reduced further to 140. The Government is open for discussions on the matter. People want this change. Therefore, a change is a must,\u201d he added.",
