“இலங்கையின் அரசியல் கலாச்சாரம் நீண்ட காலமாக வடக்கை தெற்கிற்கு எதிராகவும் அதற்கு நேர்மாறாகவும் நிறுத்தும் முயற்சிகளால் வரையறுக்கப்படுகிறது.

“இருப்பினும், பிளவுபடுத்தும் அரசியல் இனியும் ஆட்சி செய்யாது என்பதை இந்தத் தேர்தல் காட்டுகிறது. இது அனைத்து மக்களின் அபிலாஷைகளையும் வெற்றிகரமாக ஒரே மையத்திற்கு கொண்டு வந்துள்ளது,” என்றார்.

புதிய அரசாங்கம் ஆட்சிக்கு வருவதற்கு வாக்களித்த அனைத்து ஆதரவாளர்களுக்கும் ஜனாதிபதி அவர்கள் நன்றி தெரிவித்ததுடன், இலங்கை புலம்பெயர்ந்தோர் மற்றும் இளம் சமூக ஊடக ஆர்வலர்கள் தேர்தலின் போது ஆற்றிய பங்களிப்புகள் மற்றும் ஆதரவினையும் மேற்கோள் காட்டினார்.

### නව අමාත්‍ය මණ්ඩලයට ජනපතිගෙන් ඔවදනයක්

*2024-11-18 11:29:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/203488) · `si`

අමාත්‍යවරුන්ට හිමිවූ අසීමිත බලය වගකීමෙන් යුතුව හැසිරවිය යුතු බව ජනාධිපති අනුර කුමාර දිසානායක මහතා අවධාරණය කරයි.

අභිනව කැබිනට් මණ්ඩලය අමතමින් ජනාධිපතිවරයා වැඩිදුරටත් පවසා සිටියේ, එම බලය ආරක්ෂා කරගැනීමට නව අමාත්‍යවරු නිරන්තරයෙන් කටයුතු කළ යුතු බවය.

දීර්ඝ කාලයක් දරන ලද වෙහෙස, ජනතා අපේක්ෂාවන් යන සියල්ල සාර්ථක කරගැනීමේ දී යහපත් ආණ්ඩුකරණයක් තිබිය යුතු බව ද ජනාධිපතියා පැවසීය.

"ජයග්‍රහණය විශාල වගේම ඒ ජයග්‍රහණයෙන් අප වෙත පවරා ඇති වගකීම් ඒ හා සමානව බරයි." යනුවෙන් ද ජනාධිපතිවරයා කියා සිටියේය.

ලංකා ඉතිහාසයේ දේශපාලන සිතියම වෙනස් වූ බවත් තව දුරටත් බෙදීමේ දේශපාලනයක් අවශ්‍ය නොවන බව මෙවර මැතිවරණයෙන් පෙන්නුම් කළ බවත් ජනාධිපතිවරයා කියා සිටියේය.

ජාතික ජන බලවේගයට ශක්තිමත් ජන වරමක් ලබාදීමට උත්සාහ ගත් සියලු ජනතාවට ස්තූති වන්ත වන බව ද ජනාධිපතිවරයා පැවසීය.

ජාතික ජන බලවේගයේ අභිලාෂයන් මුදුන්පත් කරගැනීමේ දී සියලු ජනතාවගේ සහාය අවශ්‍ය වන බවත් පැවසු ජනාධිපතිවරයා, පරාජිතයාගේ හිත රිදවන ඉතිහාසය වෙනස් කළ බවත් අලුත් දේශපාලන සංස්කෘතියක් ආරම්භ කළ බවද කියා සිටියේය.

නව කැබිනට් මණ්ඩලය දිවුරුම් දීමෙන් පසු ප්‍රකාශයක් කරමින් හෙතෙම මේ බව සඳහන් කළේය.

“මා හිතන්නේ නෑ කිසිදු පුරවැසියෙක් බෙදීමේ දේශපාලනය විශ්වාස කරයි කියලා. මා හිතන්නේ නෑ ලංකාවේ කිසිදු දේශපාලකයෙක් ප්‍රජාතන්ත්‍රවාදය අකුලන එක විශ්වාස කරයි කියලා. මේ ආදී යහපත් දේ සෑම පුරවැසියෙක් තුළම ගැබ් වී තිබෙනවා. තවදුරටත් මේ මැතිවරණයෙන් සතුටට පත්වෙන කණ්ඩායමක් සහ මේ මැතිවරණයෙන් කම්පාවට පත්වෙන කණ්ඩායමක් කියලා කණ්ඩායම් දෙකක් මේ රටේ නෑ. ”

Geetanath Kasilingam, Chief Organizer of the Jaffna District of Sri Lanka PA, said that the concession on the concession of the newly elected National People's Power from the Jaffna District Ilangumaran is commanding.

He made the allegation in a press release issued on Monday (18) on the comments of MP Ilangumaran that he would not get any concessions for MPs.

Geetanath said that this claim is one of the clowns. The government's offer and allowances are aimed at serving the people.

Avoiding these privileges in any way, the country's economy or income is not going to be raised.

So use these offers and allowances to serve people. Although it is your choice to get and avoid these concessions, the people of Jaffna Kilinochchi Election District have elected you as a Member of Parliament by your confidence in your confidence.. People expect the problems and needs of the people to recognize that responsibility and provide them with a solution.

The representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who arrived in Sri Lanka on Sunday (17) led by Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer, are set to meet with officials from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) today (18).

Following this discussion, the delegation is expected to hold meetings with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and key ministers of the newly-formed government to further discuss Sri Lanka’s economic recovery programme.

However, speaking to journalists yesterday, Rajapaksa dismissed the idea of retirement. “I will not say goodbye like that,” he remarked in response to a question about his future in politics.

Acknowledging the victory of the National People’s Power (NPP), Rajapaksa expressed optimism about their ability to govern. “It’s good they won,” he said. “New people should come in.”

### MTI Consulting recommends Cabinet  restructuring with a ‘start-up’ mindset

*2024-11-18 03:09:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/MTI-Consulting-recommends-Cabinet-restructuring-with-a-start-up-mindset/14-769360) · `en`

Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions

Post watershed election that has the potential to transform Sri Lanka socio-economically, MTI Consulting has recommended a radically different approach to restructuring the Cabinet of Ministers.

How nations, both developed and developing, structure their cabinets is often based on legacy practices with incremental, ad-hoc changes. There is very little ground thinking, first principles, and future-proofing (which are considered effective in organisational structuring) that goes into such a process.

In this backdrop, Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions, even considering rationalisation and consolidation where needed.

### Super mandate and sobering reality

*2024-11-18 02:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/super-mandate-and-sobering-reality/) · `en`

Following their stunning victory in last week’s parliamentary election, the JVP/NPP leaders must still be pinching themselves to make sure that they are not dreaming. Their mammoth majority is sure to go down in Sri Lanka’s history. However, the bigger the majority, the greater a government’s responsibility and the higher the possibility of the public expecting miracles and becoming frustrated. Above all, the Actonian truism that absolute power corrupts absolutely has stood the test of time. Giving politicians, especially untested ones, steamroller majorities could be just as much a recipe for disaster as keeping teenagers, alcohol and car keys together.

P. Sathalingam accepts National List seat, vows dedicated service to people. Cites past failures due to opposition campaigns. Aims to address Wanni region's needs. Will continue as party General Secretary. Promises impactful work over next five years.

🟩

"I will accept the confidence of the party and dedicate the service to the people of this area," Parliamentarian P. Sathalingam said.

He said this while commenting to the media after the National List seat of the TNA.

A massive responsibility has been imposed on me. When I was a member of the Provincial Council I had made many development plans. But people rejected me for something. There is many reasons for that.

Opposition parties and rivals presented fake campaigns against me. It was a cause of failure. My career is not politics. I am a doctor. If the party did not give this post, I was in the intention of acting as a state official again.

Wanni Having is a territory where the systematic genocide is taking place. So the party has provided this seat to know the need for a Member of Parliament who can perform it.

I will accept the confidence in me and dedicate my service to the people of this area. Thanks to the people who did not vote in that way. Thanks to the party.

### Sajith's weakness is the cause of the fall of the United People's Power - Sarath Fonseka

*2024-11-18 02:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199026) · `ta`

Sajith Premadasa's weak leadership caused United People's Power's downfall, says Sarath Fonseka. Party members left due to informal management. Without a strong leader, people chose National People's Power instead.

🟩

The situation is due to the failure of Sajith Brahmedasa formally managing the leadership of the United People's Power.. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Sajith Premadasa did not act properly as the leader of the United People's Power but also the leader of the opposition.

I quit because of the weakness found in the leadership of Sajith Premadasa. As well as many senior members left the party. The two positions he held did not engage in formal administration.

So if the other members of the party want to choose Harsha de Silva as the leader. They cannot act as a strong opposition party led by Sajith Premadasa.

Due to the lack of an alternative, the people have chosen national power. Even those who voted for the cylinder in the last presidential election have chosen national people's power this time. He said the United People's Power should now fulfill its responsibility.

### Economic Challenges Of New Government: Road Ahead Not Smooth, But Treacherous

At the General elections held last week, voters from all over the country have overwhelmingly selected the candidates fielded by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake or AKD as legislators to frame laws for a five-year term. In his journey to presidency, AKD’s supporters sang the theme song of which an appropriate rendering in English will be, ‘Today the whole nation in a single file will hand the country over to Anura to usher prosperity to people’. But the election results showed that it was not in a single file but without the support of the marginalised citizenry from the upcountry, and the north and the east. Like a true statesman, delivering his victory speech at the Elections Secretariat, AKD admitted that he had been endorsed by some sections in society but there are those who had not voted for him. He said that he will serve all the people without any division or discrimination as their President[1].

Hela Apparel Holdings PLC has announced a significant improvement in its financial performance during the quarter ended 30 September, with a return to operating profit for the first time in eight quarters.

The Hela Group’s revenue surged by 36.5% year-on-year to Rs. 23.4 billion in the second quarter of FY 2024/25. This was primarily driven by the contribution of the recently established Brand Licensing Division, following the acquisition of UK-based Focus Brands in January 2024. Sales for the existing private label manufacturing division were also supported by the ongoing recovery in demand from its key brand partners across the US and Europe.

It is unlikely that democracy will yield greater returns solely because of the moral fortitude of the agents entrusted with governing on our behalf

It is broadly accepted that the Sri Lankan coconut industry, especially the smallholder segment, is highly unproductive. It has been reported that the average yield per hectare in Sri Lanka is less than half the yield in Andhra Pradesh where the climatic conditions are not dissimilar. This problem is not new.

Thirty years ago, I was asked to evaluate several information projects including the coconut information system managed by the Coconut Research Institute. The information system was exemplary, but I concluded that it all seemed pointless because the end objectives of producing more coconuts and improving the livelihoods of the growers were not being achieved. During the entire period of study, yields were declining. I was not asked to conduct evaluations after that.

The importance of achieving debt sustainability without compromising the welfare and long-term interests of Sri Lanka’s populace is clear

Lender awareness that Sri Lanka’s debt exceeded Government revenue by a factor of 10 underscores a stark instance of predatory lending practices. This highlights a profound failure to adhere to established norms of responsible lending, which require creditors to assess a borrower’s capacity to repay before extending further credit. By continuing to extend loans under such unsustainable conditions, creditors blatantly disregarded these principles, exacerbating Sri Lanka’s financial vulnerability and contributing to its current debt crisis. This pattern of lending not only violated ethical standards but also undermined the spirit of shared accountability between lenders and sovereign borrowers

Unlike in the past, voters cannot afford to remain aloof as mere onlookers and critics of what the Government does – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

When the date for election was announced there were murmurs among a group of Buddhist monks that the date would fall on a Poya Day, that it would be a day for people to attend to their religious rituals and meditation and that therefore the polling date be postponed. But the Election Commissioner stuck to his guns and as proved by the results voters thronged in hundreds of thousands not to the temples but to the polling booths and delivered an unassailable mandate to their favourite party of choice, National People’s Power (NPP) under the leadership of their favourite son, Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD).

It was indeed as the Chinese would say a mandate of heaven delivered on a Poya Day through the voting citizenry. To the Buddhists at least, NPP’s historic victory and the enormity of its size would appear a divinely blessed outcome.

This Government and this President have the best opportunity in decades to truly unify the country like none other – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

How with the overwhelming mandate from the people of the north and the east, the NPP has a unique opportunity to unite the country

The Rajapaksa family was duly credited with uniting the country after winning a relentless war with the LTTE. In May 2009 the war was won and the country was declared united as one.

But for years afterwards, racism continued to feature in political campaigns and while the peace was won, question marks persisted regarding the hearts and minds of the northerner. And doubts remained regarding their actual integration with their southern brethren.

2024 may be seen as a watershed moment in Sri Lankan history as a Presidential election was fought where racism was not an issue. Language and religion did not play a role and none of the candidates had a divisive agenda.
