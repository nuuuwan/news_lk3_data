### Competition against the West Indies is decisive to New Zealand

*2024-06-13 01:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185957) · `ta`

In the R20 World Cup, New Zealand's C team faces the West Indies after losing to Afghanistan. A win against the West Indies could secure New Zealand's spot in the Super 8 round, enhancing their chances. Historically, New Zealand has performed well in World Cups, reaching the semi-finals or finals multiple times since 2015 but struggled against Afghanistan this year. The match against the West Indies is crucial for New Zealand, who leads 10-4 in international T20 encounters but faced a tie and loss in previous meetings. Both teams aim to advance to the Super 8 round, making this match pivotal.

🟩

The New Zealand C team, which lost its first match against Afghanistan, will oppose the West Indies in its second match in the R20 World Cup.

The tournament will begin at 6.00 am on Thursday (13).

If the West Indies wins the match, the fourth team will qualify for the Super 8 round, while New Zealand's Super 8 round chance will be questioned.

So in today's match, New Zealand will try to increase its Super round chance by defeating the West Indies.

New Zealand, which has revealed the best in the World Cup since 2015, has advanced to the semi -finals of 2015, 2019, 2019 and 2023 in 2016, 2021 and 2022. On 3 occasions, he played in the final game, but did not hesitate.

However, there is suspicion that New Zealand will leave the first round of Afghanistan by 84 runs this year.

So the rivalry against the West Indies will be a knock out of New Zealand.

On the other hand, the West Indies will also try to win the Super 8 round.

In a significant development the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Kaushalya Nawaratna, has temporarily stepped down from his position pending the conclusion of an investigation into alleged financial irregularities within the BASL. This decision comes in response to growing pressure and concerns regarding the alleged misappropriation of funds earmarked for an anti-corruption initiative funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

The controversy erupted when a group of legal professionals, including 10 Presidents’ Counsel and over 80 Attorneys-at-Law, called for a comprehensive investigation into the JICA project scandal. They demanded that any BASL member potentially involved in the misuse of funds step down during the inquiry. The group highlighted the paramount importance of transparency, accountability, and the preservation of BASL’s moral authority and public trust.

### Mullaitivu fishermen threaten action amidst illegal fishing crisis

Tensions are rising among fishermen in Mullaitivu as Government authorities allegedly continue to fail to stop illegal fishing by fishermen from other provinces, leading to the risk of a major conflict in the region. Local fishing leaders have given the authorities a two-day ultimatum to address the issue, warning of drastic measures if their demands are not met.

Fishermen from outer provinces have been accused of using prohibited gear to fish in the Mullaitivu sea, depleting resources and threatening the livelihoods of local fishermen. This has prompted the Jaffna District Fishermen’s Cooperative Society Vice President, Antonipillai Francis Ratnakumar, to issue a stern warning during a protest held on 10 June in front of the Mullaitivu District Secretariat.

### India qualified for the Super 8 round to win the United States

*2024-06-13 01:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185956) · `ta`

India beat the United States by 7 wickets in the R20 World Cup, qualifying for the Super 8 round. In a challenging pitch, India, after electing to chase 111 runs, achieved the target in 18.2 overs despite early losses. Key contributions came from Suryakumar Yadav (50 runs) and Shivam Dube (31 runs). The United States, batting first, managed 110 runs in 20 overs, led by Nitish Kumar (27) and Steven Taylor (24). India's bowlers, Saurab Nethravalkar and Arshdeep Singh, were standout performers.

🟩

India won by 7 wickets in the R20 World Cup for A Group, which ended some time ago at the New York Nasav County Cricket Stadium between India and the United States.

With this victory, India qualified for the third team in the Super 8 round.

South Africa (D Group) and Australia (B Group) are the first two teams to be selected for the Super 8 round.

In the strange pitch, the players also faced the difficulty of facing the bowlers.

In some cases unthinkable, the ball flowed and in some cases the ball went down.

In response to the United States, India won the toss and elected to win 111 runs, losing 3 wickets in 18.2 overs.

Virat Kohli (0), team captain Rohit Sharma (3) and Rishabh Bant (18) lost 39 runs in the overs.

India's total number was 47 runs for the loss of 3 wickets in 10 overs.

In this case, India had to score 64 in the last 10 overs to achieve the win.

### AKD’s speech on police and rule of law: Merits and demerits

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s (AKD) speech as the Leader of the National People’s Power (NPP) at the National Convention organised by the Retired Police Officers Collective on 9 June 2024 is quite promising in terms of establishing or reestablishing rule of law in the country, if they get the opportunity to govern the nation. They have been talking about a ‘system change’ now for some time, and various independent critics and observers were asking the details of this promise, without merely depending on the slogan.

I was fortunate to listen to this speech online and live, through ‘Horawa News,’ and one weakness or wrong that I immediately observed was its leading phrase ‘Malimawa shows its police power.’ I have no idea about who runs the ‘Horawa,’ but that was not what AKD was quite obviously advocating. ‘Power’ is not a good word to use in democracy, worst still is the ‘police power.’

‘Is There Another Way? Debt Restructuring, the IMF and the Future of Sri Lanka’, was the title and topic of the most educative, enlightening public policy event of this year. Organised by Yukthi a newish civic association spearheaded by Ahilan Kadirgamar, Ermiza Tegal and Melanie Gunatilleke, it featured three top-notch international economists, Prof. Jayati Ghosh, Prof. Martin Guzman --former Economics Minister of Argentina-- and Charles Abugre. (https://www.youtube.com/live/3SF2L0nh_l4?si=G7D82fcNI2YSxu5A)

Watching the video, my wife Sanja and I had the same thought: these experts and not Lazard et al, should be our advisors on debt restructuring and consultants on our negotiating team, and our negotiating team should certainly not be the current one.

My key takeaways from what Ghosh, Guzman and Abugre said were:

Each country must do its own expert research rather than blindly accept the IMF narrative.

### Sri Lanka president needs referendum to extend his tenure: Justice Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe will need a referendum if he needs to extend his tenure by one year despite an error in the constitution’s 19th amendment when it was passed in 2015, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

Speculations have been on rise that the island nation’s constitution could allow President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by one year due to a mistake in the constitution, which was approved with more than two-third majority.

While all references to the six-year terms of both the president and parliament were changed to five years in line with the 19th Amendment, Article 83(b) was overlooked and left unchanged, giving a loophole to extend his term for President Wickremesinghe.

However, Minister Rajapakshe said despite an inconsistency, the rulers need both two-third majority and referendum to change 9 clauses in the constitution which also include the people’s voting right.
