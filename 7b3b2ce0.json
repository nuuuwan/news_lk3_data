    "Cites unwillingness to work with group that caused financial collapse for refusal to become PM",
    "Says party members have now realised he made correct decision back then",
    "Questions Basil Rajapaksa\u2019s ethical right to issue challenges to opposition",
    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday defended his decision to decline the premiership in 2022, claiming that he refused to collaborate with those responsible for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic collapse.",
    "Speaking at a Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) electoral organising meeting in Biyagama, Premadasa emphasised that today the people recognise the correctness of his decision at that time. Premadasa, visibly displeased with comments made about him during the recent Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) national convention in Colombo, responded by stating that the SLPP leader alleged he declined to accept the country\u2019s responsibility while implying that Premadasa had a suit tailored with the intention of becoming President nonetheless.",
    "\u201cCan the country be rebuilt together with the Pohottuwa group which is responsible for this country\u2019s financial collapse? Did they expect us to cohabit with the group that stole public monies and assets?\u201d he asked.",
    "Premadasa responded to the SLPP and Rajapaksa family\u2019s promise to return stronger, criticising those who, in his view, not only led the country to bankruptcy but also raised the Value Added Tax (VAT). He questioned the ethical and moral right of a SLPP veteran to issue challenges, given their alleged role in the economic collapse, and suggested that the entire country is waiting to respond to the party in kind."
