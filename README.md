### VAT hike in Sri Lanka: Who really pays the price?

*2024-10-15 02:49:39* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/VAT-hike-in-Sri-Lanka-Who-really-pays-the-price/4-767971) · `en`

The recent VAT revisions have hit the poorest the hardest, whereas the bottom 10% of income group households now spend about 10% of their income on VAT

The VAT burden has risen by approximately 50%, primarily due to the removal of VAT exemptions on around 100 items

This blog offers potential solutions for easing the VAT burden in Sri Lanka

Earlier this year, Sri Lanka introduced major changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The VAT rate increased from 15% to 18%, and tax exemptions were removed for 97 items, including essential goods such as gas and stationery. While these revisions aimed to boost Government revenue, they have also significantly increased the tax burden on low-income households, making life even more challenging for the most vulnerable during this ongoing crisis. This blog offers a comprehensive overview of the recent VAT revision and potential solutions for easing the VAT burden in Sri Lanka.

### One thousand megawatts of rooftops – solar heaven?

Let’s argue about getting the lowest cost project after we have replaced all furnace oil generation with cheaper renewable energy

At a conference in the mid ’90s, Dr. Harvey Forest, solar visionary and President of Solarex (then one of the largest solar companies), displayed a slide titled “Solar Heaven”. He predicted that annual solar installations would reach 1 Gigawatt (GW) or 1,000 Megawatt (MW) in a few years, which he called “solar heaven”. He said that at this capacity, investment into the highly capital-intensive silicon manufacturing becomes viable and this would free solar from its dependence on the semiconductor industry, for its main raw material, silicon. This in turn would drive down cost, spurring demand and setting off a virtuous cycle of more investment, more capacity, lower costs and more demand and completely transform the fledgling industry into global scale.

### What more can Govt. do: Strategies to solidify economic progress post-elections

Given Sri Lanka’s strategic location, the Government can actively engage in deepening regional trade ties, particularly with fast-growing economies

While the recent Presidential elections in Sri Lanka have set a positive tone for the country’s economic and political landscape, there is still significant work to be done to build on this momentum. The Government’s initial focus on anti-corruption, transparency, and institutional reforms has already had a strong impact on market confidence and investor sentiment. However, in the current global economic climate, additional measures are necessary to ensure that these early gains translate into long-term prosperity. Here are some key areas the Government could focus on to further strengthen its positive market impact:

### Education for system change: Proposal for critical thinking and civic responsibility curriculum

Conditioned to internalise information mechanically, students are moulded into conformity and rote memorisation, influenced more by parental expectations and societal pressures than by their talents and aspirations

The entrenched education system excels at producing highly skilled and committed engineers, doctors, mathematicians, and IT professionals, yet it often fails to prepare them to address the oppression and injustices encountered when applying their education in their professions. These professionals may be blind to, or unwilling to acknowledge, these issues. Evidence abounds that educated, talented, and well-travelled individuals—those leading cosmopolitan lives—frequently perpetuate disparities and inequities. They swiftly blame extremists and politicians when things go awry and comfortably evade accountability by positioning themselves as mere producers of ideas, conveniently leaving implementation to others

While the practice of removing shoes when entering places of Buddhist worship is practiced in both countries, Sri Lanka appears to be taking a more extreme stand regarding the distance at which this requirement must be met

Both Thailand and Sri Lanka boast of numerous tourist attractions that are essentially places of religious worship. The challenge faced by administrators of such sites is to strike a balance between the need to maintain dignity and decorum expected in a place of worship with the need to create a pleasant and convenient experience to those who travel from faraway places to catch a glimpse of these renowned sites

The ESG narrative within the new political context could be beneficial for positioning Sri Lankan businesses to attract investment into the country

Sri Lanka’s new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been sworn into office, marking a significant shift in the country’s political and economic trajectory. The new administration is focused on steering the country towards a more sustainable and inclusive economic model, which could significantly impact the business environment and the promotion of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies.

### India withdraws Canada envoy named in probe, expels diplomats

*2024-10-14 22:21:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102692/india-withdraws-canada-envoy-named-in-probe-expels-diplomats) · `en`

India ordered the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats on Monday and withdrew its own envoy from Canada, in response to what it said was Ottawa’s decision to name him and others as “persons of interest” in an investigation.

India did not go into detail on the investigation, but relations have been fraught since 2023, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had evidence linking Indian agents to the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader on his territory.

India has long denied Trudeau’s accusation. On Monday it dismissed Canada’s move on the inquiry and accused Trudeau of pursuing a “political agenda”.

“We have no faith in the current Canadian Government’s commitment to ensure their security.

Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

It later said it had asked the six Canadian diplomats to leave by Saturday.
