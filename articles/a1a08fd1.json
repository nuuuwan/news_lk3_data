    "Similarly, the Treasury bond auction held on 13 May 2024, raised the targeted Rs. 7,000 million (Rs. 1,500 million, 2,500 million and Rs. 3,000 million) out of the total market subscription of Rs. 62,555 million via the Direct Issuance Window, at the Weighted Average Yield Rates of 11.01%, 11.85% and 12.17% respectively, determined at the auction.",

    "\u201cThe government raised its targeted amounts quite easily at the last T-Bill and T-Bond sale with investors preferring to pump funds into short term debt instruments. It appears that they expect interest rates will further decline in the future and probably think might as well obtain a low return on their investment because it is anyway a steady source of income,\u201d an analyst familiar with short term debt instruments told The Island Financial Review.",
