    "Sri Lanka are set to make changes for the second Test against Pakistan starting on Monday at the SSC Grounds, Head Coach Chris Silverwood confirmed, after right-arm fast bowler Asitha Fernando was added the home team's squad.",
    "Sri Lanka lost the opening Test in Galle by four wickets, and now face the prospect of losing their first series of the new World Test Championship cycle, unless they are able to reverse their fortunes in Colombo.",
    "\"There is a couple of changes we are thinking about,\" Silverwood said, stopping short of naming the players who would be drafted in.",
    "Fernando is tipped to return, while a debut for left-arm pace bowler Dilshan Madushanka has also been touted as part of the changes to the team's two-man fast bowling attack.",
    "Kasun Rajitha and Vishwa Fernando were largely anoynmous in the first Test, although the typically spin-friendly Galle wicket did not help their cause, as the two fast-bowlers picked up just two wickets in 39 collective overs.",
    "The rest of the team is likely to remain the same, although Silverwood said he had emphasized a need for improvement in all three departments ahead of the first Test.",
    "\"We're looking for a better performance all-round. If we analyse the last Test match and if we are honest, I think we fell short in all three departments. I'll be looking an improvement in all three departments this Test match which I am sure we'll get,\" Silverwood added."
