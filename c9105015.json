    "Suwa Arana, Sri Lanka\u2019s first Paediatric Palliative Care Centre opened its doors for paediatric cancer patients. Designed on the overarching ethos of being a place for healing, this pioneering project fulfils a dire need in the paediatric palliative care space in Sri Lanka bringing together a holistic environment of supportive care, designed to promote physical, emotional and psychological healing for paediatric cancer patients.",
    "Suwa Arana\u2019s concepts in its architecture and interiors too go beyond the norm, having been designed in collaboration with healthcare professionals, child life specialists and paediatric experts to ensure efficiency, functionality and most importantly, healing.",
    "The soothing color palette, nature-inspired elements, interactive spaces, personalised touches and prioritization of safety, hygiene, privacy and family togetherness in trying times are well thought out elements in this state-of-the-art facility.",
    "Suwa Arana houses cutting edge technology and contemporary care services including pain and symptom management, psycho-social support, art and music therapy, end of life and bereavement support, created as a haven for both children and their families. Within the six-storey facility are four patient floors, in which are 32 en-suite family rooms, rooftop garden, ground floor dining, specialised kitchen and recreation facilities.",
    "With nearly one thousand children diagnosed with cancer in Sri Lanka, 7 out of 10 are from low income families. Most cannot afford the cost of medication, transport and accommodation due to their disadvantaged economic circumstances. Suwa Arana creates a home away from home for these children, completely free of charge, in a warm and supportive residential facility.",
    "Facilities at Suwa Arana are free of charge, a home away from home for childrenwith cancer to live with their families",
    "The Indira Cancer Trust, which was initiated following the demise of Indira Jayasuriya of cancer at the age of 40 is a collobarative partnership with Sri Lanka Medical Association North American Western Region (SLMANA WR) and a collective of foundations, service organisations and family trusts. The donors for this pioneering Centre for Healing include the Roshan Mahanama Trust, Lions Club International Foundation (Lions District 306B2), MJF Charitable Foundation, Wijerama Family Foundation and The Prince Group, Australia. In addition, invaluable support has been extended by a host of individuals and families to sponsor rooms, which will ensure the Center\u2019s sustainability going forward.",
    "Former Speaker and Member of Parliament SriLankabhimanya Karu Jayasuriya who is the Patron of the Indira Cancer Trust, walked the journey of pain his family suffered on the death of his daughter. \u201cWe made a pledge at the time that we would never allow other parents to go through that pain. Suwa Arana is truly a place for healing, where we take a holistic approach to care for children who are faced with an unimaginable amount of pain, uncertainty and the snatching away of their childhood. Their parents are truly helpless with no support system to give them strength.\u201d",
    "The government\u2019s economic development policy is well-received internationally \u2013 Minister",
