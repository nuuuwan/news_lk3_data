  "original_title": "Easter Terror mastermind: Question Sirisena",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena, like many other Sri Lankan political leaders, speaks in riddles. He has got obfuscation down to a fine art. He displayed his adeptness at equivocation amply on Wednesday, while addressing a conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Colombo. He said the identity of the mastermind behind the Easter Sunday terror attacks had been known to all governments, intelligence agencies and the Sri Lankan military, but nobody dared reveal the truth; the mastermind was too powerful to be dealt with, he said.",
    "An inference that can be drawn from Sirisena\u2019s cryptic claim is that the mastermind is not Sri Lankan, for he will not consider any Sri Lankan untouchable, especially former government leaders and ex-intelligence and military officers, for the incumbent government does not baulk at having them probed. Has Sirisena referred to a foreign power?",
    "Sirisena\u2019s claim at issue should be viewed against the backdrop of his testimony before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI/CoI) he himself appointed to investigate the Easter Sunday carnage. He is among 11 prominent persons who insisted that there had been an external hand or a conspiracy behind the terror attacks. The PCoI report says: \u201cSeveral Witnesses testified that the attacks were not carried out by Zahran and his group alone but that there was a foreign hand behind the attacks. However, none of them provided any evidence to assist the COI in inquiring in this aspect other than mere ipse dixit [unsupported assertion] \u2026\u201d (pp 216). Among other witnesses who made that assertion were Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, former SIS Director SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena, former STF Commandant M. R. Latiff, former Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne, former SDIG (CID) Ravi Seneviratne and former CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekera. At present, Seneviratne and Abeysekera are the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security and the Director of the CID, respectively.",
    "On 19 May 2021, the then Minister of Public Security Sarath Weerasekra told Parliament that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had confirmed that Moulavi Mohamad Naufer was the mastermind behind the Easter Sunday attacks. He said so in response to a statement made by Attorney General Dappula De Livera the previous day that there had been \u2018a grand conspiracy\u2019 behind the terror attacks.",
    "One may recall that speaking at St. Sebastian\u2019s Church, Katuwapitiya, on 21 July 2019, Cardinal Ranjith blamed the Easter Sunday terror attacks on a foreign conspiracy to destabilise the country. In October 2024, speaking at the launch of a book on the Easter Sunday attacks, Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, Spokesman for the Archdiocese of Colombo, said the terror mastermind could be the person who had identified himself as Abu Hind. He added that when the then SDIG in charge of the CID, Ravi Seneviratne sought to reveal who Abu Hind actually was, while testifying before the PCOI, he had been prevented from doing so; instead, a commissioner jotted down a name on a piece of paper and passed it on to Seneviratne, asking whether it was the person the latter was referring to; Seneviratne answered in the affirmative. One wonders why the PCOI prevented the true identity of Abu Hind from being revealed then and there. Intriguingly, the PCOI final report says: \u201cThe CID investigators who testified before the COI informed that they are investigating the identity of Abu Hind. Those investigations should proceed\u201d (p. 222). If it is true that the then SDIG of the CID tried to reveal the real identity of Abu Hind, then one can ask why the PCOI has, in its final report, asked the CID to conduct a fresh probe.",
    "Curiously, in March 2021, the then Attorney General de Livera instructed IGP C. D. Wickramaratne to conduct a thorough investigation in respect of Abu Hind, Ahamed Thalib Lukman Thalib, his son Lukman Thalib Ahamed aka \u2018Abu Abdulla,\u2019 Rimsan and Mahendran Pulasthini alias \u2018Sara.\u2019 They have been named in the PCOI report, under the Chapter, \u2018Foreign Involvement\u2019. There would have been no need for further efforts to determine the true identity Abu Hind if the CID had already done so while the PCOI proceedings were in progress. The PCoI report says, quoting an international expert on terrorism, \u201cAccording to his testimony, Abu Hind was a character created by a section of a provincial Indian intelligence apparatus \u2026 operatives of this outfit operate in social media pretending to be Islamic State figures. They are trained to run virtual personae\u201d (p. 219).",
    "As we pointed out in a previous editorial comment, when Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, who was a member of the PSC that probed the Eastern Sunday carnage, was in the Opposition, he told BBC that according to \u2018investigative evidence\u2019 he was privy to, India had been behind the terror attacks. He is now the Cabinet Spokesman. It will be interesting to know the other government leaders\u2019 position on his allegation. Curiously, the CID has not recorded a statement from him on his very serious claim.",
    "Those who are probing the Easter Sunday bombings should question Sirisena, who was the President and Minister of Defence in 2019, on his claim that he knows who the terror mastermind is.",
