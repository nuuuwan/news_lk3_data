### Cultivating circular futures: Youth as agents of change

*2025-09-27 00:54:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/cultivating-circular-futures-youth-as-agents-of-change-241998/) · `en`

On September 29, the world marks the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste, highlighting one of humanity’s pressing paradoxes. As the global population nears 8.5 billion by 2030, we still waste 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually – enough to feed three billion people. Sri Lanka is no exception. This crisis calls for urgent action, and increasingly, young people are emerging as catalysts for change.

The traditional “take-make-use-discard” model has proved unsustainable. A shift toward circular approaches – refuse, regenerate, reuse, and redesign – is gaining global momentum. At the heart of this transformation lies a simple truth: when young people embrace circular principles, they can reshape communities and inspire wider system change.

### Politics of Tamil-Muslim relations

*2025-09-27 00:12:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Politics-of-Tamil-Muslim-relations/4-782245) · `en`

Although the main attention is on Sinhalese-Tamil reconciliation, there is also a need for Tamil-Muslim reconciliation

The introduction of multi-member constituencies in the Eastern Province is a living testimony to Tamil-Muslim political mistrust. That mistrust reached its climax when the LTTE emerged on the scene. Although during its initial stages LTTE was prepared to accommodate the Muslims as Islamic Tamils in their failed Tamil Eelam, thus echoing Ramanathan of 1880s, Tamil-Muslim mistrust continued to bedevil any accommodation and finally led to the expulsion of the entire Muslim community from Jaffna and its suburbs. That was the political climate which eventually produced the ill-conceived SLMC as a party to represent Muslims only

### Selective republicanism of socialist regime rules

The pre-election promises spanning political, social and economic dimensions have been

A bigger picture emerges on the larger canvas of national political life... it is one in which the relatively few, early, ongoing good deeds that should redound to government’s credit are overshadowed by the greater good it has yet to do – because we’re beginning to be agnostic to their potential to effect systemic change, having lost faith in their slow, steady and plebeian ways. Also, we’ve failed to remember the religious zeal of previous dispensations for evil deeds

No good deed goes unpunished, mused libertarian socialist Oscar Wilde, no doubt while in Reading Gaol and reminiscing about that ironic truism in his own short life.

Perhaps some of the stalwarts in governmental ranks share a similar sentiment about the electorate at large today, sensing dissent even beyond the ranks of Tuscany.

Universal Access to Information. For many African countries, these days have always been marked with a realm of hope but in the recent past, it is a reminder of a worrying trend.

When events become politically sensitive or socially tense, governments sometimes respond by shutting down the internet or silencing broadcasters, cutting off the audience; this action severs access to credible news precisely when the public’s need for it is greatest.

Misinformation and disinformation are rampant on social media platforms such as TikTok Live, which have become an alternative source of truth for many.

### Sri Lanka’s tourism at crossroads: Wake-up call on World Tourism Day

Future growth must balance increased arrivals with a focus on high-value tourism and sustainable site management

The targets may slip, but the opportunity remains. To salvage momentum, authorities must; fast-track visa reforms through Parliament and implement before October, launch at least an interim global campaign leveraging on existing accolades in promotion, coordinate with airlines to expand connectivity, empower the private sector as partners, not bystanders and shift focus from ad-hoc roadshows to a coherent strategy

As the world marks World Tourism Day today, on 27 September, Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture. Tourism has long been hailed as the country’s “low-hanging fruit” for economic revival and the year 2025 began with bold ambitions; 3 million arrivals and $ 5 billion in earnings. Yet as the final quarter approaches, those lofty goals are slipping out of reach.

City-centric approaches to climate-related human mobility recognise that adaptation is increasingly an urban challenge

As the impacts of climate change become more frequent and intense, people across the globe are forced to adapt. In many cases, adaptation takes place within communities and areas by addressing vulnerabilities and enhancing adaptative capacities, thereby building short- and long-term climate resilience. However, climate change also causes movement, either by choice (e.g., voluntary migration in search of better incomes) or by force (e.g., displacement due to disasters or relocation of coastal populations in the face of sea level rise). Much of this movement goes from rural to urban or peri-urban areas, which are often perceived as desirable locations due to employment options, family connections, and other opportunities.

### Dozens of delegates from multiple nations walk out of UN hall as Israeli prime minister prepares to speak

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly on Friday that Israel “must finish the job” against Hamas in Gaza, giving a defiant U.N. speech despite growing international isolation over his refusal to end the devastating war in Gaza.

He spoke after dozens of delegates from multiple nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly hall en masse Friday as he prepared to speak.

As the Israeli leader spoke, unintelligible shouts echoed around the hall. Applause rang out in other quarters as he spoke. The U.S. delegation, which has backed Netanyahu in his campaign against Hamas, stayed put. The few world powers in attendance, the United States and the United Kingdom, did not send their most senior officials or even their UN ambassador to their section. Instead, it was filled out with more junior, low-level diplomats.

“Anti-semitism dies hard. In fact, it doesn’t die at all,” Netanyahu said. Netanyahu routinely accuses his critics of antisemitism.
