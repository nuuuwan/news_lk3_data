### Preparing For Free & Fair Elections

*2024-05-14 01:30:48* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/preparing-for-free-fair-elections/) · `en`

Elections provide a unique situation where people become equal regardless of their class or ethnic and religious identity. This offers space to rival politicians to address their unmet needs. The government has commenced several development initiatives that will take resources to the community level in a targeted manner. These initiatives would be beneficial to the government in mustering support for it at the grassroots level. Those who wield governmental power have the ability to make tangible offerings to the people to secure their vote in a time of elections. The intervention of the Election Commission and civil society organisations in disapproving some of these governmental actions and ensuring free and fair elections needs to be seen in this light.

Sri Lanka needs a new set of entrepreneurs to drive future economic growth based on productivity, in transforming the current business landscape dominated by patronage, rent-seeking and crony capitalism, Advocata Institute Chairman Murtaza Jafferjee said.

Given the limited capacity of the government to stimulate the economy, he stressed that productivity-based growth, through critical reforms, remains the only way forward.  “This growth can only be achieved by enhancing productivity, meaning accomplishing more with fewer resources. Going forward, we have no margin for experimentation. We must build upon our current efforts without regressing.

Competition is the answer for productivity improvement. The moment you have the competition, then you need intelligent people to come and show how to reduce the costs,” he elaborated.  Jafferjee expressed his views while addressing a panel discussion hosted by the Central Bank, last week.

Born in March 1864, Herbert Rayner Freeman was elected to the Legislative Council-(LG) under the Colebrook Constitution in 1924, representing the North-Central Province

Freeman was known to traverse miles along jungle trails, visiting the ill and those in need, always carrying his iconic umbrella. Remarkably, he even attended court sessions to advocate for individuals he believed had been unfairly accused in criminal cases

Abolish the National List; empower the electorate to choose their representatives. The current system is flawed, with party leaders and secretaries often lacking insight. They appoint individuals with dubious backgrounds, including terrorists and non-citizens, merely for financial gain. This practice undermines the credibility of our democratic principles and turns them into a farce. Let’s restore integrity to our electoral process by allowing people to have a direct say in who represents them.

It would be an absolute surprise for someone walking into a local ministry to find everything crystal clear. Rather it could be just the opposite with the operation all over the place. Sri Lanka’s system of government has a history of assigning unrelated subjects to a single ministry, thereby including multiple departments and institutions under one roof. The latest blueprint document for rational government by Verité Research reveals that the compositions of ministries had undergone changes 111 times between 2010 and 2023.

The influence of South Asians at the highest political levels in the  British Isles appears to be on the wane. However, there is speculation  that Leo Varadkar might take up a top job in the European Union and  become the first person of part-Indian origin to do so

But Varadkar could not solve Ireland’s acute housing problem. Under both  terms as Taoiseach, he failed to hit targets for affordable housing. A  whole generation of young voters were unable to purchase homes

### From reformist pedagogy to revolutionary pedagogy

*2024-05-13 23:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/from-reformist-pedagogy-to-revolutionary-pedagogy/) · `en`

Having been raised and schooled in Kandy, I have watched the festivities of the Esala Perahera at least 10 times, as a child, and drawn it at least five times during my school years. August was the best month for schools in Kandy Lake Round. We used to get a long school vacation as schools closed to house the forces providing security to the Esala Perahera. Ice cream carts, cotton candy vendors, popcorn, isso-wadai, balloon animals, sadda-nalaa  [whistles for the lack of an English equivalent], glowsticks; August was carnivalesque for my childhood self. Growing up, I saw it more as a circus. Why do crowds raise their arms with “saadu saadu”? Why are elephants in this procession? Why do new mothers take their children under the belly of elephants for good luck? Do elephants have healing powers? Are they divine? Why are they chained then? Are they beastly?

### Playing “Blind Man’s Buff” with Sri Lanka’s Free Trade Agreements: Part 1

Transparency and widespread consultation is vital for an FTA Feasibility Study that reflects the interests of the country rather than vested interests of a few politicians and their business henchmen

It is mind boggling to perceive that in their haste to clinch as many FTAs as possible in obedience to the political masters in the fastest possible time with least dissent and negotiation, Sri Lanka is negotiating FTAs at the same level of its more developed partner countries opting for “substantial liberalisation” under GATT Article XXIV and Article V of the GATS in elimination of existing regulatory measures and prohibition of new regulations

### Government proposes law to co-opt and control non-governmental activity

While we challenge these individual attempts to dismantle our freedoms and rights, it is important to take a step back and see the monstrous governance apparatus that is growing

The proposed scheme appears to introduce legal legitimacy for the current oppressive treatment of non-governmental organisations. The scheme explicitly requires organisations to comply with governmental policy and agenda, rendering unlawful those who may criticise, challenge and question Government policy and agendas. It seeks to assert authority over all forms of non-governmental associations, groups and activities by introducing mandatory registration, whilst retaining powers to give directions to institutions that are specifically excluded from registration. The Government investment in the institutional mechanism and apparatus to oversee, supervise and direct non-governmental resources and activity is quite simply a taking control of the vast breadth of institutions and groups

### Electricity sector: What Rohan Samarajiva didn’t say

Samarajiva bemoans the fact that wind projects in Sri Lanka must pass an environmental impact  assessment whereas those in India need not. And that is somehow a good thing?

In his article, “Electricity sector: Without investment we will be in the dark again” (Daily FT, 7 April, 2024), Professor Rohan Samarajiva, evidently the latest apologist for India’s Adani Group, writes, “An eminent public intellectual, Rohan Pethiyagoda, bemoans the fact that a unit of electricity produced by the wind power facility proposed by Adani will cost more than wind-produced electricity in the US and in India.” He goes on, in the manner of a gifted prestidigitator, to cite a litany of excuses that argue for waiving the rules to help Adani cream of more than $ 700 million in excess profits from Sri Lankan electricity consumers. Much of what he writes consists purely of smoke and mirrors. But let’s cut to the bone.

(Reuters) - France won a record 15 billion euros ($16.17 billion) in foreign investment pledges on Monday, allowing President Emmanuel Macron to bask in the limelight with global CEOs and forget about strained public finances and weak polls for a while.

The bumper crop of pledges, in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to pharmaceuticals and energy, stood Macron in good stead as he hosted business leaders for the annual “Choose France” summit at Versailles Palace.

This year’s figure is up from 13 billion euros announced in 2023.

The French presidency said the investments included 56 different business projects and could lead to the creation of 10,000 jobs.

Microsoft said it would invest 4 billion euros in France in its cloud and AI infrastructure, expanding its centres in Paris and Marseilles and adding a new data centre in the eastern city of Mulhouse.

### What is greatly interesting about the Diana Gamage Saga  is the different approaches taken by the Supreme Court and a majority decision of the Court of Appeal with profound implications on the roll of the judicial dice in each instance.

*2024-05-13 18:18:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84022) · `en`

Leaving apart the typically hysterical political brouhaha about the unseating of Diana Gamage, former (and largely unlamented) Member of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, what is greatly interesting about this otherwise distasteful saga is the different approaches taken by the Supreme Court and a majority decision of the Court of Appeal with profound implications on the roll of the judicial dice in each instance.

This concerned a parliamentarian whose seat was challenged by a social activist on the basis that she was the holder of a British passport thus ceasing to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and by virtue of Article 91 read with Article 89 of the Constitution, was disqualified from holding office as a Member of Parliament.

Significantly, the legal remedy sought was the rarely used Writ of Quo Warranto. This required Gamage to show ‘by what authority she claims to hold office and continue to function as a Member of Parliament.’

Colombo, May 13 (Daily Mirror) - The cost of climate change will account for a 1.2 percent loss of the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Sri Lanka by 2050 according to estimates by the World Bank, Senior Presidential Advisor on Climate Affairs Ruwan Wijewardene said.

He said it would be a multi-million dollar loss to the country.

Speaking during the ‘Environment Leaders of Tomorrow workshop’ organized by the National Youth Services Council over the weekend, Mr. Wijewardene said it is Sri Lanka’s agriculture which is mostly affected by climate change.

“It is essential for Sri Lanka to safeguard its agriculture sector,” Mr. Wijewardene said.

“Various buildings have been constructed in Sri Lanka lately. It is concluded that construction of modern buildings will give a good impression of a nation to the visitors. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe holds a different view. He believes in a green economy. This is why he proposed setting up a tropical belt initiative,” he said.
