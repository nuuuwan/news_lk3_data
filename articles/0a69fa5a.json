    "There is hardly anything that the NPP government and the Opposition do not look at through partisan political lenses and lock horns over, making one wonder whether the national interest ever figures in their scheme of things. Their latest battle is over the Trump tariffs that have made the world skip a spin or two, in a manner of speaking. The government is on cloud nine, claiming that it has been able to bring down the US reciprocal tariff from 44% to 30% through negotiations, but the Opposition insists that if the issue had been handled better, a further tariff reduction could have been obtained. Instead of making a joint effort for the sake of the country\u2019s ailing economy, which cannot take any more shocks, they are busy fighting political battles. The government exudes arrogance and hostility from every pore and has positioned itself on a confrontational course, and the Opposition is all out to score political points and apparently derives some perverse pleasure from the government\u2019s struggle to wriggle out of difficult situations.",
    "Thankfully, the government and the Opposition, for once, have seen eye to eye on the need for a joint effort to steer the country out of what may be called the current tariff mire. Speaking in Parliament, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday offered his side\u2019s support for the government\u2019s efforts to obtain a bigger tariff reduction from the US, and Minister Anil Jayantha Fernando appreciated the Opposition\u2019s offer. This is a positive development.",
    "President Donald Trump is apparently labouring under the misconception that his isolationist trade policies will help the US perpetuate its hold on the global economy. His MAGA (Make America Great Again) project has not got off to a flying start, and even the likes of Elon Musk have become disillusioned with his strategies and policies aimed at achieving his dream. So, it is only natural that Trump has weaponised tariffs, as it were, to boost his MAGA initiative, which is apparently losing its spark. He has told the world in no uncertain terms that he will do everything in his power to ensure that the US dollar retains its status as the most sought-after international reserve currency, and has issued a not-so-veiled threat to BRICS, which is working towards a common currency. He has imposed an additional 10% tariff increase on the BRICS member states and those who are seeking to join it. The big economies that constitute BRICS will remain resilient, but the developing countries, such as Sri Lanka, desirous of joining that strategic alliance have been left with a hard choice. The US may not win the economic war it has embarked on vis-\u00e0-vis the emerging global realities that do not augur well for its superpower status, with rival powers adopting bold, effective counterstrategies. China, Brazil, Russia, etc., have stood up to the Trump administration over the tariff issue, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has boldly called for a BRICS-wide independent settlement system using national currencies of the member states.",
    "The Trump tariffs are bound to cause a considerable decrease in Sri Lanka\u2019s export volume and revenue. Sri Lankan exports to the US yield about USD 3 billion annually, and apparels account for most of it. Other countries, such as the UK and the EU member states may step in to help the developing nations reeling from the US tariff shock, but Sri Lanka will have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.",
    "While having further negotiations with Washington to obtain tariff reductions, Sri Lanka has to make a thorough study of the fallout of the Trump tariffs across the globe, with special emphasis on other Asian nations\u2019 responses thereto, and work out a strategy to face the emerging challenges and possible crises, such as factory closures and mass job losses, which will lead to intractable social problems and even political upheavals. One of the biggest challenges before Sri Lanka is to diversify its exports and export destinations to cushion the blow from the US tariff hikes. The chances of Sri Lanka succeeding in its endeavour will be greater if the government, the Opposition and all other stakeholders join forces and pull in one direction. Otherwise, whichever party forms the next government will have a huge problem to contend with on the economic front.",
