    "Other suspects included the importer of the drug Sudath Janaka Fernando and Health Ministry officials T.D. Shanthini Soloman, M.M. Niran Dayananda and Sujith Wasantha Kumara.",
    "Before the remand order, the counsel appeared for Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake and requested bail be granted to his client.",
    "The counsel claimed that Dr. Wickramanayake was not functioning as the Director of the Health Department\u2019s Medical Supplies Division at the time of the forgery of documents to import the drugs took place.",
