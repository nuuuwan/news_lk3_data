    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has awarded Sri Lanka-based HNB Securities Limited its inaugural National Long-Term Rating of \u2018A(lka)\u2019, accompanied by a Stable Outlook.",
    "The rating reflects the Fitch Ratings\u2019 expectation of extraordinary support from parent, Hatton National Bank.",
    "\u201cThis assessment is underpinned by HNBS\u2019s synergistic role as the primary dealing arm of HNB, including for its affiliates and wealth management clients,\u201d  Fitch said.",
    "The rating also factors in HNB Securities\u2019 positive contribution to the parent\u2019s profitability, and HNB\u2019s oversight of it through board representation and periodic reporting.",
    "Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka-based HNB Securities Limited (HNBS) a first-time National Long-Term Rating of \u2018A(lka)\u2019 with a Stable Outlook.",
    "HNBS is ultimately 100% owned by Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB, AA-(lka)/Stable) \u2013 the fourth-largest commercial bank by assets in Sri Lanka \u2013 through HNB Investment Bank (Pvt) Ltd (HNBIB). HNBS, as one of the 10 active primary dealers in the country, is authorised to participate directly in government securities auctions. It is also one of the five primary dealers operating as standalone legal entities, while the remaining five are primary dealing divisions within banks.",
    "For more information on HNB, see our rating action commentary \u201cFitch Upgrades 10 Sri Lankan Banks\u2019 National Ratings and Affirms Five after Scale Recalibration\u201c, dated 21 January 2025.",
    "Support-Driven Rating: HNBS\u2019s National Long-Term Rating reflects our expectation of extraordinary support from HNB, if required. This assessment is underpinned by HNBS\u2019s synergistic role as the primary dealing arm of HNB, including for its affiliates and wealth management clients. The rating also factors in HNBS\u2019s shared branding with HNB, its positive contribution to the parent\u2019s profitability, and HNB\u2019s oversight of HNBS through board representation and periodic reporting.",
    "Moderate Reputational Ties: HNBIB, formerly Acuity Partners (Pvt) Ltd \u2013 a joint venture between HNB and DFCC Bank PLC (A(lka)) \u2013 became a wholly owned subsidiary of HNB following HNB\u2019s acquisition of DFCC\u2019s shareholding in HNBIB in January 2025. This transaction was followed by the alignment of the corporate and brand names of HNBIB and its subsidiaries, including HNBS, with HNB. That said, we believe the reputational risk to HNB in the event of an HNBS default is more containable than that for bank-supported finance and leasing companies rated by Fitch in Sri Lanka due to HNBS\u2019s lack of public deposit operations.",
    "Strategic Value: We believe HNBS\u2019s primary dealing operations have a strong strategic alignment with HNB\u2019s financial services franchise. HNB, together with other subsidiaries within the group, participates in government securities auctions exclusively through HNBS. HNB also plans to further integrate HNBS into the bank\u2019s broader wealth management business through cross-selling opportunities.",
    "Accretive to Group Profitability: HNBS is the largest profit contributor to HNB among the bank\u2019s subsidiaries and affiliates, accounting for 3.8% of HNB\u2019s consolidated pretax profit over the last five years (2024: 4.0%) on a pro forma fully owned basis. HNBS\u2019s average pretax return on average assets (ROAA) of 5.6% over 2020-2024 was significantly higher than the parent bank\u2019s standalone pretax ROAA of 2.4%.",
    "Group Oversight: HNBS retains significant management independence in its day-to-day operations, but it is subject to HNB\u2019s oversight through board representation and periodic reporting. HNB\u2019s CEO and head of treasury and markets are currently two of HNBS\u2019s three board members. HNBS is also required to report to HNB\u2019s risk and audit board committees on a quarterly basis.",
    "Parent\u2019s Ability to Support: We believe HNB possesses strong ability to provide extraordinary support to HNBS if needed, given the subsidiary\u2019s manageable size relative to the bank. HNBS accounted for 2.8% of HNB\u2019s total standalone assets and 3.3% of its equity at end-2024. The regulator has barred commercial banks from providing unsecured funding facilities to their subsidiaries since mid-June 2025. However, HNB can still extend funding backed by eligible collateral or inject equity capital, which provides adequate flexibility for financial support, if needed.",
    "Moderate Standalone Profile: HNBS\u2019s standalone credit profile does not drive its rating and is assessed to be weaker than its support-driven rating. This reflects HNBS\u2019s more volatile, market-focused business model and its concentrated repo funding pool. HNBS\u2019s large unhedged trading positions in government securities also heighten interest rate risk. We believe these factors are balanced by its relatively liquid assets primarily composed of government securities.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "HNBS\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in HNB\u2019s credit profile and our assessment of HNB\u2019s ability and willingness to provide timely extraordinary support. Developments that could lead to negative rating action include:",
    "\u2013 Weakening in HNB\u2019s ability to provide support, potentially due to a significant increase in HNBS\u2019s size or risk exposure relative to the parent\u2019s balance sheet, although the subsidiary is relatively small currently",
    "\u2013 A significant decline in HNB\u2019s shareholding with a material reduction in HNBS\u2019s strategic alignment with HNB that indicates HNB\u2019s declining propensity to support HNBS on a timely basis",
    "\u2013 Sustained poor performance and weak profitability for HNBS and/or a material reduction in HNBS\u2019s strategic value within the group that reduces HNB\u2019s propensity to provide support",
    "\u2013 A downgrade of HNB\u2019s rating would result in a downgrade of HNBS\u2019s rating by the same magnitude, provided other shareholder support factors remain unchanged",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "An upgrade of HNB\u2019s rating could lead to an upgrade on HNBS\u2019s rating by the same magnitude, provided other shareholder support factors remain intact. Significantly increased strategic integration with HNB, such as materially higher cross-selling or a greater contribution to the parent\u2019s absolute consolidated profit, could also strengthen the parent\u2019s support propensity.",
    "Any positive action would also take into account relativities with other support-driven entities on the Sri Lankan national scale, including HNBS\u2019s deposit-taking sister company, HNB Finance PLC (A(lka)/Stable)."
