    "The Na tree (Mesua Nagassarium) and the Nil Manel flower (Nypheae stellata) have recently (this article was written in 1986) been elevated to unique positions as Sri Lanka\u2019s National Tree and National Flower; the selection being made after contestants nominated their choice by writing an essay of less than 300 words. Even in run of the mill contests like the selection of beauties, sportsmen of the year and what have you the general public plays a more significant part once the parameters and the basis for selection, panel of judges etc., are made known. In this context, the results of which are of great national importance, the degree of public participation and the criteria on which the selection was made is not known. Further, there appears to be considerable disappointment in the choice and it therefore deserves more careful consideration.",
    "In the meanwhile the view of large numbers of people is, for instance, that the coconut tree is more suitable as our National Tree than the Na which is perhaps as important to us as any other beautiful tropical hard wood tree.The coconut industry itself is in the economic doldrums just now but the tree touches the lives of practically every man, woman and child in the country born and yet to be born.",
    "According to the Mahawamsa, coconut (Cocos nucfera) had been grown in Sri Lanka from the second century BC onward. Commercial cultivation was first encouraged by the Dutch Governor, Falk (1765-85) and today it is cultivated on approximately 1.22 million acres, 56% of which are small holdings.",
    "The tree is known as the \u2018tree of life\u2019 and its uses are said to be as many as the days of the year. This is no exaggeration as every part of the tree has some value, in homes and industry, benefiting the rich and poor. Surveys reveal that 10% of an average Sri Lankan family\u2019s expenditure on food is on coconut; the annual per capita consumption standing at 81 nuts.",
    "Since coconut is rich in protein it has a definite impact on the nutritional status of the nation though high level of consumption by the idle and those with heart diseases is said to be inadvisable.",
    "In 1985 the country\u2019s production was about three billion nuts, 47 % of which was consumed locally while the remaining 53% was exported in various forms. Foreign exchange earnings from exports which included fibre, charcoal and about a dozen other products amounted to Rs. 3,255 million which was approximately 7% of the country\u2019s earnings from exports that year.",
    "While its economic importance to the country cannot be disputed. the original home of the coconut has not been established. However, it is symbolic of a tropical country such as ours and its products are known and used the world over.",
    "A graceful trunk, a delicate looking feathery crown of leaves and green or orange nuts are ideally suited for development as a motif or logo for a country known for its lush vegetation and agrarian society. Additionally, universally known and considering its beauty it appears to be a better choice as out National Tree than the comparatively obscure Na tree.",
