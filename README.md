Teens spend on average five hours a day on social media, of their nine hours on screens

Hiding under a lobby group called NetChoice, it’s anything but

I keep tabs on misinformation, and its close cousin, disinformation for a simple reason. I teach a computer class. These topics are all part of an ecosystem that students didn’t have to worry about, say, a decade ago. I am talking about phenomena such as data harvesting, trolls, linkbait, sexting, two-factor authentication, ransomware and the whole nine yards of cyber security that IT administrators –and now the rest of us–lose sleep over.

The customer is the primary focus of any business. Even with the best intentions, companies sometimes fail to meet customer expectations, leading to dissatisfaction. This often occurs owing to the following issues:

When a problem arises, customers usually contact the company right away, expecting an immediate response. Responsiveness plays a crucial role in shaping the customer experience. Customers expect their issues to be resolved on the first contact or at least within the shortest possible time. Therefore, decision-making power should be as close to the customer as possible.

Somewhere in 2011, jazz genius Herbie Hancock made a generous reference to my familiarity with jazz and blues in the LA Times, due to my inputs into International Jazz Day which he initiated at the UNESCO, Paris. This American initiative was unanimously supported by the enthusiastic membership, with every ambassador testifying about his/her indelible first encounter with jazz, a cumulative testament to its unique universality.

Mere months later, the US was isolated at UNESCO when Palestine was admitted as a member by over the mandatory two-thirds vote, despite a stern warning delivered in person by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who flew in for the purpose. I figured in this battle for Palestine too with photos appearing in Liberation (founded by Sartre) and the international press.

Several months afterwards, all of us reconverged warmly at the first ever International Jazz Day Concert by Herbie Hancock and Friends at the UNESCO auditorium in Paris.
