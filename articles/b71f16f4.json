However, with improvements in the economy over the past year, today presents us with the opportunity to observe Ramadan and its fasting rituals as usual.",

To address this, future legislation will enable individuals to carry out their last rites in accordance with their religious beliefs or final wishes, ensuring everyone\u2019s right to burial or cremation. We are committed to formulating the necessary regulations to honour individuals\u2019 preferences in this regard.",

In light of this tragedy, we have decided to forego the national Ramadan festival this year and allocate the funds to support the people of Gaza. Additionally, a commitment has been made to construct a school in Gaza once the conflict subsides. Our stance remains firm in opposing the dissolution of the Palestinian state, and we stand in solidarity to end the ongoing conflict.",
