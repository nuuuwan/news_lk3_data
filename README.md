### FACTBOX – Sri Lanka’s new PM Harini Amarasuriya’s thorny path from social health worker

ECONOMYNEXT – She was ridiculed when she started to express her mind against social injustice to the public like a Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna activists while teaching as a lecturer at Open University of Sri Lanka, but Harini Nireka Amarasuriya never had an idea that she will end up as the island nation’s Prime Minister.

But, the 54-year old youngest in a three-member elitist family in Colombo on Tuesday took oaths as the 16th Prime Minister of Independent Sri Lanka and the third woman Prime Minister in the country.

An old girl of Bishops College, Colombo, Amarasuriya was outspoken against social injustice when she was young. She believes it came from her father.

Her first job as a social health officer, who dealt with sidelined women in early 1990s including AIDS patients and the war-affected, also helped her to connect any layers in the country – from professionals to uneducated people, from the rich to poor, and from elitists to the underprivileged people.

### Restraint on economy and full-steam on governance – AKD’s implicit strategy?

*2024-09-25 04:45:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Restraint-on-economy-and-full-steam-on-governance-AKD-s-implicit-strategy/4-767104) · `en`

What will be the strategy of the new President who soon will be going into a Parliamentary election? My reading is that the implicit strategy of AKD is to practice restraint on economic issues and go full steam on governance. This is evident from the way the campaign progressed with convergence on the economic front between candidates, but with AKD managing to rise above others with his convincing battle cry to restore trust in politicians and politics.

If that indeed is the strategy, it will be a win-win for all concerned.

Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of the 42% who voted for AKD, there is the 58% who did not. AKD won first-past-the-post, but the electoral result is clearly a mandate for consultation and compromise to take the concerns of at least some of the other 58%.

The economy and the political culture were the main issues in the campaign, but the NPP manifesto was short on details on each.

### Middle class angst of Karl Marx

*2024-09-25 04:40:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Middle-class-angst-of-Karl-Marx/4-767103) · `en`

Karl Marx made some prophetic and positive observations about capitalism

The collapse of the Soviet Union, China’s adoption of market driven policy, North Korea’s boorish behaviour and the history of brutal, totalitarian regimes that claimed to be “Marxist” have contributed to the erroneous notion that Karl Marx was an authoritarian thinker.

Some of my granddaughters have asked me who this Karl Marx was. I told them that Karl Marx was an Enlightenment age humanist and a philosopher who perceived the possibility of a utopian post capitalist society in which people could lead rich, fulfilling lives.

I also explained that Karl Marx said some very positive stuff about ‘Capitalism’ and that distinguished economists such as Kenneth Arrow regard his work as a revolutionary historical project.

Hence this brief essay. If its order and reasoning is a little convoluted, I request the indulgence of the reader for some allowance towards the muddled memory of a weary pilgrim.

A spark of protest emerged in July 2021. It has grown into an island-wide mass protest (Aragalaya) involving people of all walks of life. They gathered at Galle Face Green and delivered a message: “The country is bankrupt”. The messenger was taken to task.

Central Bank is located within sight of the Galle Face Green. Newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank delivered a message. “Sri Lanka is bankrupt and is unable to settle its mountain of debts”. Messenger, the Governor of Central Bank, has been listed under A- grade in the Central Banker Report Cards 2023.

As my friend Pali says, for us Sri Lankans what matters is not the message but the messenger who delivers it.

President-elect of Sri Lanka, Anura Kumara Dissanayake signs official documents during his swearing-in ceremony, marking the commencement of his Presidency

Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) has been elected as the ninth Executive President of Sri Lanka. The ‘election’ dust has settled, and it is time for all the competing candidates and their supporters to unite wherever, whenever, and however possible in the best interest of our motherland.

In their campaigns, the candidates spoke little on the important aspect of improving national productivity. Now that he is in power, I hope that AKD will give it his highest priority.
