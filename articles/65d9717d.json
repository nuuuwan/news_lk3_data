    "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that any foreign troops deployed to Ukraine, particularly while its invasion was still ongoing, would be considered \u201clegitimate targets\u201d by Moscow\u2019s forces.",
    "Putin\u2019s comments came hours after European leaders repledged their commitment to a potential peacekeeping force, a prospect that Moscow has repeatedly described as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf any troops appear there, especially now while fighting is ongoing, we assume that they will be legitimate targets,\u201d he said during a panel at the Eastern Economic Forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.",
    "Putin also dismissed the idea of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine after a final peace deal, saying \u201cno one should doubt\u201d that Moscow would comply with a treaty to halt its 3\u00bd-year full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
    "He said that security guarantees would be needed for both Russia and Ukraine.",
    "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later said Moscow would need \u201clegally binding documents\u201d to outline such agreements. \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t just take anybody\u2019s word for something,\u201d he told Russian news outlet Argumenty i Fakty.",
    "Putin\u2019s comments follow remarks from French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday that 26 of Ukraine\u2019s allies have pledged to deploy troops as a \u201creassurance force\u201d for Ukraine once fighting ends.",
    "Macron spoke after a meeting in Paris of the so-called coalition of the willing, a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine. He said that 26 of the countries had committed to deploying troops to Ukraine \u2014 or to maintaining a presence on land, at sea or in the air \u2014 to help guarantee the country\u2019s security the day after any ceasefire or peace is achieved.",
    "Addressing the participants of the international economic conference the Ambrosetti Forum on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was important that security guarantees \u201cstart working now, during the war, and not only after it ends.\u201d",
    "He said he could not disclose more details as they are \u201csensitive and relate to the military sphere.\u201d",
    "Russian troops attacked Ukraine overnight with 157 strike and decoy drones, as well as seven missiles of various types, Ukraine\u2019s air force reported Friday. Air defenses shot down or jammed 121 of the drones, it said.",
    "One attack damaged multiple residential buildings in Dnipro in central Ukraine, regional administration head Serhii Lysak wrote on social media. The regional administration also said that an unspecified \u201cfacility\u201d had been set alight in the strike, but did not give further details.",
    "Lysak shared photos of residential buildings with damaged roofs, glass shards lying on the ground and people carrying wooden boards to cover broken windows. \u201cPrivate homes were damaged. Windows in apartment buildings were shattered,\u201d he wrote.",
    "Meanwhile, in Ukraine\u2019s Chernihiv region north of Kyiv, Russian drones attacked infrastructure in the Novhorod-Siversk district, leaving at least 15 settlements without electricity, local authorities reported.",
    "Elsewhere, Russian troops destroyed 92 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Friday. Local social media channels in the city of Ryazan, approximately 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Moscow, reported that the city\u2019s Rosneft oil refinery had been targeted. They shared videos that appeared to show a fire against the night sky.",
    "Ryazan regional Gov. Pavel Malkov said that drone debris had fallen on an \u201cindustrial enterprise\u201d but did not give further details, instead warning residents not to post images of air defenses on social media.",
    "Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian oil infrastructure that it says fuels Moscow\u2019s war effort in recent weeks. Gas stations have run dry in some regions of Russia in recent weeks, with motorists waiting in long lines and officials resorting to rationing or cutting off sales altogether.",
    "The drone strikes were a key topic of rare high-level talks Friday between Zelenskyy and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, a tense encounter given Fico\u2019s repeated calls for \u201cnormalising\u201d relations with Russia.",
    "Following the meeting in Uzhhorod, a Ukrainian city near the border with Slovakia, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would continue to \u201crespond\u201d to years of Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, despite criticisms from Slovakia and neighboring Hungary.",
    "Both Bratislava and Budapest continue to import Russian oil and gas, even as most EU countries cut ties following Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of Ukraine. Recent Ukrainian strikes have disrupted shipments from Russia to Slovakia along the Druzhba pipeline, prompting Bratislava to protest.",
    "Zelenskyy told reporters that Kyiv was ready to supply its neighbor with oil and gas that didn\u2019t come from Russia.",
    "\u201cRussian oil, like Russian gas, has no future\u201d in Europe, Zelenskyy maintained, an apparent reference to comments made the day before by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
    "Joining a call with European leaders after the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d met in Paris, Trump said that countries in the continent must stop buying Russian oil, as these purchases help Moscow fund its war against Ukraine, according to a White House official. The official was not authorized to comment publicly about the private talks and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
    "Fico told reporters on Friday that both Slovakia and Ukraine \u201chave the right to defend our own national interests and we must respect each other in this regard.\u201d",
    "He also sounded a conciliatory note as he voiced his support for Kyiv\u2019s bid to join the EU, offering to share Slovakia\u2019s experience."
