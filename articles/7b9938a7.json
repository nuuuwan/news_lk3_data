    "Colombo, March 22 (Daily Mirror) - Over the past 70 years, the Presidents and Prime Ministers who governed this country lacked any significant job experience and also failed to provide a clear vision for the country, Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake said.",
    "Addressing the media yesterday, he said a President and a leader should have a vision for the development or betterment of the country on behalf of the people.",
    "\"As far as we see, none of the previous Presidents had the ability to manage. With the powers of the country, a President should be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the country. Being such a person, he or she should have a better knowledge of everything, especially economics. The lack of knowledge causes many issues,\" he said.",
    "\"The investments made in the country within the past 30 to 40 years are not enough for the development of the economy of the country. Due to not having a clear vision of the development of the country, even after 70 years, we have to talk about new plans and proposals,\" he said.",
    "A clean government without corruption and fraud and an understanding of management is essential for the betterment of the country, Ratnayake said.",
    "He also said that a trend has been created during the past two or three months through several alliances made by the existing politicians. They did this because they know that 60 percent of the existing 225 parliamentarians have to go home after any election is held.",
    "\"The current politicians are trying to fool the public again by resorting to some trick to get power. Therefore, the people should keep in mind not to cast their vote to these traditional politicians,\" he said.",
    "Without empowering the people and without having a clear vision and economic management knowledge, the economy of the country will not be uplifted.",
    "Without empowering the people, uplifting the country is a myth, Ratnayake added."
