    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s banks have reduced their purchases of Treasury bills contracting their holdings absolutely since over recent months, official data shows, as private credit picked up.",
    "Bank holdings of bills peaked in February 2025 at 2,825 billion rupees and has fallen to around 2,737 by July 2025, data published by the central bank show, indicating an absolute reduction of 88 billion rupees.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s bill auctions have failed to be fully subscribed in recent weeks at the cut off rates offered by the debt office, with no takers last week for additional bills offered on tap.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s bill yields have remained fixed in recent weeks, which analysts have dubbed the \u2018ramrod rate anomaly\u2019 in the past.  In the past the \u2018ramrod rate anomaly\u2019 has been enforced through printing money.",
    "However, banks are still buying bonds which are offered at higher rates.",
    "RELATED : Sri Lanka private credit continues blistering expansion in July with Rs201bn",
    "The fixing of bill rates and the discouragement of banks from buying bills, and have tended to come before a currency crisis even when budget deficits have been reduced by politicians.",
    "The emblematic year was 2018, when the budget deficit was brought down by then Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, rates were cut and money was printed through open market operations and swaps to trigger a currency crisis, higher energy and commodity prices and a voter backlash.",
    "At the time the central bank also jettisoned a \u2018bills only\u2019 policy and bought bonds outright, using central bank independence given by the Finance Minister.",
    "Ironically, the start of \u2018central bank independence\u2019 in the US in 1951 in the wake of the Fed Treasury Accord was a return to a \u2018bills only policy,\u2019 so that market rates would be reflected in government securities, EN\u2019s economic columnist Bellwether says.",
    "\u201cBut now it has come to reflect absolute discretion through open market operations as advocated by the International Monetary Fund and others, where a few state macro-economists tend do the complete opposite to operate a political transmission mechanism.\u201d",
    "The first time Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank discouraged bank investments in government securities was in the 1952/1953 crisis, its first, after running deflationary policy against US printing (ahead of the Fed Treasury Accord) in the first year or two of its operations.",
    "The central bank is now not printing money through open market operations and is operating a scarce reserve regime \u2013 though concerns have been raised about inflationary swaps, the single policy rate and moral suasion \u2013 and there are no forex shortages.",
    "A so-called \u2018fiscal buffer\u2019, in the style of a buffer for oil prices that was built by macro-economists in the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration has also drawn concerns as a measure that will hinder market interest rates and may also lead to loss of reserves in the short term.",
    "However, if a scarce reserve regime is operated only for clearing and not funding credit, the possibility of out-of-control private credit is vastly reduced as banks will either have to raise deposit rates or delay credit.  (Colombo/Aug11/2025)"
