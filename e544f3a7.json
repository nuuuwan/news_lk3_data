  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) condemned the recent statement by Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella where he had said there is no official definition to rate any medicine as of inferior quality.",
    "Speaking to the Daily Mirror, SLMA President Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne said, \u201cIt was an irresponsible statement and thus cannot be condoned.",
    "\u201cWe cannot expect such a statement by a Health Minister on a crucial matter like the quality of drugs. He should have done a thorough study on the matter,\u201d he stressed.",
    "\u201cIt is noteworthy that although there should be a process to ensure the quality of drugs, the process of evaluation of drugs is not in place in Sri Lanka and for that, the NMRA should be blamed,\u201d Dr. Ariyaratne added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
