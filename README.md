*2024-05-11 01:38:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fitch-affirms-srilankan-airlines-government-guaranteed-bonds-at-c/) · `en`

This is in addition to previous missed coupon payments in June 2023 and December 2022, and the events of default triggered via the 12 April 2022 announcement by the Sri Lankan government of a debt moratorium on several categories of sovereign and public-sector entities’ external debt, as well as the ensuing non-payment of interest on the government’s external debt.

### ‘The best time to plant a tree was 25 years ago, the second best is today’

*2024-05-11 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-best-time-to-plant-a-tree-was-25-years-ago-the-second-best-is-today/172-282335) · `en`

While President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Government has pulled Sri Lanka out of one of its worst-ever economic crises, the Government also needs to give special attention to issues such as plant health. Most village folk give much-needed attention to plant health despite problems such as shortage of fertiliser; but city folk generally do not bother much about plant health as they consider planting a tree to be the job of a servant. But good citizens need to be concerned about plant health and related issues because our health and the health of our planet depend on plants.

On Sunday, May 12, the United Nations (UN) marks International Day of Plant Health, with the focus being to raise global awareness on how protecting plant health can help end hunger, reduce poverty, protect biodiversity and the environment, and boost economic development.

### Will the approaching elections be free and fair?

*2024-05-11 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Will-the-approaching-elections-be-free-and-fair/172-282337) · `en`

What is the significance of the Election Commission’s (EC) announcement on Thursday that the next presidential election would be held between September 17 and October 16? It is a well-known fact to those who know the relevant Article of the Constitution. It would have only been relevant if the EC had announced the exact date for the election.

Although President Ranil Wickremesinghe has not declared his candidature for the forthcoming Presidential election, it is clear he has commenced his election campaign through vote-catching activities in various sectors, providing the voters with various goodies and freebies.

If we are going by a recent communication by the election monitoring body, the People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) to the Elections Commission (EC), what is shameful in this exercise is the President’s party, the United National Party (UNP) using public funds for these activities, abusing the powers of the President’s office.

### Battery-operated toys pose risks to kids

Colombo, May 10 - Battery operated toys sold in the market are harmful to children, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa said.

Since these toys contain lithium, silver oxide and alkaline button batteries, children can swallow them, put them in their ears or noses, and if children swallow these batteries, it can even be fatal to the child through the electrochemical activities.

The first part of the alimentary canal (the esophagus) is naturally narrow, and the maximum damage can occur when these are swallowed, and the submerged battery can travel to the stomach and cause severe damage, Dr. Rajapaksa said.

He also said that even the stomach can be fatally damaged through this, and even life can be lost due to the blockage of the respiratory tract.

Still, the country is reeling from its socio-economic and political debacle without a clear visionary leadership putting the country on a recovery path

Sri Lanka is battling with the current crisis because of irresponsible borrowing and investment in wasteful projects. The Supreme Court has given a ruling pointing out the responsible policymakers and concerned Government officials who contributed to the mismanagement of the economy. But it is good to remember stupidity is not a crime in the eyes of law, hence marginalised and vulnerable populations sacrifice future prosperity for sins of the corrupt and greedy

### UN General Assembly backs Palestinian bid for membership

(Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly backed a Palestinian bid to become a full U.N. member by recognizing it as qualified to join and recommending the U.N. Security Council “reconsider the matter favorably.”

The vote by the 193-member General Assembly was a global survey of support for the Palestinian bid to become a full U.N. member - a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state - after the United States vetoed it in the U.N. Security Council last month.

The assembly adopted a resolution with 143 votes in favor and nine against - including the U.S. and Israel - while 25 countries abstained. It does not give the Palestinians full U.N. membership, but simply recognizes them as qualified to join.

The resolution “determines that the State of Palestine ... should therefore be admitted to membership” and it “recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter favorably.”

In a startling turn of events, three police officers from the Sapugaskanda Police, including a sergeant and two constables, were arrested today on suspicion of accepting a bribe amounting to Rs. 150,000 to stop proceeding with legal action against the sale of aphrodisiacs (a food, drink, or other thing that stimulates sexual desire) by an Ayurvedic medicine dealer.

The saga began when the medicine dealer filed a complaint with the Sapugaskanda Police, claiming that the officers had conducted a raid on his shop. During the raid, they seized a bottle they purportedly identified as containing an aphrodisiac. However, instead of pursuing legal action, the officers allegedly demanded a hefty sum of Rs. 150,000 from the dealer to refrain from escalating the matter.

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka is in talks with Canada-based entrepreneurs of Sri Lanka origin to build a 500 million dollar industrial park in Kankesanthurai in the Jaffna peninsula, State Minister for Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama said.

The industrial park will be built on 700 acres by a defunct state-run cement factory.

The investors will invest 500 million dollars to build infrastructure in the land given by the Board of Investment under a private public partnership model.

The Canadian entrepreneurs will build roads and other infrastructure and will attract investors into the zone to recover their costs.

The zone operators have the choice of also constructing buildings and offering plug-and-play factories.

“It is entirely up to them,” Minister Amunugama said. “They can build factories or offer bare land.”

The defunct cement factory only has limestone in about 100 acres which will not be sufficient to sustain a cement factory for a long time, he said.

South Korea’s President, Yoon Suk Yeol, has announced plans to establish a new government ministry dedicated to addressing the country’s dire birth rate situation.

In a televised address, President Yoon highlighted the urgent need to confront what he described as a “national emergency” stemming from South Korea’s notoriously low birth rate, which has plunged to unprecedented depths in recent years.

The proposed Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-planning underscores the severity of South Korea’s demographic crisis.

With a fertility rate of just 0.72 in 2023, South Korea holds the unenviable title of having the world’s lowest fertility rate.

This alarming figure falls well below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman required to sustain a stable population without relying on immigration.

The demographic challenges facing South Korea and other East Asian countries are multifaceted and deeply entrenched.
