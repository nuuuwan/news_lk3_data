  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says increased Govt. revenue has not improved areas like reducing malnutrition, boosting consumption, improving education, or creating livelihood opportunities",
    "Criticises Govt. for failing to reduce electricity bills despite earning profits, leaving poor without relief",
    "Accuses current administration of continuing same exploitative policies as previous Govt.",
    "Questions Govt\u2019s failure to introduce new revenue-generating measures and calls on it to admit to misleading people with false promises",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday in Parliament expressed strong criticism of the new Government\u2019s failure to deliver on its promises and questioned the impact of its policies on the well-being of the public.",
    "Marikkar highlighted that while Government revenue and tax collection have increased significantly, this has been achieved through higher taxes and inflated bills which have negatively impacted the people. He questioned, \u201cHas the happiness of the people increased as a result?\u201d",
    "The MP argued that despite the rise in tax revenue, there has been no corresponding improvement in key areas such as reducing malnutrition, increasing consumption, enhancing educational outcomes, or creating better livelihood opportunities.",
    "While Marikkar acknowledged that a new Government must be given time to deliver, he noted that 100 days have now passed since the President was elected, and the promises made during the election campaign remain unfulfilled.",
    "He specifically criticised the Government for failing to reduce electricity bills as pledged, despite profits being made. \u201cWhy is the Government failing to provide relief to those living under the poverty line with the profits they have earned?\u201d he asked.",
    "Fuel prices were another major point of contention. Marikkar reminded Parliament that during a rally in August, the President had stated that fuel prices could be reduced and had promised to remove a Rs. 50 tax per litre. \u201cThese promises made during the elections are not being kept,\u201d he remarked.",
    "Marikkar also voiced concerns over the plight of senior citizens, who are suffering due to the increased withholding tax on fixed deposits. He accused the current administration of continuing the same exploitative policies as its predecessor, led by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "The MP questioned what new revenue-generating measures the Government has introduced, while extending an offer of support from the opposition to help improve government income. However, he insisted that the Government must first admit to misleading the public with false promises during the election campaign."
