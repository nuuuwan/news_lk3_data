    "The nature of the world is changing day by day. At present, the ways of life that were expected by us in the past are collapsing. Because of this, we are entering a period where many people around the world are travelling to Buddhist countries to find the essence of Buddhism, which explains the nature of life. The Buddhist teachings advocate the middle path for salvation.",

    "Throughout a long history, Vesak decoration has been a deep spiritual exercise that highlights the impermanence of life. Vesak decoration helps children to understand through experience that life leads to destruction unless it is well balanced. It is the duty of all adults to provide the necessary facilities and make the environment for children to understand life through experience of Vesak decorations. That also helps to preserve Vesak art.",
