    "Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019. The issue ratings on local-currency bonds have also been downgraded to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019.",
    "The Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR has been affirmed at \u2018RD\u2019 (Restricted Default) and the Country Ceiling at \u2018B-\u2019.",
    "The downgrade of Sri Lanka\u2019s LTLC IDR reflects Fitch\u2019s view that a sovereign local-currency debt restructuring process has begun, as parliament approved the government\u2019s domestic debt restructuring plan on 1 July.",
    "On 4 July, the authorities launched a formal exchange offer to bondholders for those bonds that are eligible for the restructuring.",
    "The debt restructuring announcement outlines a domestic debt optimisation (DDO) strategy, which includes treatment of Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt as well as domestically issued foreign-currency debt.",
    "The key elements of the DDO includ: conversion of CBSL\u2019s T-bills and provisional advances to the government into treasury bonds (T-bonds); exchange of superannuation funds\u2019 T-bonds into longer maturity T-bonds; exchange of outstanding Sri Lanka development bonds (SLDBs), which are US-dollar denominated but governed by local law, into new US dollar or Sri Lankan rupee instruments; and, restructuring of local-law foreign-currency denominated bank loans of the government.",
    "The debt restructuring excludes banks\u2019 holdings of Sri Lankan rupee-denominated treasury securities, but bank holdings of SLDBs will be affected.",
    "In Fitch\u2019s view, the proposed DDO will qualify as a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under its criteria, as it entails a material reduction in terms and is needed to avoid a traditional payment default.",
    "\u201cWe will downgrade the LTLC IDR to \u2018RD\u2019 upon closing of the exchange offer and following confirmation that the exchange will be executed,\u201d the rating agency said."
