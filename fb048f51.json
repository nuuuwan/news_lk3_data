    "\u201cThe EPF and ETF are the only sources of living for working people such as estate workers after their retirement. It is injustice and unreasonable to tamper with these funds. The government must stop such moves immediately. We will fight against such moves with the people. Public protests cannot be stopped by bringing in suppressive laws or obtaining court orders,\u201d he said.",
