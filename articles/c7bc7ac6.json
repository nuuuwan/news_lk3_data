    "British Council in collaboration with ChildFund Sri Lanka, recently concluded an exciting competition to celebrate the achievements of local Sri Lankan women in their communities. The She-roes role model competition encouraged Sri Lankan girls to recognise and celebrate the achievements of local female role models, nurturing appreciation for the remarkable women in their communities. Tailored for the English and Digital for Girls\u2019 Education (EDGE) project peer group leaders and members, the role model competition served as inspiration for its club members, nudging them to dream and soar to greater heights.",
    "The award ceremony for the competition was held on 22 March 2024 at the Tower Hall theatre in Colombo. The event showcased the talents and creativity of EDGE club members all over Sri Lanka, and recognised the achievements of local women role models and the tremendous impact they have on their communities. Nayana Ashcharya, hailed as Sri Lanka\u2019s first visually impaired fashion designer, graced the occasion as Chief Guest.",
    "\u201cMy warmest wishes to the women role models who were lauded and celebrated through this competition. It is a privilege to play a part in recognising the work that they have done and the importance they hold in their local communities. It is vital to spotlight positive role models for women and girls and empower them to realise their potential, while placing gender inclusion and access at the heart of their communities. The EDGE project has provided a safe space for girls to speak about the issues that affect them, empowered them to make more informed life choices and supported them to build the future they dream of,\u201d said Orlando Edwards, Country Director \u2013 British Council, Sri Lanka.",
