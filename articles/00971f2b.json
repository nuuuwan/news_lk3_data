    "Kumarika, hair care brand from Hemas Consumer Brands, has launched an initiative that brings personalised hair care experiences directly to customers via its mobile salon truck, \u2018Hair Play Studio.\u2019",
    "The \u2018Hair Play\u2019 campaign is designed to allow customers to experience and enjoy the benefits of Kumarika\u2019s latest range of shampoo and conditioner, which has been meticulously crafted to cater to all Sri Lankan hair types.",
    "This exclusive experience provides customers with an opportunity to enjoy a variety of personalised and fun sessions, which are aimed at addressing their hair care needs. The Kumarika Hair Play Studio experience begins with a personalised hair analysis, where a professional analyses a customer\u2019s hair, and recommends the most suitable Kumarika product for their specific hair problem. Thereafter, the customer will experience a hair wash using the recommended shampoo and conditioner, offering them a first-hand feel of the product. To add a special touch to the Hair Play Studio, customers also had a chance to purchase a personalised 80ml or 180ml bottle of Kumarika shampoo with their name on it. This initiative was greatly appreciated by consumers. Following the hair wash, a highly skilled stylist will create a personalised hair style based on the customer\u2019s preferences, ensuring that the style reflects their individuality.",
    "Kumarika\u2019s newest additions to its vast range of products, Damage Repair, Hydrating, Strong Hair, and Healthy & Black shampoo and conditioner variants, are manufactured to address damaged hair, dry or frizzy hair, weak and breaking hair, and dull hair which allows customers to try and play with different styles. This means they no longer have to worry about damage caused from the heat from hair styling tools, various hair treatments, pollution or even the weather. These new products add to the brand\u2019s growing portfolio of hair oils, shampoos, conditioners and hair serum.",
    "With plans to soon bring this thrilling experience to towns across Sri Lanka, including the Western, Southern, and Central provinces, Kumarika kicked off its campaign during the Colombo Shopping Festival at the BMICH. The goal of this initiative is to offer customers in various regions a unique, customised experience that emphasises individuality and self-expression.",
    "Hemas Consumer Brands Category Manager Hair Care Hirushi Fernando said, \u201cWe are excited to offer our customers a unique experience that allows them to embrace their individuality with their hair. Our goal through the \u2018Hair Play\u2019 concept, is to give people the confidence to express themselves, knowing they have the support of Kumarika\u2019s natural, carefully crafted products, allowing them to customise their hair styles as they see fit, without any fear. These aren\u2019t just ordinary hair care items; they\u2019re solutions specifically designed for Sri Lankan hair, ensuring protection and nourishment no matter the type. This initiative was a great success and saw a fantastic gathering of consumers and influencers attend the event.\u201d"
