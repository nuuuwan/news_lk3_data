    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that over the past year, Sri Lanka has managed to maintain a balance in its diplomatic relations.",
    "The President emphasized that in a world where economies and markets transcend national borders, no country can move forward alone, and Sri Lanka is working to elevate its standing globally through strong diplomatic ties.",
    "He also pointed out that for the country to move ahead, national unity must be built, and reiterated that the past year will be recorded in Sri Lankan history as a year where no ethno religious conflict was attempted internally.",
    "The President made these remarks today (28) at the Reiyukai Hall in Tokyo during a gathering with Sri Lankans residing in Japan.",
    "The meeting was organized jointly by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Japan and volunteer organizations. A large number of attendees joined, including members of the Maha Sangha, priests, professionals, and university students living in Japan.",
    "The President further noted that no Sri Lankan\u2014whether living in Sri Lanka or abroad\u2014had acted with expectations of personal favors or benefits to bring the current government to power. Instead, everyone contributed in anticipation of the transformation the people desired. He affirmed that the government is now fully committed to that transformation, and that the success of the government\u2019s first year should be judged on that basis.",
    "He said that people\u2019s expectations were to rebuild the shattered economy, ensure economic stability, affirm the rule of law, institute governance free from corruption, and make the state machinery efficient, and over the past year the government has executed a significant portion of these transformations.",
    "The President also emphasized that with the economy emerging, achieving economic growth targets is the government\u2019s ambition, and that in the next budget no new taxes are expected to be introduced; moreover, the government will look into reducing the rates of some existing taxes.",
    "To the Sri Lankans in Japan, he appealed to come and invest without hesitation, become partners in the nation\u2019s journey forward, and assured that the government is ready to provide all necessary facilities. Issues and ideas raised by those present were also discussed.",
    "\u201cYou have supported Sri Lanka\u2019s new political transformation in various ways. After the political turning point of September 21, you became part of that shift. A year has now passed since we came to power. By what benchmark should the past year be judged? Whether the year was good or bad should be evaluated in light of the hopes and expectations held by the people when the government was formed. If power is obtained without that foundation, it is not grounded in the expectations of the people who had other hopes.\u201d",
    "\u201cThose of you abroad, and everyone who contributed to forming our government, did so not to gain personal benefit, privilege, or advantage. You all contributed beyond personal desires, guided by the aspiration: \u2018What should we do as a country, as a nation?\u2019 Instead of continuing the old path, you worked to chart a new one.",
    "\u201cFirst, you recognized the need to strengthen a broken economy. Today, we have stabilized the economy to a measurable degree, though the journey ahead is long.",
    "\u201cWe also expected supremacy of the rule of law. In every developed country, a marker is that all are equal before the law. Even if legal frameworks exist, sometimes some cannot reach them\u2014power and wealth create barriers. But today, no one in Sri Lanka should live unable to reach the law. Access to law must be universal.",
    "\u201cIn rebuilding, we need economic stability, enforcement of the rule of law, minimal corruption, and an efficient state apparatus. After 76 years, for the first time we have built a government that does not steal or waste public funds. Yet more remains to be done. The state machinery must be freed from old conventions. We have placed the first step toward that change.",
    "\u201cWe have also begun building an efficient public service. A core part is digitalization. By next year, all transactions with government will begin via online payment systems. Tenders, regulatory work\u2014everything will be digitalized. We believe we can succeed.",
    "\u201cEven those who made the laws sometimes act contrary to them. While laws exist, they are not always enforced. Going forward, our step is not just to have laws, but to ensure they are enforced. That is being proven now. Today, forty parties met in a single chamber\u2014this itself is evidence. Among our citizens there should be a respect (or even fear) for the law. We are cultivating that culture.",
    "\u201cWe must also resolve the national question. Our approach is to govern in a way that no conflict arises among Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities. The people of the North have suffered greatly from war. To move forward without war again, we must build national harmony. We will provide the development and legal protection the North needs, and build a country where Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim citizens all have equal rights.",
    "\u201cTo save our children from the scourge of narcotics, we are taking action. Narcotics and organized crime are intertwined. Today, we are working to control them. We have resolved to dismantle the state infrastructure that supports narcotics and crime.",
    "\u201cMoreover, the benefits of economic growth must reach the people. No matter how much growth we show at the top, if people\u2019s lives do not change, it is not beneficial. You cannot always limit people\u2019s lives to mere subsistence. They must be given economic opportunities. Therefore, we must move agriculture and livestock sectors forward with modern technology and expand the economy to all regions; we already have plans for that.",
    "\u201cIn the most recent presidential and general elections, if the people hoped for a new change, a new path, we have been working tirelessly toward that. We expect your support on that journey. We do not want from you even a drop of blood or a tear. Bring investment to the country. Bring the experiences you gained abroad and contribute to Sri Lanka. For that we will arrange the necessary facilities. Accordingly, you will be able to become partners in nation building.\u201d"
