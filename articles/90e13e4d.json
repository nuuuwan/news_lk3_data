    "Currently, institutions providing money transfer services in Sri Lanka such as banks and nonbank financial institutions, are regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) or other relevant authorities to ensure financial system stability. However, some entities providing similar services operate outside the formal system, potentially disrupting the money transfer system and not being subject to Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulatory framework.",
    "To address this, the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policies issued the Money or Value Transfer Service (MVTS) Providers Regulations, No. 1 of 2024 dated April 20, 2024, under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005.

    "For the purpose of these Regulations, MVTS is defined as \u201cfinancial services that involve the acceptance of cash, cheques, other monetary instruments or other stores of value and the payment of a corresponding sum in cash or other forms to a beneficiary by means of communication, message, transfer, or through a clearing network to which the registered",
    "MVTS Provider belongs. Such transactions may involve one or more intermediaries and a final payment to a third party, and may be from place to place, within, to or from Sri Lanka or any other country\u201d.",

However, any person who is already engaged in or is eligible to engage in the business of or function as an MVTS Provider under any other licence, permit or authorization issued by CBSL, or any other Regulator or Government entity is exempted from the aforementioned regulation.",
    "Further, existing MVTS Providers who are already providing services without any licence, permit or authorization issued by CBSL, or any other Regulator or Government entity shall apply for a Certificate of Registration from CBSL, within one year from the effective date of these Regulations, June 3, 2024.",
    "The key requirements under the Regulations for a person to engage in the business of or function as an MVTS Provider are as follows:",
    "a. Shall be a company registered under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 having an unimpaired capital of at least Rupees Twenty Million (20 Mn) or such other amount determined by CBSL.",
    "A company limited by guarantee, an offshore company or an overseas company within the meaning of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 is not eligible for registration under these Regulations.",
    "b. Exclusively carry out businesses and activities of an MVTS Provider.",
    "c. Maintain/operate a system or well-defined mechanism for providing MVTS.",
    "An eligible person who intends to engage in the business of an MVTS Provider should submit the duly filled prescribed application to CBSL and obtain a Certificate of Registration. A company issued with such Certificate of Registration will be referred to as a \u201cRegistered MVTS Provider\u201d and will be entitled to engage in the business of or function as a MVTS Provider as defined above.",
    "Further, during this business process, transmission of money between Registered MVTS Providers and their Agents shall be by way of bank transfers. Further, they are required to maintain records of Agents, associates, employees engaging in MVTS related activities, and transactions including details of Transmitter, Beneficiary, Agent, the method of transfer, period of safekeeping, etc.",
