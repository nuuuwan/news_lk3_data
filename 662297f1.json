    "In commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day celebrated worldwide on 8 March each year, the All Ceylon Muslim Women\u2019s Association (ACMWA) has decided to initiate a biennial awards ceremony scheduled to be held on Sunday 3 March 2024.",
    "The timing is most appropriate signifying that they are also due to\u00a0 celebrate the ACMWA\u2019s 71st\u00a0 anniversary. The Association has chosen to highlight the achievements of Muslim women including the Malay, Bohra and Memon communities in Sri Lanka. The Imra\u00a0 Awards for Excellence was created to recognise these achievers. The organisers are working tirelessly to make it a reality considering the time frame. Imra in Arabic refers to a woman with the following attributes: power, growth oriented, strong, visionary, adventurous, freedom loving, spiritual, energetic, curious and magnetic. Hence, the apt name for the Awards.",
    "The event seeks to celebrate noteworthy achievements of Muslim women who have been a source of inspiration and service to the community at large. In initiating a biennial awards ceremony, it is proposed to raise awareness, highlighting the outstanding achievements of inspirational women for their willingness to rise to the occasion, demonstrate exemplary drive and put forth phenomenal efforts to better the community. The achievement of Muslim women will be recognised in the following fields: Professional Excellence Awards; Law and Advocacy; Healthcare; Banking and Finance; Education; Media, including Print and Digital; Hospitality and Tourism; STEM (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013a category meant to attract the younger generation); Entrepreneurial Excellence Award; Environment and Social Impact Excellence Award; Art and Culture Excellence Award; Two Lifetime Achievement Awards for women of other communities.",
    "The event is also set to raise funds for the Denara Vocational Training Institute, a subsidiary of the ACMWA, to provide scholarships for under-privileged young Muslim women attending classes at the Institute. In addition, part of the proceeds will be held in a Trust Fund for continuing the biennial awards night celebrating women of achievement.",
    "The organisers are honoured to have the presence of keynote speaker at the event, Dr.",
