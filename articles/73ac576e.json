    "The Deputy Minister also revealed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has no objections to increasing the salaries of public sector employees.",
    "Deputy Minister Mahinda Jayasinghe further commented, \u201cWe didn\u2019t say Rs. 25,000. Let\u2019s see about the exact number. Don\u2019t panic. Open and see what\u2019s inside the bag, don\u2019t poke it and see. Ranil Wickremesinghe made a Cabinet decision before the postal vote on September 4, targeting the votes of public sector employees in this country. But the public employees gave a good response. It was something presented to deceive public employees, not the reality.\u201d"
