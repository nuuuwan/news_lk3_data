  "original_title": "How Gotabaya  Rajapaksa Enabled  Ex-LTTE Eastern  Leader Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias  \u201cCol\u201dKaruna to go to Britain on a Diplomatic Passport Posing as a Sinhalese  named Kokila Dushmantha Gunawardena",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The United Kingdom(UK) announced on 24 Narch 2025 that sanctions have been imposed on four  individuals from Sri Lanka who were allegedly responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses during the civil war. A press release issued by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Office  stated that the  sanctions aim to seek accountability for serious human rights violations and abuses, committed during the civil war, and to prevent a culture of impunity. The sanctions against targeted individuals  include  measures such as travel bans to the UK and asset freezes.",
    "The four Sri Lankans sanctioned by the UK are former Head of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, Shavendra Silva, former Navy Commander, Wasantha Karannagoda,  former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, Jagath Jayasuriya and  former military commander of the  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan  known as Karuna Amman. As is well known Muralitharan broke away from the LTTE and formed the paramilitary Karuna Group, which worked on behalf of the Sri Lankan Army during the war.",
    "The inclusion of Muralitharan alias \u201cCol\u201dKaruna  in the list of sanctioned individuals has aroused much interest mainly  due to two  reasons. This is the first time that a Tamil person from Sri Lanka  has been sanctioned by a western  nation.Earlier sanctions by the USA and Canada  targeted individuals belonging to the  majority Sinhala community.  However it must be noted that those being sanctioned are not being targeted on grounds of ethnicity. They are being sanctioned for alleged involvement in human rights abuses, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
    "The second reason for the interest  shown by people in the sanctions by the UK  against Karuna is based on recent  history. Muralitharan alias \u201cCol\u201dKaruna is a person who was arrested, detained,prosecuted,imprisoned,released and deported back to Sri Lanka  several years ago. He had allegedly entered the UK posing as a Sinhalese  on a diplomatic passport. Ironically the passport was a genuine one issued by Sri Lankan authorities.",
    "After the  UK sanctions were  imposed the Tamil newspaper \u201cThamilan\u201d interviewed Karuna about it. Karuna was dismissive saying that the UK sanctions would not affect him or his politics in any way. Karuna denied that he  was responsible for any human rights violation. Speaking further he said that if he was guilty of any human rights violation, the UK could have penalised  him  when he sought refugee status there. \u201cwhy didn\u2019t they do it then?instead they sent me back home safely\u201dpointed out Karuna. He went on to say that he was not bothered by the UK sanctions.",
    "It is indeed ironic that a man who was deported from the UK 17  years ago has now been forbidden from travelling to the UK due to the sanctions imposed in a different context. Is Karuna being honest in saying that the UK authorities deported him instead of penalising him for alleged human rights violations because he was not guilty of any such offence? What were the circumstances under which he went to the UK 17 years ago and what exactly happened to him then?",
    "I have been  getting several queries from readers  seeking clarity on what happened then.Karuna\u2019s arrest in the UK was an issue about which I had written in detail in the 2007-\u201908 period. It is against this backdrop therefore that I re-visit -with the aid of earlier writings-  those events of the past concerning the arrest of Karuna in the UK by British officials. They were quite dramatic!",
    "The day, 2 November 2007, was a Friday. On that day in the UK, a team of 20-25 British officials swooped down on an apartment building in the South Kensington area of London. The group comprised officials from British Intelligence, Home Office, Border and Immigration Agency and the Metropolitan Police. Some stayed outside the building while others stayed close to exits in readiness to block anyone fleeing if necessary.",
    "The officials who rang the doorbell of the rented flat found five people \u2013 two adults and three children \u2013 of Sri Lankan origin inside the two-roomed residence. The officials had in their possession photographs of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias \u2018Colonel\u2019 Karuna a.k.a. Karuna Amman, the former LTTE Commander of the Batticaloa and Amparai Districts in  Sri Lanka.",
    "The man in the flat fitted the description in the photographs. He was asked politely for some identification. The man handed over a Sri Lankan diplomatic passport numbered D1944260 in the name of Kokila Dushmantha Gunawardena whose occupation on the passport was given as Director General of Wildlife Conservation.",
    "It had been issued on 30 August 2007 by the Sri Lankan Department of Immigration and Emigration. The British High Commission in Colombo had issued a multiple entry visa valid for six months on 5 September 2007. The arrival in London was on 18 September 2007.",
    "The photograph in the passport was that of the man in the photographs in the possession of UK officials. The name in the passport was different. It was blatantly obvious that the man possessing a passport in the name of Kokila Gunawardena was the man known as \u2018Col.\u2019 Karuna.",
    "While some officials interviewed \u2018Gunawardena\u2019 in the drawing room, others executed a search warrant issued against the premises. There was very little to be seized. The officials then checked the identities of the woman and three children. The woman was  Karuna\u2019s wife, Vidyavathy Muralitharan; the three children were Dharanya, Kalairathi and Darfan. They were applicants for refugee status in Britain and had been granted temporary admission officially.",
    "The officials then informed the man that they had doubts about the travel document used by him to enter Britain. They requested him to accompany them for further investigation. The man then dressed up and went along with the officials. He was not handcuffed or bodily grasped but walked out like a \u2018free\u2019 man. He was first taken to an immigration office.",
    "After further interrogation for some hours, the officials informed the man that he had entered Britain fraudulently. He was then officially informed that he was not eligible for admission to Britain and that pending further inquiry, he would be deported back to his country of origin, Sri Lanka. The diplomatic passport was seized. He was served with papers for illegal entry into the UK under the Immigration and Asylum Act of 1974.",
    "However the bearer of the diplomatic passport issued in the name of Kokila Gunawardena seemed to have anticipated such an eventuality. He was also aware of his basic rights.",
    "\u2018Kokila Gunawardena\u2019 then informed the British Immigration officials that he was Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan and not Kokila Gunawardena. He was a former member of the LTTE who had broken away from the Tigers and had formed an organisation called the Tamil Makkal Viduthalaiy Puligal (TMVP) or Tamil People\u2019s Liberation Tigers. The LTTE was trying to kill him and so he had fled Sri Lanka using a passport under a different name for security reasons. He said he wanted to ask for political asylum in Britain.",
    "Karuna told British officials that he had applied under his own name for a visa to enter Britain some time ago. He wanted to join his wife and three children. This was denied. Thereafter he was put on the blacklist. That is why he had entered Britain under a false name.",
    "Karuna said that the diplomatic passport had been given to him by the Sri Lankan Government. It was given under a false name because he (Karuna) was blacklisted by the UK and could not gain entry under his own name. He further said that the British visa too was obtained on his behalf by the Sri Lankan Government. Karuna said that he was escorted to a SriLankan Airlines plane bound for London (UL 505) by Government officials and given his passport with visa.",
    "Karuna\u2019s revelations were initially astonishing to British officials. They could not believe that a legitimate Government would engage in a fraudulent exercise and issue a passport \u2013 that too a diplomatic passport \u2013 under a false name. Though doubtful, the Brits said they would investigate the matter further.",
    "Karuna was taken to the Collingwood Detention Centre and held incommunicado pending further inquiry. The Sri Lankan High Commission in London as well as the British High Commission in Colombo were informed of the incident. Later on Karuna\u2019s wife and children were allowed limited access to him. He was also allowed to retain and consult with lawyers of his choice.",
    "Subsequently British officials discovered to their chagrin that Karuna was indeed telling the truth. An examination of his passport and visa were undertaken. The passport showed no sign of being a forgery or counterfeit after a most vigorous inspection employing the latest technological devices. His visa also was valid and not phony as it had been officially issued by the British High Commission in Colombo who confirmed it. Karuna personally had not made any false statements to the British High Commission in Colombo. He had had no direct contact with the High Commission at all. The Sri Lankan Government had procured the visa on his behalf.",
    "Muralitharan\u2019s wife Vidyavathy and three children had come to Britain many months ago. Like most asylum seekers they had used false travel documents to reach Britain and then sought refugee status under their own names. Vidyavathy, who is also called Neera, had frankly disclosed who she was and who her spouse was. The family was under grave threat and faced great danger from the LTTE and hence their flight to safety. British officials had accepted their claim as \u2018credible\u2019 and granted temporary admission after the first hearing.",
    "According to informed Tamil sources close to Karuna, the ex-Tiger leader had had no intention of residing abroad permanently when he travelled to Britain. His journey abroad had two purposes. Fundamentally, it was to see his wife and children and make further arrangements for their comfortable stay in Britain. The other purpose was to contact, by telephone, supporters and well-wishers living abroad and discuss plans of forming a new political party.",
    "Originally Karuna wanted to stay in Britain for only a month. However, family members had got him to stay longer. He had arrived in London on 18 September and earlier intended going back in the third week of October. Later he had decided to postpone his departure for another month. Had he acted according to his original plans, Karuna may not have suffered the controversy of arrest and discomfiture of detention.",
    "What went wrong for Karuna in the first place was that sections of the media in Colombo and abroad had begun speculating that the ex-Tiger leader had gone to Britain. The Tamil grapevine in London began to buzz with news of Karuna being in town. Sections of the media began contacting British High Commission officials in Colombo wanting to know how Karuna got into Britain and also sought more details. This was a legitimate function of the media. This persistent questioning was embarrassing the British diplomats in Colombo.",
    "With knowledge of Karuna being in London spreading, British authorities became agitated. Firstly, they were in the dark officially about how Karuna had entered Britain. There was no record of \u2018blacklisted\u2019 Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan being given a British visa. Secondly, there was fear of the LTTE launching a direct or indirect attack on Karuna on British soil.",
    "Against this backdrop, the British officials began probing the matter. Since Vidyavathy Muralitharan had already made a refugee claim divulging identity and full particulars, her residence was monitored first. It was just a matter of time before it was discovered that \u2018Mister Muralitharan\u2019 was there.",
    "When the officials \u2018raided\u2019 the residence, they had suspected Karuna of having used a false passport to enter Britain. The preliminary documentation for arrest was done with this in mind. When Karuna brandished a travel document under another identity, the officials were not surprised.",
    "But what shocked the Brits was the sight of a diplomatic passport. \u201cHave the counterfeiters begun making DPL travel documents too?\u201d was their worry initially. Subsequently they were astounded to find it was genuine and officially issued by Colombo. The DPL passport had been issued under the name of Kokila Dushmantha Gunawardena on 30 August. Such passports are issued by the Immigration Department only to those eligible in accordance with  terms of protocol. Such issuance can also be done if directed by the President\u2019s Office, the Foreign Ministry or Defence Ministry. In Karuna\u2019s case, the directive came from the then defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "Kokila Gunawardena\u2019s passport was submitted to the British High Commission along with those of a group of persons seeking visas to attend a conference on climate change in Britain. A third party note was attached by the Foreign Ministry recommending the issuance of visas. Kokila Gunawardena was described as an official attached to the Environment Ministry.  Former Jathika Hela Urumaya stalwart Champika Ranawaka was the Minister in charge then. The visas were issued on 5 September 2007. Karuna had landed at the Heathrow Airport on 18 September.",
    "UK officials were now faced with a tricky problem. They had very little grounds to charge Karuna as it was proved beyond doubt that the Sri Lankan Government had issued a diplomatic passport under a false name and also obtained a valid visa under false pretences. Therefore the prosecution would have found it virtually impossible to prove that Karuna had himself committed an offence under immigration law.",
    "So the British officials came up with an alternative plan. On 22 December 2007 Police officers visited Karuna at the Collingwood Detention Centre and technically \u2018arrested\u2019 him for breach of Section 25(1) of the Identity Cards Act No. 15 of 2006. Karuna was then moved to the Heathrow Police Station where he was questioned and his statement recorded with regard to the offence of \u201cpossessing a false identity document with requisite intention\u201d.",
    "There was however a \u201cchange of mind\u201d and the British finally charged Karuna for merely \u201chaving in his possession without reasonable excuse\u201d an \u201cidentity document that relates to someone else\u201d under Section 25 (5) of the Identity Cards Act.",
    "When Muralitharan\u2019s trial came up at the Isleworth Crown Court in West London, he entered a plea of guilty. However a statement by him was read out in open Court where Karuna explained how he had travelled to the UK with the backing of the Sri Lankan Government. His counsel, David Philips, reiterated this claim when he told the Court that his client had \u201centered the United Kingdom using a diplomatic passport with a six month multiple visit visa, issued at the British High Commission\u201d in Colombo.",
    "Elaborating further, Philips said: \u201cThe Sri Lankan Government gave him the passport and sent him to the United Kingdom\u201d and added that \u201cit was the Sri Lankan Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, also the President\u2019s brother, who organised it\u201d.",
    "Philips went on to say that Karuna did not go to the British High Commission to collect the documents and was merely following the instructions of the Sri Lankan Government. On 25 January 2008, Judge Hezlett Colgan sentenced Karuna to nine months\u2019 imprisonment.",
    "The British authorities were fully aware that Karuna faced a life threat in Britain due to the presence of LTTE and pro-LTTE elements. Therefore he was under heavy protection while he served his sentence in a reportedly \u201cundisclosed\u201d prison due to security reasons.",
    "Even as he was in jail, several human rights organisations mounted pressure on the British Government to invoke the principle of universal jurisdiction. They urged that Karuna should be investigated and charged for the human rights violations he had allegedly committed. These organisations also provided details about the alleged atrocities to British authorities for further investigation.",
    "This information was forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service for follow up action. According to a report in \u2018Trial Watch,\u2019 initially \u201cthe Crown Prosecutor\u2019s office indicated that they were considering proceedings against Karuna Amman for war crimes and human rights violations on the basis of the evidence presented by the Metropolitan police and outlined in expert\u2019s reports transmitted by non-governmental organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers.\u201d",
    "However, in an unexpected turn of events, the British Government announced on 5 May 2008 that there was insufficient evidence to convict Karuna for any criminal offence in the UK.",
    "The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it dropped the matter because it felt the information presented to them was insufficient. The CPS said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offences in the UK\u201d.",
    "On 9 May 2008, Karuna was released after four months in prison and placed in an immigrant detention centre pending deportation to Sri Lanka. He was deported to Sri Lanka on 3 July 2008.",
    "This then is the tale of Karuna\u2019s arrest, detention and conviction in Britain and deportation to Sri Lanka. It is indeed an ironic twist that British authorities have  now sanctioned  for alleged human rights violations , the very same person against whom the British legal system could not find sufficient evidence to prosecute several years ago.",
