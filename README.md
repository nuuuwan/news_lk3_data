This will be my first Christmas without my father, Eric Cooray, who passed away three months ago. Life has felt strange since that inevitable moment, one I always dreaded, while never anticipating just how difficult his loss would be to accept.

Almost every day starts and ends with thoughts of my father, from fond memories of my childhood to imagining how proud he would be of his beloved grandchildren. Throughout my life, he inspired me in countless ways. Even now, I draw so much strength from memories of him that it still feels like he is guiding me from the heavens, giving me the strength to keep moving forward.
