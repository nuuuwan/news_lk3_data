Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka put up a brave effort in two weeks of training as a XV a side outfit to outclass India by 45 points (7 tries, 5 conversions) to 10 points (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) at the Racecourse ground in Colombo last night.

Sri Lanka made their intention very clear of running the three quarter line and spread the ball wide with the speedy threes. Though the first 10 minutes, Indians stood out with some good defense, hosts Sri Lanka scored three unanswered first half tries, which put the Indians on the backfoot.  India spoiled many Sri Lankan moves but the lead the hosts created with very good foundation in the first half was too much for a catch up game.

Tarinda Ratwatte, Sohiru Anthony, Adeesha Weerathunga and Mursheed Doray were omnipresent. In fact Tarinda played a major role in the initial half as Centre and then moved to fill in Thenuka Nanayakkara’s fly half berth.

A source familiar with the meeting told Daily Mirror that Premadasa made such an offer during the discussion between his party and the CPC delegation that visited Sri Lanka recently.

However, the CPC is reported to have said that Sri Lanka should not attach special status to any country in its foreign relations.

At the meeting, Premadasa, apparently in reference to Indo-China conflict, said he, as a political leader, was ready for a mediatory role between the two Asian giants.

### On the NPP-SJB debate: the real question at stake

As Sri Lanka gets closer to the elections that are supposed to be held at the end of this year, a fierce contest seems to have occurred between the two main opposition parties, the Samaji Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Jathika Jana Balawegaya (NPP). Representatives of the SJB Economic Policy Committee, such as Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva, seem to have launched a strong attack on the NPP questioning the latter on economic policy matters.

One of the significant themes recurring in this attack is frequent references made to terms such as Socialism and Marxism. Addressing a press conference last week, MP Harsha de Silva stated that if the NPP Economic Council is not willing to come for a debate, the SJB economic committee trio would like to have the debate at the Galle Face Green, with cutouts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the opposing side.

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando has pledged to address technical issues  of the new visa system by May 7. This comes amid concerns of potential losses of 230,000 tourist arrivals and US$ 425 million in tourism earnings for the year.

Sri Lanka shifted to a platform operated by IVS-GBS and VFS Global mid this month from the electronic travel authorisation system operated by Department of Immigration & Emigration. Under the new platform, a multiple entry visa was introduced at a cost of US$ 75, with each stay limited to maximum of 60-days.  However, single entry visa which was earlier offered by ETA was not among the options.

An additional US$ 18.5 fee also charged as a service fee to the operator.

“We do have a slight problem since we changed the visa system. We are clearly feeling the heat. On a personal level, I am very disappointed that this happened, but I have a collective responsibility as a cabinet minister,” he said.

*2024-05-01 01:19:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Colombo-Consumer-Price-Index-dips-0-8-in-April-despite-festive-demand/108-281693) · `en`

Colombo district prices have declined by 0.8 percent in April from a month ago. This was helped by the drop in both food and non-food prices in the month, in what appeared to be an idiosyncrasy as typically prices get a bump up during the festive month.

Inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) fell after declining 1.9 percent in March, but the prices measured annually recorded a 1.5 percent increase.

The inflation measured annually declined to 0.9 percent in March due to both lower prices and higher base effects last year.

As a result, there were expectations for slightly higher prices in April from the level recorded in March.

Food prices rose by 2.9 percent in April from a year ago, cooler than 3.8 percent in March while non-food prices rose by 0.9 percent, after declining by 0.5 percent a month ago.

However, measured on a monthly basis, food prices have been on a deflation for the third month in a row. In April food prices fell by 1.0 percent.

The country has suffered a huge loss due to the delay in completing the Umoya Multipurpose Development Program. Accordingly, the loss in the last nine years is estimated at $ 587 million. The initial estimate of the project was recorded at $ 529 million.

### May Day: Not capitalism, but dogmatism has almost killed trade union movement

Rarely any other time,  save the campaign rallies, would the politicians speak so passionately about labour rights as they would today, the International Workers’ Day. But, in this quirky interest reeking of opportunism, there is a sense of irrelevance of what May Day was supposed to be.

Consider today, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa and a horde of Ministers who would ride their Pajeros to the podium while the party members who are bused from four corners of the country march under the scorching sun to mark the historic gains of the labour movement born out of a campaign for eight- hour work day.

### Are doctors’ unions making threats again? - EDITORIAL

The doctors in our country seem to be girding up their loin cloths for a possible fight with the government in the aftermath of a government decision to set up a medical faculty at the ‘National School of Business Management (NSBM) and at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).

A study by ‘The National Library of Medicine’ shows currently around 1,450 doctors enter the health system annually and the national doctor-to-patient ratio is 1:671 to 1,000 patients. Not surprisingly there is a shortage of doctors in the country.

According to the 2019 GCE (A/L) Examinations Analysis Book 20,287 students sat for the biology science (medical stream). In 2023, 40,329 students took the Bio Science stream. Of this number only 23,178 were able to gain entry to the available facilities in the country.

In other words we have a huge gap between the number of candidates attempting to enter the medical faculties of the university in the country and the numbers they are able to absorb.
