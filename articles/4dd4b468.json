    "State Minister for Defence Pramitha Bandara Thennakoon has directed the attention to a pre-symptom condition of a potential landslide near the Ella-Wellawaya road in the Karandagolla area of the Badulla district.",
    "The move was in response to recent indications of landslip susceptibility in Malittagolla, a sloping region of around two acres in the Ella area of Karandagolla. Concerns have been expressed by the community residing in the area, who blames the condition on possible effects from the Uma Oya project. Urging immediate action, he has instructed the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) and Disaster Management authorities to inspect the site and provide a comprehensive report.",
