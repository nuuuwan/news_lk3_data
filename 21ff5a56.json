    "Considering a high probability of millions of rupees being lost, the Department of Agriculture yesterday requested farmers countrywide to pay close attention to three insect diseases that are currently spreading in paddy cultivation.",
    "Studies indicate that some 22,000 hectares of rice cultivation in several districts of the island have been affected by three species of insects, namely, White Back Plant Hopper, Gray Plant Hopper and Leaf Curl worm. Timely counter measures often minimize the damage, Department of Agriculture, Director General Malathi Parasuraman said.",
    "Ms. Parasuraman said that all such insect damage can be prevented and agriculture consultants in all areas as well as other officials have been informed in this regard.",
    "She added special squads of agriculture have been deployed for field inspection.",
    "Parasuraman added: \u2018If these insects are present in their fields, farmers should immediately inform the officials of the Department of Agriculture and follow the instructions given by the agricultural consultants.",
    "\u2018Do not apply insecticides that are of inferior quality or follow the recommendations made by those who are not knowledgeable about this. Also, insecticides should not be mixed with other chemicals.",
    "\u2018Due to the ability of insects to withstand harmful insect chemicals (Chemical Resistance), it will not be possible to achieve proper results by applying insecticides.",
    "\u2018Steps should be taken to apply only pesticides recommended by the Department of Agriculture.",
    "\u2018Currently, these diseases are reported in the Northern Province, Eastern Province and North Central Province.",
    "\u2018Apart from this, the fall army worm is also reported to some extent in connection with maize cultivation. Therefore, it is necessary to check as much as possible in the cultivation field and destroy the worm cells, if any. The Department of Agriculture also emphasizes that measures should be taken to control by using chemicals only if necessary.\u2019",
