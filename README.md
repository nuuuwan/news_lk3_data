### Israel launches strikes on Iran, risking escalation in Mideast wars

*2024-10-26 07:25:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102931/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran-risking-escalation-in-mideast-wars) · `en`

Israel pounded Iran with a series of airstrikes early Saturday, saying it was targeting military targets in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier this month.

Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though there was no immediate information on damage or casualties.

The attack risks pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran – including Hamas in Gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon are already at war with Israel.

The Israeli military said Saturday it had launched “precise strikes on military targets” and, according to two Israeli officials, it was not targeting nuclear or oil facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the ongoing operation with the media.

I was lucky enough to associate with Renton for over two and a half decades. Maybe almost three, I believe. Memory goes back to “De Alwis Advertising Agency” owned by Anandatissa de Alwis, where Renton was driving the agency. I was the Marketing Manager for Elephant Lite Corporation Ltd. (ELCL). Marketing “Laxapana” dry cell batteries and ‘De Alwis’ was our advertising agency. When we launched “Fuji” batteries, as a very young marketing professional, strategic level advice received by visionary leader ‘Renton’ was unmatchable. Input I received for my launch presentation by him made me a different person. Teacher, Advisor, Consultant and dear friend, it is so sad to miss you suddenly and the message was shocking news to me.

### FAO introduces innovative technologies to build resilience in Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with funding from the government of Norway, has taken a significant step toward enhancing resilience and sustainability in Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector by handing over a multi-day fishing boat equipped with advanced cooling technology and a fuel-saving bulbous bow. This initiative promotes the adoption of new technologies to reduce post-harvest losses, lower operational costs, and improve the quality of fish for both local and export markets.

Sri Lanka’s multi-day fishing vessels, essential for deep-sea fishing, especially in the tuna export industry, often rely on ice to preserve fish during long voyages. However, this practice frequently compromises quality, leading to post-harvest losses. The Fish Loss and Waste (FLW) Assessment conducted by FAO in 2022–2023 found an average quality loss of 41.4% in the catch from Sri Lanka’s multi-day fisheries.

### State-hood and survival: Tamils, Palestinians and self-determination

Do Sri Lankan Tamil demands for a separate State or even ‘Eelam’ have the same status and legality within the international system as a Palestinian State?

Ultimately, the relative strengths and legitimacy of Palestinian claims to State-hood vs. Tamil claims to State-hood are based on the balance between the right to self-determination of one group vs. the right to maintain the existing territorial integrity of the other group. An interesting point to note is that in this thought experiment, the Northern Tamils are more analogous to the Jews than to the Palestinians. If this sounds counterintuitive, it is because comparisons of the two projects for State-hood are tenuous, as are attempts to make the rationale for one, a precedent for the other
