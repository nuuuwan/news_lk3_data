    "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the appointment of a committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chithrasiri, to assess and review the limitation of claims, allowances and privileges granted to Members of Parliament (MPs), Ministers, and former Presidents.",
    "The committee is tasked with submitting a detailed report within two months, offering suitable recommendations or suggesting other alternative methods to assess and review the limitation of claims, allowances and privileges.",
    "Members of Parliament, Ministers and ex-Presidents who are elected by the people, have been granted various entitlements, allowances, and privileges such as salaries, allowances, pensions, quarters, vehicles, staff, office equipment and security personnel.",
    "The government has to bear a significant cost annually from the public tax to provide the said various entitlements, allowances, and privileges and the government has recognized the necessity of minimization of this huge expenditure at the present fiscal capacity, the government said.",
    "Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the Prime Minister in her capacity as a Minister of Justice, Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Council and Local Government to appoint a committee consisting of the following members to submit a detailed report within two months with the suitable recommendations to study the facts in order to limit on a rational basis the entitlements, allowances, and privileges which creates an unnecessary burden on the Treasury or to introduce another suitable alternative method:",
