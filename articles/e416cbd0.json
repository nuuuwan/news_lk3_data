    "In celebration of its golden jubilee, the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) launches the Festival of Ideas, a collaborative initiative that promises to reshape conversations on international relations. Beginning Friday, November 1st, 2024, this thought-provoking programme unfolds every Friday of November (excluding the post-general election Friday) at the BCIS premises on Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo.",
    "The world is witnessing a global surge of armed conflicts, inter-state as well as intrastate and regional. The quest for international peace, understanding and cooperation remains elusive. Institutions of democracy are losing their relevance, discrimination and inequality are on the rise and the battle against climate change continues to be a challenge. Despite the remarkable changes of the last five decades, turmoil persists and the world is not very different from that of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, when she founded BCIS as the educational arm of the SWRD Bandaranaike Memorial Foundation. Her vision was to democratise the knowledge on international relations and BCIS has since its establishment in 1974 continued to be at the forefront of knowledge sharing in International Relations, providing opportunities to young and mature students for education and learning, collaborative research, networking, advocacy, and achieving language proficiency.",
    "Against this backdrop of fragility and fragmentation, the Festival of Ideas will create an independent space for informed dialogue that can influence the South Asian discourse on foreign policy and international relations and provide a \u2018bottom up\u2019, critical and alternative view on global politics and its impacts on the lived experiences of ordinary people.",
    "The Festival\u2019s programme weaves together diverse forms of engagement. Expert panels, leveraging both physical and digital spaces, will tackle urgent global issues\u2014migration, SOGIE rights, and Investor State Dispute Settlements\u2014while scrutinising international agreements and institutional frameworks. Participatory workshops and teach-ins will immerse attendees in urgent global dialogues spanning economic debt, environmental sustainability, gender dynamics, and urban development. The conversation extends through thoughtfully curated film screenings and book discussions, each adding new dimensions to these crucial debates.",
    "To further enrich the experience, three distinctive exhibitions have been prepared, that will run for three days each. From November 7-9, the University of Colombo\u2019s History Department presents \u201cLak Ithihasayata Kawuluwak\u201d (A Window to Sri Lankan History).
