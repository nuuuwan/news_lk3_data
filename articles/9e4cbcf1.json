    "Millions of Sri Lankans and Buddhists across the world will celebrate their most hallowed festival of Vesak today while participating in various religious ceremonies with pandals, eight-fold lanterns and other decorations.",
    "Traditionally, this doctrine or philosophy has been based on eight precepts: abstaining from killing, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from sexual activity, abstaining from telling lies, abstaining from intoxicating drinks and drugs, abstaining from eating after noon, abstaining from entertainment and beautifying the body and abstaining from using luxurious furniture.",
    "Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka on Poson Day by Arahath Mahinda Thero in 236 BC. The focal point of the Poson festival is the Buddhist monastic complex on the mountain of Mihintale, where Arahath Mahinda Thero preached Buddhism to one of the kings, King Devanampiyatissa.",
    "History tells us that King Devanampiyatissa was on a deer hunt on the mountains of Mihintale when he heard a proclamation: \u201cStop Thissa; do not kill\u201d. The King was surprised if not horrified as to who called him by the name Thissa. But after listening to Arahath Mahinda\u2019s explanation, he decided to turn to Buddhism, and thus began Sri Lanka\u2019s civilisation.",
    "During the festival, Buddhist temples attract thousands of pilgrims from across the country. Vesak celebrations are also seen at Buddhist sites in Anuradhapura, which was one of the first cities in Sri Lanka to convert to Buddhism. Pilgrims who visit the temples dress in white, and many of the most devoted pilgrims spend hours in quiet contemplation to honour the traditions of Buddhism.",
    "As in all areas of life, the example must be set at the top by those in leadership, but what we see today is seldom the practice of Buddhism but a blatant violation of its basic precepts. These are being violated with impunity and Sri Lanka is suffering the humiliation of being one of the most corrupt countries in the world.",
    "Today, it is especially evident that our politicians are trying to mix up Buddhism with politics in their greed for power. This began in the 1950s when the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike promoted the Sinhala-only policy that brought him to power but divided the country. In 1960, his widow Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2013becoming the world\u2019s first executive female Prime Minister, introduced several measures including the take-over of schools of other faiths.",
    "When our first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake\u2019s son Dudley Senanayake became Prime Minister after the 1965 General Election, he formed a National Government with the Tamil Federal Party getting the vital portfolio of Local Government. At a time when the Tamil people were asking for regional autonomy, Senanayake cut rice rations from two measures to one apparently disregarding the truth that the stomach is more sensitive than the head.",
    "In 1970, Sirimavo Bandaranaike swept power again and pushed through the Republican Constitution and enforced other measures such as a district quota system in education. This is widely believed to have led to the formation of terrorist or liberation movements in the North and a 30 year civil war which led to 100s or 1000s being killed or injured on both sides and causing incalculable economic damage. Sadly, it reminds us of Arahath Mahinda\u2019s first proclamation to King Devanampiyatissa: \u201cStop Thissa; do not kill.\u201d",
    "But, we must not think that Buddhism has been badly damaged. We still have the option of alpachchathawaya\u2014a simple and humble lifestyle. Wealthy, middle-class and the poorer folk need to practice this important Buddhist doctrine by also learning how to live from moment-to-moment."
