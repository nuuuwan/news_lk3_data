*2025-09-25 18:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226086) · `ta`

லிபியத் தலைவர் கர்னல் முயம்மர் கடாபியிடமிருந்து மில்லியன் கணக்கான யூரோக்களை சட்டவிரோதமாக பெற்றதாக அவர் மீது குற்றஞ்சாட்டப்பட்டிருந்தது. இந்த வழக்கில் செயலற்ற ஊழல் மற்றும் சட்டவிரோத பிரச்சார நிதியுதவி தொடர்பான சில குற்றச்சாட்டுகளில் பாரிஸ் குற்றவியல் நீதிமன்றம் அவரை விடுவித்தாலும், முக்கிய குற்றச்சாட்டில் குற்றவாளி என நிரூபிக்கப்பட்டது.

கடாபியிடமிருந்து பெறப்பட்ட நிதி, 2007ஆம் ஆண்டு நடந்த தேர்தல் பிரச்சாரத்திற்கு பயன்படுத்தப்பட்டதாக விசாரணைகளில் தெரியவந்தது.

இந்நிலையில், இந்த வழக்கு அரசியல் நோக்கம் கொண்டது என நிக்கோலஸ் சர்கோசி தனது நிலைப்பாட்டை வெளிப்படுத்தியுள்ளார்.

70 வயதான சர்கோசி, 2007 முதல் 2012 வரை பிரான்சின் ஜனாதிபதியாக பதவி வகித்தமை குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.

The government has said the existing SVAT will be removed from October 1.

Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was sentenced to five years in jail on Thursday (Sep 25) after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy over efforts by close aides to procure funds for his 2007 presidential bid from Libya during the rule of late dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

Sarkozy was acquitted by a Paris court of all other charges, including corruption and receiving illegal campaign financing.

But the ruling means the former president will spend time in jail even if he appeals, a sentence much harsher than many expected.

Sarkozy, who has always denied the charges, was accused of making a deal with Gaddafi in 2005, when he was France’s interior minister, to obtain campaign financing in exchange for supporting the then-isolated Libyan government on the international stage.

### Words Matter & Accuracy In Usage Matters Even More

My mother was my first and the last teacher. If she’s looking down from heaven, I suspect she’s quietly pleased with how I’ve navigated this world. She taught me to revere Dr. Samuel Johnson, not just as an erudite Englishman and lexicographer, but as a philosopher who warned, “Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.” She also introduced me to Mrs. Malaprop, that delightfully misguided character from 18th-century theatre, who mangled words with misplaced confidence.

Thanks to my beloved mother, I developed an early aversion to linguistic misuse. Whether in Sinhala or English, the wrong word in the wrong place grates on my ears like a surgical blade drawn across bone and in Sri Lanka, where both languages are wielded by the “educated,” the misuse is rampant.
