    "A peaceful protest was held on Thursday in front of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Flower Road, Colombo, calling for swift legal action against online gender-based violence (OGBV), particularly targeting women politicians, including former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.",
    "Organised by a group of women activists from both the political sphere and civil organisations, the protest demanded the intervention of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, who is also the Minister of Women, Children, and Youth Affairs.",
    "The protest followed a series of offensive comments made by popular YouTube figure Sudaththa Thilaksiri, who had recently used derogatory language against former President Kumaratunga on multiple occasions. The activists carried placards and raised their voices against online hate speech directed at women. They stressed that no one should be permitted to insult women, especially public figures, in such a degrading manner.",
    "Prominent human rights activist and lawyer Dr. Nimalka Fernando addressed the media during the protest, pointing out that women in politics face numerous challenges, and are often the target of sexist and disrespectful remarks. \u201cThis is not a protest against the President or the Government,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cBut it\u2019s become common to criticise women in politics based on their sexuality and social status, and we are often the targets. This has to stop.\u201d",
    "Fernando added that such attacks could deter women who are already in politics and discourage those aspiring to enter the political arena. She called for the removal of these harmful practices in order to foster the political reforms the public seeks.",
    "The protest culminated in the submission of a letter, signed by over 50 activists, including former Ministers Ferial Ashraff and Sumitra Priyangani Abeyweera, and former Ministry of Education Secretary Dr. Tara De Mel, to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The letter urged the Government to take immediate action against persons promoting hatred and insults toward women.",
    "Following a discussion with the Prime Minister\u2019s office, it was announced that Prime Minister Amarasuriya would meet with the activists at a later date to discuss their concerns."
