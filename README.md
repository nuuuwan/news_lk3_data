### Gaza aid fears as Israel bans UN Palestinian refugee agency

IsraelтАЩs parliament has voted to pass legislation banning the UNтАЩs Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) from operating within Israel and Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, within three months.

Contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will also be banned, severely limiting the agencyтАЩs ability to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Co-operation with the Israeli military - which controls all crossings into Gaza - is essential for Unrwa to transfer aid into the war-torn territory. It is the main UN organisation working on the ground there.

Unrwa staff will no longer have legal immunity within Israel, and the agencyтАЩs headquarters in East Jerusalem will be closed.

UN Secretary General Ant├│nio Guterres said implementing the laws тАЬwould be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a wholeтАЭ, while UnrwaтАЩs chief Philippe Lazzarini said it тАЬwill only deepen the suffering of PalestiniansтАЭ.

Here's a 200-character summary:

It may be exactly that the System Change should be done without representations.. That is why he asked the good leaders to give people a decree.

Furthermore, allegations are being made that the interim government has overborrowed during its first few weeks in office. The Central Bank has issued treasury bills of Rs. 465.1 billion from last September 27. However, the government has clarified that this is not a new or an additional loan.

The Lake Chad region has been repeatedly attacked by insurgencies including by Islamic State in West Africa and Boko Haram, which erupted in northeast Nigeria in 2009 and spread to the west of Chad.

Chad is an important ally for French and U.S. forces aiming to fight jihadists in the Sahel, which has become the epicentre of global terrorism under attack by factions loyal to al Qaeda and Islamic State.

Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have ended military operations with the U.S. and France in recent years and turned to Russia for support instead.
