    "A delegation from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), headed by Assistant Chief Executive Officer (Operations), Dr. Abdul Jalil Abdul Karder, along with two other officers from the Joint Operation Division of the SFA visited Sri Lanka from 25 to 28 March.",
    "The purpose of the visit was to conduct pre-inspections of slaughterhouses in Sri Lanka that have applied for licenses from the SFA in Singapore, with the objective of assessing the potential of Sri Lankan companies to be approved as sources of poultry products for Singapore.",
    "For Sri Lanka to export poultry products to Singapore, it is imperative for the country to meet the stringent requirements set out by the SFA. In this regard, facilitating this process, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) organised additional visits for the SFA delegation to rice processing mill, a fruit and vegetable processing centre, as well as a seafood export company. In collaboration with the SFA, the Sri Lanka High Commission in Singapore, the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH), and the EDB undertook efforts aimed at promoting Sri Lankan products, particularly poultry and rice, in the Singaporean market.",
    "Applications for licenses from Sri Lankan poultry processing and export companies, facilitated by the DAPH, are currently under evaluation by the SFA. Additionally, samples from various rice processing mills were submitted to the SFA for further assessment by potential clients.\u00a0 During their visit, the Singaporean team also held discussions with EDB Chairman Kingsley Bernard, and other officials of the Board. These discussions revolved around existing export opportunities and enhancing trade relations between the two nations. Representatives from the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association and the Sri Lanka Fruit and Vegetable Association also joined the deliberations.",
    "The visit of this delegation marks a significant step towards strengthening trade ties between Singapore and Sri Lanka, understanding the international quality and safety requirements for exports while considering opening doors for Sri Lankan poultry products to enter the Singaporean market and expanding market for other fisheries/agriculture products in Singaporean market."
