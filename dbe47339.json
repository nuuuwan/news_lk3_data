  "original_body_lines": [
    "While reiterating that existing laws are sufficient enough to take action against criminals involved in economic crimes, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today that the economic criminals are not brought to book due to bad political culture that prevails in the country, and not due to flaws in the law.",
    "Speaking during the adjournment debate on the Anti-Corruption Bill, he told Parliament that existing laws such as public property act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Bribery or Corruption Act and the Criminal Procedure Act and such acts are more than sufficient to take action against criminals who are involved in economic crimes.",
    "The MP said only the ordinary citizens involved in petty offences are netted by the judicial system, whereas those who are involved in serious offences go scot free due to political power.",
    "\u201cSomeone was caught for stealing coconuts, police constable and a Grama Niladhari who took bribe were brought to book. How come that happens if the law has flaws? The issue is not with the laws, but bad political culture prevailing in the country. This is a vicious circle that includes majority of political authority, handful of higher officials, several police officers, several business stalwarts and media tycoons. This is an interconnected vicious circle.\u00a0 This can only be addressed by a strong political system, not by laws alone,\u201d he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
