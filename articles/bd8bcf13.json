    "Train services between Colombo Fort and Batticaloa have resumed today after the tracks were cleared following yesterday\u2019s accident involving a fuel train near the Minneriya Rotawewa area, according to Sri Lanka Railways.",
    "All train services between Batticaloa and Colombo Fort were canceled yesterday (18), following the derailment of a train after colliding a herd of wild elephants.",
    "Six daily trains operate on this route, but services were suspended due to a collision involving a train transporting fuel.",
    "The incident occurred between the Minneriya and Higurakgoda railway stations when the train, en route from the Kolonnawa petroleum storage terminal to Batticaloa, struck a herd of wild elephants.",
    "The incident tragically resulted in the death of two wild elephants and left another seriously injured. The train, en route to Batticaloa, was transporting fuel when it struck the elephants, causing the derailment.",
    "Deputy General Manager (Traffic) of the Railway Department, N. J. Indipolage, had stated that the train could not be re-railed until the remaining fuel was safely removed from the affected tanks and that once this process was completed, work to restore the train to the tracks would commence.",
    "Meanwhile, an investigation has been launched to determine if the train was traveling at a speed above the regulated 20 km per hour, as indicated by warning signs in the area. Authorities are assessing whether the driver adhered to the speed limits, which are meant to protect wildlife in regions known for elephant crossings."
