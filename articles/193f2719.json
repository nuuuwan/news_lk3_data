    "In today\u2019s times when flow of capital takes place globally and many a times without any controls, it is important that Sri Lanka becomes a strong sovereign state in the region to begin with, a state that boldly spells its terms and conditions and also cleverly wades through the complex diplomatic tunnels in the region. The economic meltdown might have created an image of a weak nation and it might have given indications to the aspiring monopolistic private capital owners that they can potentially turn it into a banana republic. The emphasis on the strong sovereign state, with transparent, people-friendly laws and processes inside the nation. This needs to be signalled globally making it clear that people are the priority and not profiteering by the new Sri Lankan state.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has won over 2/3rd in the 225-seat Parliament. This is the first time in the island\u2019s history a single party has secured a super majority in Parliament under the proportional representation system currently use. This \u2018super-majority\u2019 of the NPP needs to be read as a mandate to take bold decisions, enact new policies without populist fears. The support for NPP has come from across the country as shown by the spread of their victorious candidates. For instance, the Tamil dominated Northern and Eastern provinces have also given them substantial votes. They won two seats in Trincomalee, getting around 42.48% of the votes in the district; won two seats in the Vanni district and got around 20.37% votes; and bagged three seats in Jaffna with 24.85%.",
    "The same trend is seen in the central highlands with a substantial population of Tamils of Indian origin. This overwhelming support can be read as a message of discontent and desperation that people have felt across the country with the way mal-governance over the years led to impoverishment, violence, and destruction of public institutions such as health and education. This also means that the onus on the running the new government in a \u2018different\u2019 way now lies with the NPP, which is for the first time going to govern the country. The onus is also on the intellectuals and activists who till now have been giving suggestions on policy matters but now have the task to build a new Sri Lanka. If this opportunity slips away, it will be considered a failure of all those sections who generated a hope to act upon each and every symbol of the destruction of the Sri Lankan institutions. A promise has been made. And hopes have been rekindled.",
    "This electoral mandate is deeply embedded in accumulated frustrations among the masses with the way governance has been carried out in Sri Lanka in past, which led to what has been termed the \u2018economic meltdown\u2019 post-2019, which saw its culmination in 2022 when people in large numbers protested in the streets across the land. General practice of electoral democracy has been that parties win elections and appearing again on the horizon just before the next elections while spending the rest of the time accumulating wealth for individual politicians and hoarding them in tax havens or investing in other countries.",
    "Given the hope generated by the NPP, the next few years will be a significant text of extreme proportions requiring overtime work by the new government. Governance is ideally a shift from the rhetoric that goes on during the run up to elections. Post-elections, it is about putting ideas and visions into practice, actualising them on the ground. With huge intellectual backing, the NPP will have to reimagine policy-making, keeping in mind their vision of the new Sri Lanka. How it moves ahead will be keenly watched within Sri Lanka as well as globally.",
    "The new government cannot create deep structural transformation and the JVP and its allies, under the NPP umbrella, realise this. On the other hand, neoliberal interests, representing the predominant global paradigm, will not let Sri Lanka go for a direct pro-poor, welfarist state and they would bargain when it comes to financial aid. Capitalism, which has been in crisis globally has resorted to authoritarianism of the worst kind, and has been destroying institutions that have any potential for dissenting knowledges and advocacy and replacing them with direct rule of corporates.",
    "The NPP-led government will have to move towards a framework that incorporates welfarism without shunting out private capital, but putting ample controls over it. The other side of welfarism is also that it creates a solid basis for the local economy to become robust and potentially feed into economic activities. Sri Lanka will have to develop a model of development that moves away from a blind financial aid based economic development. It was this blind aid policy which fostered massive corruption in earlier governments and dragged the economy into deep slumber. There is a deep economic divide and this will have to be bridged, while also creating a wider purchasing power among people, providing Sri Lankans ample opportunities in agrarian economy as well as elsewhere.",
    "Knowing that this is not going to be a new Sri Lanka of restructured social relations of the egalitarian kind, the balance has to be created wherein the private capital works along with the state, which has to frame policies safeguarding interests of people and not the private capital. One of the models that may work is a combination of the private and public wherein the state does not withdraw from social sectors, but rather reasserts its role through better funding and innovative management and also allow private players to exist. For instance, the state-run education system will have to be transformed radically from where it stands now so that Sri Lanka produces the best minds and become a centre of new, relevant and innovative learning for the South Asian region. But this should be done without stopping private players in education to establish their centres. Let the vast mass of Sri Lankans get an education at state cost which will be comparable to any other education elsewhere. Obviously, the experts would put their minds to reimagine the education system, for example by not thinking that good education comes at the cost of local language but it can happen even while Sinhala and Tamil flourishes. The same must be done in the field of health. With the kind of super-majority that the NPP has got, this is very doable.",

This needs to be signalled globally making it clear that people are the priority and not profiteering by the new Sri Lankan state. It is also the time to reconfigure the image of Sri Lanka locally, regionally and globally, and one hopes that this will be done in the next few years. This is going to be a \u2018now or never situation\u2019 for NPP and also for the people of Sri Lanka.",
