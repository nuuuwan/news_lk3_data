    "The iconic Miracle Dome welcomed a delegation of over 100 Japanese visitors on a spiritual tour of Sri Lanka.",
    "The inaugural Japanese Lily\u2019s Spiritual Tour visited the Miracle Dome as the starting point of their spiritual journey around the island. The delegation was welcomed by The Glorious Church Chairman Pastor Harin Perera, prior to the group meeting with the Sri Lankan congregation of the church.",
    "The delegation comprises Japanese nationals from all walks of life, bound by a common goal of searching for spiritual truths and awakening. The Lily\u2019s group is led by Lily\u2019s Corporation President and Representative Director Yuri Fukuya. She, together with Chords of Singers/General Association (NIGIOTO) Representative Director Ayaka Mononbe, performed a special song at the event. The Glorious Church and Prophet Jerome Fernando Ministries are blessed to be hosting the very first such delegation.",
    "The Japanese Lily\u2019s Spiritual Tour aims to bring groups of pilgrims periodically to Sri Lanka, which will be a boost for tourism in the long run. Spiritual tourism has for years seen Sri Lankans visit other countries, but this is the first time such a large delegation has visited our island nation on spiritual grounds. As we enthusiastically advocate for visitors from foreign countries through the International Visitor Program, championed by Prophet Jerome Fernando, it is anticipated that this endeavour will not only open new avenues of tourism for the nation but also foster cultural exchange and mutual understanding between our countries.",
    "The tour, which will follow suit with many others, will also bring much-needed foreign exchange to the country."
