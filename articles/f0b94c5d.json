    "A day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to seize Gaza City, Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that the enclave\u2019s largest city could \u201cturn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas reduced to rubble earlier in the war.",
    "\u201cThe gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas\u2019 murderers and rapists in Gaza \u2013 until they agree to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war,\u201d Katz wrote in a post on X.",
    "He restated Israel\u2019s ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas\u2019 complete disarmament.",
