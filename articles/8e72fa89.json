  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would increase the tariff charged on imports from India from the current rate of 25% \u201cvery substantially\u201d over the next 24 hours, in view of New Delhi\u2019s continued purchases of Russian oil.",
    "He also said a \u201czero tariff\u201d offer for imports of U.S. goods into India was not good enough, alleging that India was \u201cfuelling the war\u201d in Ukraine.",
    "Trump\u2019s threat to India over its purchases of Russian oil started on July 31, when he announced a 25% tariff for Indian goods, along with an unspecified penalty.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re fuelling the war machine, and if they\u2019re going to do that, then I\u2019m not going to be happy,\u201d Trump told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.",
    "\u201cNow, I will say this, India went from the highest tariffs ever. They will give us zero tariffs, and they\u2019re going to let us go in. But that\u2019s not good enough, because of what they\u2019re doing with oil, not good.\u201d",
    "An Indian government source said that India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil have helped to stabilise global oil prices by easing the pressure on supplies from other regions.",
    "India, the world\u2019s third biggest oil importer and consumer, buys more than a third of the oil it needs from Russia.",
    "\u201cIf we stop buying Russian oil, who will replace those barrels to maintain balance (in the market) and at the same time prevent the prices from shooting up? We don\u2019t want a repeat of 2022 when prices shot up to $137 a barrel,\u201d the source said, referring to the oil market spike around the time when Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began.",
    "The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the source was not authorised to speak to the media.",
    "Trump\u2019s latest comment followed a similar threat on Monday, which prompted India\u2019s Foreign Ministry to say the country was being unfairly singled out over its purchases of Russian oil.",
    "\u201cIt is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia (despite the Ukraine war),\u201d it said in a statement issued late on Monday.",
    "The EU conducted 67.5 billion euros ($78.0 billion) worth of trade with Russia in 2024, including record imports of liquefied natural gas that totalled 16.5 million metric tons, the Indian ministry said.",
    "The United States continues to import Russian uranium hexafluoride for use in its nuclear power industry, palladium, fertilisers and chemicals, it added, without giving a source for the export information.",
    "The U.S. embassy and the EU\u2019s delegation in New Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "Both the United States and EU have reduced their trade ties with Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "India imported about 1.75 million barrels per day of Russian oil from January to June this year, up 1% from a year ago, according to data provided to Reuters by trade sources.",
    "It has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Russia over the Ukraine war. New Delhi has resisted, citing its longstanding ties with Moscow and economic needs.",
    "India\u2019s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is likely to go ahead with a scheduled visit to Russia this week, two government sources said. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar is expected to visit in the coming weeks.",
    "The sudden rift between India and the U.S. has been deepening since July 31.",
    "Trump has said that from Friday he will impose new sanctions on Russia as well as on countries that buy its energy exports, unless Moscow takes steps to end the war with Ukraine.",
    "The trade tensions have caused concern about the potential impact on India\u2019s economy.",
    "The equity benchmark BSE Sensex .BSESN closed down 0.38%, while the rupee dropped 0.17% versus the dollar."
