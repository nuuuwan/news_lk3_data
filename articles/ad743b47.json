    "The CID has once again proved its selective efficiency and adeptness at doing political work. No sooner had it received a complaint from Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara that someone had sought to discredit him by having the title, \u2018Dr\u2019, placed before his name on the parliamentary website than it launched an investigation, interrogated the parliament staff and recorded statements, but its probe has apparently come up against a brick wall.",
    "Parliament workers have reportedly informed the CID that the titles given to the NPP MPs on the House website are based on information contained in a letter sent by the office of the Leader of the House, Bimal Ratnayake. What is described as an image of the letter in question is doing the rounds in the digital realm. The government has chosen to remain silent on the letter and the progress in the CID probe, which is bound to open a can of worms for it.",
    "What will the CID do now? Will it grill the staff of the Leader of the House as well? It will be interesting to see what the government\u2019s reaction is. Will the Justice Minister, who thinks there has been a sinister campaign against him, urge the CID to go the whole hog and get to the bottom of it?",
    "Strangely, an official of the Parliament Communication Department apologised to Minister Nanayakkara for what he called an inadvertent data entry error which had led to the placement of \u2018Dr\u2019 before Nanayakkara\u2019s name. He issued a statement to that effect when the Opposition raised questions about the academic credentials of the NPP MPs. He owes an explanation to the public.",
    "Minister Nanayakkara, after lodging his complaint with the CID, told the media that he suspected that there was a conspiracy to tarnish his image. Implying the involvement of his political opponents in \u2018the conspiracy\u2019, he went on to claim that \u2018the dog\u2019 (read the previous dispensation) had been got rid of but there were some \u2018fleas\u2019 left, and they too would be dealt with appropriately. He also expressed concern about what he called a counterrevolution.",
    "The Justice Minister has caused a great injustice to man\u2019s best friend. The NPP won elections by condemning the members of the previous government as a bunch of crooks who deserved to be behind bars for their many crimes; they included a politician who lined his pockets at the expense of cancer patients. Now, the Justice Minister likens those characters to canines!",
    "The mention of \u2018counterrevolution\u2019 must have sent a chill down the spines of those who are au fait with world history, especially the brutal manner in which some self-proclaimed socialist regimes dealt with \u2018counterrevolutionaries\u2019; they resorted to witch-hunts and kangaroo trials which led to the elimination of dissenters. This country is no stranger to savage political violence.",
    "Going by the aforesaid leaked letter, a wag asks whether the office of the Leader of the House has become the cradle of the \u2018counterrevolution\u2019 and home to the \u2018fleas\u2019 that have left the \u2018dog\u2019 in flight.",
    "It defies comprehension why Minister Nanayakkara made a beeline for the CID over the doctorate issue. He should have taken it up with the Speaker and the Secretary General of Parliament and asked for remedial action. That is the proper procedure. Unfortunately, aspersions are now being cast on certain parliament officials.",
    "The NPP parliamentary group has some members who served in previous parliaments and therefore are familiar with parliamentary affairs, and it is incumbent upon them to guide their junior colleagues.",
