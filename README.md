### இலஞ்ச ஊழல் மட்டுப்படுத்தப்பட்ட நாடாக இலங்கையை மாற்றுவதற்கு அனைவரும் அர்ப்பணிக்க வேண்டும் - ஜனாதிபதி

*2024-12-09 20:47:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/200837) · `ta`

எத்தனை சட்டங்கள் இயற்றினாலும், எத்தனை நிறுவனங்கள்  உருவாக்கப்பட்டாலும், அவற்றை வழிநடத்துபவர்கள்  சரியாகச் செயற்படாவிட்டால், குடிமக்களுக்கு நீதி  நிலைநாட்டப்படாது  என ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க தெரிவித்தார்.

மக்களால் ஸ்தாபிக்கப்பட்டுள்ள அதிகாரத்தைப் பயன்படுத்தி மக்களுக்கு நீதி வழங்கப்படாவிட்டால், அந்த அதிகாரம் பயனற்றதாகிவிடும் எனவும் ஜனாதிபதி சுட்டிக்காட்டினார்.

பண்டாரநாயக்க ஞாபகார்த்த சர்வதேச மாநாட்டு மண்டபத்தில் இன்று (09) நடைபெற்ற "2024 சர்வதேச ஊழல் எதிர்ப்பு தின தேசிய  நிகழ்வில்" ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க இதனைத் தெரிவித்தார்.

இந்த ஆண்டுக்கான சர்வதேச ஊழல் எதிர்ப்பு தினம் "தூய்மையான எதிர்காலத்திற்காக இளைஞர்களை ஒன்றிணைப்போம்" என்ற தொனிப்பொருளில் கொண்டாடப்படுகிறது.

இலங்கையில் இலஞ்சம் மற்றும் ஊழலைத் தடுப்பதற்கு போதுமான சட்டங்களும் நிறுவனங்களும் இருந்த போதும் இலஞ்சம் மற்றும்  ஊழலைத் தடுப்பதற்கு இந்தச் சட்டம் பயன்படுத்தப்பட்டுள்ளதா என்பதை தமது  மனசாட்சியிடம் கேட்க வேண்டுமெனவும்  ஜனாதிபதி தெரிவித்தார்.

At least 110 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti’s Cite Soleil slum when a gang leader targeted elderly people he suspected of causing his child’s illness through witchcraft, the National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) said on Sunday.

Wharf Jeremie gang leader Monel “Mikano” Felix ordered the massacre after his child became sick, RNDDH said, saying that he sought advice from a Voodoo priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft.

Gang members killed at least 60 people on Friday and 50 on Saturday using machetes and knives, it said.

Cite Soleil, a densely populated slum by the port of the capital Port-au-Prince, is among the poorest and most violent areas of Haiti.

Tight gang control, including the restriction of mobile phone use, has limited residents’ ability to share information about the massacre.

Felix, who heads the Wharf Jeremie gang, was in 2022 banned from entering neighboring Dominican Republic.

ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க தேர்தல் மேடைகளில் வழங்கிய வாக்குறுதிகளுக்கும், நடைமுறை நிர்வாகத்துக்கும் இடையில் பாரிய வேறுபாடுகள் காணப்படுகின்றன. கடந்த கால அரசாங்கங்களின் நிர்வாகத்தை விமர்சித்தே தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தி அரசாங்கம் ஆட்சிக்கு வந்துள்ளது.

Working with S W R D Bandaranaike in the 1956-1959 period had given me the opportunity of appreciating the many-faceted character of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was a devoted mother to her three children, ran her very busy and sometimes even chaotic household with a firm hand and had developed an understanding with her husband which allowed him to engage in his political pursuits with minimum interference.

### America has two presidents as the world braces for another Trump term

*2024-12-09 16:04:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/america-has-two-presidents-as-the-world-braces-for-another-trump-term/) · `en`

The election of Donald Trump as US President for yet another term has sent many world leaders scurrying for cover. Especially in the West. But even China is concerned. In the US itself, the longstanding maxim that there can only be one president at a time is being put to the test every day. Joe Biden, the outgoing president, is scrambling to salvage his legacy after a disastrous last year that has diminished all his achievements over the first three years on the domestic front.

Externally, Biden’s presidency has been a monumental failure, from the impulsive withdrawal from Afghanistan that kickstarted it, to the hopelessly painful stalemate in Ukraine and the relentless mass devastation in Gaza that are dragging out its end. With the pardoning of his son Hunter Biden, the outgoing president has ceded even the little moral hump that he had over Trump.

### Tonga’s prime minister quits moments ahead of no-confidence motion in parliament

Tonga’s Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned in parliament on Monday ahead of a planned no-confidence vote in his leadership, capping a period of fraught relations between his government and Tonga’s king.

Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.

His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between Tonga’s monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010.

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-09 13:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) · `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.
