*2024-10-17 16:29:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202274) · `si`

අනුරාධපුර දිස්ත්‍රික්කය ඇතුළු දිවයිනේ ප්‍රදේශ රැසක ඌරන් මෙම හඳුනා නොගත්  වයිරස රෝගයට ගොදුරු ව තිබේ.

ගොවිපොළ හිමිකරුවන් පවසන්නේ, රෝගය වැළඳී දින දෙකක් තුළ එම සතුන් මරණයට පත්වන බවය.

අනුරාධපුර මධ්‍යම නුවරගම් පළාත් ප්‍රාදේශීය ලේකම් කොට්ඨාසයේ උලුක්කුලම ප්‍රදේශයේ සත්ත්ව ගොවිපළ 20ක පමණ පැතිර ගොස් තිබේ.

ගොවිපොළ හිමිකරුවන් චෝදනා පැවසුවේ මෙම රෝගය හේතුවෙන් ඌරන් විශාල සංඛ්‍යාවක් මියගොස් ඇති අතර, වගකිව යුතු බලධාරින් කිසිවෙක් මේ පිළිබඳව සොයා බැලීමට මෙතෙක් පැමිණ නැති බවය.

### A crucial struggle in Women's World Cup today

*2024-10-17 16:20:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202273) · `si`

Australia and South Africa will be held between Australia and South Africa.

It will be held in Dubai as a night match, and the match will begin at 7.30 pm.

With the participation of 10 teams, Australia played its 'A' category.

There they will be a potential for 4 matches winning all four matches.

දකුණු අප්‍රිකානු කාන්තා කණ්ඩායම මෙහි 'B' කාණ්ඩයෙන් ක්‍රීඩාකළ අතර, ඔවුන් එක් තරගයක් පමණක් පරාජය වී තරග 3ක ජය තහවුරු කරගැනීමට සමත් විය.

ඒ හේතුවෙන් ඔවුන් එම කාණ්ඩයේ ප්‍රසාද ලකුණු සටහනේ දෙවැනි ස්ථානය පත්විය.

දකුණු අප්‍රිකානු හා ඔස්ට්‍රේලියානු කණ්ඩායම් 2009 වසරේ සිට මේ දක්වා අවස්ථා 10කදී එකිනෙකා සමගින් තරගවැදී තිබේ. ඉන් තරග 9කම ජය ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාවට හිමිවද්දී, දකුණු අප්‍රිකාව ජයගෙන ඇත්තේ එක් තරගයක් පමණි.

However, if the match is defeated by Australia, it will be the first Twenty20 Women's World Cup without a 14 year old.

ඉන් අවසන්වරට පැවැත්වූ තරගාවලියේ ත්‍රිත්වයම (2018, 2020, 2023) ඇතුලුව අවස්ථා 6කදීම ලෝක ශූරතාව දිනාගෙන ඇත්තේ ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාවයි.

### CEB criticized for ‘delaying’ electricity tariff revision

*2024-10-17 14:26:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102758/ceb-criticized-for-delaying-electricity-tariff-revision) · `en`

The Petroleum Trade Unions have criticized the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for failing to implement the revision of electricity tariffs, which was supposed to take place on October 01, allegedly due to the irresponsible actions of the CEB.

During a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (16), the convener of the union, Ananda Palitha, expressed concerns over the issue.

“The Electricity Board has not yet provided the necessary data to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for the revision of the electricity tariffs. Currently, the CEB’s net profit exceeds Rs. 155 billion. Why is there room for further exploitation?” he questioned.

Further, he urged the President to intervene, stating, “If you are committed to the welfare of the people, you should question the CEB on what it has been doing all this time. Immediate action can be taken to revise the electricity bill, potentially reducing it by at least 45 percent.”

நாட்டின் தற்போதைய அரசியல் சூழ்நிலை குறித்து கருத்து தெரிவித்த முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதி மைத்திரிபால சிறிசேன  அரசாங்கத்தின் அனைத்து மட்டங்களிலும் நேர்மை காணப்படவேண்டியதன் அவசியத்தை வலியுறுத்தியுள்ளார்.

நாடு ஒன்றின் தலைவர் ஆட்சியாளர் சிறந்தவராகயிருப்பதால் மாத்திரம் நாடு முன்னேற முடியாது, பிரதமரும் அமைச்சரவையும் சிறப்பானதாக காணப்படவேண்டும்.ஊழல் மோசடிகளிற்கு இடமளிக்க கூடாது.கடந்த 74 வருடங்களாக நாட்டில் காணப்படும் ஊழலிற்கு அரசியல்வாதிகளே காரணம் என சிலர் தெரிவிப்பதை நான் ஏற்றுக்கொள்ள மாட்டேன்,நான் இதனை முற்றாக நிராகரிக்கின்றேன்.

Two major shipwrecks—the New Diamond and X-Press Pearl—stand out in recent history as causes of significant environmental damage to Sri Lanka’s marine ecosystem. The New Diamond caught fire and sank 38 nautical miles off Sri Lanka’s east coast in September 2020, while the X-Press Pearl, a Singapore-registered vessel, sank near Colombo Port after catching fire in May 2021. Both incidents caused severe and long-lasting harm to marine life and coastal areas.

### Italy makes it illegal to seek surrogacy abroad

*2024-10-17 12:42:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102755/italy-makes-it-illegal-to-seek-surrogacy-abroad) · `en`

Italy’s parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime Minister’s Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners.

Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents.

The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year.

The legislation extends a surrogacy ban already in place in Italy since 2004 to those who go to countries such as the United States or Canada, where it is legal, imposing jail terms of up to two years and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.09 million).

In an incredibly silly switcheroo, Sajith and the SJB, hijacked or converted by an elitist cosmopolitan caucus, tried to play the UNP of 1977 rather than either of the two roles that were required by a democratic Opposition with a strong Left competitor. These were roles customised for Sajith and the SJB to play: SWRD 1956, Ranasinghe Premadasa 1988 or both. The SJB abjured these roles, abdicating them to their rival Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP. AKD kicked the goal in

The objective of lowering generation costs and, consequently, consumer tariffs will certainly not be achieved by the recent cabinet decision to reduce the Feed-In Tariff for Solar Rooftop PV, which, fortunately, has not been approved by the PUCSL

It is everyone’s hope that we may at last be moving towards a new dawn of prosperity and a future of sustainable growth in all aspects of economy and social well-being, with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake leading the way.

This hope is most prevalent in the Energy Sector, which has remained in the clutches of the fossil fuel lobby. While the transport fuels still remain nearly 100% dependent on imported fossil fuels, energy sources used for generation electricity generation have shown some progress in reducing dependence on such imports through the use of indigenous renewable energy sources.

When women are empowered, they become active contributors to the economy, driving growth and creating opportunities for all

Women empowerment is defined as “raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, equal status in society, better livelihood, and also accepting women’s viewpoints as well”, and it has become a significant aspect of the socio-economic development of a country. Women empowerment is categorised into 5 main pillars, namely, social, educational, economic, political, and psychological pillars.

The rural female labour force is 32.6% while the female urban labour force is 29.3%. Of the labour force, 6.5% of females are categorised as unemployed in the same year. Out of the total number of persons who migrated for foreign employment, 40% are females of whom 23.8% have migrated as housemaids.

Meddegoda had said, “If war crimes aren’t investigated (here), even political leaders might face travel restrictions.” In my view, not only political leaders but also investigators, prosecutors and even judges and their families, who fail to uphold human right laws may get exposed not only for international travel restrictions but also for other forms of legal harassments.
