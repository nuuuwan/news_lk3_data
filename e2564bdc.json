    "\"At the outset, as a Sri Lankan, I have always carried the Sri Lankan flag with great pride, have always strived to uplift the image of my country, and have contributed to the best of my ability in numerous ways, including singing. I love my Motherland,\" she said in her post.",
    "However, she had been requested to appear before the investigation team of the Public Administration Ministry by tomorrow. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
