  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Expert Committee appointed to investigate into the recent incidences of drug allergies and their aftereffects has determined that five out of the recent six deaths were due to anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction.",
    "This was revealed in the final report submitted to the Health Minister by the committee.",
    "Due to Doctor-patient confidentiality, the full report has not been fully disclosed.",
    "Nevertheless, the experts have outlined 12 recommendations in the report.",
    "1. Revisit and establish national and institutional guidelines/protocols on anaphylaxis management/ emergency management.",
    "2. Re- emphasize the practice of \"Recognise early and treat immediately with adrenalin\" in anaphylaxis. Authorize the registered nursing officers of institutions to use 1:1000 adrenalin in the IM route in an emergency without the directions of medical officers.",
    "3. Develop a mandatory continuous professional development mechanism or training programme for medical officers and nursing officers on emergency management of anaphylaxis.",
    "4. Institute a compulsory mechanism to conduct institutional clinical audits for all life-threatening adverse incidents reported.",
    "5. The TOR of DTCs should be revised to include the development of institutional drug management policies (ex: Institutional Antibiotic policy, ADR audit policy, etc.) and to introduce institutional mechanisms to minimize medication errors.",
    "6. Referral networks or pathways for anaphylaxis survivors for subsequent allergy reviews should be established.",
    "7. Establish a mechanism to educate Year 10 & 11 students at schools from across the country on allergy and the safe use of medicines/antibiotics. Establish a similar mechanism to educate media personnel and the public.",
    "8. Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ADRs reporting and response system by introduction of real-time data-sharing mobile applications. Allow the public to report ADRs to the NMRA.",
    "9. Take speedy remedial actions on procedural and/or financial issues that may hinder the adequate supply of safe and effective drugs of acceptable quality to healthcare institutions.",
    "10. Emphasize strict maintenance of temperature control during transportation of pharmaceuticals.",
    "11. Stringent evaluation of quality of medicines during registration and post marketing quality testing of random samples is recommended to improve the quality of pharmaceuticals in the country.",
    "12. Appropriate and expedited reporting on quality failures is needed. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
