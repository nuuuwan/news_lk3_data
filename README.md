### People’s role in NPP govt.

The election of the NPP as the new government of Sri Lanka is a victory for the people, whether they recognise it or not. While I don’t believe the election results reflect a major ideological shift, the government has the potential to spark one. However, for this to happen, the citizens of the country must also do their part

### Poverty of CBSL’s monetary policies: Part 1

*2024-11-18 23:14:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Poverty-of-CBSL-s-monetary-policies-Part-1/4-769383) · `en`

The economic consequences of the CBSL losing control over interest rates cannot be overstated

What is notable is not only that the CBSL continues to adhere to its flawed notion of money printing despite the evident logical issues in its interpretation, but also that it persists in its commitment to the quantity theory of money (QTM)—or at least its own variant of this theory. This is in spite of the numerous and growing criticisms from researchers in central banks across the world, including those considered to be at the forefront of research in monetary policy, such as the US and the UK

The CBSL does not appear to be fully committed to setting and targeting money market interest rates, which requires it to allow the quantity of cash to be determined by the market. In fact, as the IMF observes, the CBSL seems to be permitting the market, rather than policy, to set money market rates, while managing liquidity to prevent instability in these rates

### A ‘tectonic shift’ in  the plate of politics

Give the government a place to stand and let us hope it has the strength to move the earth

It must be evident by now in the densest of crania in the most conservative of political think tanks circumscribing the cocktail circuit that ‘something happened’.

But it may be a while before the penny, as they say, drops. Because, as a London-based revolutionary far from his Teutonic homeland once essayed about the plight of an oppressed class of people his continent over – from Moscow to Manchester – and their oppressors: “When the sufferers learn to think, then the thinkers will learn to suffer.” (Yes Karl Marx)

There are, it is said jocularly in circles where wit is observational of everyone else but oneself, three types of people: those who make things happen, those who watch while it is happening, and those who wonder: ‘what happened?’

What happened was that the threefold cord which is not quickly broken snapped suddenly after ever-increasing tension over the years.

Congratulations on your remarkable landslide victory, securing over a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This is a testament to the trust and belief the general public has in you. You have also set an inspiring example for greater women’s political participation, which is truly commendable.

As Sri Lankans, we have often relied on politicians to handle everything, but this approach has proven flawed. I genuinely want you to succeed so our country can regain its former glory. That is why I am raising my voice and sharing my perspective through this note, hoping it might be of value.

We can’t afford any more mistakes; the situation we find ourselves in today is dire. Every decision must be made with great care. The glass cliff lies before you and your Government, and navigating this challenging situation requires caution and thoughtful action. I offer this note in the hope that it may provide some guidance as you proceed.

### Arugam Bay is not Gaza: a reply to Tisaranee Gunasekara

Israeli tourists holidaying in southern Sri Lanka – and a somewhat pre-modern group catering to their religious needs – cannot and should not be held responsible for potential terror attacks on them stemming from Israel’s continuing war in Gaza and Lebanon

Gunasekara suggests that the ‘threat’ from the Arugam Bay Chabad stems from the wider movement’s extremist political ideology, as evidenced (by implication) in Israeli soldiers recently establishing a similar prayer house in Beit Hanoun, Gaza. And while I agree with her that any right-wing, ‘Greater Israel’-directed ideology poses a potentially serious political problem wherever it exists, I’m not convinced that is what’s at stake with the Arugam Bay Chabad

The recent election victory of Donald Trump came as a huge surprise to Americans, those on the liberal and leftist side of the political spectrum. Some reacted with intense emotions: tears were shed, declarations of leaving the country were made, and anger was directed at conservatives and anyone who voted for Trump. While this was not the first time, I had witnessed such a visceral reaction to election results, these responses only deepened my appreciation for the values I hold dear—those rooted in faith and spiritual teachings.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a 21-member new cabinet on Monday, four days after the election in which his National People’s Power (NPP) recorded a landslide victory, but his cabinet lacked representations from ethnic minority Muslims and Tamils from the island nation’s former war zone of North and East.

Dissanayake’s Maxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led ruling NPP won 159 seats in a 225-member parliament in a surprise win, much higher than NPP leaders’ estimation of 120 seats.

The more-than two-third majority will enable the Dissanayake’s new government to change the constitution focusing on the key promises they have given: eliminating corruption, implementing rule of law without any discrimination, and reducing cost of living.

“Historically, Sri Lanka’s political landscape has often been defined by a divide; North against South, and vice versa, which was fueled by mistrust and division,” Dissanayake said after the new cabinet  was sworn in.
