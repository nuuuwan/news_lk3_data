    "Indian authorities on Friday issued an order for the deportation of Santhan, also known as Thilliampalam Suthenthiraraja, a convict in the 1991 Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, to Sri Lanka. Santhan, aged 55, was granted premature release in November 2022 after serving 32 years in prison and is currently staying in a special camp within the Trichy central jail premises.",
    "The Indian Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Chennai issued the exit permit for Santhan\u2019s deportation on Friday. Depending on his wishes, Santhan is likely to be able to return to Sri Lanka as early as this week.",
    "The authorities announced that the process of verifying the travel documents of Santhan had begun and all other steps for his deportation had also commenced. Santhan is one of four Sri Lankan nationals who were housed in the Special Camp at Trichy following their release from prison. He is currently receiving treatment for a kidney-related ailment at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai.",
    "In June 2023, Santhan formally requested to be deported to Sri Lanka to be with his ailing mother. In early February, the Sri Lankan High Commission in India also provided travel documents to facilitate his return.",
    "Santhan had been in his 20s at the time of the assassination and was allegedly a member of the intelligence wing of the LTTE and was close to the prime accused Sivarasan. It is claimed he was sent to Chennai to continue his studies and after coming to India, studied at the Madras Institute of Engineering Technology, where the LTTE allegedly paid his fees.",
    "Santhan was allegedly a crucial player in the planning of the assassination and was one of the few conspirators who was informed early on about the fact that their target was Rajiv Gandhi. He had also met with Sivarasan on the day of the assassination and seen him off."
