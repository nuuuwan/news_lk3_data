ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s private banks may not need government support based on latest financial results but the impact of state enterprise loans and sovereign bond restructuring still needs to be assessed, Deputy Central Bank Governor Yvette Fernando said.

Private banks are likely to meet capital requirements on their own without government support, leaving only state banks to use budget resources, she said.

Sri Lanka’s banks were hit by bad loans from Coronavirus pandemic and the currency crisis and default.  Banks also had to provide for sovereign bond restructuring, though they were spared of rupee bond restructuring. As a result bond yields are now falling.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Chandima Weerakkody on Tuesday declared that the SJB is the most suitable political party for members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).

The MP addressing a press conference highlighted that SLFP founder S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike aimed to steer the party towards a moderate stance. Drawing parallels, he suggested that the SJB is currently following a similar path. Consequently, he maintained that the ideology most aligned with SLFP members is represented by the SJB.

Former SLFPer Weerakkody expressed his belief that the SLFP has undergone significant deterioration. He proposed that SLFP members might find it advantageous to consider joining the SJB, as its policies and ideology align more closely with their own.

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella’s revision application seeking bail has been rejected once again by the Colombo High Court yesterday.

In his bail application filed on 15 March through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrate’s decision to reject bail for him is unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition.

In March, Rambukwella’s bail application was rejected for the first time after the Attorney General had raised preliminary objections. Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama overruled the accused’ bail pleas and detained them indefinitely under the provisions of the Public Property Act.

Later, the former Minister’s daughter Chaminthri Rambukwella had filed the revision petition at the Colombo High Court requesting that her father be released on bail conditions the Court deems fit.

A global leader in responsible tourism raised concerns on lack of focus on sustainability in the tourism sector, which in turn could impede the current growth momentum in the medium term.

Intrepid Travel Chairman and Co-Founder Darrell Wade, who was recently in Sri Lanka, said the current status of the tourism industry, in terms of sustainability, is worrisome, primarily because of the drive for growth.

“We understand that it’s good for the economy, jobs, balance of payments, all sort of things. But if the growth is too fast and doesn’t factor sustainability, then that’s a major problem. We haven’t seen enough attention on sustainability (in Sri Lanka),” Wade told Mirror Business during his recent visit to Sri Lanka.

Although Sri Lanka may sustain the current growth momentum for the next two to three years, he expressed concern that it would not be sustainable beyond four to six years, if sustainability is not factored into the tourism strategy now.

### Hopes of peace dashed as confused US faces dogged Netanyahu

*2024-04-04 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Hopes-of-peace-dashed-as-confused-US-faces-dogged-Netanyahu/172-280126) · `en`

With public opinion that is increasingly supporting a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, in March, both US President Biden and his Republican challenger Trump appeared to be toeing a softer line on Gaza

A survey done in February found that around two-thirds of voters supported the US calling for a permanent ceasefire and a de-escalation of violence in Gaza

The US is blowing hot and cold on its policy on the Gaza war and is showing inconsistency in its actions. In contrast, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doggedly pursuing his uncompromising line on the war, disregarding rising opposition and even a revolt by the ultra-orthodox Jews in his homeland.

The net result of all this is that the prospects of peace in Gaza have receded further. And with Netanyahu bent on attacking Rafah, with a  huge population of locals and refugees from other parts of Gaza, more deaths and destruction are on the cards.

### World Health Day: ‘My Health, My Right’

*2024-04-04 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/World-Health-Day-My-Health-My-Right/172-280121) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s public health service is facing one of its worst crises since independence. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna government need to give much more priority to help the public health service recover; because as the cliché goes: “health is wealth”.

With public health trade unions staging regular strikes during the past two years, poor people have had to travel a long way to a public hospital only to be told that the nurses, attendants and other paramedical staff are on strike and that the people need to go back without treatment. The crisis involving former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella made the situation worse with the importation of substandard drugs from fictitious companies. The tragedy is that this is happening in the country which produced Prof. Senaka Bibile who was widely regarded as a prophet of modern medicine, and proposed a solution to the drug crisis.

### Kachchativu Island Debate: Political fodder,  No Serious Intentions

Indian National Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge hit back at the Indian Prime Minister questioning why his party did not take back the island during its past ten years in power

The issue involving Kachchativu becomes a hot political debate in India when elections are around the corner

In the course of the debate, Indian Prime Minister Modi slammed DMK party saying that the new details emerging on the matter have “unmasked” the party’s double standards

It is quite common that the issue involving Kachchativu, a tiny island in the Palk Straits between India and Sri Lanka, becomes a hot political debate in India–particularly in the state of  Tamil Nadu–when elections are around the corner in that country.

This time around, ahead of Lok Sabha elections, it has been raised; and the debate heated after remarks by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi placing blame on the Indian opposition over the agreement that ceded the island to Sri Lanka.
