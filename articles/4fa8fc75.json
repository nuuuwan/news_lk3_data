    "As part of the Nestl\u00e9 Coconut Development Plan \u2013 the \u2018Good Food Good Life\u2019 company partnered with the Coconut Cultivation Board of Sri Lanka (CCB) to conduct a two-day training programme for coconut farmers. The training programme was initially launched in 2024. Building on its success, the second edition was introduced this year to further expand its reach and impact.",
    "Conducted at CCB\u2019s Coconut Development Training Center in Lunuwila, the programme trained 25 local coconut famers on the implementation of regenerative agriculture practices in their farms, benefiting the farmers in improving coconut yield whilst conserving natural resources such as soil and water.",
    "\u201cOur long-running Coconut Development Plan stands as a strong testament to our commitment to advancing coconut cultivation in Sri Lanka. As the country\u2019s largest exporter of Coconut Milk Powder, I take pride in extending this initiative to support the farmers who supply us with coconuts. When we launched the pilot training programme last year, our goal was to help farmers adopt regenerative agricultural practices \u2013 an important step in our broader ambition to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This collaboration with the Coconut Cultivation Board marks a meaningful step forward. It not only promotes sustainable farming methods that benefit the environment but also helps unlock the full potential of this invaluable crop.\u201d said Bernie Stefan, Chairman and Managing Director of Nestl\u00e9 Lanka.",
