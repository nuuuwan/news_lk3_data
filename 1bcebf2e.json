    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Spokesman and Deputy National Organiser S.M. Marikkar in parliament yesterday strongly criticised Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, accusing him of unfair conduct. Marikkar claimed that the Speaker had arbitrarily limited the opposition\u2019s opportunity to express their views during the special session and vote on the government\u2019s domestic debt restructuring plan.",
    "\u201cThe President has requested the support of the opposition recently. But how can we support the Government when we are treated in this manner?\u201d he asked.\u00a0 \u201cIn such an instance it is impossible to even consider extending our support to the Government. We express our strong opposition to these actions,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The SJB accused the Speaker of ending the debate at 7:30 p.m. despite the MPs being informed by the Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera it would continue until 9:30 p.m. on the day. The opposition questioned the Speaker as to why the debate was abruptly brought to a halt on the day.",
    "His comments resulted in a heated exchange with the ruling party.",
    "\u201cYou do not understand Ranil but we do. You have been reduced to merely taking what is given, watching while remaining on the sidelines, and merely voting yes when ordered by the boss,\u201d he told the ruling party MPs.",
    "\u201cYou have managed to survive by joining with Ranil Wickremesinghe. But next time be prepared to go home\u201d the MP said to the MPs who opposed him.",
    "Marikkar said an SJB win at the next poll is inevitable. \u201cI am declaring it without any fear. Hold an election tomorrow and we will win. I challenge you to win at the next poll,\u201d he said."
