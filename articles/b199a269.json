  "original_body_lines": [
    "Northern former MP Angajan Ramanathan has formally requested President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to take action to reopen several key roads in the high-security zones of Jaffna.",
    "This request follows the President\u2019s decision to reopen two streets near the President\u2019s House in Colombo for public access.",
    "Ramanathan\u2019s appeal highlights that, despite the war ending 15 years ago, several vital roads in Jaffna remain closed, significantly disrupting daily life and transportation for the local population.",
    "In his letter, the former MP pointed out that the Jaffna-Palaly road, particularly the east side next to the Vayavilan Central College, should be freed from military restrictions. This road connects to the Ponnalai road, an essential route for local traffic. He also emphasised the closure of the Achuveli Vayavilan-Tholakatti street, which has hampered the functioning of major Government and private enterprises in the region.",
    "Furthermore, he called for the opening of the Vayavilan Jaffna Airport runway side road via Katuvan Junction, stating that this would significantly improve access to the Jaffna International Airport. Lastly, he urged the reopening of the Kankasanthurai-Keerimalai street which leads to an important historical and cultural site, arguing that this would not only benefit local communities but also boost tourism.",
    "Ramanathan stressed that reopening these roads would help bring peace, normalcy, and prosperity to the region. He expressed hope that the President would prioritise this issue, underscoring the positive impact such a move would have on the daily lives of the Jaffna people and the overall growth of the region."
