The harm they have been doing is diabolical, and yet, they expect you to believe they are the victims. Invoking a long-forgotten holocaust and screaming discrimination, they expect you to suspend fundamental human reason to believe that the daily sniping of children with so called “kill shots” to the head or chest and the bombing of entire neighbourhoods that bury families alive and wipe out whole bloodlines is self-defence and just.

It is a tragedy that we still follow the line expounded by the carbon emitters and polluters of the environment. We have accepted a high debt and fossil dependency scenario as the indicator of ‘Economic Development’. Our concerns with adaptation to the ongoing climate changes brought about by our own actions, seem to be minimal. The current disasters of fishermen getting caught in an sudden, random, wind events, are a foretaste of things to come. Sudden violent downpours that strip and erode the soil or delays in rain bearing winds that create harsh drought conditions, will become more frequent. The ‘climate affected’ population will grow with every event. We are witnessing the thin edge of the wedge.

“That’s their problem. They have to deal with that. You cannot carpet bomb all of the exporters.”

Sarkozy, who has always denied the charges, was accused of making a deal with Gaddafi in 2005, when he was France’s interior minister, to obtain campaign financing in exchange for supporting the then-isolated Libyan government on the international stage.
