    "Build Conservation contribution into core products while developing Community Resilience in the central highlands.A new chapter in Sri Lanka\u2019s forest restoration journey began with a landmark partnership between Alliance Finance Company PLC (AFC) and Preserving Land and Nature (Guarantee) Limited (PLANT), a news release from the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) said last week.",
    "Formalized through a recent MoU, this multi-year collaboration integrates sustainability into AFC\u2019s core products, supports the planting of 100,000 trees across PLANT sites, and initiates community programs near restoration areas.",
    "The first engagement unfolds at Radella Estate in Nuwara Eliya, managed by Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC, where AFC will help establish a forest corridor \u2013 part of a 13 km stretch being developed by WNPS PLANT with multiple partners.",
    "This initiative unites finance and conservation in a shared mission to restore native forests, enhance climate resilience, and deliver lasting benefits to local communities. AFC will fund the initial phase and aims to scale efforts over five years, combining ecological recovery with community development, nature education, and inclusive financial strategies to create a replicable model for sustainable restoration.",
    "Radella Estate, bordered by the Nanu Oya stream and dominated by invasive grasslands, is part of PLANT\u2019s Emerald Trails Initiative, an effort to reconnect fragmented habitats in Sri Lanka\u2019s biodiversity-rich southwest. Restoration will focus on planting native pioneer species to stabilize stream banks, improve microclimates, and boost biodiversity.",
    "Crucially, the project models how ecological restoration can align with community stewardship and climate adaptation, aiming to link restored areas with the Great Western mountain reserve, home to many threatened species.",
    "\u201cThis partnership shows what can happen when stewardship replaces sponsorship,\u201d said Sriyan de Silva Wijeyeratne, Chairman of PLANT. \u201cAlliance Finance is not just funding a project; they are investing in a living, breathing system. Together, we are bringing forests back, empowering families, and giving communities a tangible stake in nature\u2019s future. AFC is leading the way in demonstrating that sustainability efforts are long term oriented, and they were willing to provide longer term funding solutions for our work, once they understood our vision around Emerald Trails\u201d.",
    "Alliance Finance Company PLC (AFC), a pioneer in responsible finance and the first Sri Lankan finance company to commit to the UN\u2019s Principles for Responsible Banking, brings more than capital to the table. Through this partnership, AFC is helping shape a new model of conservation- one that integrates environmental regeneration with long-term social and economic resilience. This collaboration reflects AFC\u2019s dedication to Triple Bottom Line values: People, Planet, and Profit. It signals a transition from transactional CSR to embedded sustainability, where financial inclusion and ecological accountability go hand in hand.",
    "\u201cAt Alliance Finance, we believe sustainability means uplifting communities while restoring ecosystems,\u201d said Romani De Silva, the Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of AFC. \u201cThis partnership reflects our long-term commitment to financing regeneration, not just for nature, but for the people who depend on it. Together with PLANT, we are investing in a future that balances prosperity with planetary well-being. Through this initiative, we also aim to empower the next generation by linking tree planting with financial literacy via our Hapannu Savings Scheme \u2014 giving children a chance to grow their savings alongside the trees they help protect\u201d he further added.",
    "At the heart of PLANT\u2019s mission is the belief that restoration must be community-driven. Across 33 locations, PLANT prioritizes native biodiversity and science-based methods while empowering those closest to the land. The organization is building over 25 kilometers of forest corridors and works with local residents, especially women, youth leaders, and smallholder farmers, to lead restoration efforts. Through community nurseries, training, and income-generating opportunities, PLANT transforms degraded areas into thriving ecosystems. By rooting conservation in local hands, PLANT fosters shared ownership and responsibility, ensuring restored landscapes are protected for generations and that ecological revival goes hand in hand with community resilience.",
    "The broader vision is to embed restoration into the cultural and economic fabric of the region. Planned efforts include partnerships with local schools for climate education and student-led planting, digital tools for monitoring tree survival, and community engagement for long-term forest stewardship. By aligning conservation with inclusive development and responsible finance, the AFC\u2013PLANT partnership offers a scalable model for climate-smart restoration in Sri Lanka and beyond. As native saplings take root in Radella, they represent more than reforestation; they symbolize a cross-sector, inter-generational commitment to a future where both forests and communities can thrive together.",
