    "The nine humanoid robots gathered at the \u2018AI for Good\u2019 conference in Geneva, where organisers are seeking to make the case for Artificial Intelligence and the robots it is powering to help resolve some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges such as disease and hunger.",

    "The bust of a robot named Ameca which makes engaging facial expressions said: \u201cRobots like me can be used to help improve our lives and make the world a better place. I believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see those thousands of robots just like me out there making a difference.\u201d",
    "Asked by a journalist whether it intended to rebel against its creator, Will Jackson, seated beside it, Ameca said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you would think that,\u201d its ice-blue eyes flashing with anger. \u201cMy creator has been nothing but kind to me and I am very happy with my current situation.\u201d",
    "Many of the robots have recently been upgraded with the latest versions of generative AI and surprised even their inventors with the sophistication of their responses to questions.",
