    "Victory may have many fathers, but defeat isn\u2019t always an orphan. Just 24 hours after Donald Trump was declared as the 47th President of the United States, pundits and analysts are at it, trying to deconstruct perhaps one of the most consequential elections in US history and trying to find out what went wrong. The upshot of it is that yet another attempt at breaking the glass ceiling in the world\u2019s supposed bastion of democracy has failed \u2013 though, unlike Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris may return to the fight after the next five years are up. Until then, of course, a lot can happen. Not least of which, to the Democrats.",
    "Since 1992, when George H. W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton, the Democratic Party has been pursuing, as a mantra, a policy of triangulation and squaring the circle. At each and every election, it touts its liberal centrist credentials and hangs on to them as though they will be a near-certain guarantor of victory. To his credit, Joe Biden swerved somewhat to the left \u2013 at least in certain aspects of Washington\u2019s domestic economic agenda. Biden has been described as the most pro-worker American president since F. D. R.: no mean fit, even if the left-radical press takes issue with such praise.",
    "What is pertinent is that, as the Biden presidency made clear, the Democrats\u2019 shift to the left \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 could only be at the expense of its centrist charades. For better or worse, however, this was not a trade-off the party establishment were willing to take. From celebrity endorsements to lavishly funded National Conventions to carefully curated interviews, the Harris-Walz campaign signalled a return to the Democrats\u2019 Clintonian roots: a policy of triangulation and of appeasing the moderates in the room. In the context of an increasingly polarising political landscape, however, this could achieve either of two things for the Democrats: a marginal victory, or a colossal loss.",
    "At the last moment, the Republican rally at Madison Square Garden gave some hope to the Harris-Walz campaign. The rally was a naked display of wolf-whistling racism. But their response to it was, if not feeble, then predictable. Since 2016, when Trump announced his candidacy, liberals have constantly been using the fascist and Nazi label on his supporters. Whether or not the label fit, it became something of a thing to say.",
    "What the Democrats should have understood, yet did not, is that their denigration of Trump and his supporters would enable a section of the Republican party itself to band together with them: a miniscule minority, but an influential segment nevertheless. That would give Trump\u2019s campaign much needed fodder with which to both attack the Democrats and to claim themselves as the rightful heirs of the Republican Party. As Harris\u2019s endorsement by Liz Cheney shows, this is exactly what happened.",
    "People may have short memories, but sometimes memories don\u2019t fade away that easily. It was certainly ironic that Harris found herself on the same podium as some of the most reviled GOPers from recent memory. The Cheneys called Trump an enemy of the country and the Constitution, likening him to a fascist demagogue.",
    "Yet Cheney served as Vice President to one of the most questionable administrations in US political history, which not only passed the PATRIOT Act \u2013 an Act that Joe Biden and Barack Obama more or less approved of \u2013 but also whipped up the kind of Islamophobia and hatred of the Other, the kind of tax cuts and amnesties for the rich and powerful \u2013 that would distinguish the Trump presidency much later. As the liberal commentator Charles Blow put it in a New York Times op-ed in 2021, Liz Cheney herself began by endorsing if not supporting Trump\u2019s initial actions \u2013 including his attacks on Hillary Clinton.",
    "The Clintons, of course, must take some of the blame for what has befallen the Democratic Party. Yet from a certain perspective, they were also a product of their times in the same way Tony Blair was. Without overtly adulating him, it must be admitted that Bill Clinton saw through the largest peacetime economic expansion in US history. This is not an achievement Republicans can easily take away from him. But that expansion came at the expense of other priorities \u2013 most damnably, social welfare. As Clinton\u2019s Labour Secretary, the sharp, intrepid Robert Reich put it in a speech which played a role in his dismissal from the administration, the then government\u2019s pandering to financial interests, at the expense of workers and other deprived communities, could only fuel a popular backlash in the near-future.",
    "The 2024 election signalled not the rise but the apotheosis of that backlash. In 2016, Democrats chastened by Trump\u2019s victory could at least say he won the Electoral Colleges but not the popular vote. This time around, they don\u2019t have even that consolation: Trump got six million more votes than Kamala Harris. When you consider that he achieved this even as Harris went around defending Israel, wooing \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans, and using the same talking points against her rival, and when every mainstream media platform predicted defeat of some kind for her rival, you realise just how bad things have got for her party.",
    "In the 1990s, there were two distinct things which pointed to the rise of Trumpism. Robert Reich\u2019s speech was one of them. The other was Joel Schumacher\u2019s brilliant film Falling Down. It is ironic that almost exactly 30 years down the line \u2013 Reich made his speech in 1994, Schumacher\u2019s film came out the previous year \u2013 we have progressed from bad to worse to much worse. In terms of responding to the moment and taking advantage of the opportune, there is no doubt that Trump has squared the circle. There is also no doubt that the old Democratic strategy of targeting the moderate has run its course. The question now is, what next? Or, to paraphrase Lenin, what is to be done?",
