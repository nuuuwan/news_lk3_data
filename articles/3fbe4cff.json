    "Speaking at the United National Party's May Day rally near the Maligawatta Police Station in Colombo, Wickremesinghe extended an invitation to the rival Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), National People\u2019s Party (NPP) and others. He urged them to arrive at a consensus with the Government to secure the successful implementation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement, crucial for Sri Lanka's economic stability.",
    "The President urged them not to oppose the IMF program by resorting to traditional politics and emphasised the importance of not disrupting it. He stressed that the country must not regress to the situation it was in back in 2022.",
    "The UNP May Day rally, themed \u2018A proud nation, never to falter again, for all time\" saw the participation of UNP stalwarts such as Wajira Abeywardene, Ravi Karunanayake, and Palitha Range Bandara. Additionally, a turnout of party members from across the island, along with representatives from affiliated organisations, marked the event.",
    "Marking possible political crossovers in the near future, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Monaragala District MP Gayashan Nawanandana joined the rally in support of the UNP and President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "Addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickramasinghe emphasised that despite premature declarations of the United National Party's demise and attempts to write it off, the party ultimately had to lead Sri Lanka's revival.",
    "In a subtle jab at Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa, Wickremesinghe highlighted how the current positive situation in Sri Lanka created by him, permitted Premadasa, previously ousted from Galle Face by protesters, to organise his party\u2019s May Day rally on Chatham Street in Colombo.",

    "Premadasa also presented a promissory document, on the various relief a Government under his leadership will provide to the country\u2019s people.",
    "He pointed out that while some politicians assert their refusal to make commitments to the people, Premadasa countered by stating that only those who made promises but failed to deliver can afford to make such a statement.",
    "The SJB leader vowed to establish democracy, ensure governance that safeguards Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty and freedoms, establish a national commission for the protection of women and children, implement special programs for households led by women, initiate a national youth program, and establish new independent bodies, among many other pledges.",

    "Rajapaksa criticised SJB leader Sajith Premadasa and National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, alleging that they refused to lead the country when invited after the people\u2019s struggle, fearing their political futures.",
    "He recalled how both Premadasa and Dissanayake declined former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's invitation to take charge after he left office. Despite their current criticism of the SLPP, Rajapaksa commended President Ranil Wickremesinghe for stepping up to leadership with SLPP support during the crisis.",
    "Rajapaksa also emphasised the significance of the May Day rally for the SLPP, which has faced unwarranted attacks from political opponents. He warned against efforts by other parties to divide the SLPP's mandate and urged supporters to remain loyal. He urged disillusioned SLPP members to return to their villages and affirm their support for the party's candidate in the upcoming Presidential election. Rajapaksa also heavily criticised SLPP critics for lacking policies.",
    "The NPP organised three main May Day rallies, led by its leaders, held in Colombo, Matara, and Anuradhapura, seemingly to demonstrate its public support. An event was also held in Jaffna to mark the day. Attendance at all three rallies seemed to be significant.",
    "NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake chose to attend the rally held in Matara, flanked by NPP members Tilvin Silva, Samantha Vidyarathna, Nihal Galapatthi, Dr Harini Amarasuriya, Sunil Handunetti and others.",
    "Addressing party supporters, Dissanayake pledged the next May Day rally will be celebrated under a Government led by the NPP.",
    "The NPP leader stressed the importance of fostering a society governed by law and discipline as a core responsibility of the party.",
    "\"The National People's Power party is convening today for the last May Day rally under the rule of corruption, under the dominance of criminals who have plundered our nation, and under the leadership of rulers who have driven our country to the brink of dependency,\" he proclaimed.",
    "He emphasised the significant turnout of the public at NPP rallies and events across the four locations, noting that all attendees shared a singular goal to strive for the creation of a better society.",
    "The NPP leader criticised governments and parties lacking organisation and discipline, suggesting that such entities can only perpetuate destruction. He questioned whether Ranil Wickremesinghe could bring discipline to the country, asserting that he cannot.",
    "\u201cDiscipline is essential for nation-building. We require a society that respects the law. This responsibility is squarely on the shoulders of the National People's Force, and we are committed to fulfilling it,\u201d he said.",
    "The pro-Sirisena faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) also held a May Day rally in Gampaha. It was attended by SLFP stalwarts supporting former President Maithripala Sirisena. The key address was delivered by SLFP Presidential hopeful Minister of Justice Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe."
