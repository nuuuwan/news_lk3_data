    "US President Donald Trump said Monday (Aug 25) that he expects to visit China this year or shortly afterwards, noting that economic ties between the two countries have improved - even as he kept the door open to steeper tariffs.",
    "Speaking to reporters as he met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Washington, Trump pointed to recent talks with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping: \u201cAt some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we\u2019ll go to China.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great relationship with China,\u201d Trump vowed.",
    "The US leader added, \u201cThey have some cards. We have incredible cards, but I don\u2019t want to play those cards. If I played those cards, that would destroy China.\u201d",
    "Tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies have been simmering this year, but have significantly cooled since April, when both countries slapped escalating tariffs on each other\u2019s exports.",
    "At one point, the tit-for-tat duties reached triple digits on both sides, snarling supply chains as many importers halted shipments to try and wait for the governments to work things out.",
    "Since then, Washington and Beijing have reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions, temporarily lowering tariffs to 30 per cent on the United States\u2019 side and 10 per cent on China\u2019s part.",
    "But Trump on Monday kept the door open to hiking tariffs again if China did not hold up its end of the bargain.",
    "\u201cThey have to give us magnets,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give us magnets, then we have to charge them (a) 200 per cent tariff or something.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut we\u2019re not going to have a problem, I don\u2019t think, with that,\u201d he added.",
    "The US-China truce has been an uneasy one, with Washington previously accusing Beijing of violating their agreement and slow-walking export license approvals for rare earths.",
    "China is the world\u2019s leading producer of rare earths, used to make magnets essential to the automotive, electronics and defence industries.",
    "This month, they delayed the threatened reimposition of higher tariffs on each other\u2019s exports for another 90 days - meaning the pause on steeper duties will be in place until Nov 10."
