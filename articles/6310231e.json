    "Ranjan Lanka Private Limited, a trusted name in retail for over five decades, has stepped into the air conditioning (AC) market with the introduction of the Zero brand ACs. Imported from Zero Technologies in China, these ACs are designed to cater to small offices, houses, and apartments. The Zero brand ACs are available in two ranges: non-inverter units with capacities from 9,000 to 12,000 (British Thermal Units) BTU, and inverter units ranging from 12,000 to 18,000 BTU. These models are being introduced to the general market for the first time, with the initial launch held in Gampaha. The company plans to distribute the units island-wide from its warehouse in Gampaha and is also seeking dealers to expand their reach.",
    "Zero ACs are known for their superior durability and energy efficiency. The copper tubes used in these units are thicker than those of other brands, reducing the risk of corrosion and enhancing their lifespan. Additionally, the branded compressor operates on low wattage, ensuring lower electricity consumption for both inverter and non-inverter models. One-year warranty is offered for the entire machine and a five-year warranty for the compressor. The company also guarantees availability of spare parts, a common concern in the local market. To further enhance customer satisfaction, the company is offering three free services within the first year. Despite these features, the prices of Zero ACs are highly competitive compared to other brands, making them an affordable option without compromising on quality. Ranjan Lanka, known for its supermarket located at No. 04, Rest House Road, Gampaha, has been serving customers with groceries, stationery, garments, and electronics for 30 years. Its legacy dates back even further, to its beginnings in D.S. Senanayake Street, Ampara, nearly 50 years ago.",
