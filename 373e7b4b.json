    "The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) has announced that unregistered telecommunication devices equipped with a SIM card will be deactivated within the Cellular Mobile Telephone Operator\u2019s Network.",
    "The public is strongly advised to avail services exclusively from dealers who possess a vendor license issued by the TRCSL.",
    "In accordance with the directives of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), it is crucial for consumers to choose mobile phones that have received approval from the commission. TRCSL emphasises the necessity of verifying the IMEI number before making a purchase. This can be accomplished by sending a SMS to 1909 with the format \u201cIMEI (space) 15-digit number.\u201d An instant reply message will confirm the registration status of the mobile phone. In a non-approved TRCSL phone, the dealer who sells unauthorised devices becomes unauthorised importer who has not paid any tax and the customer of such devices is likely, to be held responsible for relevant government taxes in case of any issues.",
    "Failure to select a TRCSL-approved smartphone may result in various consequences for consumers. These include the inability to claim warranties from suppliers, difficulties in obtaining one-to-one replacements, a shortage of spare parts for specific phone models, and, most critically, network and connection issues from telecommunications companies. Such issues encompass frequency problems, bandwidth and coverage issues, as well as network connection losses.",
    "Abans is a TRCSL licenced vendor, serving as the Authorised National Distributor for Motorola and OPPO brands, in addition to being distributors for VIVO and Techno, as well as the authorised reseller for Apple iPhones in Sri Lanka, assures customers that all its smartphones are imported only after obtaining TRCSL certifications. The entire range of Apple, Motorola, and OPPO mobile phones imported by Abans undergoes rigorous testing by TRCSL to ensure network compatibility. Furthermore, these models come with comprehensive documentation, including GSM Certification, EU-Type Examination Certificate, SAR Certificate, Safety test report, EMC Test report, Radio Frequency test reports, and Battery test report.",
    "The authenticity of these certificates is verified by TRCSL in collaboration with the relevant governing bodies that issued them, affirming that Abans\u2019 mobile phones not only meet high-quality standards but also ensure the health and safety of its customers.",
    "Abans, with a reputable 17-year partnership with Apple as a value-added trusted partner, is the first to introduce Apple\u2019s latest innovations to the Sri Lankan market. As an Authorised Service Provider for Apple, Abans strictly warns users to buy only TRCSL approved products in order to get its international warranty claims in Sri Lanka.",
    "Motorola, dedicated to creating purposeful innovations that transform the way people connect with the world, is a brand that Abans has been bringing down from late 1990s. As the National Distributor, Abans has reintroduced the latest range of Motorola smartphones to the Sri Lankan market.",
    "OPPO, a leading manufacturer of smart devices with a focus on building a comprehensive smart device ecosystem, is another key brand distributed by Abans. With a presence in international markets and over 30,000 global patents, OPPO exemplifies innovative technology, and Abans proudly serves as the national distributor for OPPO smartphones in Sri Lanka."
