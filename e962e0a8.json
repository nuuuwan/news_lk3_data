    "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Indonesian rescuers and firefighters on Sunday searched for three people who were still missing under the rubble of charred houses and buildings, after a large fire spread from a fuel storage depot in the capital and killed at least 19 people.",
    "The Plumpang fuel storage station, operated by state-run oil and gas company Pertamina, is near a densely populated area in the Tanah Merah neighborhood in North Jakarta. It supplies 25% of Indonesia\u2019s fuel needs.",
    "At least 260 firefighters and 52 fire engines extinguished the blaze just before midnight on Friday after it tore through the neighborhood for more than two hours, fire officials said.",
    "Footage showed hundreds of people running in panic as thick plumes of black smoke and orange flames filled the sky.",
    "National police chief Gen. Listyo Sigit Prabowo said a preliminary investigation showed the fire was caused by a technical problem involving excess pressure as the depot received fuel from Pertamina\u2019s Balongan Refinery in West Java province.",
    "\u201cIt was found that a fire occurred during a filling of Pertamax fuel,\u201d Listyo told a news conference late Saturday, referring to a type of fuel oil produced by Pertamina.",
    "He didn\u2019t elaborate as investigators from Pertamina and the police were still working to establish the cause of the fire, including by questioning dozens of witnesses and examining video recordings from surveillance cameras.",
    "Residents living near the depot said they smelled a strong odor of gasoline, causing some people to vomit, after which thunder rumbled twice, followed by a huge explosion.",
    "Sri Haryati, a mother of three, said the fire began to spread about 20 minutes later, causing panic.",
    "\u201cI was crying and immediately grabbed our valuable documents and ran with my husband and children,\u201d Haryati said, adding that she heard smaller blasts that echoed across the neighborhood as orange flames jumped from the depot.",
    "Rescuers were still searching for three people who were reported missing. About 35 people were receiving treatment in five hospitals, some of them in critical condition.",
    "Listyo said more than 1,300 people were displaced and taking shelter in 10 government offices, a Red Cross command post and a sport stadium.",
    "Pertamina\u2019s head Nicke Widyawati apologized and said the company would provide help to the community and cooperate in the investigation.",
    "\u201cWe will carry out a thorough evaluation and reflection internally to prevent similar incidents from happening again,\u201d Widyawati said in a statement, adding that the company ensured the safe supply of fuel oil.",
    "On Saturday, grieving relatives gathered at a police hospital\u2019s morgue in eastern Jakarta to try to identify their loved ones. Officials said the victims were burned beyond recognition and could only be identified through DNA and dental records.",
    "In 2014, a fire at the same fuel depot engulfed at least 40 houses, but no casualties were reported.",
    "Indonesia\u2019s State Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir told reporters that the government will remap safe zones for residential areas away from vital objects.",
    "He said the incident showed the Plumpang area is not safe for the community, and the government is planning to move the fuel storage depot to Tanjung Priok port in northern Jakarta."
