These debentures, priced at Rs. 100 each, have maturity periods of five and seven years and include a non-viability conversion feature. In case of oversubscription, the Bank retained the option to issue an additional LKR 3 billion in debentures, with a further option to issue another LKR 2 billion under the same terms. The Debentures were rated BBB (lka) by Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited and are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.",

The strategic move aims to enhance the Bank\u2019s capital structure while supporting key economic sectors and improving overall financial stability.",
