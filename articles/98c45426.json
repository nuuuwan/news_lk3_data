    "In 1974, I wandered in the Veyangoda area with Georg (adviser) and Piyasiri (research assistant) to find a suitable village to study what socioeconomic and political factors influenced people to get together for public benefit. On the third day, at a tea kiosk, we met Guneratne (Gune), a farmer, who invited us to his house at Naiwela.",
    "Gune lived in an old house with a tiled roof and a cemented floor. I told him we were looking for a village to study the cooperative behaviour of people and a place to stay for a few months. He proposed we study Naiwela and stay at his house. He worried about Georg, saying, \u201cSuddas (white people) can\u2019t live in a village because they need creature comforts.\u201d",
    "Gune invited his wife to join us. She brought a plate of thala guli (sesame seed sweet) and three cups of tea. Gune offered us the front room of his house free of charge. His wife confessed that the house did not have a sealed toilet. We should walk 200 yards to a shared well to wash clothes and bathe. She did not cook any type of meat at home. We promised to return in a fortnight with bedding and other necessities to stay for a few months.",
    "An ARTI jeep dropped the team at Gune\u2019s house. He was happy and waiting for us. His wife served us fresh coconut water and a delicious vegetarian lunch. In our absence, he had cleaned the front room and whitewashed its inner walls. The paint smell was unbearable. The room was large enough to spread three narrow mattresses on the floor. It was the rainy season, the floor was damp, and various insects crawled around the mattresses.",
    "On our second day at Naiwela, we started our fieldwork after a good breakfast comprising kiribath and a lentil curry. Gune volunteered to introduce us to villagers. First, he took us to Ariya, his younger brother, who lived across the road. Ariya was a retired government servant. His left arm was shorter than his right arm. He was in a dirty sarong and had a small towel over his left shoulder. He apologised for his clothes, saying he was planting a jackfruit sapling in the garden.",
    "Several planters\u2019 chairs were in a circle, with a multi-coloured teapoy (round, short table) in the middle of the large verandah. The front door was wide and blocked by a heavy curtain with large floral designs. In the undulating garden, I recognised mango, guava, mangosteen, banana, and Jambu trees. There was a pineapple patch at its lower boundary.",
    "Ariya was happy to meet us. He told us we should join him to celebrate his daughter\u2019s forthcoming wedding. The daughter served us tea; a large, imported biscuit tin and a comb of bananas were on the tray. She was a thin and tall young girl in a skirt and blouse. She smiled and asked us why we were living in the village. She spoke a few English words with Georg. Ariya and Gune said they would celebrate her wedding over seven consecutive days. They wanted to make the wedding the most memorable one in the village. The daughter laughed and said it was a bad idea, as it would cost a lot of money.",
    "Gune showed us a house just opposite his house. It was modern, built in a coconut estate with electricity and an overhead water tank. He told us never to visit the house as the woman there had a bad reputation. She was a divorcee and lived with several servants. Gune disapproved of such a living arrangement. I asked him what she could do other than to live in her house with servants. Gune was taken aback by my question. He said that she should not have divorced her husband. Moreover, a young woman should not live with servants, especially with male servants, in a lonely house.",
    "As we walked, he introduced us to villagers. One narrow lane took us to an open public well. Two young women approached it while we admired the blue water in the well. They smiled and drew water to wash their clothes. Both were in their diyareddas (lungi tied above breasts). Gune was unhappy and took us quickly away from the well.",
    "He walked silently for a minute ahead of us, and at a junction where our path crossed a wide track, he said that we must avoid those two girls like vasa (poison). Both had a bad reputation, and he suspected they ran a brothel with two women. We named them X and Y because we would never be able to know them because of Gune\u2019s vigilant eyes.",
    "Gune wanted to walk with us wherever we went. He felt happy and proud to be with us, especially with a white man. People from other villages came in the evening to meet us. One wanted to send us four booru enndan (foldable beds) to sleep on. Another inquired about the white man\u2019s well-being, especially whether he could eat spicy food. Gune\u2019s wife told them he ate more than the other two, enjoying green chillies with white rice. One or two visitors talked to Georg in English.",
    "Gradually, evenings became an informal gathering time at Gune\u2019s house. The Petromax lamp and chairs arranged around it gave us an ideal atmosphere to discuss politics, village gossip, and news. Gune\u2019s wife served tea to visitors. Georg had brought biscuits, tea leaves, and sugar from Colombo to serve visitors. The fascinating topic we discussed during such gatherings was local politics intertwined with caste issues, particularly the influence of caste on social interactions and the challenges faced by low-caste families in the village.",
    "One evening, a peon at the Government Printer\u2019s Department, known for his talkative and demanding nature, visited us. He smoked a cigar, and his breath suggested he had consumed arrack. On that day, Georg was in Colombo. The peon, who often liked to assert his authority, started the conversation with us.",
    "I said, \u201cWe are studying village groups and how they help each other.\u201d",
    "Peon: \u201cWe know all village groups and how they interact. What is there to search for?\u201d",
    "Peon (addressed the audience): \u201cYou know, spies come to rural areas to collect information to send to foreign agencies. I am worried to see a white man with three Colombo boys among us.\u201d",
    "Peon(turned to me and asked): \u201cAre you a member of the CIA?\u201d",
    "I: \u201cNo, I am a government servant who is doing research for the government.\u201d",
    "Peon turned again to his audience and triumphantly declared: There you are! I expected these answers. A spy does not tell the truth and reveal his true identity!\u201d",
    "By this time, Gune was furious and told the peon to behave appropriately or leave. The peon got angry and left, saying he would find out the truth about us and inform the MP of the electorate. The young people in the front yard whistled when he walked out. He hurled a few vulgar and lewd statements at them, and all laughed. Gune explained the peon\u2019s anger \u2014 he was angry because we did not visit him.",
    "Our stay in the village and evening meetings gave Gune and his wife a new status. People started calling Gune\u2019s house sudu mahattaya inna gedera (the house where the white gentleman stays). He participated in our interviews and often answered our questions before respondents spoke. While we were walking home after an interview, Gune summarised the interview with a statement about the interviewee\u2019s family and caste status. If we visited a cross-caste couple, he highlighted it with some caustic remark, especially if the respondent or spouse was of a low caste. For him, goigama (farmer caste) is the highest in the status hierarchy. The lowest was the padu. Nawandanna (goldsmiths) and kumbal (potters) castes were in the middle. Hinna (washermen) were below them but above padu people.",
    "Gune and wife were worried about having four young bachelors at home and felt responsible for their well-being. They wanted to ensure we did not fall in love with village women, particularly low-caste women. Caste purity and innocence were always in our discussions. Gune once said that he wanted to protect us from evil women who knew how to charm innocent boys into marrying them.",
    "Gune wanted us to engage in his niece\u2019s wedding. We took the responsibility to distribute wedding invitation cards. Ariya was happy we engaged in the wedding, and soon, we became frequent visitors to his house. We listened to the discussions on wedding arrangements, the guest lists, and the types of gifts they expected from invitees. Ariya did not discuss expenses, but when no one was around, he told me how much he had already spent on the wedding. Discussions in the evenings at Arya\u2019s invariably ended with dinner there. We were invited to the inner house to sit with them at the dining table. Gune was initially unhappy that we stayed with Ariya for dinner. But gradually, he, too, joined us in discussions and dinner.",
    "After arguments and counterarguments, Ariya and his wife identified guests for each wedding day. His wife\u2019s word was final, and all agreed once she revealed her thoughts. Ariya once lost his temper and walked out, saying that he would not attend the wedding. Within minutes, he returned and kept quiet.",
    "Ariya\u2019s wife had informed Redi Naenda (washerwoman) about her duties. Redi Naenda\u2018s role was crucial to the wedding. She would collect the bedsheets from the nuptial bed, check blood stains, if any, and declare whether the bride was a virgin or not in public. In addition to this crucial declaration, she had to protect the bride from evil spirits. Before homecoming, she had to clean the bride from kili (impurities). She must refrain from spreading gossip in the village about the bride\u2019s virginity.",
    "A young man whom we interviewed told us that if the bride was not a virgin, Redi Naenda might accept a handsome bribe to declare that the bride was one. In any case, she could not stop what villagers would say, and the rumour-mongering machine would start before the wedding day.",
    "Ariya sent his younger brother to Kuliyapitiya, where the bridegroom lived, to check his physical and sexual fitness. The emissary went discreetly to the bridegroom\u2019s house by appointment to check his genitals. The emissary could touch any part of the bridegroom\u2019s body in a room with respect and permission. He would tell the bridegroom his opinion. If positive, there would be an informal tea party at the bridegroom\u2019s house. When the emissary returned, Ariya was impatient and ill-tempered. He took the emissary to the front room of the house and re-emerged with a smile.",
    "The bridegroom was a graduate of Colombo University and an assistant manager of a Peoples Bank Branch. He was a goigama man, and his parents were schoolteachers. The village chief priest had recommended the boy as decent, honest, obedient, and someone who would look after his parents and siblings.",
    "The bridegroom arrived at Ariya\u2019s with two friends on the wedding eve. The visit confirmed that he would marry the bride the following day. The bride was kept out of sight while the bridegroom was with Ariya and his wife. He handed over a small parcel to Ariya\u2019s wife. After the bridegroom left, Ariya showed me the gift \u2013 a gold chain for the bride to reaffirm his love for his future wife and his commitment to marry her.",
    "The first day of the wedding was a grand, formal affair. Only close relatives of both sides and a few village residents, such as the school principal and his family and business colleagues of Ariya, attended the wedding. The couple stood on the poruwa (decorated platform). The Birth, Marriage, and Death Registrar officiated at the ceremony by reciting a few Sanskrit  slokas (prayers). The most heartbreaking part of the occasion was when the bride gave her mother Sela (a piece of silk cloth) to thank her for turning blood into breastmilk when she was an infant. Mother and bride cried, hugging each other, and other women joined them.",
    "Guests took their seats for lunch only after Ariya and his wife had invited each of them with a full glass of water to a particular table. The newlyweds talked to each guest and left home on their honeymoon at four in the afternoon amongst firecrackers and raban (drum) playing. Ariya\u2019s wife fainted when she saw her only daughter leaving her sadahatama (forever) and becoming a stranger\u2019s wife. She recovered and attended to Ariya, who sobbed in the front room.",
    "The couple returned the following day at 12.30 pm from their honeymoon amidst beating drums and firecrackers. Everybody was happy. Redi naenda had sent a confidential report to the bride\u2019s mother to say that her daughter was a virgin. The bride looked glamorous with heavy gold jewellery and beamed with a lovely smile.",
    "Ariya wanted to say a few words. He held a gold coin and tossed it several times so others could see. He gave the sovereign to his daughter and said, \u201cYou have protected your dignity and our dignity being a virgin. Today, your mother and I are the happiest people on earth. We hope to see many of your children playing in this large garden, which will belong to them.\u201d",
    "Ariya started crying, saying that he was despondent as his only daughter had left him. He thanked the bridegroom for marrying his darling daughter and sternly warned him not to ill-treat her. Ariya could not control his sorrow, so he retired to the front room and stayed there. A little later, Ariya bolted out of the room into the verandah with tears in his eyes and started talking to Georg, expecting me to translate.",
    "Ariya: \u201cSudu Mahaththayo\u2019 (white sir) [pause] \u2018kanya bhawaya\u2019 (virginity) of my daughter [pause].\u201d",
    "Ariya: \u201cBlood, sir. Blood. Virginity, Blood. White sir, do you know our rituals about weddings?\u201d",
    "Georg: \u201cI do not know much about wedding rituals in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Ariya: \u201cI will tell you. My daughter is a virgin. Now we all can celebrate her purity in public.\u201d",
    "I hesitated to translate what Ariya had just said. Ariya beckoned me to his side and asked me to translate what he had just said into English. Fortunately, the bride overheard her father shouting about her virginity and purity and came running to tell him to stop. He started crying and said to me, \u201cLook, she has already started to ill-treat me. I wonder whether she might join her in-laws and ridicule me.\u201d Showing his left arm, he said, \u201cI am not a powerful man. I would soon be an orphan at home, as my wife would control me more.\u201d He started crying, and nobody paid attention.",
    "Ariya and his wife hosted relatives from faraway places on the third day of the wedding. The fourth day was for ordinary Naiwela villagers. The fifth day was for Ariya\u2019s old friends, especially those who worked with him at government offices. The sixth day was for the bride\u2019s office friends, and the seventh was for the immediate family and well-wishers. The new couple wore wedding clothes daily and spent time with the visitors. On the seventh day, after lunch, the couple left for the bridegroom\u2019s parents to spend a week with them.",
    "Two days later, Georg and I visited Ariya and his wife. Ariya told me they could not bear their loneliness and live without their daughter at home. After evening tea, Ariya\u2019s wife told me, in her usual low voice and while trying to dry her tears, that I had a marriage proposal from a decent family. The girl was the only child and 21 years old. She studied at a leading girls\u2019 school in Colombo and was fluent in English. It might be the girl I once saw at the Buddhist temple with her parents. She was a tall, pretty woman in a white  lama sari (half saree). Ariya said their house and the large garden were worth over a million rupees. In addition, one hundred thousand rupees would be the cash dowry.",
    "I was perplexed. It was my first marriage proposal, and I was not used to such large sums of money. The housing loan I was paying in instalments after my father\u2019s untimely death flashed into my mind. Suddenly, I had a solution to my financial difficulties and an avenue to secure my future. Georg understood my predicament and smiled. He said, \u201cJayantha, you have indeed gone native!\u201d",
