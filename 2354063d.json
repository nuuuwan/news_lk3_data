  "original_body_lines": [
    "The solar panel installation atop the Hayleys Fabric plant in Horana",
    "UNIDO conducts regular training for Energy Savers across various industries",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Energy Savers are industry leaders and energy practitioners who are determined to help the country slash energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions. They explain what they are doing to decarbonise Sri Lankan industries and why the time to act is now.",
    "One of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest fabric manufacturers, Teejay Lanka Engineering Manager Mendaka Hettithanthri says the changing climate is a sure sign that industry must do more to lower its carbon emissions.",
    "\u201cYou can already see how global warming is affecting Sri Lankans. We are an agricultural country \u2026 and the farmers used to know exactly when to harvest the crops and when to replant. Now the weather patterns are completely messed up.\u201d",
    "Leading Sri Lankan engineering company Hayleys Fentons Group, Manager of Group Compliance Nisal Liyanage says there are also many business benefits to decarbonisation, such as production cost savings: \u201cWe would see reduced greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for greater energy independence for us as a country.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are further incentivised by our foreign customers,\u201d adds fabric manufacturer Hayleys Fabric Environment, Health and Safety Manager Mohomad Arshad. \u201cCompliance with international controls and requirements related to green practices are essential for remaining competitive in the global market.\u201d",
    "More knowledge is needed to help companies fully realise the potential of energy efficiency, says Industrial Development Board of Ceylon Assistant Director of Planning Nadeera Ramanayake.",
    "She welcomes a new 12-month initiative spearheaded by United Nations Industrial Development Organisation and the National Cleaner Production Centre Sri Lanka with support from the European Union. They are guiding a first group of 70 Energy Savers through an internationally recognised course on Energy Management Systems.",
    "\u201cAmidst the current energy crisis in the country, I thought that joining a project like this and getting knowledge is vital,\u201d says Nadeera.",
    "Colombo Dockyard Energy Management Officer Damitha Sandanayaka says cutting energy waste requires new ways of acting at all levels of a business.",
    "\u201cI strongly believe that changing human behaviour is the key to improving energy efficiency, which is why training and awareness have become fundamental to our organisation. We conduct regular training \u2026 [and] we also initiated Energy Management Week... This promotes awareness on the importance of energy management and encourages teams to work together to achieve energy efficiency goals.\u201d",
    "Cutting energy waste often helps manufacturing companies better understand their energy use, creating a solid foundation upon which to build effective renewable energy solutions.",
    "Flintec Transducers Senior Manager of Production and Facility Maintenance Asanka Manoj describes how installing rooftop solar panels on the company\u2019s plants cut daytime energy use by 65 to 70%. This, coupled with energy efficiency measures, has helped Flintec significantly reduce energy costs and emissions.",
    "But a number of Energy Savers caution against looking for a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d to decarbonisation. Rather, multiple solutions that use a variety of energy optimisation and clean energy technologies are needed.",
    "\u201c[We need to take] a holistic approach,\u201d says K.H. Thanushka at Watawala Plantations. \u201c[That\u2019s how] to unlock this potential and create a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.\u201d",
