### US gives Israel 30 days to boost Gaza aid or risk cut to military support

*2024-10-16 11:03:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102728/us-gives-israel-30-days-to-boost-gaza-aid-or-risk-cut-to-military-support) ┬╖ `en`

The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off.

The letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties.

It says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month.

Israel is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country тАЬtakes this matter seriouslyтАЭ and intends to тАЬaddress the concerns raisedтАЭ with US counterparts.

Israel has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is under fire after buying a multi-million-dollar cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis.

Albanese made the purchase months out from an election in which the cost of living and housing are key issues.

The move has sparked backlash from across the political divide - with his opponents calling it тАЬtone deafтАЭ and some within his own party anonymously telling local media it left them тАЬgobsmackedтАЭ.

Albanese defended his decision, saying he тАЬknows what it is like to struggleтАЭ but bought the luxury property to be close to his fiancee Jodie HaydonтАЩs family on the New South Wales Central Coast.

Property records show the four-bedroom, three-bathroom, and three-carport property in Copacabana - which has panoramic views - was sold for A$4.3m ($2.9m, ┬г2.2m) last month, but the purchase is yet to settle.

This election is therefore about having a politically serious and a critically sharp, effectively тАЬnationalтАЭ peopleтАЩs Opposition тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Nominations for the 2024 November 14 parliamentary elections were closed island wide, on 11 October. Altogether, around 690 nomination papers have been accepted for the 52 electoral districts. Phenomenal rise to power of the JVP/NPP at the September Presidential elections has sealed the fate of over two dozen politicians, some of whom would not have wanted to leave politics yet. Not very surprisingly, since the 1936 State Council elections when D.M won the Hambantota seat, Rajapaksas are wholly absent in Hambantota for the first time, this election. On the wild side of it, there are numerous amoebic groups that have come out as тАЬnewтАЭ political parties and independent groups contesting most districts.

What many who run for office forget is that they are seeking to become members of a legislature

In Sri Lanka, the meaning of constituency service has been distorted over time to include matters such as springing people from remand and providing assistance in cash or kind for various ceremonies and events organised by constituents. The former should be illegal. The latter makes heavy demands on the finances of the MP and may be a causal factor fostering corruption in various forms. There will be no system change until voters cease to select their representative on how they helped get individuals out of remand or on the quality of the bus that was provided for a pilgrimage

### Forward plans to transform Sri Lanka into a global aviation and logistics hub

*2024-10-15 22:35:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/forward-plans-to-transform-sri-lanka-into-a-global-aviation-and-logistics-hub/) ┬╖ `en`

Harischandra Gunaratna of The Island Financial Review speaks to Andre Fernando, Managing Director of MAC Holdings (PRIVATE) LTD

Sri LankaтАЩs strategic location in the Indian Ocean among major air routes connecting Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, offers a unique opportunity to transform the island into a thriving aviation hub. With the right investments and policy changes, Sri Lanka can leverage its geographical advantage to bolster tourism, facilitate international cargo & passenger transportation, and serve as a key transit point for passengers and goods. This vision not only promises to boost the nationтАЩs economy but also has the potential to redefine its position on the global aviation map. Perfect example is the growth of 4 prominent airlines; Emirates, Fly Dubai, Air Arabia and Etihad and their importance to the economy of UAE, which was a desert in the mid-1990s.
