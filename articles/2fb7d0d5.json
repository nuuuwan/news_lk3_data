    "Colombo, Jan 22 (Daily Mirror) - The Inter Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today requested the government and the police to create smart roads before creating smart drivers.",
    "Addressing the media association's secretary, Anjana Priyanjith said the government and the police must keep in mind that they are unable to create smart drivers without having smart roads.",
    "\"We questioned the Police Department to find out and tell them whether a higher number of fatal accidents occur in Colombo town or out of Colombo. We know the cause of the fatal accidents in Colombo town. We saw the sons of VIP officials, police officers and other higher-ranking officials who used to meet with fatal accidents during the night under the influence of alcohol. We do not know whether proper legal action was taken against them,\" he said.",
    "\"As private bus operators, we can firmly say that our bus drivers and conductors were involved in minor fatal accidents in Colombo city. As a responsible bus association, we can clearly say that this government is running on taxes and fines. That is the way the government is trying to implement these types of concepts.",
    "\"The bus priority lane was implemented two years ago, and it was discontinued in a very short time. Therefore, before creating smart drivers, it is better to bring back the bus priority lane again. If we have that again, we are ready to continue with our passenger transport service without making any mistakes.",
    "\"Police should take action to remove vehicle parks on both sides of main roads in Colombo to minimize the huge traffic. If the police are able to do so, we can drive our buses exactly according to the road rules and regulations.",
    "\"Our target is to provide transport facilities for people to go for their duties and return to their homes safely.",
    "\"If the police launch their special programme to send fine sheets to bus owners for violating traffic rules, there will be no buses for people to report for their duties on time, starting tomorrow morning,\" he added."
