    "The Global Dialogue Forum (GDF), in partnership with the Club of Rome \u2013 India, successfully hosted its international conclave on AI in powering green energy, food security and cybersecurity at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo, on 20 September. The full-day event convened global policymakers, academics, industry leaders, and innovators to examine how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be practically deployed to address the most pressing challenges facing societies.",
    "The conference was graced by Deputy Minister of Digital Economy Eranga Weeraratne, who outlined his vision for a resilient and green digital future powered by AI. He highlighted the importance of bridging the global AI divide and strengthening cybersecurity as the foundation of a secure digital nation. The strategic overview was delivered by Club of Rome \u2013 India Secretary General Lt. General Arun Sahni (Retd), while the inaugural address was presented by Special Staff to the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Air Force and Indonesia\u2019s Cognitive AI Research Group Head Air First Marshal Dr. Ir. Arwin Sumari.",
    "\u201cThe question before us is how humanity can use Artificial Intelligence to meet its most urgent needs\u2014securing energy, food, and digital systems,\u201d said Global Dialogue Forum Chairman Moses Manoharan. \u201cThis conclave in Colombo was designed to bring together diverse perspectives, and by opening the discussions to a global audience, we aimed to make the exchange of ideas part of a wider movement for sustainable solutions.\u201d",
    "The conclave featured four thematic sessions that explored AI in transitioning from fossil fuels to green energy, AI-enhanced agricultural productivity and water security, AI-driven investment models in green finance, and a panel dialogue on North-South collaboration and governance. Delegates and speakers from India, Indonesia and others from ASEAN, joined local experts, underlining Colombo\u2019s role as a convening ground for regional and global policy dialogue",
    "The conclave also spotlighted Sri Lankan perspectives. Cybersecurity and AI policy leader Asela Waidyalankara warned that \u201csustainability without security is merely an illusion,\u201d stressing the urgency of regulation, ethics, and governance as societies increasingly rely on AI. He urged participants to consider how the technology can be used with care to safeguard systems and reduce risk.",
    "Building on this, Deloitte Sri Lanka Human Capital Consulting, Engineering AI and Data, and Growth Office Leader Mayura Malagala noted that AI is shaped by the quality of human-created data and must be monitored for bias and flawed outcomes. He emphasised transparency, accountability, and data sovereignty, urging organisations to treat AI \u201cas a very smart intern who must be guided responsibly\u201d to ensure its growth supports society\u2019s goals.",
    "With participation from regional and global stakeholders, the Global Dialogue Forum reaffirmed Colombo\u2019s positioning as a hub for international policy discourse. The conclave provided a platform to exchange ideas, build understanding, and explore AI-driven pathways toward sustainable, resilient, and inclusive societies."
