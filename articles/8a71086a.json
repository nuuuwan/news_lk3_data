    "The Sri Lanka-China Business Council (SLCHBC) of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held its 24th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 3 July, at the Port City Sales Gallery, Colombo Port City, reaffirming its commitment to strengthening bilateral economic cooperation with China.",
    "Officials from the Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China graced the occasion, with Second Secretary Geng Zichao, delivering an address on behalf of the Chinese Embassy. He highlighted China\u2019s robust economic performance in 2024, including a GDP of $ 18.94 trillion and 5.4% growth in Q1 2025. Bilateral trade with Sri Lanka reached $ 5.365 billion, marking a 30.4% year-on-year increase \u2013 the fastest growth in South Asia.",
    "Geng emphasised China\u2019s continued role as Sri Lanka\u2019s largest source of foreign direct investment, supporting strategic projects such as the Colombo Port City and Southern Expressway. He also noted President Anura Kumara Disanayake\u2019s visit to China in January 2025, during which 15 cooperation agreements were signed, focused on infrastructure, green energy, and tourism.",
    "Sinwa Holdings Ltd., Group Director and SLCHBC President Haroun Cader, reflected on the renewed momentum since the 23rd AGM. He also highlighted the success of the Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Forum held on 30 May, which enabled constructive dialogue on expanding trade opportunities.",
    "Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s exports to China totalling approximately $ 250 million against imports exceeding $ 3 billion, Cader acknowledged the need to address this trade imbalance. He outlined plans to promote local exports and enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s presence at platforms such as the upcoming Canton Fair to drive new business partnerships.",
    "The SLCHBC continues to play a critical role in fostering trade, investment, innovation, and sustainable partnerships between Sri Lanka and China."
