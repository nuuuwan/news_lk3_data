Coconut shortage causes: high temperatures reduce seedling growth & pollination. Sri Lanka consumes 114 coconuts/year. Experts suggest increasing plantations to address scarcity.

🟩

Senior Professor of Professor Aruna Kumara says that the main cause of coconut shortage in the country is the hot-hot weather in the first few months of the Ruhuna.

He also said that the number of coconut seedlings in the country has reduced the number of coconut seedlings from about 70 lakhs.

"It has to be considered that the coconut is instantly increased to be scarce within a short period of time. Clear is not a quick increase. But for some time the population of these animals is increasing. High increase in temperature from March to June and the decrease in temperature and coconut availability. The best temperature for a coconut tree is a temperature like a Centigrade 27,28. But when it goes up to the centigrade, the pollination of the collise is reduced and the fruit decreases. "

In response to Ada Derana, Prof. Aruna Kumara said that Sri Lanka is the largest number of coconut consumption in the world and a person consumes 114 coconuts per year.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has recommended to the government to go ahead with a tender for a floating liquefied natural gas terminal that will allow power generation costs to be slashed, Chairman Tilak Siyambalapitiya said.

The tender for a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) to be built offshore of Kerawalapitiya was called in 2021.

The tender involved an FSRU on a built operate own basis and a compatible mooring system on a built operate own and transfer (BOOT) basis.

The competitive tender was apparently suspended in controversial circumstances amid attempts to bring in a rival unsolicited proposal by New Fortress Energy, a US-based company.

Sri Lanka could lose billions through unsolicited New Fortress Energy deal: CEBEU

Later stop gap solutions were proposed instead of completing the tender.

“Our preference is to go ahead with the bidding round that was concluded,” Siyambalapitiya told reporters.

Main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has finalised its nominations for the remaining four National List MP seats in Parliament. The nominees are Mano Ganesan, Nizam Kariapper, Sujeewa Senasinghe, and Mohamed Ismail.

This announcement follows weeks of deliberation after the SJB secured five National List MP seats as bonus seats in the General Election held on 14 November. One of these seats was filled on 19 November by SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara. However, the nomination process has been overshadowed by a legal dispute. The Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order earlier yesterday, preventing the SJB from submitting its National List nominees to the Election Commission without including the name of Nizam Kariapper, Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).

### Who guards the guards?

*2024-12-13 02:58:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/who-guards-the-guards-2/) · `en`

The Opposition continues to crank up pressure on Speaker Asoka Ranwala to resign over what it calls his false claim to have a doctorate. The JVP-led NPP government may have expected its opponents’ campaign against the Speaker to fizzle out with the passage of time. In this country, controversies crop up at such a rate that one finds it well-nigh impossible to keep track of them, and that may be the reason why the government has chosen to remain silent on the issue of the Speaker’s educational qualifications. But the Opposition remains maniacally focused on the Speaker’s claim in question, and SJB MP Ajith Perera has gone on record as saying that unless Ranwala resigns forthwith, the Opposition will be compelled to move a motion of no confidence against him. The government has sought to make light of the situation, but in vain.

### Effective Communication Is Vital For Sri Lanka’s New NPP Government

Effective communication plays a vital role in governance. If communication is clear and effective, it contributes to promoting transparency and building trust between those holding power and the people who are being served. It helps citizens to better understand the policies and decisions of governments, thus fostering a sense of accountability. For any government to function smoothly and efficiently and make decisions so that everyone benefits, the trust of its citizens is essential. In that sense, effective communication is not simply a good idea but an essential building block for efficacious good governance.

Bad winds blowing around the opportunity cost of green energy

Mannar was a crucial trading post on the Maritime Silk Road, but more recently it was a place hardly on anyone’s radar. Except for birders, that is. Mannar island, to the east, just 30 kilometers in length, less so. But it is now in the crosshairs of major economic forces, with gigantic wind turbines planted in an area where its inhabitants’ lifestyle is being disrupted as they cultivate and go to church, and their children attend school. With this, the greenwashing brigade arrived, talking about ‘climate change mitigation’ and energy security. Converting wind into energy was a noble idea–with a large asterisk.

### Sri Lankan  opposition parties have strengthened the hand of the JVP/NPP government to proceed with its assault on the living conditions of workers and the poor.

*2024-12-13 00:45:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=85199) · `en`

After two days of debate on December 3–4, the Sri Lankan parliament, without taking a vote, unanimously endorsed the policy statement of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna/National People’s Power (JVP/NPP) government, presented by the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on November 21.

The unanimity of the ruling and opposition MPs on the policy statement, which pledged to implement the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in full, demonstrates the fundamental agreement of the entire political establishment with the savage austerity agenda.

The opposition parties have thus strengthened the hand of the JVP/NPP government to proceed with its assault on the living conditions of workers and the poor. Their support followed the government’s signing of an IMF staff level agreement on November 23, promising to bring next year’s budget into line with its demands.

### MMDA reform is not repeal:  New Govt. must counter fearmongering and resistance to justice

Justice in the context of MMDA reforms will entail treating women and children with dignity, providing equal protection of Sri Lanka law to women and children, ensuring that the MMDA is a Shari’ah compliant Islamic law that strives for righteous living in the interest and wellbeing of Muslims, and realising constitutional guarantees for all Muslims of the country. Reform of the MMDA will represent all these progressive aspects: Islamic legal jurisprudence, constitutional protections, universal human rights and basic human compassion and fairness. Indeed the call for reform is one to strengthen and preserve the MMDA rather than repeal it

The new Government must recognise the current fearmongering campaign for what it is, and confidently advance MMDA reforms

### Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children

The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.

The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to “community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders” and will act as a deterrent.

But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.

The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.

The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the “rights of victims” ahead of “the rights of criminals”.
