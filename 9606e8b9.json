    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe plans to invite the Tamil diaspora to participate in proposed development plans for the northern province and for the country\u2019s economy overall, the president said.",
    "Speaking at a district committee meeting for the formerly war-torn Jaffna and Kilonochchi districts on Thursday January 04, Wickremesinghe discussed resettlement, education, health, land, fisheries, agriculture and forest conservation, according to a statement from the president\u2019s office.",
    "Wickremesinghe also invited all members of parliament representing the Northern Province to actively participate in his government\u2019s development agenda. Highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts, the president called for a \u201cconcerted plan to expedite the Northern Province\u2019s development and urged everyone to accelerate the collective programme for building the country\u2019s economy\u201d.",
    "Following the establishment of the new economic commission, Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying, individuals will have the opportunity to come to Sri Lanka and present proposals.",
    "\u201cHe expressed the intention to extend invitations to the diaspora abroad to participate in these opportunities,\u201d the statement noted.",
    "\u201cAfter years, we have restarted development activities. The economy will recover this year. We have to carry out development activities within those constraints",
    "\u201cLast year, the government was able to finish paying of all outstanding bills. Our economy has strengthened a little. We have to create a 2 or 3 percent economic growth this year, upon which our economy strengthens, as does the rupee. Next year, we plan to achieve 5 percent growth,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe people are living in great difficulty. We have to stabilise the economy to move forward. Going forward, we can\u2019t come and check if projects are properly underway. We\u2019re doing things differently. I thought I would start that in the northern province,\u201d he said speaking to local officials.",
    "\u201cEveryone here is struggling. Government workers may get some relief, possibly after Thai Pongal,\u201d he added.",
    "Wickremesinghe said the government\u2019s new welfare programme Asweauma can be fast-tracked in the north.",
    "\u201cAswesuma is not like Samurdhi. It grants three times as much. We are able to add 2.4 million to Aswesuma. But we have only 1.4 million. Because our officials have been unable to work at the grassroots level. If you can get them all to fill the forms up, we can give to more people in Jaffna and the north. I don\u2019t think the ground-level issues in the south exist in the north. Can the district secretaries take this up and resolve it quickly?",
    "\u201cThe relief will be provided to the people of this area. Not anyone else. If you all can get together, we\u2019ll finish the northern province one easily,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jan05/2023)"
