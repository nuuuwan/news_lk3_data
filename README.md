### Compounding of capital market offences: Call for balanced regulation

*2024-12-05 00:46:17* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Compounding-of-capital-market-offences-Call-for-balanced-regulation/4-770113) ¬∑ `en`

Consider reforms aimed at expediting judicial processes in financial crime cases, such as the establishment of specialised courts or streamlined procedures

The legal landscape surrounding capital market offences in Sri Lanka has tightened significantly due to recent amendments to the Securities and Exchange Commission Act (SEC Act). These amendments introduce stringent penalties, including mandatory imprisonment for major offences, and eliminate the option to compound five major offences. While this reflects a serious stance against capital market offences, the removal of compounding raises important concerns regarding the practical enforcement of these laws and the potential benefits of reintroducing compounding under controlled circumstances.

To settle (a matter) by a money payment, in lieu of other liability;

### Road much travelled: Identical paths towards fiscal distress in Sri Lanka and the Maldives

*2024-12-05 00:44:17* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Road-much-travelled-Identical-paths-towards-fiscal-distress-in-Sri-Lanka-and-the-Maldives/4-770112) ¬∑ `en`

Though our economy be bruised, the external economic context and our innate geographic blessings, when bound with sound fiscal policies, shall certainly prevent a repeat of the ills that visited the Lankan economy in 2022

This article attempts an analysis of the eerily similar roads travelled in both Sri Lanka and the Maldives towards a fiscal cliff. Even though, we here in the Maldives, have not slipped off the precipice, the landscape is familiar and the dangers real and tangible.

However, it is important to stress at the outset, that while the terrain is familiar, it is not inevitable that we here in the Maldives too, tumble down the fiscal cliff into ‚Äòwhite waters‚Äô of internal turmoil, collapse of the political system and of an economic meltdown.

AKD with Senior Economic Advisor and Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

‚ÄúFor sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.‚Äù

Act I: Ranil Wickremesinghe (and his CBSL chief) turn the debt problem into a ticking debt-bomb with the ISB surge at tail-end of Prime Ministerial tenure (2015-2019). (https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/the-real-cause-of-sri-lankas-debt-trap/)

Act II: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ignores the ‚ÄòChina card‚Äô of ongoing discussions for debt-rollover, inducts new technocrats and pivots to the IMF option. Ranil Wickremesinghe, nominated not elected to Parliament, is appointed by besieged Gotabaya as PM and selected by the SLPP-dominated parliament as President, defeating the competing candidate-- their dissenting colleague and Mahinda‚Äôs ideologue in 2005 and 2010, Dullas Alahapperuma. (Insiders say RW was Basil and Gota‚Äôs choice; Mahinda tells media he voted for Dullas.)

### Why Dual Stability of Terrorism Act in the North

Dual treatment of terrorism: Sivajilingam in North vs social activists in South. Attorney General consulted during arrests. National People's Power promises reduced fuel/electricity costs but fails to deliver. Government vows to combat racism and corruption.

üü©

Sivajilingam in the north. Social activists are arrested under the Terrorism Act in the South. Why this dual stand. Consult the Attorney General during these arrests.

He was speaking at a debate on the President's Policy Declaration held in Parliament on Wednesday (04).

I congratulate the government headed by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. I also thank the people of Kurunegala Electoral District who supported me amidst massive political challenges.

Prior to 2015, a massive voice was raised among the people on racism, religion and corruption. If the Ranil -Maithri government came to power in 2015, the country would have improved.

Religious leaders advised Gotabhaya Rajapakse to manage this country to become Hitler. But he was spontaneously stupid. In the end, the country opposed the worst crises.

It was in this context that the people of the country formed the power -led government. Remember that there is no way. The authority is like swing.
