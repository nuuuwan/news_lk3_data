    "The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) says that steps will be taken to suspend the party membership of anyone who acts against the party\u2019s decisions regardless of their positions.",
    "The General Secretary of the SLPP Sagara Kariyawasam has informed in writing that this decision was unanimously arrived at by the Politburo of the SLPP.",
    "Furthermore, the SLPP mentioned that against a backdrop where the party has adopted proposals to field a candidate of the party for the 2024 presidential election, if any member of the party presents himself as a presidential candidate without the knowledge of the party or acts directly or indirectly against the candidate presented by the party, disciplinary action will be taken against that member regardless of the position held by that member in the party, and the party membership of the person in question will be suspended.",
    "Additionally, it has also been decided the same will apply for any party member who backs any candidate other than the SLPP\u2019s presidential candidate directly or indirectly, or acts against the decisions taken by the party."
