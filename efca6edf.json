    "One of Sri Lanka\u2019s leading research firms, Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT) released its second Bangladesh Country Report 2023 containing key trends and developments in the economy and major sectors such as the residential, commercial and retail real-estate markets as well as the hotel and bare land markets pertaining to the capital of Dhaka.",
    "The new report also outlines the behaviour of macroeconomic indicators related to the country including the peer comparison of the economic performance within the South Asian Region.",
    "Through this report RIUNIT addresses a need for lack of information in the South Asian nation while also making its contribution to developing knowledge that will benefit local developers, investors and buyers. The research firm hopes this will ease the way for foreign investors looking at this most promising of emerging markets in Asia to navigate their journey.",
    "The report will be of use to anyone and everyone in real estate or thinking of entering. Investors, developers, academics, professionals and property hunters to grasp a good understanding about various drivers of the real-estate market in Bangladesh.",
    "\u201cThe way in which Bangladesh\u2019s capital city of Dhaka has evolved over recent years, and indeed continues to find ways to keep evolving and expanding is a case in point. Where real estate is concerned, the landscape is dominated by very strong local developers while increasingly, foreign interest in residential apartments and other market segments is gathering,\u201d said Research Intelligence Unit CEO Roshan Madewela at the launch of the report.",
    "\u201cIt is only a matter of time before the large international brands join the party.\u201d",
    "The report is a product of over 11 months of research with dozens of organisations, both public and private, supporting the quest for information, data and market intelligence.",
    "Currently there are 20-30 Sri Lankan companies operating in the Bangladeshi market and RIUNIT has also been there since 2020.",
