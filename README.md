### ‘From rags to riches’: Sri Lankan worker becomes millionaire doing cleaning jobs in Australia

The story of a Sri Lankan worker, who migrated to Australia less than a decade ago and has become a millionaire now, has taken the internet by storm. At the age of 25, Vinul Karunaratne has made enough money to quit and shift full-time to doing gig jobs.

Karunaratne moved to Australia in 2015 and started working at 7-Eleven stores. But in 2019, he started taking on end-of-lease cleaning jobs on Airtasker. It’s a Sydney-based online marketplace that enables people to outsource everyday tasks - such as cleaning, assembling furniture, or yard work - for others to complete in exchange for cash.

Karunaratne told local news channel 7News that he didn’t have much resources and equipment when he started. “When I started, I didn’t even have much equipment. I had a vacuum, mop, bucket, and some rags,” he said, adding, “That was the stuff I had at home.”

His hard work eventually paid off and he was soon able to ditch his job at 7-Eleven to shift full-time to Airtasker.

Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Response Team (SL CERT) has reported a significant rise in complaints related to online financial fraud in 2024.

According to SL CERT’s Senior Information Engineer Charuka Damunupola, over 340 complaints involving financial scams have been received so far this year.

“Up to September, we’ve received 7,210 complaints regarding online scams, with the majority of these linked to social media platforms. When we focus specifically on online-based fraud, around 20% of the complaints involve financial scams. This highlights a growing trend of internet fraud targeting online banking users,” Damunupola stated.

He further explained that many victims fall prey to scams due to a lack of attention to security measures, particularly with One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

“Many users do not take proper care in safeguarding their OTPs or fail to recognize fraudulent websites. This often results in them being caught in these online banking scams,” Damunupola added.

(Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Israeli airstrikes had killed two successors to Hezbollah’s slain leader, as Israel expanded its ground offensive against the Iran-backed group with a fourth army division deployed into south Lebanon.

Netanyahu spoke in a video released by his office hours after the deputy leader of Hezbollah, which is reeling after a spate of killings of senior commanders in Israeli airstrikes, left the door open to a negotiated ceasefire.

“We’ve degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including (Hassan) Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of the replacement,” Netanyahu said, without naming the latter two.

Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to succeed Nasrallah, had probably been “eliminated”. It was not immediately clear whom Netanyahu meant by the “replacement of the replacement”.

The economic challenges, the debt restructuring, etc. are a perfect storm. If the promise of the constitution is to protect and promote the development of the lives of citizens, I suggest the centre and nine provinces must synergies and seamlessly harmonise government

This piece was prompted by the scaling back of ministries at the centre post the recent elections. The focus has been on cutting back on waste at the centre. Governance is carried out by layered structures; i.e. national, provincial and local. There are nine second-tier provinces and 341 third-level local government: 24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils and 276 Pradeshiya sabhas (village councils). All staffed by Government employees.

### Foreign observers at polls: Evolution of the concept and practice of election observation

*2024-10-09 02:01:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Foreign-observers-at-polls-Evolution-of-the-concept-and-practice-of-election-observation/4-767718) · `en`

Ideals and values of the organisation as well as the duty of transparency and communication appears to bear upon how elections are observed – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The question then arises as to whether all this makes them independent observers or observers who are partial to the sending organisation. The answer is of a binary nature. They are independent in so far as their functioning in the receiving country is concerned. They are required to not take sides in a contest, but to diligently observe whether the conduct of the election was free and fair. The agreement or understanding reached with the national agency and the mandate or the terms of reference under which the organisation concerned nominates the election observers are applicable here. This notwithstanding, there is no denying the fact that the observers bear partiality towards the sending organisation, which means that they uphold the ideals and values of that organisation at all times during their mission

Anura Kumara Dissanayake ; “Leftist” Star Rises Over Sri Lanka – Part Two

Sri Lanka’s newly elected ninth executive president Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) continues to be the focus of this column. In the first part of this article published last week, the early years of  Anura’s eventful life were delved into in some detail. In this week’s  second part,  AKD’s steady rise as a   political leader within the Janatha  Vimukthi  Peramuna (JVP) will be related to some extent.

As stated in this column last week , the JVP’s second insurgency was ruthlessly suppressed by the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime. Tens of thousands of youths were killed or made to disappear. Thousands of youths were incarcerated for years. Hundreds of youths fled Sri Lanka for safety. Hundreds of youths avoided arrest  and possible execution while in Sri Lanka by changing identities and relocating elsewhere. Anura was among those who stayed in Lanka and evaded capture by going underground.

### Greece as a lens to understand present political changes

*2024-10-09 00:36:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Greece-as-a-lens-to-understand-present-political-changes/4-767706) · `en`

The Government of Greece, like its counterpart in Sri Lanka, spent more than the revenue it generated year after year, piling up debt. Unlike in Sri Lanka, Greece lacked the ability to reset the economy by letting the currency float. In both countries the post-crisis focus was on the primary balance. In Sri Lanka this was to be achieved from the revenue side with no overt cuts in expenditure; in Greece by cutting Government expenditures including salaries and pensions, by downsizing Government, and by raising taxes. Syriza did it and now Greece is back to normalcy

Inflation in August 2024 was 0.5%, the lowest since 2000. There are no shortages. No bank collapsed. Reserves are up. Agreement is close on the commercial debt, the last piece of the restructuring.
