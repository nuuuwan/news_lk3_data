    "From the comments I get from readers, it seems that aloe vera is what they like to dabble in to enhance their beauty. Believe me, aloe vera happens to be my favourite, as well.",
    "Okay, here\u2019s how to use fresh aloe vera gel to reap all its beauty benefits.",
    "One of the best benefits of aloe vera gel is that it helps heal skin that has been sunburnt. Since the skin becomes sensitive and changes colour, too, it is important to apply a soothing ingredient on it. Aloe vera gel has cooling properties that help heal the skin faster.",
    "In order to use aloe vera gel on sunburnt skin, store fresh gel in the fridge and let it get cool for a few hours. Now, apply the gel on the skin and let it stay there. The skin will absorb the gel and the gel that is left at the top will protect and act as anti-inflammatory agent.",
    "Some parts of our body are darker than the rest, such as the elbows, under the arms, and knees. Aloe vera gel has properties that can lighten the skin tone. It will prevent dryness in these areas and also help in restoring the natural colour. However, it takes time to see results, so you be patient. Apply the gel every day on these areas and leave it on overnight. If these areas are exposed, make sure you apply sunscreen on them before stepping out.",
    "Dark spots and blemishes can ruin your appearance. Well, if you want to fade them away, aloe vera gel can help you do that. Apply the gel every night and wash off your face in the morning. It is best to do so in the night as that is when your skin rejuvenates, and it will absorb the gel in it. Apply the gel on the blemish, or spots, and then wash face with a facial cleanser the next morning",
    "Aloe vera gel is great for your hair\u2019s health. It promotes hair growth, keeps scalp clean, and nourishes the hair, as well. Applying aloe vera gel does not have any side-effects for your hair, so make sure you use it once a week. Mix it with tea tree oil or sweet almond oil and then massage it on your scalp. Wash your hair after an hour.",
    "If you do not want to use creams and lotions to remove makeup, you can use aloe vera gel. You can apply it directly, or apply it on a cotton pad, and then use it on your face. Mix a little coconut or olive oil as it will be easier to apply and remove the makeup. Aloe vera gel will also not harm the skin; it will soothe it in the process.",
