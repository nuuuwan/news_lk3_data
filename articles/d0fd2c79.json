    "Sri Lanka\u2019s workers\u2019 remittances remain robust, with the June inflow surging to $ 635.7 million, marking the highest since 2016.",
    "As per the latest Central Bank data, the June inflow reflects a robust 22.3% year-on-year (YoY) growth, although it registered a mere 1% dip compared to May 2025.",
    "The $ 693.3 million in March is the highest monthly remittance inflow registered so far in 2025. The improved inflows during June also boosted the cumulative remittances for the first half of 2025, which reached over $ 3.7 billion, a 19% YoY increase and the highest cumulative figure in the period since 2021.",
    "The cumulative figure also represents a 3.46% increase compared to the $ 3.61 billion registered in the same period of 2016 \u2014 the year that holds the record for the highest annual workers\u2019 remittances inflow at $ 7.24 billion.",
    "In 2024, workers\u2019 remittances hit a four-year high of $ 6.57 billion, up by 10.1% from $ 5.69 billion in 2023. This growth was followed by a record wave of people seeking foreign employment after an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "The sharpest post-crisis rebound was in 2023, when workers\u2019 remittances grew by 57% to $ 6 billion, recovering from a 12-year low of $ 3.78 billion in 2022.",
    "Historically, the highest-ever annual workers\u2019 remittances were recorded in 2016, whilst between 2014 and 2018, the annual inflows averaged around $ 7 billion, or roughly around $ 600 million per month."
