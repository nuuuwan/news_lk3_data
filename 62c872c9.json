  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will kick off a procurement process to buy power from independent power producers to feed the grid in the south of the country, after lower-than-expected rainfall pushed up water needs for paddy, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.",
    "Bid are to be called from ACE Matara, ACE Embilipitiya and V-Power which are in position to connect to the Southern grid, he said.",
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board has expected 4,200 to 4,500 Giga Watt hours of hydro generation 2023 and the Public Utilities Commission had projected 5,000 GWh earlier in the year, Minister Wijesekera told parliament.",
    "Due to lower rainfall, in June the Department of Irrigation had requested more water from the Samanalawewa reservoir which is used for power generation.",
    "More requests are now being made for water in August. Cabinet had approved the release of water, and the hiring of extra private power.",
    "As a result of accommodating the latest request, Samanalawewa was expected to go dry on August 17, instead of October when rains from the North East monsoons are expected to resume.  (Colombo/Aug09/2023)"
