    "Invests Rs. 475.97 m in expansive photovoltaic panel rooftop to offset consumption from national grid",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s top tyre maker CEAT Kelani Holdings has completed an investment of Rs. 475.97 million in a High Tension (HT) metering roof-top photovoltaic panel solar power plant as part of the company\u2019s efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of its manufacturing operations at its Kelaniya complex.",
    "The 2.4 MW solar power plant installed by Regen Renewables Ltd. on the factory roof will produce 59.61 GWh in its operational period, offsetting about 21% of CEAT\u2019s consumption of electricity from the national grid and contributing to an omission of 42,326 tons of CO\u2082 emissions, the company said.",
    "The 295,200 square foot solar power plant became operational in December 2023 and will also reduce CEAT\u2019s electricity bill, which currently accounts for about 13% of the company\u2019s cost of production.",
    "CEAT Kelani\u2019s investment covered the cost of solar panels, inverters, walkways, a cleaning system, and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) grid connection.",
    "\u201cAs the manufacturer of nearly half of Sri Lanka\u2019s requirements of pneumatic tyres, CEAT Kelani is a systemically-important contributor to the national economy, but our commitment goes deeper to encompass the community and the environment,\u201d the company\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Dadlani said. \u201cThis investment in renewable energy is just one example of our focus on sustainability.\u201d",
    "One of the most successful India-Sri Lanka joint ventures in the manufacturing sector, the CEAT Kelani joint venture\u2019s investment in Sri Lanka over the past 10 years exceeds Rs. 8.5 billion.",
    "The supplier of the solar power plant Regen Renewables represents SUNTECH \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest and most technologically advanced Tier-1 Solar panel manufacturers \u2013 and the inverter manufacturer Siemens-KACO in Sri Lanka. Regen has been in the rooftop solar business for more than a decade and has successfully installed and commissioned over 20 MW of facilities which is equivalent to a market share of almost 10% in the rooftop industry."
