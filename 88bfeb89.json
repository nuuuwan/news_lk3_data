    "The Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC) has recently sent a letter to Inspector General of Police (IGP) C.D. Wickramaratne, requesting his support to implement a plan to prevent the presence of beggars at traffic lights in the Colombo city area.",
    "The AAC said it has been brought to the notice of its Executive Committee that the \u2018beggar menace\u2019 at the traffic lights in the Colombo City Limits has gone from bad to worse.",
    "\u201cIt was reported that these beggars are a nuisance at the traffic lights where they irritate the motorists by banging on the car windscreen or the glasses while creating a traffic congestion. Furthermore, some of the beggars fall on the bonnet of the vehicle pretending that the motorist had knocked him down and create a scene,\u201d the AAC said.",
    "In the letter to the IGP, the AAC noted that the unruly behaviour of beggars has a direct effect on the image and culture of the country. The AAC also expressed its dissatisfaction at the inaction of the Police despite repeatedly raising the issue with Police personnel attending the monthly meetings of the AAC\u2019s executive committee. \u201cNo effective measures taken to eradicate this troublesome public nuisance,\u201d it noted.",
    "\u201cIt was, therefore, decided that we will take this matter to a forum with your representative and draw up a suitable program which could bring an effective and constructive solution to the beggar menace at the traffic lights, especially within the Colombo City Limits (Zone 1-15). We are confident you will give us the necessary support and expertise on this subject and make the Colombo roads safe for all road users,\u201d the AAC added."
