    "The political decisions of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be decided only by the committees of the party including the SLFP\u2019s central committee, says the party\u2019s Senior Vice President Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa.",
    "The Colombo District Court on Thursday (04) issued an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman.",
    "The order, which was issued following a complaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, will be effective until April 18.",
    "However, Prof. Piyadasa stated that even if the court issued an enjoining order by way of legal clarification in the judicial process, the party\u2019s future political decisions would be made by the party\u2019s committees."
