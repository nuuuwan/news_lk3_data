    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena will stand by his decision to rule against judicial intervention in Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt restructuring as public finance rests solely with parliament, he said.",
    "Abeywardena told MPs on Friday August 11 that he took the decision after several hours\u2019 worth of discussions and consultations with legal experts.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t take this decision alone. It was after wasting two, three hours of discussions,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe have not mentioned a court case anywhere in this,\u201d he added.",
    "The speaker noted that his ruling did not refer to any court case in particular but had only highlighted the supremacy of parliament in matters of public finance.",
    "\u201cIn any case, my decision will not be changed, because it was taken after necessary deliberation,\u201d he said, refusing to withdraw the ruling as requested by opposition lawmakers.",
    "Speaker Abeywardena made the ruling on Wednesday August 09 with regard to parliamentary privileges, noting that courts in the island have no jurisdiction to intervene on a domestic debt restructuring resolution which was passed in parliament last month.",
    "Opposition National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that the Speaker\u2019s ruling could set a dangerous precedent.",
    "\u201cWe have now set a precedent that a motion brought by the government, once it has been passed, cannot be heard in court. This is completely wrong,\u201d said Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cThere is only one thing left to do. You must withdraw your ruling,\u201d he added.",
    "Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said the Supreme Court dismissed a petition against domestic debt restructuring after the Speaker\u2019s ruling.",
    "\u201cThey thought this might lead to a crisis between the judiciary and the executive,\u201d he said.",
    "Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala said the only way to challenge a ruling made by the Speaker of Parliament is through a motion of no confidence against him or her.",
    "Opposition MP G L Peiris warned that the Speaker\u2019s ruling could lead to a constitutional crisis.",
    "Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said the courts can only give a verdict on the constitutionality of a piece of legislation.",
    "\u201cThe Speaker did not challenge the judiciary at all,\u201d he said.",
    "A fundamental rights petition filed challenging the domestic debt restructuring programme was dismissed by a three-judge-bench Supreme Court citing objections made by the Attorney General.",
    "The petition was filed by President of the Inter Company Employees Union and former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Wasantha Samarasinghe and five others.",
    "There were at least two petitions in the Supreme Court alleging that restructuring debt in the Employees Provident Fund and limiting it to pension funds while excluding others holders is iniquitous.",
    "The restructuring plan was approved by the parliament\u2019s public finance committee with a majority and passed by the parliament on July 01, with 122 members voting for and 62 against and it was a matter concerning public finance.",
    "\u201cAs the resolution for the implementation of domestic debt optimization to restore sovereign debt sustainability has been passed by parliament on July 01\u00a0 the resolution is beyond the jurisdiction Supreme Court or any other court established under 171 constitution of Sri Lanka and cannot be questioned, and/or reviewed and/or challenged,\u201d Speaker Abeywardana said in parliament on Wednesday.",
    "He cited a previous ruling by former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike that the Speaker cannot be restrained by interim court orders and a law on parliamentary privileges.",
    "Abeywardana was responding to a ruling requested by Minister Harin Fernando whether courts could intervene on the debt restructure.",
    "Related Ruling sought from Sri Lanka Speaker on Supreme Court hearings on DDR.",
    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa protested that citizens had the right to go to court on fundamental rights according to the constitution because bond holders had been treated unequally in the DDR exercise.",
    "Meanwhile, counsel for EPF beneficiaries who went to the Supreme Court alleging inequity, insisted that courts had jurisdiction to rule on the matter at a hearing on Thursday.",
    "Petitioners went to court saying their fundamental rights had been violated by pension funds being singled out for debt restructuring.",
    "But Counsel M A Sumanthiran, argued that the motion was not legislation or even subsidiary legislation (regulations issued under a law which have before parliament) which had also been struck down by courts elsewhere.",
    "The DDR motion therefore was not legislation and the invitation for debt treatment by the Minister of Finance was simply executive action, which was within the jurisdiction of the court, he said.",
    "No other country which had restructured debt had singled out superannuation funds for debt treatment, while excluding others, Sumanthiran argued. Some had excluded pension funds.",
    "While Sri Lanka\u2019s Registered Stocks Securities Ordinance provided for the government to exchange bonds, all bonds in a series had to be exchanged and not only portions belonging to a one group of holders, he said.",
    "Sri Lanka EPF beneficiaries counsel argue courts can intervene on DDRSee more",
    "In a separate development, a Sri Lanka citizen petitioned the island\u2019s Human Rights Commission against a planned restructuring of debt in pension funds, complaining that other holders were excluded.",
    "Although there were other bondholders like banks, primary dealers, insurance companies, investment companies, high net worth individuals, trustees and proxy holders of individuals would not be subject to the same scheme, the petitioner said.",
    "\u201cThis has serious implications on my right to association and family, and it is inexplicable why the superannuation funds have been targeted by the State for the restructure to the exclusion of others,\u201d the complaint said.",
    "The complainant sought a recommendation that \u201csingling out the beneficiaries of superannuation funds to the exclusion of other similarly place beneficiaries, is a violation of Article 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution.\u201d",
