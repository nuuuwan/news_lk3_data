  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The \u201ctop economist\u201d of Sri Lanka\u2019s leftist alliance National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has confirmed that a future NPP government will not honour Sri Lanka\u2019s outstanding international sovereign bond (ISB) debt, according to opposition MP Harsha de Silva.",
    "\u201cThat a future JVP/NPP Gov will NOT honour #SriLanka USD 12b ISB debt; first insinuated by their chief econ adviser Prof Anil J at @CeylonChamber now repeated clearly by their top economist Sunil Handunhetti goes to show these guys have absolutely no idea how to run a country,\u201d de Silva said in a tweet on Wednesday January 03.",
    "The MP made this claim after a video went viral online showing Handunneththi, former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP and ex-chair of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), casually dismissing Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations to its ISB holders.",
    "If we say we will not payback to ISB holders, they will say 'no worrys Machang'",
    "We will say to IMF, if you want give us money but dont put any conditions",
    "These are lollipop ideas with no practicality.#lka #SriLanka #jvp #\u0d9a\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dba\u0ddd pic.twitter.com/7Db3KeRidR",
    "\u201cHow did we get stuck in ISBs? Everyone who puts in money for ISBs do so taking the risk involved. They calculate the interest with the risk included. They have already taken the risk from the interest. If we say we\u2019re not paying the ISB debt, they\u2019ll say \u2018it\u2019s okay, machang\u2019, because the risk is contained in the interest,\u201d Handunneththi said in the video.",
    "\u201cISBs are for investing in risky economies. The maturity periods and interests are calculated after a risk analysis. That\u2019s what we have to say to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) too. \u2018Give us the loan if you wish to. We will pay it back, but give us a fair amount of time to pay back. We don\u2019t want conditions,\u201d he added.",
    "In his response, MP de Silva, who is the foremost voice for economic policy in the main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), said the NPP\u2019s economic advisor Prof Anil Jayasekera had originally made a similar remark, which Handunneththi was now repeating.",
    "This goes to show the NPP has \u201cno idea how to run a country,\u201d he said.",
    "In an interview with EconomyNext in June 2023, de Silva said Sri Lanka\u2019s next election will be a battle of ideologies.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s next election a battle of ideologies: Harsha de SilvaSee more",
    "The leftist NPP, a loose alliance dominated by the Marxist-Leninist JVP which has been increasingly critical of the IMF programme, has gained ground in the aftermath of the 2022 crisis and, according to at least one poll, is still ahead of the SJB, the SLPP and President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s one-man United National Party (UNP). Against this backdrop, if President Wickremesinghe were to invite the SJB to come back into the UNP fold \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s so called \u2018grand old party\u2019 which the SJB broke away from \u2013 or to form a grand alliance with like minded groups, would the SJB consider it?",
    "\u201cI think we should consider any alliance that is ideologically aligned,\u201d answered de Silva in the June interview, adding, however, that the SJB is in complete disagreement with the president on the alleged partnership with and protection of those accused of corruption, as well as controversial pieces of legislation such as the proposed broadcast regulatory commission act, the anti-terrorism act ant the like.",
    "\u201cThese are completely wrong. This is not the Ranil Wickremesinghe that we knew,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, MP Nalaka Godahewa, a key proponent of the Viyathmaga professional body that backed ex President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has joined forces with the SJB.",
    "Speaking at an SJB press event, Godahewa distanced the Viyathmaga outfit from the discredited policies of Rajapaksa.",
    "Godahewa, speaking to the media with an SJB banner behind him, claimed that Viyathmaga, a body of professionals who endorsed and campaigned for Rajapaksa in the run-up to the 2019 presidential poll, was excluded from key policy decisions."
