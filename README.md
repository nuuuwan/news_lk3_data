Instead of dwelling on the past, they should focus on presenting their manifestos for the upcoming election ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

I am appalled to see how all the old political parties are scrambling to form alliances against the NPP for the upcoming general election.

Meanwhile, the NPP is showing wisdom by steering clear of these alliances, positioning themselves to secure over 113 seats in Parliament.

It‚Äôs time for the other party leaders to walk the talk and stop playing blame games. Instead of dwelling on the past, they should focus on presenting their manifestos for the upcoming election and offer real solutions to the public.
