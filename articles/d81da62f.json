    "The Chairman of the Election Commission, R.M.A.L. Ratnayake officially announced the counting of second preference of the two leading candidates of the 2024 presidential election, in view of the prevailing situation of the vote results.",
    "Mr. Ratnayake stated that accordingly, all the other candidates except for the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya candidate Sajith Premadasa will be disqualified from the race.",
    "The Election Commission Chairman announced this during a special media briefing, a short while ago.",
    "Furthermore, he expressed that since no candidate has obtained the required percentage of votes at the first count, the preference for the two leading candidates Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa among the other ballot papers will be counted for a final decision.",
    "Under Sri Lanka\u2019s electoral rules, voters can rank second and third-choice candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50 per cent, those second-preference votes are added to the tally of the two leading candidates to determine a winner.",
    "This will be the first presidential run-off in Sri Lanka\u2019s election history."
