    "Review of \u201cA Sri Lankan Misadventure\u201d by Nareshkumar B. Handagama",
    "In 2021, Sri Lanka was rocked by over 400 cooking gas explosions \u2013 many fatal, many more injured, and all terrified. Homes and restaurants became death traps overnight. While victims were initially blamed for \u201cusing old cookers\u201d or \u201cneglecting maintenance,\u201d Dr. Nareshkumar B. Handagama \u2013 a globally renowned chemical engineer, professor, former CEO of Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology \u2013 and his meticulously researched book, \u2018A Sri Lankan Misadventure\u2019, exposes the shocking truth: the explosions were a manmade disaster fuelled by corporate greed, regulatory negligence, complicit indifference and governmental wilful ignorance.",
    "Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), used in millions of Sri Lankan kitchens, is typically a mix of propane and butane. For 50 years, Sri Lanka\u2019s standard was 20% propane and 80% butane. This ratio wasn\u2019t arbitrary; it was carefully matched to the safety ratings of regulators, valves, hoses, and cookers designed to handle the resulting pressure inside gas cylinders (around 54 psi at typical Sri Lankan temperatures).",
    "Handagama demonstrates through rigorous thermodynamic modelling what happened next. Sometime in late 2021, without warning or safety testing, the major LPG suppliers (state-owned Litro Gas and private LAUGFS Gas) changed the mixture to 50% propane and 50% butane.",
    "Why does this matter? Propane has a much higher vapour pressure than butane. The 50:50 mix dramatically increased the pressure inside the cylinders. At 32\u00b0C (the Sri Lanka\u2019s common ambient temperature), the pressure jumped from the safe 54 psi to a dangerous 89.4 psi.",
    "The result, obviously, was fatal. This step-surge in pressure overwhelmed the existing infrastructure: Regulators (designed for 54 psi) failed, valves and seals leaked, hoses (especially older ones) ruptured, and cooker components couldn\u2019t contain the flow.",
    "Gas leaked silently. LPG being heavier than air, it stagnated and pooled at the floor elevations in kitchens and enclosed spaces. All it needed was a spark \u2013 from an electric light switch, a refrigerator, or a match \u2013 to ignite the flammable cloud resulting a catastrophic explosion.",
    "Handagama\u2019s book isn\u2019t just a technical analysis; it\u2019s a damning indictment of systemic failure.",
    "The book strongly implies (citing \u201ckickbacks and greed\u201d) that the change to a 50:50 mix was likely driven by cost/profit considerations in the global LPG market. The exact financial incentive isn\u2019t spelled out, but it only takes one small observation to reveal a deeper scandal: \u201cLPG is sold by mass (kg), not volume. A 50:50 mix at the same cylinder pressure contains less butane \u2013 a heavier gas \u2013 meaning consumers paid full price for",
    "less fuel.\u201d This isn\u2019t profit; it\u2019s looting. Where do we draw the line between entrepreneurship and fraud? Between \u201cmarket dynamics\u201d and parasitic exploitation?",
    "Crucially, no Management of Change (MoC) protocol was followed either. Changing a fundamental property like composition without a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study is, as Handagama states, \u201cborder[ing] on insanity\u201d in process engineering. Basic safety engineering was ignored.",
    "In a move that was dismissive to the victims at best, and disrespectful at worst, when explosions surged, companies blamed consumers for \u201cshoddy equipment\u201d and \u201cpandemic neglect.\u201d They refused to acknowledge their own role until forced by courts and public pressure. They actively concealed the composition change.",
    "Even scarier is the fact that the regulators (Sri Lanka Standards Institute \u2013 SLSI, Consumer Affairs) were asleep at the wheel! The SLSI standard (20:80) was blatantly violated. Regulators failed to monitor compliance or test imported gas before unloading. As people died and were maimed, regulatory bodies remained largely silent. Where were the pre-shipment checks? The mass audits? Ethics in civil society shouldn\u2019t be a dream.",
    "A government\u2019s prime mandate is public protection. Here, ministers first sided with corporations, ignoring the \u201cdemons of negligence\u201d. And despite hundreds of incidents, the Government response was \u201clukewarm,\u201d delayed, and lacked focus or vigour. Handagama scathingly critiques the appointment of unqualified \u201cPresidential Advisors,\u201d highlighting a chaotic system \u201cwhere quid pro quo and nepotism dominates.\u201d This lack of genuine technical expertise meant warnings were likely ignored or misunderstood. The Government\u2019s failure to act decisively represented a \u201cgross lapse of ethical imagination\u201d and a \u201csocial moral void.\u201d Victims were abandoned while powerful interests were protected.",
    "And throughout the series of unfortunate events, where were Sri Lanka\u2019s chemical engineering faculties? As Handagama asks: \u201cWhere had all the \u2018cream of the crop\u2019 gone?\u201d Their silence amid technical injustice speaks volumes about complicity in control structures.",
    "The book poignantly dedicates itself to those who \u201clost their lives in vain... succumbed to the demons of negligence and the devils of ignorance.\u201d Handagama notes tragically that the explosions disproportionately affected lower-income households, highlighting how substandard, unregulated appliances became deadly under the increased LPG operating pressure. This wasn\u2019t just an accident; it was a preventable tragedy enabled by a culture that prioritised profit and convenience over human life and safety.",
    "\u2018A Sri Lankan Misadventure\u2019 is more than an expert analysis; it\u2019s a crucial public document.",
    "Handagama cuts through the technical complexity to reveal a simple, horrifying truth: People died because institutions failed in their most basic duties.",
    "The book is a powerful call for accountability \u2013 prosecution of those responsible for the reckless composition change and cover-up and compensation for victims. It\u2019s a call for regulatory reform \u2013 mandatory pre-discharge testing of LPG, strict enforcement of SLSI standards, and robust MoC protocols, are the least of Dr. Handagama\u2019s recommendations. And above all, it\u2019s a call for a better safety culture \u2013 A fundamental shift where safety is paramount, transparency is demanded, and technical competence guides decisions \u2013 in both corporations and government.",
    "A Sri Lankan Misadventure is also a mirror held to a society; where oligarchy overruled oversight, laws bent to profit, and morality became collateral damage.",
    "This \u201cmisadventure\u201d was not fate; it was the direct result of choices made by those in power. Handagama\u2019s work ensures we cannot look away or forget. It demands justice and systemic change to prevent such explosive negligence from ever happening again. The question lingers: \u201cIs this ignorance, or capitalising on ignorance?\u201d Until Sri Lanka confronts its culture of \u201cpower without responsibility,\u201d the next misadventure looms.",
    "It is essential reading for every citizen, regulator, and policymaker in Sri Lanka. The book is available through Sarasavi Publishers and bookshops."
