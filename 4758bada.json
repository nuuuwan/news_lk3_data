    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation will call tenders to sell furnace oil and naptha produced at its refinery after heavy rains reduced fuel demand for power generation, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.",
    "The refinery is producing about 1,400 to 1,500 metric tonnes of naptha a day, but industrial customers, other than the CEB only bought about 200 to 300 metric tonnes a day.",
    "The CPC had now stockpiled 69,000 metric tonnes of product and it only had about 90,000 metric tonnes of storage available.",
    "\u201cAn option is to stop the refinery but it also produces diesel, petrol and jet fuel,\u201d Minister Wijesekera said.",
    "The CEB was hardly using furnace oil and naptha and the other option was to export the heavy fuels.",
    "\u201cWe hope to avoid a loss or make a small profit in the export,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s refinery built in the last century produces somewhat higher volumes of naptha and furnace oil compared to modern ones using more advanced cracking technology. (Colombo/Dec19/2023)"
