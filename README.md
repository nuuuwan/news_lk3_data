BBC - The US House of Representatives has passed a landmark bill that could see TikTok banned in America.

It would give the social media giant's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, six months to sell its controlling stake or the app would be blocked in the US.

While the bill passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan vote, it still needs to clear the Senate and be signed by the president to become law.

Lawmakers have long held concerns about China's influence over TikTok.

TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, founded in 2012.

The Beijing-based firm is registered in the Cayman Islands, and has offices across Europe and the US.

If the bill does manage to secure approval in the Senate, President Joe Biden has promised to sign it as soon as it lands on his desk, which could prompt a diplomatic spat with China.

### Eliminate taxes for menstrual use, including Saturni Nabkins - Emphasizing the Government

*2024-03-14 09:01:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178676) · `ta`

The Sri Lanka Family Association calls for the government to eliminate taxes on menstrual products, including Saturni Nabkins, to address 'menstrual poverty' impacting women's health. This issue was discussed at an International Women's Day event, aiming to pressure the government to restructure taxes on menstrual materials. Internationally, 'Period Poverty' highlights the inability of women to afford essential menstrual products, affecting over half of Sri Lanka's population. The association argues that taxing menstrual products, especially for large-income families, negatively impacts women's hygiene and social inclusion. The recent Value Service Amendment has increased the tax on Saturni Nabkins, raising prices by 92%. MP Harsha de Silva supports eliminating these taxes, suggesting they raise minimal income and proposing free distribution to school children.

🟩

The Sri Lanka Family Association, which has pointed out that 'menstrual poverty' is the most impact on the physical and psychological health of women nationwide, has urged the government to completely eliminate taxes on menstrual use, including Saturni Nabkins.

The main objective of the investigation was to put pressure on the government to restructure the policy reorganization of all taxes on menstrual material, including Saturni Nabkins, to ensure the menstrual health of women nationwide.

The number of children globally who died before their fifth birthday dropped to a record low of 4.9 million in 2022, but that still represents one death every six seconds, according to new United Nations estimates.

While the mortality rate for under-5s has roughly halved since 2000, the world is still behind in the goal of reducing preventable deaths in that age group by 2030, and progress has slowed since 2015, the report, released on Wednesday, found.

The numbers represent “an important milestone”, said Juan Pablo Uribe, director for health nutrition and population at the World Bank, one of the partners that put together the report alongside Unicef, the U.N. population division and the World Health Organization.

The picture is varied. Some countries, like Cambodia, Malawi and Mongolia, have reduced under-5 mortality rates by more than 75% since 2000.

### Canada to strengthen mental health safeguards

Colombo, March 14 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of a Sri Lankan family killed in Canada and a 19-year-old Sri Lankan national being charged for it, the Canadian authorities will put more attention to safeguards already in place on the mental health of students, according to a diplomatic source.

Febrio De-Zoysa, who is believed to be in Canada as a student, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder, Ottawa police said in a post on X. Six Sri Lankans were stabbed to death in the home they lived in together, including a 2 1/2-month-old girl and three other young children.

The incident has triggered fears in the minds of Sri Lankans whether Canada will toughen visa regulations for them in the future following this incident. A diplomatic source, however, confirmed that Canada would not do so because this was just a one-off incident.

Sri Lanka is poised to benefit from the global trend towards electric vehicles (EVs), leveraging its top-quality vein graphite crucial for EV battery manufacturing.

The country’s commitment to sustainability and quality standards places it strategically in the non-China graphite export market, boosted by US industrial policies favouring domestic assembly and non-China sources.

A new IPS study highlights Sri Lanka’s opportunity to become part of the EV battery supply chain. It suggests focusing on upstream activities including exporting battery-grade graphite and anodes, and strengthening Research and Development to enhance its strategic position in the non-China graphite export sector, thus attracting investment and ensuring sustainability.

### Sri Lanka grappling with severe clove production decline

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a severe decline in clove production, Mirror Business learns.

The experts attribute the downfall to the heavy rainfall towards the end of August last year, causing premature shedding of the clove buds. Consequently, the seasonal cultivation cycle, which was anticipated to commence between December and January, has been adversely affected.

Speaking to Mirror Business, Export Agriculture Industries Director General A.P.P. Disna shared that the country is projected to achieve only 20 percent of its annual clove production, with the export quantities likely to plummet to below 1000 tonnes.

“Cloves exhibit a cyclic pattern of abundant yields every three years. In a favourable season, we can export between 4000 and 6000 tonnes of cloves. Last year, we had good production. But this year, the overall production is roughly forecasted to be just 600-700 tonnes,” Disna revealed.

The consumer confidence in Sri Lanka saw a slight improvement in February.

According to the Institute for Health Policy (IHP), this is driven by a recovery of the public expectations of the country’s situation in the next 12 months, coupled with the recovery of the buying conditions.

In February, all three of the IHP’s Consumer Confidence indices, which are generated from its Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS), improved.

The Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), the broadest measure of the public’s view of their personal economic status and national economy, gained six points to 22 points. The Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE), which tracks future perceptions, increased seven points to 28 points. The Index of Current Conditions (ICC), a measure of perceptions of the current conditions, also increased four points to 13 points.

Are the people of Sri Lanka happy? Most independent and non-party analysts would say a clear no. Millions of people are suffering from a lack of food, shelter, clothing, healthcare needs, education and other facilities. So it is clear that except for the politicians– most of whom make money illegally– and big business magnets, most of  Sri Lanka’s people are unhappy.

Next week, the United Nations will mark the International Day of Happiness. In a statement, the world body said that happiness is a fundamental human goal. The UN General Assembly recognizes this goal and calls for a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes happiness and well-being of all people.

They were offered a forum to raise their objections, which you usually hear in press conferences and political meetings, and present a coherent alternative plan

### Economic Policies in an Election Year: Suggested Priorities

Part I of this article, which was published on February 29, laid out the grim fiscal and debt sustainability outlook for Sri Lanka.

The key driver of debt dynamics is the gap between real GDP growth and real interest rates on government debt. Sustained annual growth of 5-6% and low real interest rates through disciplined fiscal policy would significantly improve debt sustainability. With slowing labour force growth due to an ageing population, sustaining high GDP growth requires increased investment and productivity growth. In addition, raising Sri Lanka’s low tax ratio to 16-18% of GDP, aligning with Asian peers, would support sustainable non-interest spending levels (Figure 1).

Given the imperative of fiscal discipline, Sri Lanka can no longer turn to the economic model of the past where growth was driven by public sector spending fueled by borrowing and inward-looking, protectionist trade policies. It needs to adopt a new economic model where growth would be:

*2024-03-14 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Sri-Lanka-failed-to-meet-33-of-IMF-commitments-due-by-end-Feb/172-278797) · `en`

Sri Lanka verifiably failed to meet 33% of the commitments due by end-February 2024 in its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, according to the February update of Verité Research’s ‘IMF Tracker’.

Many of these commitments that are classified as ‘not met’ on IMF Tracker were designed to improve governance. These include commitments related to publishing information (transparency), and those that require the passage of governance-improving legislation. The IMF has recognised poor governance as being at the heart of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, and Sri Lanka is the first Asian country to have had an IMF-led Governance Diagnostic Assessment.

The status of 36% of the commitments are classified as ‘unknown’, which means sufficient data was not made available to assess their progress. By end-February, 31% of the commitments were verifiably ‘met’.

### Harsha non-committal on Ranil’s claim

*2024-03-13 23:46:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Harsha-non-committal-on-Ranils-claim/108-278807) · `en`

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) - Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Harsha de Silva was non-committal on the recent remark by President Ranil Wickremesinghe that the SJB leadership has sidelined party men like him and is depending on others such as MPs Professor G.L. Peiris and Nalaka Godahewa.

"You should ask President Wickremesinghe about our being sidelined. We cannot comment on that," Dr. De Silva said in response to a question raised by the media as to whether MPs such as him are sidelined by the SJB leadership.

Also he said Sri Lanka should be a stakeholder of fast developing Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala if it is to survive in the future. These states are identified as the fastest developing regions. Sri Lanka should become a stakeholder of this development and should try to benefit from it, he added.

### The Conspiracy: Gotabaya’s Mein Kampf could incite ethnic, religious conflict

*2024-03-13 23:35:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-Conspiracy-Gotabaya-s-Mein-Kampf-could-incite-ethnic-religious-conflict/4-759442) · `en`

“…The point I made about the Aragalaya being fundamentally, an anti-Sinhalese and anti-Buddhist enterprise from the beginning to the end”

Dr. Colvin R. de Silva’s position on the executive presidency was slightly more nuanced than the flat denunciation by Dr. N.M. Perera. While criticising the 1978 Constitution, he took pains in a contribution to the Lanka Guardian magazine to emphasise that the Jayewardene presidential system, though deriving from the Gaullist model of France, has significant accretions and distortions which brought it more into line with those of Francophone Africa. Colvin pointed explicitly to the tyrant Jean-Bedel Bokassa of the Central African Republic. He quipped that the main danger of the over-concentration of power in the 1978 Jayewardene Constitution is that “someday we may not only have to suffer a bad president but also a mad president”.

### Najmul guides Bangladesh to comfortable win against Sri Lanka

Chittagong, Mar. 13 - Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto struck an unbeaten century to guide Bangladesh to a comfortable six-wicket win in the first one-day international of a three-match series against Sri Lanka in Chittagong on Wednesday.

Najmul hit 122 not out off 129 balls, and was ably supported by one of his predecessors as captain, Mushfiqur Rahim, who was unbeaten on 73, as Bangladesh raced to 257-4 in 44.4 overs after bowling out Sri Lanka for 255 runs.

The pair added 165 in their unbroken fifth-wicket stand, saving Bangladesh from a potential mid-innings collapse, coming together at 92-4.

Dilshan Madushanka took two early wickets and Pramod Madushan joined him to leave Bangladesh struggling at 23-3, in a little over five overs.

Najmul put on 69 for the fourth wicket with Mahmudullah Riyad to stave off the initial danger.

### Home remedies for Glowing Skin

*2024-03-13 23:04:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/home-remedies-for-glowing-skin/) · `en`

No doubt, we all love to have glowing skins, the ladies, especially, and with that in mind, this week I’ve decided to give them a choice.

All the items mentioned are freely available, so let’s move into action….

Take a few pieces of ripe papaya and, add one teaspoon of Sandalwood powder, and one teaspoon of honey. Mix these ingredients to get a paste-like consistency.

Apply the paste all over the face and neck and leave it for 20 minutes. Rinse off with cool water. Repeat this once every week.

Overall, this face pack acts as an anti-ageing and skin firming pack which helps you get a glowing skin.

Apply pure honey evenly on a clear and damp face and massage it thoroughly for a few minutes. Then, wash it off with lukewarm water. Do this on every alternative day.

Honey will reduce blemishes and make the skin soft and healthy

### Calendar girl…

*2024-03-13 23:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/calendar-girl/) · `en`

Neil Sedaka’s big hit of the sixties, ‘Calendar Girl’, came to mind when I was told that Rozanne Diasz, and her senior colleagues, in the modelling scene, had worked on a project to bring out a calendar, featuring the senior models.

According to Rozanne, the 2024 calendar was their very first attempt at doing something unique for the senior models.

“It was a kind of a trial effort and the response that came our way was very encouraging and we now plan to make the calendar a reality for the year 2025 – as a desk and wall calendar.

The 2024 effort features Rozanne herself, Dannielle Kerkoven, Geraldine D’ Rozario, Koshi Edirisuriya, Nilusha Fernando, Nilu Senanayake and Rozelle Sheril Plunkett.

They are pictured in the respective months they celebrate their birthdays.

“Since we did all this at short notice we didn’t get a birthday girl model for each month of the year, but it will be a totally different scene when we come out with our desk and wall calendar for 2025.”

🟩

Gotabhaya Rajapakse, who has put the country into a bankruptcy, is trying to intensify Sinhala Buddhist policies. Writing the book is useless. National Council Chairman Omalpe Sobhitha Thera said that Gotabhaya Rajapakse should not forget that the people are very clear and that I am presenting the facilities to leave the country in the event of a life -threatening.

He made this statement during a media briefing held at Embilipitiya on Monday evening.

In the book published by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, I am noted that I have acted from his presence to eliminate his Sinhala Buddhist existence.

In 2020, the economic crisis should be held responsible for the Sri Lanka PA. The people affected by the economic crisis took to the streets to protest the government.

And Beijing confirmed Wednesday that a delegation had visited the country and met with pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu during a trip that also took them to Sri Lanka and Nepal from March 4 to 13.
