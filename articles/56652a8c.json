    "The story of Sri Lanka\u2019s recent turmoil is both a cautionary tale of authoritarianism gone awry and a narrative of resilience. The Rajapaksa dynasty, spearheaded by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, came to symbolize the very forces that pushed Sri Lanka to the brink\u2014corruption, nepotism, and reckless economic policies. Gotabaya\u2019s tenure left the nation reeling from financial mismanagement, stoked ethnic divisions, and silenced dissent. Yet, from this dark chapter emerged a new leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, whose values and vision offer Sri Lankans a renewed sense of hope. This article traces the disastrous decisions of Gotabaya\u2019s administration and examines how Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party are paving a path toward unity, accountability, and economic recovery.",
    "Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s rule began with promises of security and prosperity, but it quickly devolved into a regime driven by ethnocentrism, nepotism, and economic blunders. He ascended to power on a wave of Sinhalese nationalism, framing himself as a protector against threats from minority communities. His rule deepened ethnic divides, especially targeting Tamil and Muslim populations, creating an \u201cus versus them\u201d atmosphere.",
    "In a calculated move post-Easter attacks in 2019, he ramped up the rhetoric around \u201cprotecting\u201d Sri Lanka from minority extremists. Mosques and Muslim-owned businesses faced violence, with little intervention from authorities\u2014a chilling reminder of state complicity. Rather than uniting the country, he harnessed division, deploying a strategy of \u201cus versus them\u201d that deflected attention from the pressing economic issues that plagued the nation.",
    "Gotabaya\u2019s presidency was marked by rampant nepotism, with key government roles filled by family members, including his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who served as Prime Minister. Other close relatives & loyalists took charge of crucial portfolios like finance and law. Under the guise of stability, the Rajapaksas formed a political monopoly, undermining accountability. One of the most damaging consequences was a drastic tax cut in 2019, a policy endorsed by his brother, then-finance minister Basil Rajapaksa, which stripped the state of revenue. This ill-advised move quickly drained Sri Lanka\u2019s coffers, leaving it financially vulnerable.",
    "In an attempt to present Sri Lanka as a green pioneer, Gotabaya abruptly banned chemical fertilizers in 2021, aiming for a transition to organic farming. This policy devastated the agricultural sector, with crop yields for staples like rice and tea dropping dramatically. Sri Lanka, once a self-sufficient rice producer, was forced to import rice amid soaring costs, deepening the strain on its depleted foreign reserves. Economists warned of these risks, but Gotabaya dismissed expert advice, framing the policy as an environmental leap forward. Instead, it spiraled into a food crisis and economic collapse.",
    "Gotabaya\u2019s government exploited public resources and signed dubious contracts that prioritized profit over national interest. The infamous Hambantota Port deal with China, a project fronted by the Rajapaksas, resulted in a massive debt burden and a 99-year lease to China. This deal underscored how the Rajapaksa administration sacrificed long-term sovereignty for short-term financial gain. As foreign reserves dwindled and Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt in 2022, the economic chaos exposed the depths of corruption.\u00a0Pandora Papers\u00a0revelations further implicated the Rajapaksa family in offshore accounts and financial misconduct.",
    "In his pursuit of power, Gotabaya deployed repressive tactics to silence opposition. Journalists and activists who questioned his policies faced intimidation, detainment, or even murder. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) became a tool to stifle dissent, imprisoning critics without trial. Prominent figures, like lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah, were detained under dubious charges, underscoring a regime where dissent was not tolerated. This authoritarian climate eroded press freedom and fostered a pervasive culture of fear, with state forces loyal to Gotabaya strategically positioned across civil institutions.",
    "In the wake of Gotabaya\u2019s abdication, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the NPP emerged as symbols of a new dawn. Dissanayake\u2019s unwavering stance against corruption and his commitment to social justice resonated deeply with a public disillusioned by empty promises and self-serving leaders. Unlike his predecessors, Dissanayake\u2019s vision for Sri Lanka is based on inclusion, integrity, and progress. His straightforward, honest rhetoric appeals to a nation longing for leaders who prioritize people over power.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s party, the National People\u2019s Power, stands in stark contrast to the traditional power dynamics of Sri Lankan politics. Grounded in transparency, the NPP advocates policies that restore faith in governance. The party\u2019s emphasis on responsible fiscal management, sustainable development, and economic independence addresses the immediate and long-term needs of the nation. Unlike the Rajapaksa\u2019s debt-heavy policies, Dissanayake envisions economic growth fueled by domestic industries and infrastructure, strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s self-reliance.",
    "To address Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis, the NPP proposes stringent anti-corruption measures, including routine audits and open reporting of government spending. These policies, coupled with a commitment to reduce public debt responsibly, have instilled confidence among diverse communities, from urban professionals to rural farmers. By curbing state corruption and waste, Dissanayake and the NPP aim to make public funds work for the people, not political elites.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s appeal extends across ethnic and religious boundaries, a rarity in Sri Lankan politics. Unlike Gotabaya, who pandered to Sinhalese nationalism, Dissanayake emphasizes inclusivity, seeking reconciliation for communities scarred by years of conflict and division. The NPP has proposed a truth and reconciliation commission to address past grievances, aiming for healing through accountability. This approach resonates with Tamil, Muslim, and Sinhalese populations alike, as Dissanayake pledges to protect the rights of all citizens and restore a sense of national solidarity.",
    "For millions of Sri Lankans, Dissanayake\u2019s leadership represents a long-awaited promise of recovery and reform. His pledge to reduce inequality, prioritize education and healthcare, and revitalize agriculture signals a renewed commitment to the welfare of ordinary citizens. As Dissanayake puts it, \u201cPower belongs to the people, not to those who hold office.\u201d This shift in perspective is deeply personal for Sri Lankans who suffered under Gotabaya\u2019s authoritarian rule and now see in Dissanayake a chance to rebuild their nation with dignity and transparency.",
    "The NPP\u2019s rise has mobilized people from all walks of life, united by the hope for a better Sri Lanka. Where the Rajapaksas drained resources and crushed dissent, Dissanayake promises a government that listens to its citizens and prioritizes their well-being. Sri Lankans gather in packed halls to hear him speak, seeing in his words not just policy but sincerity\u2014a genuine desire to restore their country\u2019s honor and potential.",
    "Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s presidency brought Sri Lanka to the brink, marked by corruption, nepotism, and division. His rule decimated the economy, fractured society, and instilled a culture of fear. Yet, amid this darkness, Anura Kumara Dissanayake has emerged with a vision rooted in integrity and unity. With the NPP, he offers Sri Lankans a path to rebuild\u2014not through division, but through solidarity; not through exploitation, but through empowerment.",
    "As Sri Lanka turns to the future, Dissanayake stands as a reminder that true leadership lies in service, not power. His rise offers a rare glimmer of hope that this nation, bruised but resilient, can once again stand tall. The dawn may be fragile, but it is real, and under Dissanayake\u2019s guidance, Sri Lankans dare to believe in the promise of a brighter tomorrow."
