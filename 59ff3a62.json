  "original_body_lines": [
    "An appeal filed challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal to dismiss the petition, filed seeking the disqualification of State Minister Diana Gamage\u2019s parliamentary seat, has been fixed for consideration on January 19, 2024.",
    "The appeal which was put forward by social activist Oshala Herath was taken up before a Supreme Court judge bench led by Justice Yasantha Kodagoda today (Jan. 08).",
    "Social activist Oshala Herath had filed the relevant appeal two weeks after the petition he had filed over Diana Gamage\u2019s parliamentary seat and citizenship was dismissed by the Appeals Court.",
    "Naming State Minister Gamage and several others as the respondent of his appeal, Herath said he had previously filed a petition alleging that the lawmaker is unqualified to hold the position of a member of parliament in Sri Lanka, as she also holds dual citizenship.",
    "However, a three-member judge bench of the Appeals Court delivered a split decision on October 31, 2023 and dismissed the petition, subject to a fee.",
    "Accordingly, Herath has sought a Supreme Court order determining that the Appeals Court ruling is unlawful and that State Minister Gamage is not qualified to hold parliamentary seat."
