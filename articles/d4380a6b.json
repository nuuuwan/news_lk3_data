    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka can achieve fast growth by boosting tourism, information technology, and making better use of its ocean and mineral resources, President Anura Dissanayake said.",
    "Sri Lanka will continue with an International Monetary Fund program to stabilize the financial sector but has strategies for the broader economy, he said making a policy statement in parliament.",
    "\u201cThe tourism sector is the quickest strategy to increase revenue of our goods and services. We have prepared a tourism industry policy to attract 4 billion tourists, and grow the industry to 8 billion dollars in 3-4 years.\u201d",
    "He said globally the IT industry was one of the fastest developing markets.",
    "\u201cWe need experienced professionals high in IT literacy. There are around 85,000 now. We intend to grow this to 200,000.\u201d",
    "Currently Sri Lanka earns around 1.2 billion dollars from the IT industry, Dissanayake said.",
    "\u201cWe will implement steps to grow this to 5 billion dollars. ICT is one area where we can make an exponential leap.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s geographic location is ideal to grow commercial and naval sectors, he said.",
    "\u201cColombo Port has an important place among global ports, but are those that obtain services happy about its efficiency and management?\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has claims to an ocean area 8 times its size, but is not reaping its benefits to the full, he said.",
    "\u201cFisheries sector can provide a boost to our economy. That\u2019s why we took steps to give a fuel subsidy.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka could also capitalize on its resources, especially mineral resources, he said.",
    "\u201cWithout value addition, we have been unable to earn the full potential revenue from this. We will grow this sector through public private partnerships.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe state can\u2019t do it alone. In some instances we require technology, in some instances capital. So we will involve private investors to grow this sector.\u201d (Colombo/Nov21/2024)"
