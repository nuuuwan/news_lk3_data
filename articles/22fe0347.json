    "I have always believed that whatever you do, and whatever reputation you have gathered for yourself, an element of luck is necessary from time to time. This has been reflected in many ways, but one such outstanding example occurred when a delegation led by me was in London, on our way back home from Washington.",
    "We were staying at a hotel where we found Mr. E. L.B. Hurulle, a Senior Minister also staying. We had met him in the lobby and spoken with him a few times. We happened to be in London, because we always made use of the opportunity of passing through London to Washington and back in order to have extensive discussions with our lawyers. When importing and shipping a large tonnage of food commodities, inevitably disputes arose. Some of these were settled amicably and by mutual agreement. But over some, we had to go in for arbitration in London, and some cases involved going to Court.",
    "The Attorney-General in Sri Lanka could not handle all these matters himself. The volume was too great. We had therefore to have lawyers on the spot in London. Whilst in London, we usually spent about five to six working days sitting down with our lawyers and discussing each case coming up for trial or arbitration. Our departmental legal advisor brought with him 20-30 files, each of which constituted a dispute or a case.",
    "Sometimes our Commercial Counselor in the High Commission joined our discussions, because he was our liaison with the lawyers on a regular basis. We kept him regularly posted with the facts of the various cases. Sometimes we had to see specialized counsel at consultations, in their chambers. When the discussions start we spent virtually a full working day with the lawyers, having a sandwich lunch at the conference table. Occasionally, when time permitted, we were taken out to a nearby pub for lunch.",
    "Sometimes, the fact that we are in London gets around and then we get invited for lunch and sometimes dinner. Most luncheon invitations, we had to decline because of our work. There was one however, during this particular visit, that we couldn\u2019t decline. This was a joint invitation from the major sugar trading firms, with which we had been doing business for a long time. This was to be a jointly hosted lunch by the Managing Directors of these companies.",
    "On the one hand it would have been bad form for us to have declined. On the other, there was a distinct mutual advantage in meeting at this level, and exchanging views and discussing any problems. One also always learn at these discussions. We had been informed that they would send a car to pick us up at the hotel at 12 noon on the day of the lunch. This was to be a formal lounge suit affair. We were down in the lobby at about ten minutes to twelve to find Mr. Hurulle seated there. He was more casually dressed.",
    "We exchanged pleasantries and were standing around chatting, when an old Ford Cortina drew up, somebody waved, Mr. Hurulle waved back, smiled at us and went with his host. The time was about three minutes to twelve. Sharp at noon, a splendid looking Rolls-Royce drew up and a tall liveried chauffeur strode to the front desk. We were lost, admiring the car, when I heard my name mentioned. I looked back and discovered that the Rolls-Royce was the car that had been sent to pick us up. On the way, the driver kept reporting as to where we were, over a radio communication system.",
    "We all had the same thought. What would have been the impression created in Minister Hurulle\u2019s mind, had he not left before we left and witnessed the splendour in which we were going to travel. We were certain that he would have gone back to Colombo and reported that we were living it up in London, and that Rolls-Royces were coming to pick us up. Most things when taken out of context would be damaging. But this would have been devastating. Explanations could come later. By that time lasting impressions could be generated and unfortunate suspicions aroused. Only a matter of three minutes saved us from the possibility of all these.",
    "The lunch itself went off quite well. The heads of the sugar trading companies informed us that we enjoyed what they called Triple A status in the London sugar market. We did not know this. When we inquired what it meant they said that it meant that if we were to lift a phone in the Ministry in Colombo and say that we required a sugar cargo of 10,000 tons, they would ship it even without the opening of an L.C. They said that very few international customers enjoyed such a status. It was gratify ing to learn of this. I was tempted to tell them however, that their Rolls-Royce could have resulted in our relegation to triple F status in the Colombo market of innuendo and gossip.",
    "Towards the end of 1981, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Sri Lanka, and we fulfilled the customary duty of attending the garden party hosted by President and Mrs. Jayewardene. In a small society like Sri Lanka, such occasions can be a waste of time, since you happen to meet almost the same people most of the time. At the same time, they are important from the point of view of upholding settled international political social and diplomatic standards.",
    "In November 1981, 1 was appointed to the Board of Directors of the People\u2019s Bank. This was in my capacity as Secretary, Cooperatives. As was well known, the People\u2019s Bank had its genesis in the Co-operative movement, and continued to have a special relationship with the movement. I was also appointed to the Rural Credit Advisory Board of the Central Bank, a Board chaired by the Governor. These appointments meant more work and more time.",
    "In January 1982, I had to go to South Korea. This was in my capacity as a Director of the Ceylon Shipping Corporation. One day, Mr. Caspersz, the Chairman of the Corporation, told me in his own inimitable style, \u201cDharmasiri, we want you to go to South Korea, attend a lunch, reply to a toast, drink a glass of champagne and come back.\u201d I asked \u201cSince when has the government resorted to such extravagance?\u201d The fact was. one of our container vessels, \u201cLanka Siri\u201d built in a Korean shipyard was ready for delivery. My job was to go and formally accept it. The Minister of Food and the Minister of Shipping had agreed that I should go and the President had approved it.",
    "I left for Seoul on January 31, accompanied by Mrs. Geetha Wijeyapala, Manager Legal and Insurance of the Shipping Corporation. The technical people had gone ahead and were already in Seoul. Sea trials of the ship were taking place. The expectation was that all the technical aspects would have been satisfactorily concluded, paving the way for the formal acceptance of the ship.",
    "When I met the technical officers in Seoul however, I was not reassured by the manner they spoke. I did not detect a confident assertion from them after the conclusion of the sea trials that the ship was completely and fully sea-worthy and that I could proceed to accept it. They were hedging my questions.",
    "Therefore, I went on probing, until it emerged that \u201cA few matters\u201d needed attention. At this point, I made it quite clear to all that I was not prepared to accept a ship which was not complete in all respects. We now had to go to Pusan where the ship had been built. In over a four hour Journey from Seoul by train, we saw something of the countryside. South Korea was a mountainous country with relatively limited arable land. The cold during this time of the year was intense, particularly to those who had come from a warm tropical climate. One had however to admire what the Koreans had achieved, in spite of war and an inhospitable terrain. This was obviously due to their energy, their industry and their focus. During this time..",
    "There was still a curfew on after midnight for security reasons. After the trauma of the war, there was not unnaturally an obsession with security. Many important figures of government, from the President downwards, were figures with a military background. The people appeared to be obedient and disciplined. Their capacity for work seemed to be remarkable.",
    "Both in Seoul and Pusan I had the experience of going down for breakfast at about 6.45 a.m. and being unable to find a seat in the quite large coffee shops in the hotels. At practically every table there were lounge suit clad businessmen with their brief cases opened, calculators, note pads and reams of documents spread out, avidly engrossed in business discussions. I had never seen such a sight of mass business discussions, at such an early hour anywhere else in the world. We were told that if we wished to have undelayed seating, 5.45 a.m. was a better time than 6.45 a.m!",
    "Whilst in Pusan I had extensive discussions with our officers as well as representatives of the ship building firm and others. Things were that much more difficult for us because we did not at the time have an Embassy in South Korea. I had therefore to do a lot of drafting by hand, whilst the Legal and Insurance Manager kept hand written minutes of our various discussions.",
    "By now the Korean parties were getting frantic, because the day had been fixed for the acceptance of the vessel and invitations had gone out to important people. My refusal to accept the vessel without further investigation was heading towards delay and loss of face for them. I sympathized but could not compromise. I had also discussed the whole matter in detail with our Legal and Insurance Manager who fully supported me.",
    "I informed the technical people, that I would accept the ship as it was, only if they vouched in writing to me that they certify it was complete in all respects and that they recommend its formal acceptance. This they could not do. It was not easy to get through to Colombo, but I managed to speak to Mr. Caspersz on at least two occasions over an unclear line. He thought, we should accept the ship subject to an understanding to rectify defects. I disagreed. The stability of the vessel was in doubt, and this to me was fundamental, and once we accepted the vessel the problem was going to be with us.",
    "I was not prepared to accept on this basis. Anybody else could do so. The whole thing had turned into a nightmare. We were isolated in Pusan, with no comfort or assistance from an Embassy. In the meantime, the Koreans were exerting heavy pressure on us to accept the ship on deadline. They appeared to be both upset and angry. I got our whole team together and made my position very clear. They had to agree that the main technical defects should be remedied and the contract amended.",
    "I also telephoned Norway and spoke to our former consultants on shipping and fortified myself with their advice. I further contacted some UNDP. experts on shipping whom I had previously met. As a result of all this, it was decided to add the necessary ballast to stabilize the vessel fully. The Koreans commenced work on this immediately. But I wanted to see for myself. Therefore, one morning in the biting cold I boarded a launch with the technical officers and went on board the vessel to see the work in progress.",
    "Some kind of large concrete blocks were being added to a part of the ship. By now it was clear that the ceremonial handing over could not take place on the scheduled date. The invitations would have to be cancelled. I was obviously not the most popular person with the Koreans, and the isolation, hard work and stress was perhaps making me a bit paranoid. Sometimes, the telephone by my bedside rang during the dead of night, when I was fast asleep. But when I lifted the receiver there was total silence.",
    "I perhaps imagined that someone was trying to open my bedroom door. This was disturbing and I felt somewhat better after positioning against the door, a heavy armchair which was in my room.",
    "In the end, there was no lunch and no champagne. The delivery of the vessel was postponed. I obtained a written guarantee on the ultimate stability of the vessel, from the ship builders. The letter of guarantee backed by a bank guarantee included the provision that any adjustments deemed necessary by the Classification Society would be made at their expense.",
    "There also remained the question of some minor items of work. A separate agreement was signed that in respect of this work, both sides would jointly itemize and price this work, after which the Koreans would pay us that sum, so that we could get this work done in Colombo or elsewhere. Through all this, Geetha, the Legal and Insurance Manager was an unfailing source of competence and strength. It was fortunate that she came on this visit.",
    "Thus ended for me the virtual saga of my first visit to South Korea. The reward lay in the satisfaction of overcoming numerous unforeseen obstacles, working hard, keeping one\u2019s nerve and achieving a solution. There was an additional reward of Ministerial appreciation. My colleagues in the Ministry of Trade and Shipping told me, that on reading my report, Minister Lalith Athulathmudali .said, \u201cThank God, we sent Dharmasiri.\u201d",
    "I had returned from the visit to South Korea and had barely settled down to work, when Lakshman de Mel rang me from the Trade Ministry, towards the middle of March 1982 and informed me that he and I with one or two others will have to go to China almost immediately, because the government had decided to purchase some extra rice for the buffer. This was completely unexpected, and our guess was that the government was thinking of some form of elections including perhaps a Presidential election, and wanted to ensure the availability of adequate food stocks. We already had the insurance of a buffer. This was going to be reinsurance.",
    "Therefore, a delegation led by Lakshman, and consisting of Mr. Pulendiran, the Food Commissioner; Laurie Mariadasan, Director of Commerce; Mr. Dissanayake, Deputy Director Fiscal Policy, Ministry of Finance and myself left on March 21. The Chinese too, had to arrange this visit at very short notice. We were to have general discussions on food supplies and specifically negotiate for the purchase of 100,000 metric tons of rice.",
    "Negotiations did not go as smoothly as before. The Chinese were really not prepared for this sudden visit. They did not have the quantity we needed in surplus with them. They therefore had to talk to Burma in order to procure stocks to meet the shortfall. The negotiation became tripartite. Beyond a point, the Chinese did not have control of the Burmese price. Rice shipped from Burma would cost us less due to the cheaper freight. We had to see that this advantage was not nullified in the overall result.",
    "The negotiations did not go on, morning and afternoon. This was not the Chinese practice. There were sometimes half day breaks. On this particular occasion, these breaks sometimes even took longer because the Chinese had to consult the Burmese and await a reply from there. All in all, things dragged on. The Chinese, as was customary had arranged for our delegation to be flown out to the South-Western City of Kunming, known as the City of \u201cEternal Spring\u201d close to the Burmese border, after the negotiations, for us to spend a few days there. The deadline for departure was now rapidly approaching, and we were still haggling over the price. We were to leave Beijing on March 27, but by the morning of the 26th, we had not yet reached agreement. Mr. Lakshman de Mel and I decided to stay on, and if necessary cancel the visit to Kunming.",
