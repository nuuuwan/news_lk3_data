    "Announces diversification into hospitality sector with acquisition of Sigiri Asna Nature Resort and Spa",
    "Arcade of Aluminium, a leading provider of aluminium products in Sri Lanka, recently hosted its 15th annual get-together, themed \u201cChampions of Arcade\u201d, at Waters Edge.",
    "The event honoured the long-standing customers and key suppliers, acknowledging their continuous trust and support, and celebrating their shared journey towards achieving greater milestones in the industry together.",
    "Speaking at the event, Arcade of Aluminium Ltd., Managing Director Heshan Padukka reflected on the company\u2019s remarkable journey, noting how it began with a small team of five in 2010 and grew into a trusted market leader by consistently delivering products that exceed industry standards.",
    "Regarding the theme, \u201cChampions of Arcade\u201d, he explained, \u201cOur customers and suppliers are the true champions driving the success of Arcade of Aluminium. They are the ones who take our products to the end-user, and this theme was the best way to honour our patrons for the support given to us throughout the years.\u201d",
    "Sharing the company\u2019s core strategy for earning customer trust, Padukka said their approach has always been to prioritise the needs of the end-user. \u201cWe have been known as a brand that upholds its promises, known for genuine quality and originality,\u201d he stated, adding that when it comes to product standards, durability is a key focus.",
    "Padukka addressed a common concern in the market, noting that while some fabricators and other suppliers offer products with warranties up to three years, many fail to uphold their promises when customers make a claim. He explained that this is often due to a lack of proper product standard certification.",
    "As a solution, Arcade of Aluminium introduced its own A+ quality assurance certification, making it Sri Lanka\u2019s very first company to develop and sell products under its own certified brand.",
    "Tailored to meet local demands, the A+ line offers a comprehensive range of high-quality accessories and components. To prove its commitment to customer satisfaction and long-term reliability, Arcade of Aluminium offered a 10-year warranty for their products, which included an exclusive two-year full-replacement policy.",
    "He stated that the company\u2019s warranty policy is a first in the Sri Lankan market, setting a new benchmark for customer trust and product reliability. He added that if a product, such as a cladding sheet, experiences an issue within two years, the company will provide a new sheet along with the necessary labour and accessories for re-installation.",
    "\u201cWe believe our customers kept faith in us, and we wanted to prove that their trust was well-placed,\u201d he added, affirming the company\u2019s dedication to customer satisfaction and long-term reliability.",
    "During the event, Arcade of Aluminium revealed its expansion into a new sector with the acquisition of the Sigiri Asna Nature Resort and Spa. This marks a key step away from the company\u2019s core business in building and construction. As part of this move, the resort, which combines modern amenities with Sri Lanka\u2019s beautiful natural setting, will offer exclusive discounts to Arcade of Aluminium customers for their stays.",
    "Speaking about the company\u2019s key alliances, Padukka mentioned that Arcade of Aluminium joined hands with Alumex PLC and quickly became a leading supplier of Alumex products in Sri Lanka. Within three years, the company expanded its operations and opened multiple branches, solidifying its industry leadership. Padukka also affirmed that Alumex remains the company\u2019s sole supplier for aluminium, highlighting their long-standing partnership.",
    "In addition to its local partnership, Padukka highlighted Arcade of Aluminium\u2019s alliances with key international brands. He noted that the company partners with Eurobond Euro Panel Products Limited for advanced cladding materials and Ferroli Gypsheet LLP for premium gypsum products.",
    "Looking ahead, Padukka stated that the company is focused on innovation and continuous growth. He noted that Arcade of Aluminium plans to maintain its position as an industry leader by consistently investing in advanced technology and providing training for its team to meet the evolving demands of the aluminium, glass, and accessory industries.",
    "Padukka also expressed his sincere gratitude to the company\u2019s partners and customers. \u201cYour support, trust, and loyalty have been the driving forces behind our success,\u201d he stated. \u201cWithout your partnership, none of this would have been possible, and we look forward to continuing this incredible journey. We will continue to hold annual get-togethers to honour your loyalty and thank you for choosing us as your partner.\u201d",
    "The \u201cArcade of Champions\u201d get-together provided a unique opportunity to connect and strengthen relationships with the company\u2019s customers. Padukka encouraged attendees to visit Alumex branches for guidance on product innovation and necessary training, stating that the company\u2019s goal is to uplift the skills of apprentices, fabricators, and consultants within the building and construction industry.",
    "He stated that Alumex will soon introduce a highly anticipated new product. The company\u2019s focus is in response to a growing demand for durable and superior aluminium solutions. The new product is expected to set a new standard in the industry, offering customers enhanced quality and a diverse range of finishes.",
    "International suppliers also joined the stage to show their appreciation, highlighting their long-standing partnerships with Arcade of Aluminium.",
    "Ferroli Gypsheet LLP Chief Sales Director Amish Tankariya said that his company specialises in manufacturing premium gypsum boards, plaster, and related accessories. He noted that their products are crafted to the highest standards and that Arcade of Aluminium ensures they reach customers, making them a trusted choice for both residential and commercial projects in Sri Lanka.",
    "Eurobond Panel Products Ltd., Director Divyam Shah, shared a brief overview of his brand, stating it is a global leader in aluminium composite panels (ACPs), renowned for delivering high-quality, durable cladding solutions.",
    "Speaking about their innovative products, Shah explained that the company developed exclusive products, including fire-retardant Eurocomb panels and self-healing zinc options, in response to growing concerns about fire-related accidents. As the sole agent in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Arcade of Aluminium provides its premium products to customers with an international warranty.",
    "Due to its vast customer base, Arcade of Aluminium held its 15th anniversary celebration as a two-part event. The second edition of the celebration was filled with celebrity performances, entertainment, food, and drinks.",
    "The main highlight was the prize distribution, where customers were awarded based on the volume of products they had purchased.",
    "The company announced the lucky winners for each category: First place: The five-day, six-night Egypt Tour had 17 lucky winners; Second place: The three-day, four-night Bali Tour had 9 lucky winners; Third place: The five-day, six-night Thailand Tour had 21 lucky winners; Fourth place: The one-night All-Inclusive Cruise Tour had 15 lucky winners; and Fifth place: The six-day, five-night, full-board Five-Star Hotel Stay had 20 lucky winners."
