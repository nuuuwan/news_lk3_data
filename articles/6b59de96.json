    "The Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs, Ananda Wijepala assured that it is not permissible to hold commemoration events associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization.",
    "The Minister emphasized that, as the LTTE remains a proscribed organization in Sri Lanka, any celebrations featuring the banned organization\u2019s symbols, uniforms, or images of its members are strictly prohibited.",
    "However, Minister Wijepala clarified that there is no restriction on people of the Northern Province commemorating their relatives who have died during the war.",
    "\u201cLegally, individuals are allowed to commemorate the deaths of their relatives. However, it is not allowed to hold \u2018Mahaviru\u2019 celebrations to glorify LTTE members or use their images under the LTTE logo. The LTTE remains a proscribed organization under the country\u2019s laws\u201d, the Minister said.",
    "Furthermore, he added: \u201cWhile people from any part of the country\u2014North, West, South, or East\u2014have the right to commemorate their deceased loved ones, I would like to emphasize that the law does not allow celebrations linked to the LTTE. Unfortunately, at times, some people in the North have misinterpreted these commemorations. We stress that there is no space for any form of celebrations glorifying the LTTE\u201d.",
