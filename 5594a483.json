    "Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva today said that he\u00a0is willing to accept receiving LTTE ships from Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu as long as India permits.",
    "He said Sri Lanka is ready to start the ferry service between South India (Pondicherry) and Kankesanthurai (KKS) at any time, but the reason for the delay in starting the service is due to India not granting permission.",
    "Addressing the media, he said there is a joint committee according to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that was signed between the two countries in 2011.",
    "\"There has been no issues so far, but we want the ferry service. We put up the passenger terminal and other facilities at the KKS harbour. According to the latest communication we had with India, they said that they can start the ferry service only from Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu and not from any other port,\" the minister said.",
    "\"According to the security assessment with India, Sri Lanka has no issues. Whoever approves this project, we will accept it,\" he said.",
    "\"Ferry operators have to contact the Indian government, prove their credentials and their genuineness, and get permission from India to start the ferry from Nagapattinam. From the moment the Indian government gives the green light, we will grant approval for receiving any ship or any person from India,\" he said.",
    "The Minister requested the ferry operators to come to India and recognize them as ferry operators.",
    "\"The Indian High Commissioner claimed that they have received fifteen applications from ferry operators. There would be some selection process in India. We have no issues if the Indian government approves all 15 applications for ferry operators, Minister de Silva said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
