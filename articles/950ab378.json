    "Contributed to promoting friendly relations, mutual understanding and economic exchange between Japan and Sri Lanka",

As President of JASTECA from 2013, he played a key role in creating new guidelines for CSR Sustainability Awards, organising seminars on Japanese management, and advocating for the introduction of Japanese management practices in Sri Lanka. His efforts were recognised during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to Sri Lanka in September 2014, where a joint statement by the two state leaders praised JASTECA, highlighting its role in promoting Japanese management practices in Sri Lanka and enhancing bilateral cooperation. This recognition has led to an increased awareness and trust in Japanese management practices in Sri Lanka, ultimately contributing to the positive image of Japan.",

Despite challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant introduced the first Japanese food delivery service in Sri Lanka, supporting the culinary needs of Japanese residents. Furthermore, it hosted events to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Japan-Sri Lanka diplomatic relations in 2022, showcasing the appeal of Japanese cuisine to a wide audience.",
    "The Embassy of Japan expressed its heartfelt congratulations to Wickramanayake and Edirisinghe on the decoration of the Orders, with sincere appreciation for their remarkable dedication to the cause of promoting friendly relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka."
