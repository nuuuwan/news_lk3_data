  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers approved paying the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 welfare allowances mentioned in the gazette notification published at present for all three categories who were already obtaining benefits up to now.",
    "The Government has published name lists of around two million individuals who have been identified for the implementation of the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 welfare benefits payment scheme.",
    "The proposal to this effect submitted by President in his capacity as the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Minister was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday.",
    "The scheme aims to provide welfare benefits to senior citizens, individuals receiving kidney disease allowance due to unidentified circumstances and differently-abled persons receiving allowances. The lists have been published at Divisional Secretariat divisions and Grama Niladhari divisions to allow for appeals and objections to be submitted. Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena stated that 968,000 appeals have been received, but over 600,000 of them are from individuals who are already receiving benefits.",
    "\u201cWe understand that they have submitted these appeals because they feel that the amount offered is not sufficient,\u201d he said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday. Gunawardena said the President has advised to accommodate all deserving individuals who require assistance to be included in the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 welfare benefit scheme, despite exceeding the deadline for submissions.",
    "He also noted that a total of 17,500 petitions have been submitted, noting that unsuitable candidates were selected for the program.",
    "\u201cThe Government is working to ensure that the selection process is fair and that those who are truly in need of assistance are able to receive it. Thus, I urge public not to jeopardise the process,\u201d he added.",
    "Separately, State Finance Minister Sheehan Semasinghe said instructions have been given to Divisional Secretariats and Provincial Councils to prioritise the entry of direct appeals and objections into the system of the Welfare Benefit Board to ensure that everyone\u2019s grievances are heard and addressed."
