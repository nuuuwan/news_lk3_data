    "JICA is set to initiate a new technical cooperation project early next year to support Sri Lanka to improve fecal sludge management.",
    "Record of Discussion of this project was concluded between S. Alokabandara, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, Local Government and Labour and YAMADA Tetsuya, Chief Representative of JICA Sri Lanka Office on 15th October 2024.",
    "Currently, Sri Lanka faces various challenges related to fecal sludge management. Due to limited fecal sludge treatment plants, gully bowser disposes sludge to open environment, which leads to environment degradation and threaten public health. Fecal sludge collected is not treated as a reusable resource on most occasions, although mixing this waste can be effective to facilitate beneficial use of biosolids for sustainable agriculture due to the lack of standards and technical capacities.",
    "This four-year project, entitled \u201cProject for Improvement of Fecal Sludge Management\u201d aims to improve sustainable systems for fecal sludge management and biosolids production adapted local and municipal conditions. The project plans to support in managing fecal sludge service chains and produce biosolids according to the developed technical guideline in selected Local Authorities, in drafting standard on biosolids production, and in disseminating relevant by-laws on sustainable fecal sludge management for Local Authorities.",

In addition to the contributions to sanitation and environment protection, this project will also contribute to Sri Lanka\u2019s next efforts toward circular economy by exploring possibility of producing biosolids from fecal sludges in a safe manner.",
