Also, he added that since the electronic passport (E-Passport) is to be introduced by the end of October, there is a possibility to request the new e- passport from some countries and accordingly, the department requests the non-essential public to refrain from getting passports.",
    "The Chair of the Committee pointed out that people should be informed about this as much as possible. However, the Chair also emphasized that it is the responsibility of the Immigration and Emigration Department to issue the requested passports so that the people are not inconvenienced, as it is the right of the people to get passports after paying money.

    "This new bill has been prepared by amending the issue of travel documents, the Immigrants and Emigrants Act and the Passport (Regulation) and Exit Permit Act, No. 53 of 1971 to suit the current social and technological situation. He also mentioned that since this bill has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the relevant determination has been announced to the Parliament, the related amendments will be made.",
