    "The electricity supply to Mihintale sacred city has been disconnected last morning due to non payment of due arrears.",
    "Chief Incumbent of Mihintale Rajamaha Vihara Ven. Walawahengunawewe Dhammarathana Thera said it was being politically victimized for his steadiness in speech.",
    "\u201cThe Electricity Board has taken this step at a time when a massive development project is in progress at the Minintale sacred city. The shrine rooms, the police post, and the archaeological sites in the area will be in the dark. The government should provide immediate protection to the archaeological site if the power supply is disconnected. The resident monks of the temple will be left without water. We are not in a position to pay Rs.4.1 million as claimed by the CEB,\u201d the Ven. Thera said.",
    "He requested the CEB to install separate meters for the living quarters of the monks which could be paid.",
    "Meanwhile, Anuradhapura CEB Regional Engineer J.M.F. Jayawardene said the Mihintale temple has run into arrears of electricity bills amounting to Rs. 4.1 million since 2022 and that the Chief Incumbent had been requested to settle this. He said the CEB had to disconnect the power supply yesterday at 11.00 pm after prior notice."
