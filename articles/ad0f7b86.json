    "The 12th Edition of annual Indian Navy (IN) - Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) bilateral maritime exercise SLINEX-2025 is scheduled at Colombo from 14 to 18 August.",
    "The exercise will be conducted in two phases; the Harbour Phase at Colombo from 14 to 16 August followed by Sea Phase from 17 to 18 August off Colombo. The Indian Navy will be represented by INS Jyoti (Fleet Tanker) and INS Rana (Destroyer) whist Sri Lanka Navy will have SLNS Vijayabahu (Advance Offshore Patrol Vessel) and SLNS Sayura (OPV). In addition, Sri Lanka Air Force BEL 412 helicopters would also participate in the exercise.",
    "The exercise will also have the Special Forces of the two navies undertake the IN-SLN SF exercise. The previous edition of SLINEX was conducted in Visakhapatnam from 17 to 20 December 2024.",
    "SLINEX-2025 aims to enhance inter-operability, improve mutual understanding and exchange best practices/ procedures in multi-faceted maritime operations between both navies. The Harbour Phase would include sports fixtures, yoga sessions, and cultural events which would provide an opportunity for personnel from both navies to learn from each other, re-enforce shared values and build bonds of friendship and camaraderie. Sri Lanka Navy Operations Director General Rear Admiral B. Liyanagamage, INS Jyoti Commanding Officer Captain Chetan R. Upadhayaya, and INS Rana Commanding Officer Captain K.P. Sreesan along with High Commission of India Defence Adviser Captain Anand Mukundan, would participate in the opening ceremony of SLINEX-2025.",
    "Harbour training activities, SME interaction and training at HARD simulator, will also be progressed during SLINEX-2025. The Sea Phase would include exercises in multi dimensions like surface firing, tactical manoeuvres, seamanship evolutions, helicopter operations including cross deck flying, Search and Rescue, and Special Forces operations at sea, which will further enhance the high degree of inter-operability already established between the two friendly navies.",
    "It may be recalled that, the Indian navy had earlier deployed Dornier maritime patrol aircraft on lease. The aircraft in the past three years enhanced the maritime surveillance capability of Sri Lanka. The aircraft has recently returned to India on completion of the deployment. Indian Naval Ship Rana also entered Trincomalee on 11 August for de-induction of Dornier ground support equipment and spares prior proceeding to Colombo for SLINEX-2025.",
    "SLINEX series of exercise exemplifies the deep engagement between India and Sri Lanka which has strengthened mutual cooperation in the maritime domain. Interaction between the SLN and IN has also grown significantly in recent years, in consonance with India\u2019s policy of \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s vision of \u2018Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR)\u2019."
