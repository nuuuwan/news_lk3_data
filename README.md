### Eliminating political corruption: Key to our recovery

Sri Lanka is grappling with a severe cost-of-living crisis rooted in pervasive political corruption. Political intermediaries profit at every stage, shifting the burden onto consumers. The economy has plummeted due to corrupt leaders using the Government to further personal agendas and misusing public funds on unproductive projects while simultaneously selling national assets and depleting public reserves. Under such deceptive governance, our future hard work and increased taxes will be in vain, offering no relief to ordinary citizens as corrupt politicians continue to siphon off surplus funds.

“What we know about how these children are being treated is unacceptable, but what we don’t know could be even worse.” – Jason Lee, Save the Children

To put things in perspective. Figures from widely reported independent sources indicate, as of today, the number of Palestinians – Muslims, Christians and others – killed total to 37,000. Of this, the number of children killed are 13,800. The total number injured is 75,000 and the attacks are continuing. The ceasefire approved by the Security Council in June has been conveniently forgotten. The arrest warrant against Netanyahu and his other accomplices in war crimes has been tactically delayed.

### A time to ponder; a time for change?

More than at any time in the past those in whose hands lies the power to choose their leaders will also decide their own futures and that of their children – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

There has never been as important a period in the history of Sri Lanka as will be the next few months. The country is still reeling under the financial and economic battering of two years ago. As per the latest statistics the country’s debt burden has ticked over the $ 100 billion mark – including the backlog of interest. Meanwhile, a deceptive sense of calm and even spots of prosperity – for some – seem to prevail on the surface disguising strong undercurrents of turmoil.

This turmoil is more than just a single facet. One could debate which of them is worse but the combination is a deadly cocktail which unless mitigated has the potential to cripple the country and the lives of its citizens for decades to come. Yet, the solution to this complex situation lies – literally – in the hands of the stakeholders.

Having entered the House of Commons in May 2015, it has taken Keir Starmer less than a decade to climb what Benjamin Disraeli, once famously described as the “greasy pole” of British politics. Britain now has a new government after Labour Party won a landslide victory in last Thursday’s election, winning 412 seats and a huge 172-seat majority in parliament. While 2019’s general election was largely a story of two parties, this time national ballot led to historic gains for the Lib Dems, the Greens and Reform UK. The victories by pro-Gaza independent candidates, among them ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dealt blows to some of Westminster’s most prominent MPs. The rise of the “populist” Reform UK Party led by Nigel Farage, particularly had leaders of the more established political outfits rattled. (Interestingly the biggest donor to this party was a British entrepreneur with Sri Lankan heritage). Labour has also regained its dominance in Scotland, and Wales too.

Dominic Jeeva, born to Joseph and Maryamma on June 27, 1927, in Jaffna, launched the arts and literary monthly magazine, Mallikai in 1966. He continued its publication until 2012, serving as its editor and publisher. Through his unwavering self-effort in that endeavour, he became widely known as Mallikai Jeeva.

The name “Mallikai Jeeva” resonated across Sri Lanka, among Tamil, Sinhala, and Muslim literary circles. Born into a modest middle-class family and deprived of opportunities for higher education, Dominic Jeeva became a self-taught scholar through the experience he gained through his extensive reading of works by intellectuals and progressive writers. His tireless contributions significantly advanced Tamil literature in Eelam. Dominic Jeeva passed away at the age of 93.

Had he lived a few more years, he would have reached the centennial mark. This past June 27th, he would have turned 97. Although he is no more, his memory remains everlasting!
