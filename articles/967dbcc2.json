  "original_body_lines": [
    "India\u2019s ruling party is projected to have lost two key provincial elections to the main opposition Congress party and its allies, exit polls showed, suggesting another setback after the party fared poorly in national elections.",
    "Local media reported that Congress had a clear advantage in exit polls in the northern state of Haryana, indicating an end to a decade of rule by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state. The opposition also held an edge in the Himalayan territory of Jammu and Kashmir.",
    "The two elections were held in phases that ended on Saturday. Votes will be counted on Tuesday and results will be announced the same day. The exit poll results were released late on Saturday.",
    "Exit polls, conducted by private polling firms including TV broadcasters, have a patchy record in India, which analysts say poses a particular challenge due to its large and diverse voting population.",
    "The exit polls had projected Modi\u2019s BJP would win a large majority in the general election in June, but it fell short and had to depend on regional parties to secure a majority and form a coalition government.",
    "The two Indian territories are the first to go to the polls since the national elections.",
    "India\u2019s industrial hub of Maharashtra and the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, next up in provincial elections, are awaiting the announcement of poll dates that are expected to be in November.",
    "The Jammu and Kashmir election was the first in a decade in the Himalayan region, which has endured years of militant violence. It is India\u2019s only Muslim-majority territory and has been at the centre of a dispute with neighbouring Pakistan since 1947.",
    "Its status as a special semi-autonomous entity was revoked in 2019 by Modi\u2019s government, which says the move has helped to restore normalcy in the area and boosted development."
