Responding to an urgent request, Anutin left Parliament and flew two surgeons from Chulalongkorn University to Loei.

The organs—a heart, liver, pancreas, two kidneys, and two eyes—were donated by the family of a 19-year-old man who died following a local brawl.

### The US government is officially closed

*2025-10-01 09:51:03* · [`adalk`](https://www.ada.lk/international/ඇමෙරිකානු-රජය-නිල-වශයෙන්-වසා-දැමෙයි/3-418832) · `si`

The US Federal Government has officially closed. The government has to be officially closed due to the Awarding of Eleenming. This is the first time a US government has been officially closed after 2019.

The leaders of the United States personally emphasize that they should not be responsible for the shortage of funds: Republican Party insists that the Democratic Party should agree to extend the current funds for another seven weeks.

The Democratic Party has rejected the main relief to vote for his votes to pass any funding step in the Senate. Senators have a deep uncertainty of how long the shutdown can last.

The Senate is to vote again on the funding plan. The closing of the government means leave of lack of thousands of federal workers, and others who are considered essential will continue to report to work.

But most people are not paid until the end of this messy. Others, however, will continue to collect salaries as they do not fund their jobs through the annual discharge of Congress.

It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material

The tragedy that occurred at internationally famed Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks on the spot and injuring six other Bikkus is another heartrending news that shocked the entire Sri Lanka within the last one month. From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.

Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.
