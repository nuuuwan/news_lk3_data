  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the appointment of Capt. Daminda Rambukwella as the new Director General and Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL), a move that has already stirred controversy in political and professional circles.",
    "Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Eng. Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku officially handed over the letter of appointment to Rambukwella yesterday at the Ministry premises.",
    "Rambukwella is an aviation professional with over 25 years of experience.",
    "However, the decision has sparked debate over the selection process and questions about political influence. Both Rambukwella and another shortlisted candidate, Primal De Silva, are widely seen as loyalists of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, raising concerns over whether merit or political ties guided the final outcome.",
    "Industry insiders point out that at least two applicants with strong international aviation credentials and unblemished track records were excluded from even being called for interviews. The panel comprising Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake, Deputy Minister Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku, CAASL Chairman Sunil Jayaratne, and a Ministry Additional Secretary only interviewed three candidates\u2014Acting Director General Rehan Wanniappa, Primal De Silva, and Rambukwella.",
    "Wanniappa, despite serving in the role, is believed to have been side-lined, leaving the other two in the running.",
    "Critics argue that Rambukwella\u2019s rise reflects less on technical competence and more on political proximity. His close ties to influential figures, particularly Defence Ministry Secretary and former Air Force colleague Sampath Thuyacontha, are well known. In fact, when Rambukwella married, none other than former President Mahinda Rajapaksa stood as a witness at the ceremony, a symbolic connection that continues to fuel speculation about patronage.",
    "The ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government, which came to power pledging to dismantle entrenched political networks, now faces accusations of perpetuating the very system it vowed to reform.",
    "Aviation professionals warn that the DGCA post demands not only technical expertise, but also unimpeachable integrity, given its role in ensuring safety, regulatory oversight and public confidence in civil aviation."
