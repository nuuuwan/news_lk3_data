### Sri Lanka reports US$706mn current account surplus amid financial outflows

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has recorded a 706 million US dollar current account surplus in the first quarter of 2024 as the financial account recorded a deficit amid private and official debt repayments and reserve collections, data show.

Sri Lanka has recorded current account surpluses, since the last quarter of 2022 when monetary stability is reached.

The current account is a mirror image of the financial and capital accounts, subject to errors and omissions.

The way external accounting is calculated, only the balance of payments surplus and deficit (as defined) can be accurately measured.

Whether there is a balance of payments deficit or surplus depends on the note-issue activities of the central bank.

When money is printed through reverse repo or standing facilities, regardless of a budget deficit or surplus, there are foreign exchange shortages, making it difficult to make foreign payments, especially in the capital account, leading to a run down of reserve and eventual default.

“They said the agreements signed by the government would not be presented tomorrow. We noted that though the government said they had signed those agreements, they actually hadn’t. There are three agreements. Two of them have been signed. The third hasn’t been signed yet.

“There is no point having a debate without the third agreement, beacause it is the third agreement that reveals the whole picture,” said Kiriella.

### Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

*2024-07-01 23:21:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imputed-rental-income-tax-Gateway-to-corruption-on-a-massive-scale/4-763721) · `en`

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an “imputed rental income” on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of “imputed rental income” is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new “imputed rental income” is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

### When one thing leads to nothing

*2024-07-01 23:07:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/When-one-thing-leads-to-nothing/4-763718) · `en`

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, “To cross the river, feel for the stones.”

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, “Let the robber barons come.”

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the world’s factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.

(Text of Address  Delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the “Victory through Unity” (Ekwa Jayagamu) Held at the Matara Fort Grounds on 30 June 2024)

“I have safely brought the Titanic, entrusted to me, to port. While other captains fled from the iceberg, we faced a critical decision: sink or navigate to safety. Now that we’ve reached port, the question is what to do next with this ship. We must decide whether to refurbish it for the next 50-100 years or hand it over in its current state to a fleeing captain.

When I arrived here today, memories of the hardships faced by the Matara people flooded back. I vividly recall spending the Sinhala New Year 2022 in Kamburupitiya, where a filling station near my hotel was constantly crowded with long queues of vehicles. Witnessing the people’s suffering and frustration, I resolved that such scenes must not recur in our country.

The latest complaint is that the bilateral debt was postponed, not forgiven partially. Over the past two years, it was explained many times that debt restructuring can take many forms: a haircut (or the reduction of the principal due); adjustment of the payment period; and changes to the interest charged. In all cases, the creditor takes a hit. In all cases, the debtor does not get off scot-free. For debt restructuring to work, both sides must lose; both sides must gain.

### Palestinian militants fire rockets into Israel, tanks advance in Gaza

The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said.

The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, said its fighters fired rockets towards several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to “the crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian people”.

The volley of around 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed militants still possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it.

Violence also flared on Monday in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said a woman and a boy were killed in the city of Tulkarm during an operation by Israeli forces. A day earlier, an Israeli strike in the same area killed an Islamic Jihad member.
