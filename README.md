Hi! Since I haven’t given my readers any beauty tips, with the potato as the main base, I thought of bringing the potato into the scene this week.

What’s more, potatoes are freely available, so you won’t have any hassle going searching for this vegetable which is a favourite at most homes.

You will need 02 teaspoons potato juice, 02 teaspoons lemon juice and ½ teaspoon honey (optional)

Mix the potato and lemon juice and add honey to the mixture and blend well.

Apply it all over your face and neck and leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off with water.

(Do this very alternate day. By the way, dilute the lemon juice if you experience irritation)

You will need 01 tablespoon potato juice or pulp, 01 tablespoon tomato juice or pulp and 01 tablespoon honey.

Mix the potato and tomato juice/pulp and add the honey to the mixture and mix until you obtain a smooth paste.

Apply it evenly on your face, focusing on the affected area.

‘Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has voiced his strong criticism against the proposed Indo-Lanka land bridge project. Speaking to the media in Ruwanwella on Friday Cardinal Ranjith warned the project will endanger Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and independence. He cited historical instances of South Indian invasions where Sinhalese kings had to defend and reclaim parts of the island. He warned that such a project would lead to Sri Lanka becoming a part of Tamil Nadu…

“Who needs this bridge? It’s evident that the idea originated from foreign requests, not from the people here,” the Cardinal stated. “This Government is determined to follow all external directives without considering whether they are beneficial or harmful to us. We must be cautious and avoid actions that are not in our best interest. Otherwise, we will find ourselves in an even worse crisis than we already face. We must not do anything that jeopardises our sovereignty and independence.” Cardinal Ranjith said…’
