    "Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera yesterday announced that the Cabinet has approved new feed-in tariffs for renewable power plants below 10 megawatts (MW).",
    "According to the new tariffs, rooftop solar installations below 500 kilowatts (KW) will receive a flat rate of Rs. 27.06 per unit for 20 years. Installations exceeding 500 kW will receive Rs. 23.18 per unit.",
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has also set tariffs for other renewable projects below 10 MW, accordingly:",
    "Solar: Rs. 25.48 per unit (equivalent to 8.35 US cents at an exchange rate of Rs. 305 to the US dollar)",
    "All these rates will remain fixed for 20 years without tiered reductions.",
    "However, energy experts have criticized Sri Lanka\u2019s feed-in tariffs, except for biomass, for being administratively set much higher than competitive rates in other regions. For instance, a 50 MW wind plant in Mannar receives tariffs of only 4.88 US cents per kWh.",
    "Feed-in tariffs were initially replaced by competitive bidding but have been reinstated following lobbying efforts. Recently, bids were received for a 50 MW wind power plant in Mannar, with Windforce PLC proposing 4.88 cents per kWh, and other companies bidding slightly higher.",
    "The bid opening for the Mannar project, which benefits from high winds with a plant factor exceeding 40%, was delayed due to objections from the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, according to opposition legislator Kabir Hashim.",
    "Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry clarified that the Adani Power Project is not a government-to-government initiative, prompting questions about the project\u2019s procurement under existing legislation.",
    "In other developments, the Cabinet also approved the borrowing of USD 100 million from the Asian Development Bank as part of a larger USD 300 million program. This loan is linked to recent electricity law reforms aimed at supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s budget and restructuring debt under an International Monetary Fund-backed program.",
