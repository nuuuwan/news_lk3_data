    "COLOMBO (News 1st); North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has indicated a willingness to resume dialogue with the United States, provided Washington abandons its insistence on denuclearization.\u00a0The remarks, delivered during a speech at the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly in Pyongyang, were reported by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Monday.Kim stated that he still holds positive memories of former U.S. President Donald Trump and suggested that if the U.S. accepts North Korea\u2019s nuclear status and seeks genuine peaceful coexistence, Pyongyang would have no reason to avoid future conversations.\u00a0However, Kim made it clear that North Korea will never relinquish its nuclear arsenal, warning adversaries not to believe they can defeat the regime through sanctions or military pressure.He also ruled out any engagement with South Korea or pursuit of unification, reaffirming his \u201ctwo hostile states\u201d doctrine and signaling a hardening of Pyongyang\u2019s stance toward Seoul."
