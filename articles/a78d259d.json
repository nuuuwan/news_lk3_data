    "When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J. Hulugalle, Jayantha Padmanabha, Tarzie Vittachi and Denzil Peiris. They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.",
    "I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.",
    "To me Mervyn\u2019s life was a series of literary and intellectual achievements that unfolded with Cartesian precision, building one upon the other.",
    "The foundation being the liberal education received at school and university as well as through his voracious and explorative reading. Also, the intellectual sparing of his early days and his punishing regime of writing and literary engagement. A foundation through which he acquired and imbibed all that was admirable in Western culture, literature and thought.",
    "Mervyn\u2019s obvious and comprehensive modernity was a conspicuous stigmata of his socio-cultural milieu, one in which he and his peers had been moulded by almost half a millennium of saturated exposure to European thought, mores, literature, lifestyle and values. These were cemented by the British Public School experience that already shaped Mervyn\u2019s father at Trinity College, and would then mould Mervyn himself at Royal College and the English Department of the University of Ceylon.",
    "Mervyn was to transform these literary and intellectual skills into a career in journalism at Lake House that climaxed in the early seventies with him becoming editor of the Daily News and the Sunday Observer.",
    "By then he was Sri Lanka\u2019s best-known journalist. He would cover and report on the country for the most prestigious international journals:  The Economist, Newsweek and the London Financial Times. He also reported for the BBC. As a foreign correspondent he was the driving force behind the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Association, serving as its president. Through all of this he left an indelible mark on journalism and the media in this country.",
    "Not surprisingly his modernity also made him a connoisseur of \u2018Cultural Christianity\u2019 which he accessed through the works of masters like T.S.Eliot. And though Mervyn was steadfastly secular, even agnostic, his Cultural Christianity was reminiscent of what Eliot\u2019s biographer , when describing Eliot\u2019s late religious conversion, explained as serving to \u201cattach Eliot to the English community and English culture.\u201d",
    "But he went beyond being just another Westernised dilettante. The rise of nationalism that came with the post-colonial years interacted with and impacted on his Western sophistication to give this country, for the first time, an editor who was liberal in the most profound sense of the word, in that he was sensitive to the aspirations of the emerging Sinhala and Tamil speaking world. History provided us at this critical juncture in time, with someone who was not just adrift between two worlds, but a link between two dimensions of Ceylonese life.",
    "No doubt he had been influenced both at Royal and in the University\u2019s English Department by those who in what was still early days, questioned and criticised the status quo; Dickie Attygalle, Regi Siriwardena and Professor Ludowyke.",
    "Moreover his inherited family heritage did carry the strands of indigenous religion, values and pride. And perhaps this latent tension which I with my own diverse heritage can instinctively appreciate, also provided Mervyn the critic of the establishment, the rebel against the existing order and the outsider who wanted to change the status quo, with the capacity to contain this inherent contradiction. Or as Izzeth Hussain described Mervyn: \u201cUnderneath was always a troubled intelligence, sensitive and vulnerable, the non-conformist always on the side of the underdog\u2026without illusions about men of power and their world, and incapable of identifying himself with any political party\u2026\u201d",
    "His compelling mission to use his modernising drive to see beyond its own circumscribed horizon led him to replicate his radical vision beyond this Island\u2019s shores and apply it to unlock at a global level the unraveling of a new exciting post-colonial world. And this came with the second level of his specialisation and challenges \u2013 international affairs.",
    "In the aftermath of Bandaranaike\u2019s 1956 victory, Mervyn\u2019s Peradeniya batchmate, the young MEP Parliamentarian Nimal Karunatilleke, introduced him to the new Prime Minister who unceremoniously told Mervyn to take over and deliver the weekly foreign affairs commentary that was aired on the then Radio Ceylon.",
    "He schooled himself in foreign affairs so that he became the country\u2019s foremost writer and broadcaster in this field. As Secretary-General of the Ceylon Institute of World Affairs (CIWA) he fashioned a forum where the issues of the day could be discussed and developed.",
    "One of my earliest recollections of Mervyn was at a presentation by Shirley Amerasinghe, Colombo\u2019s Permanent Representative at the United Nations. While Maj. Gen. Anton Muttukumaru presided it was the debonair Mervyn, immaculately dressed, pipe in hand, who gave the vote of thanks. He opened with: They say it\u2019s a good thing that diplomats have long noses, because they cannot see beyond them! It was pure Mervyn; charming, witty, the consummate speaker, a treat to listen to.",
    "Later, the two-day seminar that he was to organise in 1972 for the CIWA at the Taprobane on The Indian Ocean Region, brought together some provocative minds of the day, among them jurist Lalith Athulathmudali, diplomat Yogeswaran Duraisamy, academic K. H. Jayasinghe, writer Hector Abhayavardhana and strategist Rajan Kadirgamar.",
    "At a time when the Cold War had left the emerging states in the South with little option but to formulate their own foreign policy, Sri Lanka was fortunate to have in Mervyn someone who was gifted with a sense of history. It enabled him to respond to the flood of ideas coming out of the South as it grappled with its newfound freedom and evolved a policy of Non Alignment for the emerging post-colonial world.",
    "At one level Mervyn was a very public person. He enjoyed the limelight, the academia-driven exchanges, the diplomatic circuit and the cocktail parties. But his family, Lakshmi his wife and Dayan his son were a source of strength to him and the object of his unwavering affection and commitment. Though my acquaintance with Mervyn\u2019s wife Lakshmi was limited, in his tribute to his mother, Dayan clearly explains her role and significance in Mervyn\u2019s life and career. \u201cIt was only my mother whose firmness and strength, determination and discipline, constancy and consistency, engagement and fighting spirit that kept him on track and able to achieve that which he did, reaching the top of his profession of journalism nationally and internationally, scaling the heights of global political access and encounter, and with his greatness posthumously recognised. He knew he owed her!\u201d",
    "Understandably the mainstream media could not accommodate him or contain him; so, he had to break out, he had to do his own thing. And so began the third phase of his journey, he set out to create and fashion a literary vehicle that quintessentially could carry his Progressive Liberal vision. And in 1978 was born The Lanka Guardian.",
    "He shared his vision with me on a quiet afternoon at the Orient Club. This was where Mervyn retired each day, and as his eye focused on the billiard table, his mind grappled with the challenge of launching a new journal, a different magazine.",
    "In those early days, The Lanka Guardian drew on the literary talents of independent writers like S. Pathiravitharne, Regi Siriwardene and V. P. Vittachi \u2013 providing them, and later countless other writers with a unique forum. Mervyn also built around him a loyal team, Hugh Abeyaratne who single-handedly sub-edited the magazine, Gamini Dissanayake who looked after the business side and Shahareen Ismail behind her typewriter. And from a small office at the YMBA Building in Fort, they opened a window through which a generation could view Sri Lanka, could share ideas, could debate issues and could publish poetry.",
    "In the years that followed, as tame journalism became the hallmark of the mainstream media, the Guardian stood out as a fiercely independent magazine, which opened its pages to diverse views and distant voices. It was honest and intelligent in a world that had become mediocre and mundane. It conveyed news, made analyses and poked fun, as everything around was reduced to stultified regimentation. As Sri Lanka passed through the darkness of the eighties and nineties, as violence swept the land, destroying dissent and creativity, Mervyn ensured that the Guardian hit the streets. It was his statement of faith, his belief in getting truth and opinion out there, regardless of the cost.",
    "in Mervyn\u2019s hands was more than a magazine, it was a torch that he kept alight as one after the other all other lamps were extinguished. It became a lifeline as people in different corners of the world waited each fortnight to sense and touch the real Sri Lanka; its events, its people, its ideas \u2013 its hopes and dreams. Mervyn and the Guardian in the words of the poet Matthew Arnold were \u201cWandering between two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born.\u201d",
    "Mervyn kept at it with tenacity, undaunted by the challenges. At that tenuous moment in time, it was his testament, his legacy. History called him to independently take a stand as a critical commentator, and this he did without a moment\u2019s hesitation. And he kept at it until the very end, thinking, speaking, writing, and broadcasting, never disheartened by the carnage, the futility and the vanity of that era.",
    "He kept true to the end. Surely could he have said when it was all over, like that tragic hero Mark Anthony before him: \u201cUnarm Eros, the long day\u2019s task is done.\u201d",
