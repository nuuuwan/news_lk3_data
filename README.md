### Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union – Workers’ Tribunal from 7 to 8 June

The Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union has brought together workers from the plantation sector to organise the first ever Workers’ Tribunal from 7 to 8 June, at the BMICH, Colombo. In this Tribunal several other unions will also be giving their testimonies.

Organisers said it has been 200 years since workers in the plantations have been enabling Sri Lanka’s growth with their sweat and blood. The situation of the workers remain dire and unchanged. The long-standing mobilisation by workers demanding an increase in the basic wages to Rs. 1,000/- began in 2010 and gained momentum in 2018. In this context, the Wages Board increased the workers’ wages to Rs. 1,000/- per day in 2019. The intervention of the Wages Board in this matter has been unacceptable to the companies and the legal battle is still ongoing. Therefore, since 2018, the conditions of workers’ rights have only become worse.

### Sri Lanka urgently needs green power on ground and not paper

*2024-06-06 05:32:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Sri-Lanka-urgently-needs-green-power-on-ground-and-not-paper/14-762691) · `en`

Sri Lanka has set an ambitious goal of achieving 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2050. To put this in perspective, for FY24, fossil fuel-based power plants met 54% of total power generated in the country, and under 8% came from solar or wind, with hydro contributing 31%. In terms of installed capacity, as on 31 March 2024, of SL’s generation capacity of 5,012 MW, ex of hydro, REs contributed barely 1093 MW, which is about a fifth of the total installed capacity. With limited scope of adding large-scale hydro projects in the future, it is the wind and solar projects which will have to do the heavy lifting for SL to meet its RE generation goals.

### Ministry of Finance: Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted

A recent press statement issued by the Ministry of Finance dated 27/05/2024, appears to be a belated focus possibly due to an intervention initiated by an external authority. It pronounces a scheme designed for the implementation of reforms for State Owned Banks.

The diagnosed defects to be addressed are in summary form as follows;

SOBs have faced significant stress during the recent economic crisis,

SOB lending practices have deteriorated due to inadequate risk mitigation and weak governance

SOB balance sheets have absorbed losses of SOEs and help large fiscal deficits of those SOEs

These have led to delays in reforms which contributed to the economic crisis

It is not a fight between two equal states but between an occupier and those that they have occupied

“When IRA was bombing people in England, we did not drop 2000 lbs bombs on Belfast” was a chilling note with utter disgust from the ardent pro-Israeli Broadcaster/Journalist Piers Morgan. This was following the attack on the Rafah refugee tents killing 45 and injuring 250 already displaced civilians on 26 May. The silly claim of Netanyahu’s was, “there were two Hamas operatives.”
