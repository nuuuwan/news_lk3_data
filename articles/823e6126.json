    "The 55-year-old leftist leader rose to the country\u2019s most powerful office two months ago, winning a crucial presidential election on a plank anti-corruption, promising \u201cchange\u201d in political culture.",
    "The outcome of Thursday\u2019s (November 14, 2024) parliamentary polls will determine the extent of his government\u2019s influence in the 225-member legislature.",
