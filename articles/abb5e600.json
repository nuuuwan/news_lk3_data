  "original_body_lines": [
    "Elon Musk briefly lost his title as the world\u2019s richest person to Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle and an ally of US President Donald Trump.",
    "Ellison\u2019s wealth surged to $393bn (\u00a3290bn) on Wednesday morning, surpassing Musk\u2019s $385bn (\u00a3284bn), according to the Forbes billionaire list.",
    "The jump came after shares in Oracle, which make up a significant part of Ellison\u2019s fortune, soared more than 40%, boosted by the database software company\u2019s surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals.",
    "But the firm\u2019s share price had shed some of those gains by the end of the day, putting Musk back on top.",
    "Before briefly losing it to Ellison, Musk had held the title of world\u2019s richest person for nearly one year.",
    "He could receive a pay package worth over $1tn (\u00a3740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed.",
    "But shares in Musk\u2019s most valuable business, Tesla, have fallen this year.",
    "The electric vehicle maker has grappled with investor jitters over the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of electric vehicle initiatives, on top of consumer backlash to Musk\u2019s political involvement.",
    "Oracle has recently been propelled by growing demand for data centre infrastructure.",
    "The company projected as part of its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday that revenue from its cloud business will jump 77% this year, to $18bn, with further growth expected in the coming years.",
    "Oracle has reported a surge in demand among AI companies for its data centres, which helped push its stock dramatically higher.",
    "It signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with customers in the last quarter and anticipates several more deals in the months ahead, chief executive Safra Catz said on Tuesday.",
    "Ellison, 81, helped start Oracle in 1977 and rose to prominence in the 1990s, when he became a public figure known as much for his lavish lifestyle as for the database company behind his fortune.",
    "He was Oracle\u2019s chief executive until 2014 and is now the company\u2019s chairman and chief technology officer.",
    "And he has positioned himself as an ally to President Trump.",
    "When Trump returned to the White House in January, Ellison appeared alongside OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son to announce a project called Stargate, to build out AI infrastructure in the US.",
    "Oracle has also emerged as a possible buyer of TikTok, the app owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. TikTok is facing a ban in the US unless it divests itself of its ByteDance ownership.",
    "In January, when asked whether he was open to Musk buying TikTok, Trump responded: \u201cI\u2019d like Larry to buy it, too.\u201d",
    "He funded the bulk of a $8bn bid by his son to acquire Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV.",
    "That deal between Paramount and the media company Skydance, which is controlled by his son David, closed last month."
