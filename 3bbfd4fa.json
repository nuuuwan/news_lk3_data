    "Australia opener Usman Khawaja has been charged by the International Cricket Council for wearing a black armband in support of civilians in Gaza during the first Test against Pakistan.",
    "Khawaja, 37, did not wear shoes bearing the words \u201call lives are equal\u201d and \u201cfreedom is a human right\u201d in Perth, as he had in training.",
    "The ICC deemed him in breach of its clothing and equipment regulations.",
    "Khawaja is free to play in the second Test, starting on 26 December.",
    "However, he faces further sanctions if he wears an armband again or makes an on-field statement in support of Palestinians without the permission of the ICC and Cricket Australia.",
    "At least 20,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported killed since Israel began bombing the territory in the wake of Hamas\u2019 7 October attacks, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Under ICC regulations, players cannot display messages of political, religious or racial causes during international matches.",
    "Khawaja, who is Muslim, has said his message is a \u201chumanitarian appeal\u201d and not a political statement.",
    "\u201cUsman displayed a personal message during the first Test match against Pakistan without seeking the prior approval of Cricket Australia and the ICC to display it, as required in the regulations for personal messages,\u201d said an ICC spokesperson.",
    "\u201cThis is a breach under the category of an \u2018other breach\u2019 and the sanction for a first offence is a reprimand.\u201d",
    "Khawaja said he would \u201cfight\u201d the decision when he was told not to wear the shoes, which featured writing in red, green and black - the colours of the Palestinian flag.",
    "He posted a video message on social media in which he reiterated his support for civilians in Gaza.",
    "\u201cThe ICC have told me that I can\u2019t wear my shoes on-field because they believe it\u2019s a political statement under their guidelines. I don\u2019t believe it is,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI will respect their view and decision but I will fight it and seek to gain approval.\u201d",
    "Cricket Australia previously said it supported \u201cthe right of our players to express personal opinions\u201d but that it expected them to uphold the ICC rules.",
    "In 2014 England all-rounder Moeen Ali was warned to stop wearing wristbands showing support for Gaza during a Test against India.",
    "Khawaja is set to speak to the media in Melbourne on Friday.",
    "Australia lead the three-match series 1-0 before the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground."
