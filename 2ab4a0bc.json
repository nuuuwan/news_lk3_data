    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 State health sector unions in Sri Lanka have threatened trade union action if the health ministry does not revoke a gag order imposed on health professionals.",
    "President of the College of Medical Laboratory Science (CMLS) Ravi Kumudesh told reporters that health sector unions will go on strike on Tuesday July 25 if the health ministry secretary does not withdraw a circular issued on July 21 threatening disciplinary action against any official speaking to the media.",
    "All provincial health secretaries, heads of all health institutions under ministry, provincial and regional health directors have been ordered to take disciplinary action against any officer of the government who issues comments to the media. This is in the wake of a raging controversy over unregistered anesthetic drugs imported from India which are allegedly linked to a number of deaths in government hospitals.",
    "\u201cWithdraw this circular immediately and revoke the disciplinary actions, or we will have to resort to trade union actions,\u201d said Kumudesh.",
    "\u201cThis time, our trade union action will be done together with the patients,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Jul25/2023)"
