  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka, a land teeming with biodiversity and historical significance, continues to captivate the global stage, thanks to individuals like Suriya Jayalath Perera. A celebrated wildlife photographer, researcher, and conservationist, Suriya\u2019s work bridges the gap between Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural history and its unparalleled natural beauty.",
    "His book, Kingdom of Ruhuna, is a testament to his dedication. This masterpiece intricately documents the rich history of Ruhuna, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s ancient kingdoms, while capturing its ecological splendour through vivid photography.",
    "\u201cThe Kingdom of Ruhuna is more than just a historical region. It\u2019s a living testament to how culture and nature coexist harmoniously. Through this book, I hope to inspire readers to cherish and protect this symbiosis,\u201d Suriya remarked during an interview with The Island.",
    "The book highlights the majestic landscapes of the Yala National Park, a key area of the Ruhuna Kingdom, showcasing iconic species such as leopards, elephants, and rare birds. Accompanying these visuals is a deep dive into the archaeological remnants of the kingdom, making Kingdom of Ruhuna a unique blend of natural and historical storytelling.",
    "Suriya\u2019s work has not only gained recognition locally but has also reached global audiences. His contributions to events such as In Focus USA, held at UCLA in 2024, emphasise the global importance of Sri Lanka\u2019s wildlife. This exhibition featured Suriya\u2019s photographs of Sri Lanka\u2019s untamed wilderness, which stood out for their ability to bring the raw beauty of nature to life.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s wilderness is a global treasure. Events like these help us connect with the world and highlight the urgent need for conservation,\u201d Suriya noted.",
    "Behind Suriya\u2019s success is a supportive family that shares his love for nature. \u201cMy family has always been my backbone, accompanying me on many journeys into the wild. Their encouragement motivates me to keep pushing boundaries,\u201d he shared.",
    "Suriya\u2019s wife and children are frequently seen accompanying him during his explorations, learning about the intricacies of wildlife and the importance of preserving it for future generations. This close-knit family dynamic further adds to the personal charm of his professional journey.",
    "Despite the accolades and achievements, Suriya remains focused on his ultimate goal: conservation. His work goes beyond photography and books; he actively participates in initiatives aimed at educating local communities about the importance of preserving Sri Lanka\u2019s natural heritage.",
    "\u201cThe wilderness is not just for us\u2014it belongs to the generations to come. If we don\u2019t act now, we risk losing everything,\u201d Suriya warned passionately.",
    "Through his photographs, books, and global outreach, Suriya is creating a legacy that goes beyond aesthetics. His work serves as both a celebration of Sri Lanka\u2019s biodiversity and a rallying cry for its preservation.",
    "As readers turn the pages of Kingdom of Ruhuna, they are not just witnessing history and beauty\u2014they are becoming part of a movement to protect one of the world\u2019s most precious ecosystems.",
    "Preserving Ruhuna\u2019s Folklore: The timless echoes of Sri Lanka\u2019s Past",
    "Nestled in the heart of Sri Lanka\u2019s southern plains, the Kingdom of Ruhuna is more than just a historical domain\u2014it is a treasure trove of folklore. This ancient realm, steeped in myths and legends, serves as a window into the cultural and spiritual essence of the region. From the timeless tales of warrior kings to whispered stories of mystical beings, Ruhuna\u2019s folklore is a vibrant tapestry that bridges the past and the present.",
    "Ruhuna\u2019s history unfolds like an epic, its roots intertwined with the island\u2019s Buddhist heritage and folklore. It is said that the legendary King Mahanaga, escaping palace intrigues in Anuradhapura, founded the Ruhunu Kingdom in Magama. Oral traditions passed through generations paint vivid pictures of his journey through jungles, rivers, and mountains, accompanied by tales of heroism and resilience.",
    "The region\u2019s lore extends further back, connecting with the mythological era of King Ravana, mentioned in the Ramayana. According to folklore, Ravana\u2019s palaces once adorned the rugged hills of Ruhuna, their remnants lost to time and tide. Fishermen recount sightings of inscriptions on submerged rocks, visible during calm seas\u2014a haunting reminder of this mythical past.",
    "Suriya, reflected on the enduring significance of folklore. \u201cFolklore is the soul of Ruhuna. It is how our ancestors preserved their wisdom, their fears, and their dreams. To lose these stories is to lose a part of who we are,\u201d he explained.",
    "His years of research brought him face-to-face with the oral traditions that animate Ruhuna\u2019s cultural landscape. \u201cEvery rock, every tank, every temple tells a story. Even the Yala wilderness, with its leopards and elephants, is a living testament to the harmony our ancestors sought with nature,\u201d he said.",
    "One such story is that of the Nittaewo, a mysterious race believed to have inhabited Ruhuna\u2019s forests. \u201cThe Nittaewo are more than just mythical creatures,\u201d Suriya highlighted. \u201cTheir story reflects the deep connection our people had with the land, and the battles they fought to survive in a harsh but beautiful environment.\u201d",
    "Folklore has long shaped Ruhuna\u2019s socio-cultural identity, from its agricultural practices to its spiritual traditions. The region\u2019s sacred sites, such as Kataragama, are steeped in stories that blend Buddhist, Hindu, and indigenous beliefs. \u201cKataragama isn\u2019t just a temple\u2014it\u2019s a narrative crossroads where history and spirituality meet,\u201d he noted.",
    "However, the modern era poses challenges. \u201cUrbanisation, globalisation, and even treasure hunters threaten the survival of these stories,\u201d he warned. \u201cMuch of our folklore still exists only in oral form. If we don\u2019t act now, we risk losing it forever.\u201d",
    "Suriya says the book is more than a historical account; it is a call for action. \u201cI wrote Kingdom of Ruhuna to ensure that these stories are not buried in the sands of time,\u201d he added. His work has inspired local efforts to document folklore through schools, community projects, and digital platforms.",
    "For Suriya, preserving folklore is not merely an academic pursuit but a personal mission. \u201cEvery tale, whether of kings or villagers, holds a lesson for us today,\u201d he said. \u201cFolklore teaches us to respect our past and to live in harmony with the natural world.\u201d",
    "As Sri Lanka charts its future, Ruhuna\u2019s folklore stands as a reminder of the island\u2019s rich heritage. \u201cFolklore is not just about the past,\u201d he said adding \u201cIt\u2019s a guide for the future, teaching us resilience, creativity, and the value of community.\u201d",
    "In conclusion, Suriya expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Prabath Sahabandu, the Editor of The Island newspaper , acknowledging him as the first to publish his research two decades ago.",
    "President Emeritus of the International Institute of Space Law & Policy",
    "The area surrounding the Ruhuna National Park is celebrated in Sinhalese history as a sacred place, steeped in meditation and spiritual significance, where Arahaths have sought refuge. As Nandasiri Jasentuliyana, President Emeritus of the International Institute of Space Law & Policy, observes, even today, the visitor cannot help but feel a sense of sanctity and tranquility in the region, as if stepping into a sacred land rich in history.",
    "He highlights the legend of King Dutugemenu, who, in gratitude to God Skanda (Kataragama Deviyo) for helping him cross the Menik Ganga in his quest to defeat Elara, built a shrine to honour the deity. This shrine, which has remained a holy site for both Hindus and Buddhists, is one of many monuments that underscore the region\u2019s spiritual importance. Tissamaharama and Kiri Wehera stupas are a further testament to the sacredness of the area, which is now home to a wealth of archaeological and religious relics.",
    "Jasentuliyana also draws attention to the Mahavamsa, the ancient Buddhist text, whose final chapter dramatises these historical events, intertwining the sanctity of Ruhuna with the national consciousness of Sri Lanka. The Mahavamsa, written long after the events it narrates, captures the folklore that shapes the region\u2019s history and geography, including that of the Ruhuna Kingdom and the surrounding area.",
    "Despite these rich historical associations, the region is also renowned for its wildlife, particularly in Yala National Park, which boasts the world\u2019s highest population density of leopards. The author, in his unique and insightful style, brings to life the serene beauty and historical richness of the Ruhuna Kingdom, offering readers a scholarly narration enriched by folklores, offering rare glimpses into archaeological sites often overlooked by even historians. As Jasentuliyana concludes, the Ruhuna Kingdom is not only a treasure trove of legendary stories but also a living testament to Sri Lanka\u2019s rich cultural and natural heritage.",
