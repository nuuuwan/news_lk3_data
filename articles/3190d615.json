    "The Presidential Secretary, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake has officially informed the Secretary General of Parliament in writing that the President has accepted the resignation of Speaker Ashoka Ranwala.",
    "Ranwala announced his resignation from his position as Speaker of Parliament on December 13, amidst the controversy surrounding his educational qualifications. This is the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s parliamentary history that a Speaker has resigned.",
    "Political observers have indicated that the appointment of a new Speaker will likely take place on December 17, when the Parliament reconvenes. Nominees for the position are expected to be submitted on the same day.",
    "The Speaker can submit his resignation to the General Secretary of Parliament or the President. Once the President receives the resignation letter, he can decide whether to accept it. Upon acceptance, Parliament must elect a new Speaker, either through a vote or nomination, as per the regulations.",
    "Meanwhile, announcing his resignation in a statement yesterday (13), Ranwala addressed the controversy regarding his educational qualifications, which surfaced in the days leading up to his resignation.",
    "He clarified that he had never made a false statement about his academic background. However, the MP stated that at this moment he is not in possession of certain documents required to confirm his educational qualifications and that while he has requested for them from the relevant institutions, it is difficult to urgently produce these documents at this moment.",
    "MP Ranwala further stated that while the relevant documents can be obtained from the research institution affiliated with Japan\u2019s Waseda University which had awarded him the doctorate, he intends to present them as soon as possible.",
    "The controversy surrounding his doctorate escalated when reports circulated on social media, leading to the removal of the title \u201cDr.\u201d from his profile on the Sri Lanka Parliament website.",
    "Opposition parties had raised concerns, demanding clarification on whether his doctorate was legitimately granted and recognized.",
    "In response, Ranwala assured that he would address these allegations at the appropriate time.",
    "Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, initiated signing a Motion of No Confidence against the Speaker over the issue on December 13."
