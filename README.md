In the application, Jamaldeen claimed that Premachandra committed the offence of Contempt of Court by criticising an order issued by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court concerning him during a press conference held on International Women’s Day. He further alleged that her actions amounted to interference with the due administration of justice.

*2024-12-05 01:30:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Rice-millers-agree-to-supply-at-controlled-price-Trade-Minister/56-770126) · `en`

Rice millers agreed to supply 200,000 kilograms of rice daily to the market through ‘Lanka Sathosa’ at a controlled price of Rs. 220 per kilo, effective from yesterday.

The move was confirmed by Trade Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe during the Parliament session yesterday.

“During the recent discussion with rice mill owners, they claimed that the rice stocks in the mills cannot be released to the market due to an issue with the banks. On Tuesday, we provided them with a solution for that issue,” he added.

The Trade Minister also assured that 1 million coconuts will be sold through Sathosa outlets in the suburbs at a price of Rs. 130 per coconut, over the next two weeks.

Samarasinghe added that coconut products obtained from State-owned plantations will be sold at low prices in this manner.

Court orders People’s Bank to disclose funds donated by its Anuradhapura Regional Branch Buddhist Society for the 2022 Poson Poya Charity and Bathi Gee Festival

Says Buddhist Society is part of People’s Bank and not an independent entity, making records subject to RTI scrutiny

Notes public funds must be made available for examination by citizens in the interest of transparency

The Court of Appeal (CoA) this week ruled that the scope of the Right to Information (RTI) Act must be expanded to ensure accountability for any expenditure by a public authority, affirming that such information should be made available for public inspection upon request.

The ruling was delivered in response to an appeal by People’s Bank, which contested a decision by the Right to Information Commission to disclose details of funds donated by the Anuradhapura Regional Branch Buddhist Society of the People’s Bank for the 2022 Poson Poya Charity and Poson Bathi Gee Festival.

In addition to halting the company’s liquor production, the department said that other licences issued to W.M. Mendis & Co. will not be renewed beyond 31 December unless the tax arrears are cleared. Currently, eight out of the 10 liquor manufacturing licences issued to the company have already been suspended. The issue came to light during proceedings at the Court of Appeal yesterday.

### Compounding of capital market offences: Call for balanced regulation

*2024-12-05 00:46:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Compounding-of-capital-market-offences-Call-for-balanced-regulation/4-770113) · `en`

Consider reforms aimed at expediting judicial processes in financial crime cases, such as the establishment of specialised courts or streamlined procedures

The legal landscape surrounding capital market offences in Sri Lanka has tightened significantly due to recent amendments to the Securities and Exchange Commission Act (SEC Act). These amendments introduce stringent penalties, including mandatory imprisonment for major offences, and eliminate the option to compound five major offences. While this reflects a serious stance against capital market offences, the removal of compounding raises important concerns regarding the practical enforcement of these laws and the potential benefits of reintroducing compounding under controlled circumstances.

To settle (a matter) by a money payment, in lieu of other liability;

### Road much travelled: Identical paths towards fiscal distress in Sri Lanka and the Maldives

*2024-12-05 00:44:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Road-much-travelled-Identical-paths-towards-fiscal-distress-in-Sri-Lanka-and-the-Maldives/4-770112) · `en`

Though our economy be bruised, the external economic context and our innate geographic blessings, when bound with sound fiscal policies, shall certainly prevent a repeat of the ills that visited the Lankan economy in 2022

This article attempts an analysis of the eerily similar roads travelled in both Sri Lanka and the Maldives towards a fiscal cliff. Even though, we here in the Maldives, have not slipped off the precipice, the landscape is familiar and the dangers real and tangible.

However, it is important to stress at the outset, that while the terrain is familiar, it is not inevitable that we here in the Maldives too, tumble down the fiscal cliff into ‘white waters’ of internal turmoil, collapse of the political system and of an economic meltdown.
