    "First Capital Research has reaffirmed its positive stance on National Development Bank (NDB), maintaining a \u2018buy\u2019\u00a0recommendation despite a slight moderation in short-term expectations. The bank\u2019s strong earnings recovery, declining impairments, and favorable macroeconomic conditions underpin First Capital\u2019s confidence in NDB\u2019s long-term growth trajectory.",
    "NDB reported an impressive\u00a0143.6% year-on-year (YoY) earnings growth\u00a0in 1Q2025, though slightly below expectations due to slower loan expansion. The surge in profitability was largely driven by a sharp reduction in impairment charges. However, quarterly earnings saw a\u00a058.5% contraction\u00a0compared to 4Q2024, primarily due to a one-off reversal of impairment charges related to International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs).",

Meanwhile, fee and commission income saw modest growth of\u00a01.6% YoY, underperforming peers due to weaker card-based transactions.",
