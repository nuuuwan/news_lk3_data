### Uncertainty over elections could risk Sri Lanka’s economic recovery: ADB

*2024-04-12 22:01:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98599/uncertainty-over-elections-could-risk-sri-lankas-economic-recovery-adb) · `en`

The “uncertainty” over the impending elections in Sri Lanka will cause a possible downward trend in the country’s economic outlook, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.

The island nation is set to face a presidential election in the last quarter of this year, while the parliamentary election is due mid-next year.

However, political uncertainty prevails in the country as opposition parties have pledged to reverse the current IMF-linked reforms, which have proved to be unpopular with the masses.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has steered the recovery programme by going into a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a USD 2.9 billion facility, maintains that the island could once again face economic collapse if the IMF programme reforms are not adhered to.

### Germany eases gender change rules

*2024-04-12 21:59:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Germany-eases-gender-change-rules/108-280660) · `en`

Germany, April 12 (BBC) - The German parliament has passed a law making it easier for citizens and residents to legally change gender.

It's also introducing hefty fines - in specific circumstances - for disclosing someone's prior registered name or gender without consent.

Previously, changing your registered gender required a doctor's certificate and the approval of a family court.

Now over-18s can change to male, female or diverse, a third gender option that already exists under German law.

Three months on from a request for such a change, applicants will then have to appear at a registry office in person.

You can also request that no details regarding your gender are registered at all.

The intentional and harmful disclosure of someone's prior name or legal gender could attract a fine of up to €10,000.

However, there are exceptions - for example if it's a legal requirement due to court proceedings or police investigations.

April 12 (BBC) - President Joe Biden has been urged to ban imports of Chinese-made electric cars to the US.

The chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Sherrod Brown, wrote "Chinese electric vehicles are an existential threat to the American auto industry".

In February, the White House said the US was opening an investigation into whether Chinese cars pose a national security risk.

"We cannot allow China to bring its government-backed cheating to the American auto industry", Senator Brown said in a video on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Senator Brown, who is a Democrat from the the car-producing state of Ohio, is seeking to win a fourth term in office in November's election.

The study, Understanding Connections between Human Rights and Economic Crimes, combines the findings on key informant interviews (KIIs), and analysis of the challenges to the country’s efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability within its governance framework.

“The United States defense commitments to Japan and to the Philippines are ironclad. They’re ironclad,” Biden said as he began three-way talks at the White House with Kishida and Marcos. “As I said before, any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defense treaty.”

### Sri Lanka Yukthiya operations leading addicts to seek Ayurveda high

ECONOMYNEXT – A shortage of drugs due to the Yukthiya crackdown has led some addicts to look for alternative medicines, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said.

Sri Lanka allows cannabis to be used in the manufacture of ayurvedic medicine. Raw materials in Ayurvedic medicine include several parts of the cannabis plant, as well as abin (Papaver somniferum Linn), in herbal remedies.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that over-the-counter products available at shops that sell ayurveda products (sinhala beheth) provide varying degrees of relaxation or stimulation.

Jayakody said a written notification has been sent to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and the Inspector General of Police regarding the challenges faced by the indigenous medical sector due to operation ‘Yukthiya’.

### Taylor Swift’s music back on TikTok after dispute

April 12 (BBC) - Taylor Swift's songs are back on TikTok following a dispute that led her label to stop licensing its content to the app.

Her music's return on Thursday comes ahead of the release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.

Universal Music pulled songs by its artists in January, including Rihanna and Ariana Grande, citing a licensing dispute.

While many of her songs - including You Belong With Me and Cruel Summer - are again available for users to add to their videos, music belonging to Universal's other artists has still not been relisted.

That may be because unlike other artists, Swift owns the copyright to her music under the terms of a 2018 deal with Universal. Some reports speculated Swift reached a separate deal with TikTok.

"Swifties" - Taylor Swift fans - took to the platform to share their delight at her music returning.

"OMG this made my whole year," wrote verified user Jessica Golich, adding that users would "have the whole new album to play with".

### Vietnamese billionaire sentenced to death for $44bn fraud

Vietnam, April 12 (BBC) - Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old Vietnamese property developer was sentenced to death on Thursday for looting one of the country's largest banks over a period of 11 years.

It's a rare verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.

The decision is a reflection of the dizzying scale of the fraud. Truong My Lan was convicted of taking out $44bn (£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may never be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of trying to encourage her to return some of the missing billions.

The habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said 2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers were involved.

He said this while commenting on attempts to stop a common candidate on behalf of the Tamil parties in the upcoming presidential election.

In the upcoming presidential election, initiatives to stop a common candidate on behalf of Tamil political parties.

At present, those who are expected to field in the presidential election do not reveal themselves as compassionate on any issues, including a solution to the ethnic problem of the Tamil people.

Therefore, supporting the Candidates of South Sri Lanka without any basics is an inappropriate endeavor. It is a suitable approach that all the Tamil parties unite and stop the general candidate.

I am in principle compliance with that effort. However, it is very important that the party needs to take a decision on the issue of the Sri Lankan Tamil party.

During previous years the NTC had discussions with private bus associations to arrange buses without inconveniencing commuters, he said.

"Earlier, we were advised to assign short-distance buses to long-distance services to meet the demand. But this time no such decision has been taken. Therefore, people have to wait many hours at the bus stand to get their transport facilities", Priyanjith said.

### Appropriate moment: Sajith, Tamil party should speak with Anura- Dayan Jayatilaka

*2024-04-12 06:38:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181012) · `ta`

Diplomat Dayan Jayatilaka advises Tamil parties to engage with main rivals, Sajith and Anura, amidst Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism. He suggests against stopping a Tamil general candidate, noting the lack of public support for such a move. Despite the historical tributes by Tamil parties in presidential elections, the current attempt to unite behind a common candidate faces challenges due to differing political tendencies and the absence of unanimity. Jayatilaka emphasizes the importance of addressing long-term issues with Sajith and Anura, drawing parallels with Catalonia and Kurdishland, and advocates for strategic decision-making to leverage the current political climate.

🟩

Diplomatic Dayan Jayatilaka has said that the Tamil parties, Sajith, should carry out talks with the main rivals, as the time when the Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism, which have long been politicized at home, have been appropriate.

He also pointed out that while the political tendency of the Tamils is going on, the attempt to stop a Tamil general candidate will not be appropriate.

He said this while commenting on the Tamil political parties, which are based on the North and East, have taken a public candidate in the upcoming presidential election.

The Tamil people have carried out various tributes in the past in the presidential election. However, the tricks have not received enough reactors to the Tamil people.

Against this backdrop, Tamil political parties are trying to stop a common candidate on their next presidential election.

It is a possible strategy if all parties come forward to work together on this issue.

Current media coverage in Sri Lanka is heavily focused on the forthcoming Presidential elections. Though officially not announced yet, it seems a foregone conclusion that the presidential poll would take place later this year. Several potential candidates ranging from incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe to   media magnate Dilith Jayaweera are tipped to be in the presidential fray.

Adding to this fluid state of affairs are recent attempts  by vested interests to field a “Hindu” as a common presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Even as people were becoming aware of efforts by interested parties to nominate a  Hindu  presidential candidate, the head of a  Hindu organization in Northern Sri Lanka issued a public statement calling for a common  candidate to contest the forthcoming presidential poll on behalf of all Hindus in the Island.
