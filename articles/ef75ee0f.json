  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka known earlier as Ceylon has produced many journalists of a high calibre in the past.These excellent scribes writing in  Sinhala, Tamil  or English newspapers  acquired  a large readership and made their mark over the years. Some were bi-lingual too. Unfortunately  most of these journalists were known only to people proficient in the language of the newspapers or journals they wrote for.  Despite being household names to one segment of readers, these illustrious members of the fourth  estate were virtually unknown to other readers.",
    "It is in this context that this column focuses on a scribe who in his heyday,  bestrode the  world of Tamil journalism like a colossus. Sinnathamby Sellathurai whose birth centenary was on 26th February 2025 was the Jaffna correspondent of the Tamil daily \u201cVirakesari\u201d (Valiant lion) for 36 years. Although a provincial correspondent, Sellathurai made a name for himself at and through the Virakesari .The quantitative output and qualitative nature of the news stories he filed from Jaffna  made him a legend in  the Tamil journalistic realm. Sinnathamby Sellathurai was regarded as the doyen of Jaffna journalists during his time.",
    "The \u201dVirakesari\u201dfounded 95 years ago  in 1930 will celebrate it\u2019s centenary in 2030. The  reputed newspaper  is regarded as the leading Tamil newspaper in Sri Lanka. This rise to the top was  made possible by the newspaper\u2019s editors, sub-editors, reporters,feature writers and provincial correspondents of yore. Sellathurai was foremost among those who  contributed to the  \u201cVirakesari\u201d\u2019s success. His professional life was inextricably ,inter-twined with that of the newspaper. So much so that he was widely referred to as \u201cVirakesari Sellathurai\u201d.",
    "Sinnathamby Sellathurai was  born on 26 February 1925 at Naavalkaadu,Atchuvely   in the Jaffna peninsula. He was the eldest among  seven children. Sellathurai  had his primary education  at the Saraswathy Vidyalayam in Atchuvely. His secondary education  was at the Atchuvely Christian College (now Atchuvely Maha Vidyaayam) where he completed his Senior School Certificate(SSC). Due to the family\u2019s financial circumstances, he  could not proceed further in studies. The family owned some land and also leased out more. Sellathurai became an agriculturist in his late teens.",
    "Though his formal schooling had ended, Sellathurai remained a life-long student. He was a voracious reader and read a lot in Tamil. Moreover he had a knack or flair for writing. In those days a popular Tamil weekly newspaper \u201cEelakesari\u201dwas published at Chunnakam in Jaffna. The Editor was S. Sivapathasundaram who later went to London to establish the BBC\u2019s Tamil radio service.. A well-known yesteryear Tamil literary personality Kanaga.Senthinathan recommended the youngster  to editor Sivapathasundaram.",
    "Sellathurai became a freelance journalist attached to the Eelakesari. He was assigned to cover various events and write about them in the weekly. Impressed by Sellathurai\u2019s writing, the editor later got him to interview people and also write  profiles of prominent people.  Interestingly he also wrote pieces for the women\u2019s section.Sellathurai used the pseudonyms \u201cIlavarasu\u201d for literary articles and \u201cSellam\u201d for the Woman\u2019s page.",
    "An Indian Tamil businessman Subramaniam Chettiar  began publishing the Tamil daily  \u201cVirakesari\u201d in Colombo in 1930. The paper largely catered to the Tamils  of Indian origin in Colombo and the hill country. After world war two ended the Virakesari began expanding to the North and East of Sri Lanka. Sellathurai was appointed Atchuvely correspondent in 1946 and became known as \u201cAtchuvely\u201dSellathurai.",
    "Though the  Virakesari had appointed several correspondents in different parts of Jaffna, not all of them were productive or industrious as Sellathurai. The young man would cycle throughout the length and breadth of the Jaffna peninsula gathering information for news articles and news features.They would appear under the byline of Atchuvely correspondent.",
    "A  Catholic schoolmaster from Eeachamottai in Jaffna was the Virakesari\u2019s Jaffna  City correspondent but he was not very active. So Sellathurai had to double up as Jaffna correspondent too. In 1953,Sellathurai the Atchuvely correspondent was  officially appointed as the Virakesari\u2019s Jaffna correspondent. He remained so  until his demise in 1982.",
    "Meanwhile Subramaniam chettiar returned to India for good. The  Virakesari was bought by a group of Colombo based Indian Tamil businessmen. They wanted the paper to sell well in Jaffna but there was a problem. The Virakesari editorial staff in Colombo were mainly Indian Tamil. Their news coverage was mainly about Indian affairs and about the Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka. Besides the vocabulary and grammatical structure  of the news and articles were  akin to  Tamil newspapers published in India.",
    "Thus the Virakesari did not appeal to the Jaffna reader then.It was perceived as an \u201cIndian\u201dpaper. Gradually the paper changed its substance and style to suit the local environment. The paper also began to devote more space to news and views from Jaffna. The Virakesari\u2019s Jaffna correspondent S.Sellathurai  played a huge role in popularising the paper in Jaffna. He worked tirelessly to file numerous news reports from Jaffna. Due to efforts spearheaded by Sellathurai, the Virakesari became the most widely read  Tamil newspaper among  readers in Jaffna and elsewhere.",
    "The Virakesari in the early days had no office in Jaffna. Sellathurai would sit at the back of a barber saloon in Jaffna town and write his copy. The saloon owner was Dominick Jeeva a literary icon of Jaffna who edited the literary monthly \u201cMallikai\u201d.  Jeeva even wrote a short story \u201cSeithi Vettai\u201d(news hunt) inspired by Sellathurai.",
    "After sometime the Virakesari rented part  of a shop on Power House Road. Sellathurai got a table and chair there. Subsequently the Express newspapers Ceylon Ltd that runs the Virakesari set up a large office on Station road in Jaffna. It remains there still.",
    "The main challenge facing a provincial correspondent was despatching the news he or she had gathered to the head office in Colombo as fast as possible. Filing news copy from Jaffna then was an uphill task. There were no cellular phones. Only the old dial phones. Long distance calls  to Colombo had to be booked as trunk calls through the telephone exchange. Only the latest or very important news stories were relayed by phone.Most news stories and articles were sent by post. Photographs were developed in Jaffna and sent by post.",
    "Sellathurai however was innovative enough to resort to some unorthodox measures. One was to send a news bulletin by telegram. Another was to send the news copy as a railway parcel by the daily mail train. An office aide  in Colombo  would collect the parcel of news each morning and bring it to the editorial In later years Sellathurai would use the Air Ceylon and Upali Airlines flights from Jaffna to send his news parcels too. Another of his innovations was to take film rolls to a studio and get them clipped neatly and send them to Colombo where they would be developed.",
    "Thus Sellathurai was able to send the news quickly to Colombo from Jaffna. These methods were replicated by other outstation correspondents  whenever and wherever  possible. But what really put the Virakesari on top in Jaffna was the quality and quantity of the news sent by its Jaffna correspondent. They were well-written, informative,  reliable and credible.  A news story by the Virakesari\u2019s Jaffna correspondent was believed by readers.",
    "In later years a rival newspaper cast aspersions on Sellathurai\u2019s coverage of the visit to Jaffna of Kundrakkudi Adigalaar a spiritual leader from Tamil Nadu. The paper conducted a prolonged campaign in its columns to undermine Sellathurai\u2019s credibility and tarnish his image. Sellathurai however did not give in and stood his ground. Ultimately the anti -_Sellathurai  campaign was called off.",
    "Another serious matter happened during the United Front Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike (1970-770. The only Tamil minister in that cabinet was Chelliah Kumarasuriar, the post and telecommunications minister. The arrogant Kumarasuriar  encouraged by a bunch of servile sycophants  used to behave like a tin pot dictator in the Tamil areas.",
    "The independent Sellathurai fell foul of Kumarasuriar because he did not toe the cabinet minister\u2019s line. A furious Kumarasuriar pressured the  Virakesari management to discontinue Sellathurai but the management refused. Kumarasuriar then used his influence to deprive the paper of Govt adverstisements. \u201csack Sellathurai or lose advertising revenue\u201d was the implied threat. To its credit the Virakesari editor and management stood by their Jaffna correspondent  and lost money rather than cave into the minister\u2019s demand to fire  Sellathurai.",
    "The irony in this was that Sellathurai was not a staff reporter to be fired. Despite his long stint at the Virakesari, Sellathurai remained a free-lancer. Although the Virakesari wanted to put him on the staff, Sellathurai turned down the offer. One reason was that he wanted to be independent and not restricted by the office regulations.. The other and perhaps the main reason was that Sellathurai thanks to his prodigious output of news and articles earned much more  each month than what he would have been paid as a staff reporter. Even though his news was measured and paid per  column inch, the Jaffna Correspondent\u2019s payment each month  was more than double the amount paid to  most of his colleagues on the staff",
    "Though not on the newspaper\u2019s staff, Sellathurai was  the mainstay of the \u201cVirakesari\u201d during the decades he was attached to it. Sellathurai\u2019s news copy did not  require much subbing as it was flawless and perfect. It was a model to be followed.",
    "When I entered journalism by joining the Virakesari as a staff reporter in 1977, the then editor K.Sivapragasam advised me to read Sellathurai\u2019s news stories carefully and emulate their structural format in writing news stories.  I followed this advice dutifully and learnt the rudiments of the craft in this way. When I told this to Sellathurai later, the veteran newsman was happy.",
    "Former Jaffna University Vice-chancellor Prof S. Vithianandan once telephoned the editor Sivapragasam about a news story that had appeared in the Virakesari. I was seated in front of the editor when the call was put through. Prof. Vithianandan asked Sivapragasam whether the story was correct. Editor Sivapragasam told  Vice-chancellor Vithiananthan that the news story in question was written by the Jaffna correspondent  Sellathurai. Therefore the story cannot be  wrong said the editor. Such was the faith in Sellathurai.",
    "As mentioned earlier, Sellathurai was incredibly loyal to the Virakesari. Prior to becoming the paper\u2019s Jaffna correspondent, he had been writing for newspapers such as the Eelakesari and Suthanthiran but  once the Virakesari link was  firmly established, he stopped writing to other newspapers. Writing for the Viraesari became the consuming passion of his life. Extremely lucrative offers were made by other Tamil newspapers  to entice him  but Sellathurai declined them all and remained faithful to the Virakesari.",
    "As the years progressed, Sellathurai became known as \u201cVirakesari\u201dSellathhurai. When he built a new house in Naavatkaadu, Sellathurai named it \u201cVirakesari\u201d and engraved the name   on the upper wall above the verandah and below the roof. Later the house was re-structured and enlarged   years  after Sellathurai\u2019s death. The family made sure the Virakesari name in Tamil letters remained  despite the renovation.",
    "One of the remarkable things about Sellathurai was that he did not belong to the dominant castes in Jaffna. In spite of this Sellathurai was able to  blossom into a leading journalist in \u201cCaste-conscious\u201d Jaffna.  He was widely respected by all political leaders in Jaffna There were many politicians who sought his advice and opinion on matters political.",
    "Sellathurai had devised a  formula based on proportionality in providing political coverage. Each political party was given coverage  in proportion to the  political strength it enjoyed  in Jaffna. Since the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK)and later the Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF) were the pre-dominant political parties in Jaffna, they received the lion\u2019s share in coverage but no party was ignored or denied adequate coverage.",
    "Sellathurai in his youth was an admirer of Tamil Nadu\u2019s \u201cDravida Kazhagham(DK) leader E. V. Ramaswamy known as \u201cPeriyaar\u201d. EVR\u2019s belief in the concepts of  \u201cSuyamariyaathai\u201d(self-respect) and \u201cSamuha Neethi\u201d(social justice) appealed to Sellathurai. He even went to India once and met Periyaar in person.  Sellathurai also staged dramas such as \u201cthookumedai\u201dand \u201cNachukkoappai\u201d that were  written by Kalaingar\u201dKarunanidhi who later became Tamil Nadu chief minister. However with the advent of the ITAK in 1949, Sellathurai became enamoured of the new party and its policies.",
    "Sellathurai\u2019s native village Atchuvely is part of the Kopay electoral division. He  has moved closely with  all Parliamentarians representing Kopay such as Vanniyasingham, Balasundaram. Kathiravetpillai and Aalaalasundara. In later years  he  got close to other ITAK/TULF leaders such as  Chelvanayagam, Naganathan,KP Ratnam,Amirthalingam, Sivasithamparan, Dharmalingam.Jeyakkodi and VN Navaratnam. Nevertheless, he always remained independent and fair in his political reporting.",
    "One of the news stories by Sellathurai that made a big splash in those days was one bordering on superstition  that he wrote on the eve of the 1970 election. Apparently three mishaps had occurred then at  different election meetings. The \u201cNiraikudam\u201d (auspicious pot) placed on a table on the stage at a meeting held by Former Uduppiddy MP M. Sivasithamparam had toppled. The stage had collapsed at a meeting held by former Vaddukkoddai MP A. Amirthalingam. The pandal set up at a meeting for former Nallur MP Dr.EMV Naganathan had fallen.",
    "Sellathurai threaded these three different  instances together  and wrote a news story implying that thse were three bad omens. All three  incumbent MPs Naganathan, Amirthalingam and Sivasithamparam lost their seats in Nallur, Vaddukkoddai and Uduppiddy in the 1970 election. SEllathurai\u2019s bad omen news became a sensation. Actually Sellathurai had realised that all three were going to face defeat and had indirectly predicted it through his artful news story.",
    "Sellathurai  would be  usually clad in a white verti and a cream coloured long sleeve shirt. It was like his uniform.Though a journalist by profession, Sellathurai never gave up being an agriculturist. He would get up early and devote the morning to agriculture. He cultivated onions and chillies.",
    "He would have an early lunch and take the bus to Jaffna.Atchuvely was 16 km away from Jaffna city. He would go to the Virakesari office on Station road and start work. He would use the office cycle to go to the Kachcheri, Municipality .Courts,Hospital ,University  or Police station  when necessary.Otherwise he would be on the telephone. Working at breakneck speed, Sellathurai would write his news stories, telephoning Colombo if required. Apart from the Viraqkesari, Sellathurai also wrote for the \u201cMithiran\u201dwhich was a spicy tabloid published by express newspapers ltd.",
    "Sellathurai  would wind up in the evening at 6.30 pm  and walk to the nearby railway station and send his  news  despatches by  railway parcel on the Colombo bound mail train. Sellathurai would then walk to the Jaffna bus stand and browse through papers ,magazines and books at the Poologasingham book depot",
    "Sellathurai  would then  buy his usual bundle of cigars, packet of scented arecanut  and sweets and biscuits for his children  and board the point pedro bound bus. He would get off at the Aavarankaal junction and go home. This routine would change if he had events or meetings to cover in the mornings or evenings.",
    "The hard-working Sellathurai  was diagnosed as having   cancer in 1981.He delayed hospitalization for a few months. This was because he wanted to cover the inaugural meeting of the Jaffna District Development Council. Sellathurai like many Tamils yearned for a devolution scheme that would bring about   power sharing.  He was happy even when the DDC scheme was set up but that too was a failure. Nevertheless, Sellathurai  delayed hospitalization simply because he wanted to cover the DDC  inaugural  meeting.",
    "The Virakesari Jaffna Correspondent was admitted to the National Hospital in Colombo where he underwent surgery. He returned home. After a few months he was  hospitalized again. After some time  his condition started deteriorating. The end seemed inevitable.",
    "Sellathurai returned home and passed away peacefully on 29 April 1982.He was 57 years old.The Virakesari  honoured Sellathurai by  publishing an   editorial about  him titled \u201cSeithi Mannan Sellathurai\u201d(news king Sellathurai). Large crowds including politicians from diverse parties attended his funeral",
    "Sinnathamby Sellathurai  married his cousin Rajeswari in 1955. They had 10 children ,four boys  and six girls. Some of his children now live abroad while the others are in Sri Lanka.One of his sons  joined the LTTE and was killed in a clash with the navy. Another son Ravichandran worked as  a journalist at the Virakesari in Jaffna.He later relocated to the Netherlands.",
    "There were three occasions when I worked in Jaffna during  the years I interacted with Sellathurai. The first was in 1979 when I acted as Jaffna correspondent for two days as he had to attend a media conference in Colombo. He was worried as to whether I could cope with the situation and gave me a lot of advice. Mr.Lionel Fernando was the GA in Jaffna then. In an interview ,Lionel disclosed details of an integrated development project for Jaffna district being in the pipeline. I knew it was a good story and immediately  filed it",
    "I was  then staying in one of the guest rooms at the Jaffna railway station as it was just a stone\u2019s throw away from the Virakesari office. I was fast asleep when Sellathurai returned to Jaffna on the mail train from Cololmbo. He came up to my rom and waved the Sunday Virakesari excitedly at me and said in Tamil\u201dYou have got a scoop. They have published it as the lead story. Very good,very good\u201d.  He treated me with great affection and respect after that.",
    "The Second was in the first week of June 1981. The Police had gone on the rampage and burnt down the monumental Jaffna library, \u201cEelanaadu  newspaper office,Jaffna MP Yogeswaran\u2019s house and the TULF office and other buildings,shops and vehicles. It was a kind of emergency situation and the Virakesari flew me by air on an Upali Airlines flight to Jaffna to work with Sellathurai in Jaffna Those were strenuous yet exciting days.  Both of us worked in tandem to provide news from Jaffna to the Virakesari readers. This experience strengthened the bond between us.",
    "The third in 1981 was when he was diagnosed with cancer. It was Sellathurai\u2019s wish that I should act as Jaffna correspondent when he was in hospital. He wrote a letter to editor Sivapragasam about who his  replacement should be. Sellathurai did not mention me by name but laid down some conditions that were applicable only to me.Editor Sivapragasam read out the letter, chuckled and said he wants me to send you without telling me so. That was how I became the Virakesari\u2019s Jaffna correspondent as a replacement for Sellathurai while he was warded at the national hospital in Colombo.",
    "While working in Jaffna,I had to cover an important meeting of the TULF  at their office in Thirunelvely.The press  was debarred from that  closed door meeting. The highlight was Opposition leader A. Amirthalingam\u2019s address. Adopting certain stratagems I managed to infiltrate that meeting. The Virakesari had my report as the lead story. Fellow journalists in Jaffna were puzzled as to how I had  managed to report in detail.",
    "The greatest compliment however came from Sellathurai who said you have somehow been able to be present at the meeting. None could have reported Amirthalingam\u2019s speech with such detail without being physically present. He then hazarded a guess as to how I may have pulled it off.He was spot on. Sellathurai reading the paper on his hospital bed had realized how the story had been written. Such was  his experience and expertise in  Journalism!",
    "This then is the tale of a Tamil journalist who was devoted to his profession or rather vocation. I consider myself fortunate  for having been able to  interacted with him. He was quite fond of me and would say \u201cI want you to  become the editor of the Virakesari one day.\u201d Sellathurai Annan as I called him was hugely disappointed when I moved to English journalism by joining \u201cThe Island\u201d. Yet he wished me well. His one request to me  was  \u201cThamizhaiyum Thamizharaiyum Marrakka Vaendaam\u201d(Do not forget Tamil or the Tamils).I have not forgotten that request.",
