LetтАЩs build a parliament that values progress over politics, one that can make bold decisions for the betterment of Sri Lanka

Just a few weeks ago, Sri Lanka elected a new President, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, with high hopes for real, lasting change. But real change isnтАЩt something a President can achieve alone. If we truly want to see our nation thrive, we need to come together in the upcoming General Election to build a strong, united parliament that supports the PresidentтАЩs vision: A Thriving Nation тАУ A Beautiful Life.

### Overhead bridge being used for multiple purposes

*2024-11-06 05:45:59* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Overhead-bridge-being-used-for-multiple-purposes/14-768875) ┬╖ `en`

The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (DriebergтАЩs Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets тАУ smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

### Rethinking Central Bank independence in Sri LankaтАЩs development journey

*2024-11-06 05:38:36* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rethinking-Central-Bank-independence-in-Sri-Lanka-s-development-journey/4-768873) ┬╖ `en`

Although an independent CBSL is intended to operate free from political interference, it remains heavily influenced by IMF directives, fostering dependency on IMF guidance

As Sri Lanka prepares for a new government post-14 November, it must carefully evaluate the extent of external influence on its economic policy. A critical question is whether Sri Lanka has already ceded too much control over its monetary and fiscal policy decisions to outside actors. Aligning national development goals of the new government will likely require greater coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, ensuring they operate in tandem to achieve shared objectives. The CBSL should retain the flexibility for strategic interventions that foster growth, development, and social welfare when needed

### Strategic focus and agility in unpredictable markets

*2024-11-06 05:31:18* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Strategic-focus-and-agility-in-unpredictable-markets/4-768871) ┬╖ `en`

One of the greatest challenges for commercial leaders is balancing immediate needs with long-term growth strategies

Commercial leaders today are tasked with steering their organisations through increasingly unpredictable markets. Maintaining strategic focus while being agile is crucial for weathering sudden disruptions. Leaders must balance the long-term vision with the need to adapt swiftly to unforeseen challenges, requiring a deep understanding of market factors like consumer behaviour, competitor activity, and regulatory shifts. Regular reassessment of strategic objectives is key, and when market conditions change, quick pivots are critical.

Agility doesnтАЩt mean losing sight of the long-term strategy; it enhances execution by empowering teams to make informed, real-time decisions. Scenario planning is essential for staying aligned with core goals while adjusting to evolving conditions. This blend of focus and agility helps organisations remain proactive and adaptable.

It seems that the NPP Government does not have any new or innovative ways to run the country. President Anura Kumara is just following the path that Ranil Wickremesinghe took in terms of reforms and Mahinda Rajapaksa when it comes to infrastructure development. He follows both the leaders. With regard to national security, he can follow Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Earlier, the NPP was condemning the state intelligence agencies to get political mileage but now President Anura KumaraтАЩs stance is different. This shows he is now on the correct path by following all previous leaders

Says SLPP is the best party which can give leadership to social democracy

Claims Sajith Premadasa has absolutely failed and SLPP has great opportunity to take leadership of the Opposition

Says NPP will bring more senior JVPers but not new NPPers to Parliament

Tips SLPP, Ranil WickremesingheтАЩs party and SJB will bring new faces to Parliament

Cautions NPPers in Parliament will have serious issues due to their inexperience

We all know that in Sri Lanka, students are separated to specialized subject areas a bit too early. This early specialization continues even at universities. Now, some students are admitted to universities directly from the University Grant Commission and they are not allowed to segue into any other stream of leaning. In some cases, they cannot even take classes in another subject. In addition, there are departments in our faculties looking to seize the first opportunity to break away and establish their own faculties isolating further in their own expertise.
