  "original_body_lines": [
    "The visa waiver initiative should not serve as a smokescreen for the continued absence of a coherent international marketing campaign. Despite repeated proclamations, no meaningful effort has materialised\u2014even though the necessary funds have long been available.",
    "This failure to properly position Sri Lanka is doing real harm. It contributes to suppressed room rates across all categories of accommodation and deters foreign direct investment, which remains significantly lower than in competing regional markets due to weak margins. Ask any hotelier.",
    "Recent comparisons positioning Sri Lanka as the \u201cnext Bali\u201d\u2014with all the baggage of overtourism\u2014have been rightly rejected by local tourism stakeholders. But distancing ourselves from that path requires deliberate, proactive steps to shape Sri Lanka\u2019s growth in a strategic and sustainable way. A focus on revenue and higher value travellers, rather than volume-driven overtourism, demands thoughtful destination marketing\u2014not price cuts, whether on visas or hotel rooms.",
    "If a traveller chooses Sri Lanka primarily because of a waived visa fee, that signals a deeper issue: we have failed to clearly communicate what makes the destination exceptional. The decision to visit should be inspired by Sri Lanka\u2019s remarkable offerings\u2014not driven by a modest cost saving. For most travellers, what matters is a seamless online visa process\u2014which Sri Lanka already provides, aside from a temporary disruption last year.",
    "The decline in arrivals during June and July is unsurprising. These months have traditionally been considered off-season. Without a sustained marketing effort to position Sri Lanka as a year-round destination, dips in visitation during this period are inevitable. (Read our article \u2018Rethinking Seasonality\u2019 for further insights.)",
    "A national tourism brand cannot be built on sporadic initiatives. It requires professional storytelling, strategic global media partnerships, a robust digital presence, and consistent messaging. Priority must be given to digital marketing, leveraging platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to tell compelling stories\u2014highlighting Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse, year-round appeal, from surfing in Arugam Bay to trekking the Pekoe Trail in the central highlands.",
    "Moreover, campaigns must be segmented by market. What appeals to an Indian family traveller differs from what attracts a European wellness seeker. Targeted, data-informed messaging is essential. Public\u2013private collaboration must be deepened, with coordinated campaigns co-created alongside industry stakeholders.",
    "Sri Lanka remains an extraordinary destination\u2014rich in natural beauty, culture, and diversity. Yet it continues to undersell itself due to weak and fragmented communication. This must change if we are to unlock the country\u2019s full tourism potential and uplift the millions of livelihoods that depend on it. While the cost of living is a global challenge that Governments alone cannot resolve, the focus must shift to raising incomes. Tourism offers one of the most effective pathways to achieve this\u2014even in the most remote corners of the country.",
    "However, realising this potential requires capability, strategic vision, and committed leadership. Let\u2019s hope we can soon shift the narrative from untapped promise to meaningful progress."
