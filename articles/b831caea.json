  "original_body_lines": [
    "Newly elected Jaffna district independent MP Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna has issued a public apology after occupying the seat traditionally reserved for the Leader of the Opposition during the ceremonial opening of the first session of the 10th Parliament.",
    "The incident unfolded when the MP refused to vacate the Leader of the Opposition\u2019s seat despite repeated requests from parliamentary staff. As a result, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa was compelled to sit at the corner of the front row.",
    "Addressing the controversy on his personal social media account yesterday, Ramanathan revealed that he had publicly apologised during an introductory workshop for newly elected MPs in Parliament. \u201cI recognise the importance of maintaining decorum and respect in all discussions,\u201d he wrote, expressing gratitude to his colleagues and the public for their understanding. Speaking to the media yesterday, Ramanathan explained that he had been unaware the seat was reserved for the Opposition Leader. \u201cWe were informed that MPs could sit anywhere, so I took the seat. Had it been marked or noted, I would not have done so,\u201d he said. However, during the incident, Ramanathan reportedly told parliamentary staff, \u201cTradition is being changed,\u201d when they asked him to move.",
    "The matter had also been raised with the Secretary-General of Parliament, Kushani Rohanadeera, but no action was taken as MPs had been informed they were allowed to sit wherever they chose on the day.",
    "Earlier, Speaker Ashoka Ranwala had indicated his intention to hold discussions with Dr Archchuna regarding the incident, stressing the importance of respecting parliamentary traditions."
