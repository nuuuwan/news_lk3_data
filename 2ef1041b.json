    "Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando says that the government is working to withdraw from the Co-operative service programme.",
    "However, the minister emphasized that if the Co-operative service is affected by the government\u2019s intervention, the government should refrain from intervening in its activities.",
    "\u201cWe are now thinking about how the government can leave the Co-operatives business\u201d, he said.",
    "\u201cWe can only move forward with this program if the Co-operative suggests itself on what kind of intervention [from the govt.] they need and how they need that intervention to happen. We should then move with those suggestions.\u201d",
    "\u201cTherefore, especially the Prime Minister and I were thinking to take decisions in this regard in the near future\u201d, he added."
