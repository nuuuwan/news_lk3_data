    "India\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 vote on the UN General Assembly\u2019s (UNGA) December 12th resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza raises many a thought-provoking issue in relation to a country\u2019s national interest and its foreign policy thinking and stances. The resolution is of particular interest on account of the fact that India abstained from voting on a similar UNGA resolution that was passed overwhelmingly by the Assembly close on the heels of the October 7th carnage in the Gaza.",
    "India\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN Ruchira Khamboj, reports said, had not clarified any reasons for India\u2019s shift in stance on the issues in question, just within a couple of months, but had drawn the attention of the UN community to several \u2018dimensions\u2019 to the crisis. One of these is the Gaza\u2019s \u2018humanitarian crisis and large scale loss of lives.\u2019 Other \u2018dimensions\u2019 are the need for the world to observe international humanitarian law \u2018in all circumstances\u2019 and the importance of finding a lasting solution to the Middle East crisis, based on the \u2018two state solution.\u2019",
    "It would be reasonable to take up the position that India\u2019s assessment of what is in its best interests in relation to the Gaza carnage had changed within two months. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with such shifting of stances.",
    "While at the time of the explosive emergence of the Gaza violence India would have needed to make it clear to the world that it does not endorse terroristic violence emanating from any quarter, for whatever reason, two months later it would have been compelled to take into consideration the tragic fallout from the violence on the civilians on both sides of the divide and the paramount need for a country to endorse international humanitarian law. All such cardinal considerations, in other words, accord perfectly with what India considers as its national or best interest.",
    "It stands to reason that a country\u2019s best interests would determine its foreign policy thinking and the basic parameters of the latter. It comes as a welcome development that India, being a principal \u2018Swing State\u2019, has taken into consideration the need for it to be profoundly sensitive to the requirements international humanitarian law.",
    "Thereby, India transmits to the world the crucial importance of the latter abiding by the main tenets of international humanitarian law, besides acting always in deference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
    "It is obligatory on the part of all major powers to evince deep sensitivity to international humanitarian law and its dictates. In this respect India has done right but the same could not be said of the US and Russia. The latter has shown least interest in the preservation of civilian lives in the Ukraine while the US, although voicing humanitarian concerns in the Gaza theatre, is yet to call unambiguously for a ceasefire in the latter conflagration.",
    "Once again, each of the latter states\u2019 national interest would need to be factored in when seeking reasons for their seeming indifference to the loss of civilian lives and other concerns in the relevant war zones. Russia sees the annexation of Ukraine, at whatever cost, to be integral to its national or best interests at present while the US considers it obligatory, given its national interest, to champion Israel\u2019s security considerations. From the US viewpoint, a ceasefire right now, could undermine Israel\u2019s security concerns and consequently, what the US considers as its best interests.",
    "For the student and analyst of international relations these are thought-provoking matters of the first importance. India\u2019s change of stance referred to above, while focusing on the central importance of a country\u2019s national interest to its foreign policy thinking, demonstrates also that what a state sees as its national interest is not static but dynamic and subject to change, depending on the developments of the day.",
    "The Russian and the US cases testify to the fact that a country\u2019s national interest may not necessarily be consistent with international humanitarian law and its obligations always.",
    "Meanwhile, in what may be seem as a curious development in South Asian inter-state politics, the Maldives has decided to introduce some substantial changes to its security policy. In terms of these changes, the new President of the Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, is considering it advisable to order the removal of all foreign military personnel from his country. This would mean that a small contingent of Indian security forces personnel that has been hitherto stationed in the Maldives would have to leave it.",
    "Muizzu is regarded as close to China and his moves on the Indian security contingent are seen as a boon to China but the Maldivian President is also on record that he means to pursue a balanced foreign policy, which would translate into the maintenance of amicability with all states. \u201cI will keep friendship with foreign countries. There won\u2019t be any enmity with countries close and far away, Muizzu is reported to have stated.",
    "However, these substantial changes on the security front are a marked departure from the hitherto Malidivian policy of maintaining close security and foreign relations with India. Some past President of the Maldives, for instance, pursued an \u2018India First\u2019 policy. Critics cannot be faulted, therefore, for seeing Muizzu\u2019s initiatives as a dilution of the Malidives\u2019 traditional closeness to India.",
    "As to whether these Maldivian initiatives would pay off in the medium and long terms is left to be seen, but considering that it would be in the best interests of India\u2019s closest neighbours to maintain close and mutually-beneficial relations with her first, the advisability of the Maldives\u2019 new foreign policy orientation could very well be questioned.",
    "Nevertheless, the Muizzu administration would be compelled to do a tight rope walk in its ties with India and China. Past experience establishes the advisability of India\u2019s close neighbours prioritizing good relations with India above all else in the foreign relations sphere. Good relations with China are advisable, considering the latter\u2019s obvious strengths, but alienating India in the process could turn out to be hazardous for the small states in particular of South Asia.",
    "Right now, therefore, it is open to question whether the Maldivian foreign and security policies are being crafted with the country\u2019s best interests in mind. After all, such policies need to be anchored in the state\u2019s national interest. However, these are issues that the Maldivian people need to deliberate on in the first instance.",
