    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s legislators have politicized the topics of rape and violence without addressing the elephant in the room, Jeevan Thondaman, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development said in parliament on Monday (4).",
    "\u201cAll the members here are talking about rape. What happens after that? We must talk about abortion rights. That is not something anyone wants to touch on, and that is why we are in this place right now,\u201d Thondaman said.",
    "\u201cDespite alarming statistics on rape and violence, women are often blamed and punished for it. The criminalisation of abortion is a major example of this.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world. According to a 2016 estimate by the Health Ministry, he said, approximately 658 abortions take place a day, and close to 250,000 a year.",
    "He added that what was needed at this point in time was comprehensive sexual education (CSE) for children and young people.",
    "\u201cOnly through CSE in schools will children and young people develop, accurate, age appropriate knowledge attitude and skills; positive values such as respect for human rights, gender equality, diversity and attitude and skills that contribute to a safe, healthy and positive relationship.\u201d",
    "Thondaman pointed out that CSE plays a pivotal role in preparing young people for a world where HIV, AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancies, and sexual and gender based violence still pose a risk to their well-being.",
    "\u201cCSE basically empowers children take control and make informed decisions freely and responsibly.\u201d",
    "Thondaman also highlighted the findings of a 2021 study (Fatalities_20211109_UNFPA) by the UNFPA and the University of Kelaniya that showed that a majority of women killed in Sri Lanka were murdered by those close to them.",
    "\u201c62 percent of homicides of Sri Lankan women are committed by either an intimate partner, ex-partner or family member. 84 percent are killed in their own homes by someone they know.\u201d",
    "Police and the judiciary have failed Sri Lanka\u2019s women, the minister pointed out.",
    "\u201cOnly 5 percent of these cases, between 2013-2017, were ever concluded. Men claim they were provoked, or are of unsound mind or have mental illness: These have been successful defenses. And the Police often express sympathy to this narrative as opposed to the victim\u2019s.\u201d",
    "It takes 7-10 years for a child rape case to conclude, he pointed out.",
    "Establishment of child courts are needed, he said, as well as several legislative amendments. \u201cThe government is working on a new law to reform the domestic violence act, reform of marriage and divorce laws to ensure there is an easier path to divorce: no one should be forced to remain in a marriage that is either abusive or not healthy.\u201d (Colombo/Dec4/2023)"
