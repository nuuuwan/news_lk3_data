    "Around 350 distinguished guests, including Deputy Governor of Nairobi City\u00a0 Njoroge Muchiri, Ambassadors, UN officials, business leaders, and members of the Sri Lankan community residing in Kenya attended the event.",
    "The ceremonial opening included the traditional Sri Lankan gesture of offering beetle leaves and Independence Day commemorative shawls to the guests. High Commissioner Kana\u00a0 Kananathan then hoisted the national flag, accompanied by the Kenyan Police Band playing the Sri Lankan national anthem.",
    "A poignant moment unfolded during the celebration with the symbolic lighting of the oil lamp.

It serves as a compelling testament to the commitment to unity and a shared national identity that transcends boundaries."
