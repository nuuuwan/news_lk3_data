    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Ministry of Power and Energy announced preparations for a potential reduction in electricity tariffs starting in January 2024.",
    "State Minister Indika Anuruddha attributed this possibility to two key factors: increased hydropower generation and the purchase of coal at a lower price.",
    "Anuruddha noted that coal purchases in 2023 were lower compared to the previous year, contributing to potential cost savings.",
    "However, he emphasized the need for discussions with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to determine the exact price adjustments.",
    "The Ministry plans to submit proposals for electricity tariff revisions to the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) in the near future. The PUCSL will then review the proposals and make a final decision on any tariff changes.",
