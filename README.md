### Sajith Premadasa presents social democratic, progressive-centrist alternative; Namal goes Rahul

“Sri Lankans are more likely to think the country is headed in the wrong direction than people in any other country where this is polled. In June–July 2024, a global average of 62% of adults polled by IPSOS in 29 countries thought their country was headed in the wrong direction compared with 93% in Sri Lanka.”

With only 8% of citizens thinking that the country is going in the right direction and 72% thinking it is “on the wrong track”, it would be borderline lunacy to assume that Ranil, ably supported by the most detested parliamentarians since 1970-77, could get into double-digits in September. “…Public views towards the country’s direction have worsened since July 2023, driven by a steady decline in uncommitted respondents.” (Ibid)

*2024-08-14 17:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191098) · `ta`

An employee at the Arctic Radar site in Nunavut, Canada, died from a rare snow bear attack, the second such incident in recent years. Snow bear populations, affected by global warming, are decreasing. Meanwhile, a black bear attack in Montana endangered a child, highlighting the danger these animals pose despite their smaller size compared to polar bears.

🟩

An employee who worked at the Arctic Radar site in the northern Nunawat of Canada has died after being hit by two snow bears.

The attack took place on Breward Island, southeast of Bafin Island.

The deceased is working at the Nasituk Corporation, a company that operates radar security sites on behalf of the Canadian government.

In these areas, the snow bear attack on humans is rarely occurring.

“The safety and well -being of our employees is one of the main. We are very obliged to ensure a safe workshop for employees, ”the company said.

This is the second incident that followed after the snow bear struck last year.

Last year, a woman and her 1 -year -old son were attacked by a bear in the village of Alaskan.

Two -thirds of the world's snow bears ie 17,000 bears in Canada. The number of snow bears is decreasing. Scientists say that the global warming is the cause of the destruction of glaciers and the destruction of places for reproduction.

### Our choice is Ranil Wickremesinghe;He is the one who bravely declares that the 13th Amendment should continue and practice it - Ali Sabri

*2024-08-14 17:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191086) · `ta`

In the midst of Sri Lanka's political climate, the focus shifts towards Ranil Wickremesinghe, praised for his bravery in advocating for the continuation and implementation of the 13th Amendment, a stance considered bold amidst the pre-presidential election dynamics. Despite historical political differences, the emphasis is on addressing current challenges, particularly economic ones, rather than adhering strictly to party lines. Wickremesinghe is highlighted for his experience and potential to navigate the complexities of governance, including economic management and foreign relations. The decision by the Sri Lanka PA to field its own candidate is noted, with internal support leaning towards Wickremesinghe due to his leadership in initiating economic recovery efforts. The majority of the Sri Lanka PA's MPs have chosen Wickremesinghe, indicating a significant alignment within the party. Criticisms from Namal Rajapaksa are acknowledged as part of democratic discourse, while Wickremesinghe's suitability in fostering a common Sri Lankan identity is underscored through his track record of addressing issues affecting the common good. The upcoming election is anticipated to feature strong contenders, with the outcome to be determined by the voters on September 21st.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe is brave enough that the 13th Amendment should continue and implement it. It is impossible to report this in Sri Lanka's political environment before the presidential election. External Affairs and Justice Minister Ali Sabri said that this is the most difficult issue, saying that Ranil Wickremesinghe is very relevant in our choices.

Question - What are your feelings about campaigning in favor of someone who has worked against you throughout your political life?

Answer - This is a part of politics. It is necessary to examine the current challenges and priority to the country than to be stubborn about parties and political leaders.

So what is important in this moment. Especially economics.

We must choose someone who can face these challenges. Because of this I choose him.

Question - You have consistently stated that it is the most important thing to strengthen the country's stability. Do you not think that anyone like Dhammika can help at this moment?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has revealed plans to provide relief for personal income tax in the near future as the government is considering adjustments to the personal income tax structure to provide relief to taxpayers, the President’s Media Division reported.

Following the strong performance in tax revenue this year, the government has proposed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an adjustment in Personal Income Tax slabs from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 720,000, aiming to provide relief to mid-level taxpayers affected by recent tax reforms, he said.
