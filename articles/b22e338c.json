    "Is the \u201cHouse of Rajapaksa\u201d Falling Down? was the heading of an article written by me for our sister paper the \u201cDaily Mirror\u201d two and a half  years ago. The article was   published on 23 April 2022 when the \u201cAragalaya\u201d(struggle) protests were going on. The article focused on the  Rajapaksa family and its struggle to  stay afloat  in power despite the rising tide of public resentment and anger.The  following two paragraphs are excerpted from that article.-",
    "\u201cAt one point in  time the Rajapaksas seemed all-powerful and invincible. Today the wheel has turned full circle. The Rajapaksa brand is crumbling. The House of Rajapaksa is tumbling. The reasons are well-known and need no elaboration at this juncture. The agitation at Galle Face in particular and the related protests in different parts of the country in general are all focused on ousting the Rajapaksas from power. Initially it seemed that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the sole target. Subsequently the protest  enlarged into one demanding the exit of the entire Rajapaksa clan and a return of the loot allegedly robbed by the family over the years. \u201c",
    "\u201cOne thing however is crystal clear. President Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Rajapaksa and their Govt. may be able to withstand the protests and stay in power without stepping down but their effectiveness would diminish. The Rajapaksa regime would only be a \u2018lame duck\u2019 Govt. Furthermore it is highly unlikely that the Rajapaksas would be able to regain power and prestige as a dominant political dynasty again. Individual Rajapaksas could remain in politics but being a dominant political family again seems out of the question. The House of Rajapaksa may not see a total political downfall but it is certainly falling down.\u201d",
    "As  is well known the house of Rajapaksa did fall . With Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s exit and Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s entry ,effective power shifted from the Rajapaksas to Wickremesinghe.   The Rajapaksa dynasty\u2019s political  power and influence began eroding.This was made  clear when the Presidential elections were held this year. When the Rajapaksas backstabbed Wickremesinghe by refusing to support his candidacy,over 90 MPs of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) crossed over to Ranil\u2019s side.",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s eldest son and crown prince of the Rajapaksa dynasty Namal Rajapaksa contested as the SLPP candidate in  the presidential election held on September 21st. He fared miserably polling only 342,781 (2.57%) votes. Moreover Namal Rajapaksa was trounced in the family  citadel  of Hambantota district. Fearing perhaps another drubbing, Namal has refrained from contesting the Parliament election scheduled for November 14th. He has opted to be on the national list.",
    "Thus for the first time in about eight decades, a member of the Rajapaksa dynasty will not be contesting  from Hambantota district in an election to the legislature. Namal\u2019s first cousins Shasheendra Rajapaksa and Nipuna Ranawaka will be contesting from the Moneragala and Matara districts respectively but none from the Medamulana clan are in the field on their home turf Hambantota.",
    "This shows that the Rajapaksa moon has waned. It remains to be seen as to whether  it would wax again. What is certain however is the fact that the Rajapaksa political dynasty has reached a dead end. It is against this backdrop therefore that this column -with the aid of earlier writings \u2013   traces  the political rise and fall of the Rajapaksa dynasty this week.",
    "The Royal Family in the UK is known as the House of Windsor. The Rajapaksas are neither royal nor aristocratic, but as one time  \u201crulers \u201c of Sri Lanka the family could very well be dubbed as the \u201cHouse of Rajapaksa\u201d. At its zenith, the House of Rajapaksa had four Rajapaksa brothers from one generation holding the reins in Government as President, Prime Minister and cabinet ministers.",
    "Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also the Minister of Defence. Ex- Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was Minister of Economic Policies and Plan Implementation, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious & Cultural Affairs and Minister of Urban Development and Housing. Basil Rajapaksa was Finance Minister. Eldest brother Chamal Rajapaksa was Cabinet Minister of Irrigation. He was also the State Minister of National Security and Disaster Management. It was estimated  then that 72% of the total budgetary allocations to ministries were to those under the purview of the Rajapaksa family.",
    "Then  were also three politicos  from  the younger generation in the Rajapaksa family. Mahinda\u2019s son Namal Rajapaksa was the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports and State Minister of Digital Technology and Enterprise Development. Chamal\u2019s son Shasheendra Rajapaksa who was earlier the Chief Minister of Uva Province was a state minister with an \u201cextensive\u201d portfolio. He was the Minister of State for Organic Fertilizer Production, Supply and Regulation and Paddy and Grains, Organic Food, Vegetables, Fruits, Chillies, Onion and Potato Cultivation Promotion, Seed Production and Advanced Technology for Agriculture. In addition to Namal and Shasheendra, another cousin Nipuna Ranawaka was  an elected MP. He is the son of the youngest Rajapaksa daughter Gandani Ranawaka who is no more.",
    "The rise and growth of \u2018political families\u2019  have been  a common occurrence in Sri Lanka. Ever since the island known formerly as Ceylon gained limited forms of representative democracy through Legislative and State Councils during British rule, the practice of members of the same family seeking posts through elections became widely prevalent. The advent of parliamentary elections coupled with freedom from colonial bondage saw the political dynasty phenomenon gain further mileage. Political families began proliferating at multiple levels from local authorities to the supreme legislature.",
    "Family politics became  a familiar feature of Sri  Lanka\u2019s political landscape cutting across race, religion, caste and creed. A perusal of a list of Sri Lankan political families in alphabetical order starting from the Abdul Majeeds of the East and going down to the Yapa Abeywardenas of the South would reveal that ethnicity is no bar to family bandyism of a political nature in Sri  Lanka.",
    "There are various types of political dynasties at different levels from the national, provincial, district and electoral division levels. There are also different degrees of pedigree and vintage in these dynasties. While there are many regional and sub-regional political families, there have been only three major family formations dominating politics at a national level so far in Sri  Lanka.",
    "The first was  the \u2018Bothale Dynasty\u2019 of D.S. Senanayake, his son Dudley Senanayake and nephew Sir John Kotelawala along with extended family members J.R. Jayewardene and Ranil Wickremesinghe. The next was the \u2018Horagolla Dynasty\u2019 of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, his wife Sirimavo Ratwatte Bandaranaike, daughter Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and son Anura Bandaranaike. Interestingly, Chandrika\u2019s husband Vijaya Kumaratunga though an actor was also a politician. Both the Bothale and Horagolla dynasties were paramount in 20th century Sri Lankan politics since Independence.",
    "The  third political family that came into its own in the 21st century was the \u2018Medamulana Dynasty\u2019 comprising the family members of Don Alvin Rajapaksa \u2013 Sons Chamal, Mahinda, Basil and Gotabaya along with grandsons Namal , Shasheendra. And Nipuna.",
    "Although the \u2018Ruhunu Rajapaksas\u2019  have been in politics for several decades starting from the days of the State Council, its ascendancy to the pinnacle of power came only in the new millennium. This became possible only after Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa, known to his country and the world at large as Mahinda Rajapaksa, became Sri  Lanka\u2019s fifth Executive President on November 18, 2005. Thereafter, the Rajapaksas established themselves rapidly as the \u2018numero uno\u2019 family in Sri Lankan politics.",
    "Apart from Mahinda Rajapaksa as President, family members and extended family members monopolised plum positions. Various posts in different spheres \u2013 from Defence Secretary to diplomatic representative \u2013 were held by the clan. Some were elected to office while others were appointed. Some proved their capability by efficiently discharging their duties while others failed miserably demonstrating the negativity of nepotism.",
    "During the days of the Rajapaksa regimes, it was an open secret that no major enterprise or project could be undertaken in the island without the blessings of at least one Rajapaksa. In those days, most movers and shakers in Sri Lankan society derived their power and energy from the Rajapaksa \u2018generator.",
    "The rise of Rajapaksas as a formidable political family in Ruhuna began with Don David Vidanarachchi Rajapaksa, the grandfather of Mahinda, Gotabaya and siblings and great grandfather of their offspring. Don David Rajapaksa hailed from Buddhiyagama at Weeraketiya in the Southern Hambantota District. The ancient Ruhunu Kingdom of the Sinhala Kings consisted of what are today the Administrative Districts of Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Moneragala. Don David or D.D. Rajapaksa was the hereditary \u2018Vidane Arachchi\u2019 or village headman of a cluster of villages and hamlets known as \u2018Ihala Valikada Korale.\u2019",
    "The area inhabited by the Rajapaksa family was the division known as \u2018Giruweva/Giruwapattuwa.\u2019 It was an agricultural region where the growing of crops and vegetables, coconut cultivation and buffalo/cattle rearing were the basis of the local economy. \u2018Slash and burn\u2019 chena cultivation was a fact of life. Cultivation of \u2018Kurakkan\u2019 or millet was widely prevalent and the region was regarded generally as \u2018Kurakkan Country.\u2019",
    "D.D. Rajapaksa had three sons and a daughter. The eldest was Don Coronelis Rajapaksa or D.C. Rajapaksa, who served as coroner of the area. The daughter was Dona Carolina Bandara Weeraman. The second son was Don Mathew Rajapaksa while the youngest son was Don Alvin Rajapaksa.",
    "The direct entry into electoral politics was made by Don Mathew Rajapaksa or D.M. Rajapaksa who was elected State Councillor during British rule. D.M. Rajapaksa was  known popularly as  the \u2018Lion of Ruhunu.\u2019 When universal suffrage was introduced and elections to the State Council were held in 1931, D.M. Rajapaksa supported V.S. Wickramanayake in the Hambantota constituency. Wickramanayake was elected.",
    "In 1936, D.M. Rajapaksa himself plunged directly into politics and faced hustings. In those days, candidates used different colours for their respective ballot boxes. DM chose brown, the colour of Kurakkan, to symbolise \u2018Kurakkan Country.\u2019 He won with a majority of 12,097 votes.",
    "It was D.M. Rajapaksa who first started the practice of wearing a Kurakkan-coloured shawl to symbolise Giruwapattuwa. This was followed by his brother DA and his sons  and grandsons later. The \u2018Sataka\u2019 worn by the Rajapaksas of today was not merely due to notions of sartorial elegance. The practice has deeper meaningful roots.",
    "Unfortunately, D.M. Rajapaksa died at the age of 49 in May 1945. His eldest son Lakshman born in July 1924 had not even reached the voting age of 21 then. The mantle therefore fell on his unassuming younger brother Don Alvin Rajapaksa. Their father D.D. Rajapaksa had died in 1912.",
    "While D.M. Rajapaksa had taken to social service and politics, his brother D.A. Rajapaksa had tended to look after the family occupation of farming and livestock breeding. The elder brother lived at the \u2018Mahagedara\u2019 in Kondagala and the younger at  the Medamulana \u201cMahagedara.\u201d",
    "After D.M. Rajapaksa\u2019s demise, the people of Giruwapattuwa wanted D.A. Rajapaksa to step into his brother\u2019s shoes. The simple DA, content with his agriculture, refused. Finally, a deputation of notables went in procession to the paddy field where DA was engaged in ploughing. The delegation had with them the nomination papers and pressed DA to replace his brother in the State Council.",
    "Finally, Don Alvin agreed. He washed the mud off his hands and legs and signed the nomination papers, whereupon one person removed his shawl and wrapped it around D.A. Rajapaksa in a symbolic gesture. The Kurakkan Sataka tradition continued. The Kurakkan Sataka became a hallmark of Rajapaksa family politics.",
    "D.A. Rajapaksa was elected unopposed to the State Council representing the Hambantota constituency on July 14, 1945. When he entered State Council and took his oaths on August 8, 1945, he became a member of the Executive Committee on Agriculture and Lands.",
    "After independence from Britain, D.A. Rajapaksa represented the Beliatta seat in Parliament from 1947 to 1965 with a short break in March1960 when he lost to D.P. Atapattu of the UNP. D.A. Rajapaksa lost in 1965 to D.P. Atapattu again. D.A. Rajapaksa won Beliatta on the UNP ticket in 1947 and thereafter on the SLFP ticket till \u201965.",
    "Don Alvin Rajapaksa was a faithful deputy of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who crossed over from the UNP to SLFP on July 12, 1951. Five others \u2013 A.P. Jayasooriya, George R. de Silva, Jayaweera Kuruppu, D.S. Goonesekera and D.A. Rajapaksa \u2013 were supposed to follow suit, but when the moment came, only D.A. Rajapaksa crossed the floor behind Bandaranaike like his faithful shadow. The others got cold feet to cross over in the House but did so later.",
    "On September 2, 1951, the SLFP was formed. DA was one of the 44 signatories giving notice of the formation of the SLFP. In the May 1952 elections, the fledgling SLFP won nine seats. D.A. Rajapaksa was one of the nine victors.",
    "In spite of these impressive credentials and loyalty, D.A. Rajapaksa was not a minister in the 1956 Cabinet or 1960 July Cabinet. This was due to his simplicity, lack of ambition, love of his roots and abhorrence for the trappings of power.  He served as a deputy minister in the SWRD Bandaranaike Govt. He was also deputy speaker after  Sirimavo Bandaranaike became  PM in 1960. DA Rajapaksa  died in 1967.",
    "Don Alvin Rajapaksa married Dona Dandina Samarasinghe Dissanayake of Palatuwa, Matara. They had nine children \u2013 six boys and three girls. Their names are Chamal, Jayanthi (deceased), Mahinda, Tudor (deceased), Gotabaya, Basil, Preethi, Dudley and Gandini (deceased). DA who had lost elections in 1965 passed away on November 7, 1967.",
    "Meanwhile, eldest son Chamal Rajapaksa joined the police force as a Sub-Inspector. After DA\u2019s death, Sri Lanka Freedom Party leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike offered the post of party organiser for Beliatta to Chamal. He declined and recommended his younger brother Mahinda instead.",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa who studied at Richmond College in Galle and at Nalanda and Thurstan Colleges in Colombo was then working as an assistant librarian at VidyodayaUniversity later to be made Vidyodaya Campus and now Sri Jayewardenepura University. It was during this time that Mahinda got enamoured of left-leaning politics. He became a card-carrying member of the Ceylon Mercantile Union (CMU).",
    "Initially, Mrs. Bandaranaike was hesitant thinking Mahinda was too young and somewhat irresponsible. Later on, she relented and appointed Mahinda as Beliatta Organiser in 1968. This brought about a marked change in Mahinda. He buckled down to the task and strove to meet the challenge. He gave up his assistant librarian job and relocated to Medamulana. He began working with the people at the grassroots level.",
    "The 1970 elections saw the United Front sweeping polls with SLFP getting ninety-one seats and LSSP and CP winning nineteen and six seats respectively. Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa, known as Mahinda, defeated his rival from the UNP, Dr. Ranjith K.P. Atapattu to be elected as Beliatta MP.. Mahinda got 23,103 votes and Ranjith 16,477. In 1977, the roles were reversed with Ranjith Atapattu winning 24,289 votes while Mahinda got 17,896. Interestingly, Mahinda\u2019s father D.A. Rajapaksa and Ranjith\u2019s father D.P. Atapattu had been rivals contesting Beliatta in each election from 1947. Sadly, both fathers were not alive to see their sons become Beliatta MPs.",
    "Those were the days when ministers were proportionately few and the fresher Mahinda remained a backbencher throughout the life of the 1970-\u201977 Parliament. Some changes made in the admissions criteria to Law College enabled Mahinda to enrol as a law student while being an MP. In July 1977, he lost the election but took oaths as an Attorney-at-Law in November that year. After becoming a lawyer, Mahinda moved to Tangalle and established a lucrative practice in the South. His politics too continued albeit on a lower scale.",
    "In 1989, Mahinda was elected to Parliament from the Hambantota District under new election procedures. While in Parliament, Mahinda along with Matara District MP Mangala Samaraweera worked tirelessly in opposing the UNP Government of the day and reinvigorating the SLFP.",
    "The 1994 elections saw the People\u2019s Alliance forming a government. Chandrika Kumaratunga became Prime Minister and later President. Mahinda was first appointed as the Labour Minister and later Fisheries Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle. In 2001, the UNP formed the government while Chandrika continued to be President. Mahinda Rajapaksa became opposition leader. In 2004, the UPFA formed the government and Mahinda became Prime Minister.",
    "In 2005, the presidential elections were announced. Despite many intra-party obstacles, Mahinda Rajapaksa secured nomination as the presidential candidate in the November 2005 elections. The LTTE-enforced boycott in the North and East in 2005 helped Mahinda defeat Ranil in the presidential poll.",
    "What happened thereafter is now history! The Rajapaksa Government pursued the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) with ruthless determination. After many deaths and much displacement, destruction and despair, the war ended with the military defeat of the LTTE in May 2009.",
    "The Rajapaksas cleverly converted the war-victory euphoria into political victories in the 2010 presidential and parliamentary elections.The  Ruhunu Rajapaksas perceived as the first family in Sri Lankan politics began ruling the roost  thereafter. Mahinda lost the 2015 election and the Rajapaksas were out of power. The dynasty made a comeback  in 2019 with Gotabaya at the helm as president. Rajapaksa misrule led to the Aragalaya. The Rajapaksas were  compelled to relinquish power.",
    "The Medamulna political dynasty  has now suffered a great downfall.It is however uncertain whether dynastic politics has ended in Sri Lanka or whether it would re-emerge again in new forms  with new persons.",
