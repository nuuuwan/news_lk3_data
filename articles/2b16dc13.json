    "Slams Govt. for allegedly failing to fulfil its campaign promises to provide economic relief to citizens",
    "Claims it indicates Govt. lacks necessary knowledge for financial management, revenue generation, and tax reduction",
    "Observes unions leaders who once advocated for citizens have now fallen silent",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate S.M Marikkar has accused the current Government of following the same high-tax policies implemented by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and failing to fulfil its campaign promises to provide economic relief to the people.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo Marikkar slammed the Government for failing to reduce the prices of Octane 92 petrol and Auto Diesel which are essential for the common people.",
    "\u201cOn the campaign stage, President Anura Dissanayake promised to revise fuel prices and offer relief, yet the expected change has not materialised. This indicates that the current Government lacks the necessary knowledge or intent for financial management, revenue generation, and tax reduction,\u201d he said.",
    "He pointed out that the Government, which came to power with the promise of alleviating the public\u2019s hardships, has not shown its inability to provide tangible relief in areas such as fuel, electricity, water, or essential goods, despite higher tax revenue.",
    "Marikkar also drew comparisons with the Good Governance administration, which he claimed had successfully enacted immediate economic relief measures after assuming power in 2015. \u201cThat Government reduced fuel prices, lowered the cost of gas cylinders, cut prices of essential goods, provided a Rs. 10 000 wage increase to state employees, and offered a Rs. 20 000 allowance to pregnant mothers,\u201d he said.",
    "Marikkar\u2019s criticisms extended to the changing role of union leaders who had historically advocated for workers, farmers, and teachers. Marikkar observed that these leaders, once vocal in their protests and demonstrations to pressure the Government for change, have now become silent and are instead preparing to contest the upcoming General Elections.",
    "He asserted that the people, who previously rallied for change through strikes and demonstrations that disrupted Government operations, are now calling for General Elections as their new hope for accountability."
