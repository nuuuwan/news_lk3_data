    "This August, tea export company Empire Teas will celebrate 25 years by inviting business partners from across the world for a heartfelt celebration in Sri Lanka. From 7-9 August, guests will enjoy a curated tea journey from behind-the-scenes tours to lush plantations and a grand Gala Dinner to honour the friendships that have powered the company\u2019s success.",
    "From modest beginnings to becoming one of Sri Lanka\u2019s top five tea exporters, Empire Teas now delivers over 14 million kilos of premium Ceylon tea to more than 70 countries annually. Behind this growth is a story of vision and heart, led by the founder, a third-generation tea master, Lushantha de Silva, and a team dedicated to doing things the right way, always. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just our celebration,\u201d says Lushantha. \u201cIt\u2019s a thank you to our business partners who believed in us, walked with us, and helped us grow.\u201d",
    "Empire\u2019s footprint extends far beyond Sri Lanka, with operations in Kenya and teams across China, Spain, and the Netherlands. Its signature brands, Hyson, Thurson, Akina, and Tea Avenue, carry the story of Ceylon tea to the world, while hundreds of private-label partners trust Empire to uphold their brand\u2019s promise. What makes Empire truly special, though, is not just the tea. It\u2019s the trust it\u2019s built, the values it\u2019s stayed true to, and the future it\u2019s shaping. \u201cWe may have started small,\u201d reflects Lushantha, \u201cbut we\u2019ve grown with soul. And this is just the beginning.\u201d Thus, Empire continues to grow with soul, anchored in values, inspired by legacy, and driven by a bold vision for the future."
