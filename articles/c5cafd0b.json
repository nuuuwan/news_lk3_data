    "Colombo, Jan. 11, (Daily Mirror)- A joy ride for the ruling party parliamentarians had been provided by Sri Lanka Ports Authority in two dredging vessels on Tuesday January 9 at the expense of the taxpayers.",
    "More than 25 MPs and their families had joined in this joy ride free of charge which has cost Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) nearly Rs. 5 million according to Chief Secretary All Ceylon General Port Employees Union Niroshan Gorakanage.",
    "Although Gorakanage claims so, reliable SLPA sources said the total cost for fuel for the two vessels was around Rs. 300,000. \u201cSLPA foot the bill only for the fuel as these vessels moved within the port area and not outside. Hence the cost was minimal,\u201d sources said on condition of anonymity.",
    "This joy ride was organized by the State Minister of Ports and Aviation Premalal Jayasekera for government MPs and the State Minister\u2019s Coordinating Secretary Senali Jayasekera by a letter dated January 8, 2024, had made a request to the Chairman of SLPA to provide short eats free of charge for the guests.",
    "However, SLPA Chairman Keith Bernard had turned down the request. \u201cThe Chairman turned down the request claiming that state funds cannot be spent on such rides which is hailed by the employees. Had the Chairman agreed to provide the food that was requested, Ports Authority could have lost a considerable amount of public money. Later the State Minister had requested the private bakery that provides short eats for the SLPA staff to supply the food,\u201d Gorakanage said.",
    "However, Gorakanage said that the other expenses including fuel for the two vessels, overtime payments for the SLPA employees who were in attendance and for other services had cost the institution around Rs. 5 million.",
    "\u201cThey claim that this ride was to inspect the two port terminals. If so, why did they spend time inside the vessels enjoying music provided by a live band with food and drinks? No one was seen inspecting the terminal work,\u201d Gorakanage alleged.",
    "State Minister Jayasekera however refuted the allegation leveled and said that it was he who foot the bill for the snacks, drinks and even for the fuel. \u201cThe MPs wanted to supervise the East and West Terminals and also to see how dredging work is taking place within the harbour area. That is why I organized this tour. We did not go to the outer harbour area but we were within the port area,\u201d he said.",
    "When asked why his daughter who is his Coordinating Secretary requested the SLPA Chairman to provide snacks for this event, the state minister said that his daughter never made such a request. Also, when asked why this journey was organized late in the evening instead of the daytime, if the MPs wanted to inspect the two terminals and how dredging takes place, he said that he had to postpone the time as the MPs had to attend an urgent meeting.",
    "All attempts to obtain a comment from Chairman SLPA, Keith Bernard failed as he was not in office."
