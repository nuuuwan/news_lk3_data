    "Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has emphasised the duty of all stakeholders, including the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL), the Government led by the President, the Sri Lanka Police, and the entire Government mechanism, in ensuring a free and fair Presidential election without any violence, corruption, or acts of hate between communities.",
    "Issuing a press release on Wednesday, former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya recalled that the 17th Amendment, championed by the country\u2019s civil society, sought to establish a fair election culture in Sri Lanka. However, the unlimited executive powers granted by the 18th and 20th Amendments led to disappointment. \u201cIt is imperative for the current President and potential candidates of the upcoming election not to create a similar environment once more,\u201d Jayasuriya said.",
    "He said that in the current context, the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary have a great responsibility to protect the country\u2019s democracy. \u201cTherefore, creating a clash between the three branches is harmful to the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d he said. The former Speaker also noted that implementing the new campaign finance law and the Anti-Corruption Act will fulfill the people\u2019s hopes for free and fair Presidential elections.",
    "Jayasuriya emphasised that it was imperative and a national duty to prevent the repetition of certain incidents seen in the 2020 election and to reject cheap propaganda tactics linked with the country\u2019s media.",
    "He said the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ), led by him, has placed their faith in the members of the ECSL and wishes them the best in conducting a free and fair election."
