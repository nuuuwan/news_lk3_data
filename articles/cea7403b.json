    "The government has made it clear that it will not abide by the Supreme Court (SC) order that IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon be suspended and an Acting IGP appointed. Obviously, it manipulated the Constitutional Council (CC) process to elevate Tennakoon as the IGP for a purpose; it apparently cannot think of any other top cop to help further its interests better during a crucial election, which it cannot afford to lose.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe pretends that he has nothing to do with the current politico-legal mess that has arisen from the non-implementation of the SC order in question. He and other government leaders are treating the judiciary to lectures on the Constitution, which they are also interpreting! This, we believe, is an affront to the dignity of the SC, and an insult to the intelligence of the public.",
    "The government insists that President Wickremesinghe, who is also a presidential candidate, cannot appoint an acting IGP. This is what Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has told Parliament while refusing to accept the SC order. What if an IGP were to become incapacitated ahead of an election with the incumbent President in the fray?",
    "President Wickremesinghe has sought to obfuscate the issue of his refusal to appoint an Acting IGP. He has requested Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya and Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, who is a respondent cited in the fundamental rights petitions against Tennakoon\u2019s appointment as the IGP, to discuss and resolve the issue. Speaking at a political rally near a bus station, of all places, in a suburb of Colombo, over the weekend, the President said he had asked the Speaker to discuss the matter with the CJ, whom, he said, he would contact. So, this is how the President reacts to an SC order!",
    "When the apex court gives an order, instead of abiding by it, the President tells the court to do as he says! There is nothing stupider than to expect the rule of law to be restored under the current dispensation.",
    "The government has spelt out its position on the SC order and says that will not change. Therefore, when the President asks the CJ and the Speaker to resolve the issue, the question is whether the government wants it done on its own terms.",
    "President Wickremesinghe is reported to have said in his aforesaid speech that the Speaker has decided that the CC is part of Parliament and therefore the judiciary cannot scrutinise its affairs. This argument is flawed; it is based on circular logic or petitio principii, as we argued in a previous comment; the Speaker, who stands accused of having manipulated the CC process, says Tennakoon\u2019s appointment was properly made.",
    "Interestingly, President Wickremesinghe himself once declared in Parliament that the CC was part of the Executive. His Media Division had this to say on its website on 31 Jan., 2024: \u201cThe Constitutional Council, which is chaired by the Hon. Speaker of Parliament and established under the Constitution has been empowered to assist the President in making certain decisions and is part of the Executive.\u201d So, how can the Speaker and the PM claim the CC is part of the legislature?",
    "The argument that an Acting IGP cannot be appointed because the post of the IGP has not fallen vacant is untenable, for following the Easter Sunday terror attacks (2019), the then IGP Pujith Jayasundera was sent on compulsory leave and Senior DIG C. D. Wickramaratne was appointed Acting IGP. The incumbent IGP could/should have been similarly dealt with following the SC order.",
    "There has been a notable instance where the Executive arbitrarily undid what the legislature had done. Wickremesinghe, who is so concerned about the supremacy of Parliament, was instrumental in having Chief Justice (CJ) Shirani Bandaranayake, who had been impeached by Parliament reinstated by President Maithripala Sirisena, who also sacked the then serving CJ Mohan Peiris unceremoniously, in 2015. Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister at the time. He, as the President, had no qualms about standing by the current Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) office-bearers, despite a unanimous parliamentary resolution calling upon them to step down. Adding insult to injury, he went on to appoint a person of SLC bigwigs\u2019 choice as the Minister of Sports. One wonders whether there has been any other instance where Parliament was demeaned in a worse manner.",
    "The President has claimed that the absence of an IGP will affect the electoral process; the EC has to work with the IGP and not any of the Senior DIGs, he has claimed. The EC is convinced otherwise. It is of the view that the absence of the IGP or an Acting IGP will not affect its work. The government\u2019s efforts to turn public opinion against the judiciary are bound to fail.",
    "Is the government trying to create a crisis by refusing to obey the SC order in question so as to delay the presidential election? Given the despicable manner in which the government is undermining the judiciary on the watch of Wickremesinghe, who is an unelected President, one cannot but wonder how bad the situation would have been if he had been popularly elected.",
    "It behoves the President, the PM, and the Speaker to clean up the unholy mess they themselves have created; they ought not to drag the EC, the people\u2019s sovereignty and franchise, the upcoming presidential election, etc., into it.",
