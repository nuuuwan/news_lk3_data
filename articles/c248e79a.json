  "original_body_lines": [
    "Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.",
    "The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.",
    "The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.",
    "Thereafter, the unnecessary waste of public funds should be stopped. The perks given to former presidents should be withheld as most of them have done more harm than good to the nation and the people. In any case, no spouse should be allowed any privileges after the demise of a former president.",
    "The privileges given to incumbent MPs are a huge drain on public finances. They should not be entitled to pensions after serving five years. It is very unfair by public servants who have to toil for 25 years to think of retiring and getting a pension. The cost of pensions to parliamentarians is excessive.",
    "Besides pensions, other allowances of MPs should also be pruned. They should be allowed only one clerk to attend to their office work. The facility of providing duty free vehicles to MPs must also be withdrawn and they should be given a reasonable fuel allowance based on submission of bills. The retinue of security officers and vehicles to politicians should be withdrawn.",
    "If any MP cannot get on the road alone without fear or favour, s/he should resign. They must realize that even the prime ministers of some of the Scandinavian countries cycle to work and back and carry their own bags. Here we have seen bag carriers appointed ministers!",
    "The highly subsidized restaurant in parliament should be closed as it is a vast drain on public finance.",
    "The cabinet of ministers should be limited to 20. Ours is far too large, even when compared to India with its vast population. There should be no state ministers as such offices are redundant and serve only the political class.. Ministers should be allocated just one vehicle each with a driver and a single security guard as was the case even during Mrs. Bandaranaike\u2019s time. Mr. Lakshman Jayakody then drove his own vehicle to do his shopping and marketing without even a single policeman!",
    "MPs should be paid a substantial allowance for attending parliament rather than a salary to ensure better attendance than at present when sittings sometimes have to be abandoned for lack of a quorum.",
    "The appointment of MPs on a National List should be stopped. This does not serve its intended purpose as not only MPs who have lost their seats but even those whose party could not win a single seat have been able to enter parliament through the backdoor. This permitted one such MP to be elevated to the highest position in the land!",
    "Governors of the Central Bank, other than career officers, should not be paid a pension after their tenure. Any such payments now being made should be halted and they may be paid a reasonable amount on relinquishing office.",
    "Taxation should be streamlined to ensure that all those liable come within the tax net. In addition to collecting taxes from individuals, those who have earned large sums illegally should be brought to book. If all this is done, Sri Lanka will be able to overcome her present economic difficulties.",
    "As we are an agricultural country, it is imperative that the new government pays heed to developing agriculture, not only tea, rubber and coconut, but other cash crops, some of which could be utilized to develop agro-based industries. We must be self-sufficient in whatever can be produced here. We recently imported eggs from India instead of helping the local poultry industry.",
    "It is also necessary to do away with all red tape to help exports and earn foreign exchange.",
