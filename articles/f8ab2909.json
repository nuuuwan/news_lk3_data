    "It is popularly said in this country that if one kicks any wayside bush about a dozen public employees jump out. The state service is bursting at the seams thanks to numerous politically motivated recruitment drives under successive governments so much so that today there is one state employee for every 15 citizens! This extremely high state-official-to-citizen ratio has not benefited the public at all, as evident from their many complaints of lethargy, delays, etc., in state institutions. Worse, the public sector is to be expanded, we are told.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said, at a recent Monaragala District Coordination Committee meeting, that Cabinet approval was granted for recruiting 62,000 additional employees into the state service, but the number could go up to 100,000 as vacancies exist in some institutions in the public sector, which is overstaffed.",
    "The need to downsize the public service has been felt for several decades, but politicians have baulked at doing so for political reasons. Only the UNP-led UNF government (2001-2004) dared grasp the nettle; it made a serious effort to tackle the problem by curtailing public sector recruitments, but its successors restored the status quo ante. If the UNF administration\u2019s state sector recruitment policy had been followed by its successors, a great deal of funds could have been saved, and the public would not have had to pay through the nose to maintain an unwieldy state service.",
    "Successive governments have used the need to fill vacancies as an excuse for politically motivated recruitment drives to garner favour with job seekers and their families and shore up their approval ratings ahead of elections. This has been the name of the game in Sri Lankan politics.",
    "The NPP government is coming under increasing pressure to fulfil its pledge to recruit unemployed graduates into the state service. The cost of state sector recruitments under the incumbent dispensation will also be passed on to the public in the form of tax and tariff increases.",
    "Even the US, the biggest economy in the world, is downsizing the state service to curtail expenditure. The Trump administration is planning mass layoffs. But Sri Lanka, which is struggling to regain economic stability, and service its external debt, is going to bloat the public service further.",
    "State workers must not be laid off. There are ways and means of streamlining the public sector. The government should seriously consider modern methods such as workforce realignment or reskilling and redeployment. The possibility of excess workers in some state institutions being restrained and reassigned to the ones experiencing shortages of human resources should be explored. Last year, graduates recruited as Development Officers and attached to state-run schools staged a protest in Battaramulla, demanding confirmation in service. Why they are not assigned to the state institutions where vacancies exist is the question.",
    "Instead of making the state sector even more unwieldy, the government should take steps to enhance its quality and productivity by investing in modern technology so that the public can be served better. Digitalisation will help overcome various problems caused by vacancies in some state institutions.",
    "Experts have urged successive governments to adopt some modern strategies, focused on redeployment, digitalisation, performance, institutional rationalisation, and incremental reform to improve public service without increasing the state payroll. A government plan to cluster small schools has run into stiff resistance from the Opposition and trade unions in the education sector, but this method can be effectively applied to some other state institutions to avoid duplication and overcome shortages of workers. The challenge before the current administration is to handle the problem at hand in such a way that the public won\u2019t end up having to pay higher taxes and tariffs to maintain the new recruits in return for little.",
