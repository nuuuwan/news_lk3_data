  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Advocata Institute, while welcoming the government\u2019s recent decision to waive visa fees for tourists from 40 additional countries, calls for broader liberalisation of the visa regime to fully unlock economic opportunities through tourism.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently aiming for three million tourist arrivals and USD 5 billion in revenue this year. Advocata believes that open, clear, and consistent visa policies\u2014combined with a welcoming environment, investment-friendly regulation, and high-value targeting\u2014will be essential to achieving that goal.",
    "\u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d said Dhananath Fernando, CEO of Advocata Institute. \u201cTourism is one of the few sectors in Sri Lanka with immediate job-creating potential and strong multiplier effects across the economy. Reducing barriers to entry, even something as simple as waiving a fee, can go a long way in making Sri Lanka more attractive as a destination.\u201d",
    "The Institute emphasized that this should not be a one-off gesture, but the start of a broader liberalization agenda. Advocata calls for Sri Lanka to work toward reverting to at least its pre-2012 visa regime, under which 84 countries were eligible for visas on arrival, without needing to apply for electronic travel authorization (ETA) in advance. This system was more consistent, easier for travelers, and better aligned with international best practices.",
    "Advocata recommends that Sri Lanka introduce visa-on-arrival access for travelers who hold valid multiple-entry visas to high-screening countries, such as the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Australia.These travelers have already undergone extensive vetting and, in many cases, are eligible to enter more than 50 countries visa-free based on their existing travel history.",
    "Additionally, the Institute suggests exploring the introduction of a two-year, renewable visa-on-arrival for citizens or permanent residents of countries with per capita incomes at least four times that of Sri Lanka. This would encourage long-stay travel, remote/nomad work, and academic or business exchange from high-income countries\u2014contributing to knowledge transfer, professional networking, and investment.",
    "Advocata also highlighted the importance of visa policy consistency and better user experience. Sri Lanka\u2019s visa regime has undergone several abrupt changes over the past decade, contributing to confusion among both tourists and travel agents. While visa fees may be waived, tourists are still required to apply online for an ETA, a process that often results in credit card payment issues (for those from countries that do not have the fee waiver) and poor usability.",
    "While the removal of visa fees is a welcome reform, Advocata cautions that this alone is not enough to ensure tourism success. Sri Lanka must also tackle the deeper structural issues in the sector. This includes attracting higher-spending tourists through well-targeted global marketing campaigns, and creating the right investment climate to bring in the infrastructure and innovation needed for long-term growth.",
