  "original_body_lines": [
    "More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since May while trying to get food in the Gaza Strip, mostly near aid sites run by an American contractor, the U.N. human rights office said Tuesday.",
    "Meanwhile, Israeli strikes killed 25 people across Gaza, according to local health officials.",
    "Desperation is mounting in the Palestinian territory of more than 2 million, which experts say is at risk of famine because of Israel\u2019s blockade and nearly two-year offensive.",
    "A breakdown of law and order has led to widespread looting and contributed to chaos and violence around aid deliveries.",
    "Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid \u2014 without providing evidence of widespread diversion \u2014 and blames U.N. agencies for failing to deliver food it has allowed in. The military says it has only fired warning shots near aid sites. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor, rejected what it said were \u201cfalse and exaggerated statistics\u201d from the United Nations.",
    "The Gaza Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, said Tuesday that 101 people, including 80 children, have died in recent days from starvation.",
    "The deaths could not be independently verified, but U.N. officials and major international aid groups say the conditions for starvation exist in Gaza. During hunger crises, people can die from malnutrition or from common illnesses or injuries that the body is not strong enough to fight.",
    "Israel eased a 2\u00bd-month blockade in May, allowing a trickle of aid in through the longstanding U.N.-run system and the newly created GHF. Aid groups say it\u2019s not nearly enough.",
    "Dozens of Palestinians lined up Tuesday outside a charity kitchen in Gaza City, hoping for a bowl of watery tomato soup. The lucky ones got small chunks of eggplant. As supplies ran out, people holding pots pushed and shoved to get to the front.",
    "Nadia Mdoukh, a pregnant woman who was displaced from her home and lives in a tent with her husband and three children, said she worries about being shoved or trampled on, and about heat stroke as daytime temperatures hover above 90 F (32 C).",
    "\u201cI do it for my children,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is famine \u2014 there is no bread or flour.\u201d",
    "The U.N. World Food Program says Gaza\u2019s hunger crisis has reached \u201cnew and astonishing levels of desperation.\u201d Ross Smith, the agency\u2019s director for emergencies, told reporters Monday that nearly 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, and a third of Gaza\u2019s population is going without food for multiple days in a row.",
    "MedGlobal, a charity working in Gaza, said five children as young as 3 months had died from starvation in the past three days.",
    "\u201cThis is a deliberate and human-made disaster,\u201d said Joseph Belliveau, its executive director. \u201cThose children died because there is not enough food in Gaza and not enough medicines, including IV fluids and therapeutic formula, to revive them.\u201d",
    "The charity said food is in such short supply that its own staff members suffer dizziness and headaches.",
    "Of the 1,054 people killed while trying to get food since late May, 766 were killed while heading to sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to the U.N. human rights office. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.",
    "Thameen al-Kheetan, a spokesperson for the U.N. rights office, says its figures come from \u201cmultiple reliable sources on the ground,\u201d including medics, humanitarian and human rights organizations. He said the numbers were still being verified according to the office\u2019s strict methodology.",
    "Palestinian witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces regularly fire toward crowds of thousands of people heading to the GHF sites. The military says it has only fired warning shots, and GHF says its armed contractors have only fired into the air on a few occasions to try to prevent stampedes.",
    "A joint statement from 28 Western-aligned countries on Monday condemned the \u201cthe drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,\u201d read the statement, which was signed by the United Kingdom, France and other countries friendly to Israel. \u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable.\u201d",
    "Israel and the United States rejected the statement, blaming Hamas for prolonging the war by not accepting Israeli terms for a ceasefire and the release of hostages abducted in the militant-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the fighting.",
    "Hamas has said it will release the remaining hostages only in return for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Israel says it will keep fighting until Hamas has been defeated or disarmed.",
    "Israeli strikes killed at least 25 people Tuesday across Gaza, according to local health officials.",
    "One strike hit tents sheltering displaced people in the built-up seaside Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, killing at least 12 people, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said that it wasn\u2019t aware of such a strike by its forces.",
    "The dead included three women and three children, the hospital director, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, told The Associated Press. Thirty-eight other Palestinians were wounded, he said.",
    "An overnight strike that hit crowds of Palestinians waiting for aid trucks in Gaza City killed eight, hospitals said. At least 118 were wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.",
    "\u201cA bag of flour covered in blood and death,\u201d said Mohammed Issam, who was in the crowd and said some people were run over by trucks in the chaos. \u201cHow long will this humiliation continue?\u201d",
    "The Israeli military had no immediate comment on that strike. Israel blames the deaths of Palestinian civilians on Hamas, because the militants operate in densely populated areas.",
    "Israel renewed its offensive in March with a surprise bombardment after ending an earlier ceasefire. Talks on another truce have dragged on for weeks despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.",
    "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people in the Oct. 7 attack, and killed around 1,200 people. Fewer than half of the 50 hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.",
    "More than 59,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Its count doesn\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians, but the ministry says that more than half of the dead are women and children. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties."
