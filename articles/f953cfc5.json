    "Highlights Opposition\u2019s role in supporting public dissent against former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate Hirunika Premachandra has pledged that, should the party and its alliance, the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS), fail to secure Government power at the upcoming General Election, they will create a robust and effective Opposition instead.",
    "Addressing a press conference over the weekend, Premachandra emphasised that a strong Opposition is vital for a functioning democracy, citing how the Opposition played a crucial role in supporting the public during the economic collapse and ensuing protests under former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s administration.",
    "\u201cA nation\u2019s democratic strength can be measured by the effectiveness of its Opposition. During the Rajapaksa regime, when the country faced bankruptcy, it was the Opposition\u2019s resilience that empowered the people to stand up. If we cannot achieve Government power, we will focus on building a powerful Opposition,\u201d Premachandra said.",
    "The former MP also underlined the importance of electing a Government capable of bringing meaningful change and stabilising the economy. She argued that only the SJB and its alliance possess the skilled team necessary to navigate the country\u2019s economic challenges and foster productive relationships with international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "\u201cThe SJB is uniquely equipped with an economic vision that can stabilise the nation in the coming years. We have the talent and strategy to lift the country out of its current economic abyss and build strong international partnerships. Should we gain power, we have the capability to collaborate with the current President and work under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa as Prime Minister to restore the nation\u2019s strength,\u201d Premachandra said.",
    "Reflecting on the recent Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election, Premachandra expressed concern over its implications for the current Government. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s National People\u2019s Power (NPP) secured 15 seats, while the remaining 15 were shared by various Opposition parties.",
    "\u201cThis outcome could foreshadow significant challenges for the current administration. A balanced council where one vote can determine the passing of budgets and bills is risky. The Elpitiya election result may not bode well for the future of the current Government,\u201d she noted, warning that this competition is a signal of the stiff contest the NPP party will face at the General Election.",
    "Premachandra also commented on the ongoing discussions between the Government and the IMF. The talks, which involved key figures, including Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena, and former Presidents Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe, have raised concerns due to their opacity.",
    "\u201cDespite participating in negotiations, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his team, who were initially opposed to IMF dealings, have realised the necessity of such engagements to pull the country out of its economic crisis. However, there has been little transparency regarding the progress of these talks, and the IMF\u2019s decision to temporarily withhold the third tranche of funding adds to the uncertainty,\u201d Premachandra said.",
    "She stressed that the public is anxiously awaiting updates from President Dissanayake or his representatives about the outcomes of these critical negotiations. \u201cThe people are waiting to understand the results of these discussions. It is imperative that the Government shares this information to maintain public trust,\u201d she concluded."
