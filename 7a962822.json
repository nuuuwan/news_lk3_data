    "This is an exchange between two Australians of Sri Lankan descent prior to the World Cup final between India and Australia at Ahmedebad last week reproduced in Michael Roberts\u2019 Thuppahai blog. The protagonists are Errol Fernando, a skilled piano player from Trinity College, who predicted the Aussie victory against all odds and the firmer Royal College cricketing legend, Lorenz Pereira.",
    "\u201cAfter a long tournament, we reach the final that we all predicted many weeks ago, Lorenz\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 India vs Australia\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 with the obvious prediction that India will win. Millions will back India,of course.",
    "\u201cLet me take a different path by predicting a win for the Aussies, especially if they bat first. Head, Marsh and Maxwell are dangerous players who can take the game away from India.",
    "\u201cHowever, India\u2019s main enemy is simply PRESSURE!\u00a0 They are under enormous, superhuman pressure, playing at home with the whole nation\u2019s expectations. This will certainly weigh them down.",
    "\u201cThe Aussies, on the other hand, are the UNDERDOGS with no pressure and no expectations. They have no burdens whatsoever. All they need to do is to relax, enjoy themselves and have a go. This will lead to a win, for sure.",
    "\u201cIndia have no hope of a win because their BURDEN is far too great.",
    "\u201cI could not possibly be wrong about this, Lorenz,\u00a0and you could either congratulate me right away or else wait till Monday morning.",
    "\u201cWhat a brilliant theoretical analysis of the outcome of the Final. Surely of Einstein proportion and worthy of a Nobel Nomination.",
    "\u201cHowever, I am deeply distressed and disillusioned by your Prediction.\u00a0 I want an Australian Win\u2026\u2026 [and] history records that your Predictions have been 100 % Wrong, which means that it will turn out to be an Indian Win.",
    "\u201cYou have based your rationale and analysis on the enormous Stress Factor that India will be faced with.\u00a0 But in the above, you have erroneously omitted that India will be playing with 12 Team Members.\u00a0The vital 12th Member being irreplaceable, being their Super Coach, Rahul Dravid.",
    "\u201cPlease see the article on him that I am sending you by email.\u00a0That negative \u201cburden\u201d you have alluded to as being India\u2019s Achilles heel has been already neutralized by Dravid \u00a0during the course of this Tournament.\u00a0So, it will not assist Australia.",
    "\u201cNot sure which Team will have an advantage from that.\u00a0Much of both India\u2019s and Australia\u2019s bowling success to date had been based on Speed, although Zampa is a leading wicket taker, but demolished by the South Africans.",
    "\u201cA final plea dear Errol. I sincerely hope that for once your Prediction is Correct.",
