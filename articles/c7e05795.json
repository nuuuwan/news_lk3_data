    "US Ambassador Julie Chung, Peace Corps Director Carol Spahn, and First Lady Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe join US Peace Corps Volunteers, school directors and counterparts at the Peace Corps swearing in ceremony in Colombo on March 6",
    "Peace Corps Volunteers learned Sri Lankan culture, Sinhala or Tamil for the past three months before they go out to their schools to teach English for the next two years",
    "In a ceremony held in Colombo on March 6, Peace Corps Director Carol Spahn, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, First Lady Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe, and Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha officiated the swearing-in of 20 Peace Corps Volunteers from the United States.\u00a0 This marks the 25th group of Peace Corps Volunteers to serve in Sri Lanka since 1998. The cohort of skilled, diverse trainees arrived in November 2023 to begin 12 weeks of training. Following three months of intensive training in language, culture, and effective engagement within Sri Lankan schools, these Volunteers will now embark on a two-year service journey as English teachers in the Central and Uva provinces. They will work alongside their Sri Lankan counterparts, including English teachers and principals, to deliver English language instruction to Sri Lankan school children.",
    "Addressing the swearing-in ceremony, US Ambassador Julie Chung congratulated the Volunteers and expressed gratitude to the Government of Sri Lanka for extending the invitation to the Peace Corps. She remarked, \u201cI feel a tremendous sense of pride, both as US Ambassador and as an American, in Peace Corps Volunteers. I cannot imagine a better way to demonstrate our collective engagement to serve the people of Sri Lanka.\u201d She added, \u201cThese Peace Corps volunteers are embarking on a profound experience. They become part of their Sri Lankan communities, speaking Sinhala or Tamil, and working side-by-side with their Sri Lankan counterparts. Their experiences in Sri Lanka will forever shape them, and they will share their love for Sri Lanka with fellow Americans. These Volunteers will play an important role in strengthening cross-cultural ties between our nations, while also advancing the importance of English language education as a crucial tool for participation in the global economy, contributing to Sri Lanka\u2019s progress and development.\u201d",
    "Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe commended the volunteerism inherent in Peace Corps and said, \u201cIn an era when virtual connectivity and reality seems sometimes to be valued at the expense of human contact, what could be more real or more tangible or human than the Peace Corps experience.\u201d",
    "Peace Corps Director Carol Spahn, who travelled from Peace Corps headquarters in Washington D.C. to oversee the swearing in and meet with Sri Lankan government officials, said, \u201cTo engage with and learn and walk side-by-side with Sri Lankans who come from such rich and diverse cultures is a gift. We thank the government of Sri Lanka for inviting Peace Corps back to Sri Lanka and we thank the people of Sri Lanka for your hospitality and welcoming these Volunteers with open arms. Finally, we honour these Volunteers for demonstrating the cultural humility, openness, respect, resilience, flexibility, and patience that are the foundation upon which we build peace and friendship, one relationship at a time. It is such an honour to be able to be here to attend the first swearing in ceremony of Peace Corps Volunteers in over a generation here in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha spoke about the importance of English language education and partnership, and said, \u201cCongratulations to the 20 Peace Corps Volunteers for your swearing-in. Our partnership with Peace Corps unlocks opportunities for all Sri Lankans to benefit from English language education. I hope you thrive in our local communities and forge strong bonds with your host families, students, counterparts and schools, and hold all these wonderful experiences when you return to America. Embrace the rich cultural exchange opportunities that Sri Lanka offers, as these experiences will not only enrich your journey but also strengthen the bonds between our nations.\u201d",
    "\u201cI want to recognise and express my gratitude to the community members who have opened their hearts and their homes to the trainees,\u201d said Peace Corps Sri Lanka Country Director Kavita Pullapilly, to the teacher counterparts, school principals and host families. \u201cWe honour you today for your kindness, your willingness to share your culture, and your generosity in creating a space for the Volunteers to learn Sinhala and Tamil and experience all the joys of living in Sri Lanka.\u201d"
