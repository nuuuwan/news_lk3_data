    "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks.",
    "Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying.",
    "Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria.",
    "Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing.",
    "In the run-up to his court date, Netanyahu revived familiar pre-war rhetoric against law enforcement, describing investigations against him as a witch hunt. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty.",
    "\u201cThe real threat to democracy in Israel is not posed by the public\u2019s elected representatives, but by some among the law enforcement authorities who refuse to accept the voters\u2019 choice and are trying to carry out a coup with rabid political investigations that are unacceptable in any democracy,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday.",
    "At a Monday night press conference Netanyahu said he had waited eight years to be able to tell his story and expressed outrage at the way witnesses had been treated during investigations.",
    "Before the war, Netanyahu\u2019s legal troubles bitterly divided Israelis and shook Israeli politics through five rounds of elections. His government\u2019s bid last year to curb the powers of the judiciary further polarised Israelis.",
    "The shock Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the ensuing Gaza war swept Netanyahu\u2019s trial off the public agenda as Israelis came together in grief and trauma. But as the war dragged on, political unity crumbled.",
    "In recent weeks, while fighting abated on one front after Israel reached a ceasefire with Hamas\u2019 Lebanese ally Hezbollah, members of Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, including his justice and police ministers, have clashed with the judiciary.",
    "In power almost consecutively since 2009, Netanyahu, 75, is Israel\u2019s longest serving leader and its first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime.",
    "His domestic legal woes were compounded last month when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict."
