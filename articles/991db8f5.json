  "original_title": "Rising risks to Indian corporates from higher US tariffs: Fitch Ratings",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Fitch Ratings believes India-based corporates generally have low direct exposure to US tariffs, but sectors that are currently unaffected, including pharmaceuticals, could be hit by further US tariff announcements.",
    "The risk of second-order effects from existing tariffs is also rising. A US-India trade deal, if secured, would reduce these risks.",
    "The US imposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on India with effect from 7 August 2025 and an additional 25% levy in connection with its oil imports from Russia, effective 27 August.",
    "India\u2019s direct automotive exports to the US, including parts, are limited. The US accounts for close to 20% of sales for auto supplier Samvardhana Motherson International Limited (SAMIL, BB+/Stable), but mostly from production bases in the US, or those in Mexico that benefit from tariff exemptions under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Nonetheless, Fitch revised the Outlook on SAMIL to Stable from Positive in May 2025, reflecting our expectation that a weakened global auto sector outlook amid tariff-related uncertainty would limit further improvement in SAMIL\u2019s financial leverage.",
    "The US is a key export destination for Indian pharmaceutical companies. Biosimilars-focused Biocon Biologics Limited (BB-/Stable) derives around 40% of its sales from the US, mostly from production sites in India and Malaysia. Significant US tariffs on pharmaceutical products are not yet factored into our rating base case and could pose downside risks to its operating performance. The competitive industry landscape could limit Biocon\u2019s ability to pass on higher costs, despite the non-discretionary demand for its products.",
    "US customers constitute 10%-12% of total revenue for crop-protection chemical producer UPL Limited (UPL), whose consolidated profile forms the basis for the rating of its subsidiary UPL Corporation Ltd (BB/Stable). Tariffs on UPL\u2019s products manufactured in India are set to move closer to those on products from China, potentially affecting its competitive position in the US. Nevertheless, UPL benefits from significant geographical and product diversification. We believe it will still be able to meet its EBITDA growth guidance of 10%-14% in constant currency terms, and we see limited risk to our EBITDA growth estimate of 11% (in US dollar terms) and leverage forecast for the financial year ending March 2026 (FY26).",
    "Russian crude accounts for about 30%-40% of crude imports for Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs), with its discounted price supporting their EBITDA and profitability. Our base case is that the Indian government will not limit OMC purchases of Russian crude. If these were curtailed, it would hurt OMCs\u2019 EBITDA, but we estimate that the EBITDA impact would be around 10% in the case of a full halt. We expect that the support-driven OMCs\u2019 Issuer Default Ratings, such as those of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BBB-/Stable), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (BBB-/Stable) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL, BBB-/Stable), would be unaffected under this scenario. HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (BB+/Stable), however, has a lower rating buffer and its credit profile could be more vulnerable to a sharp deterioration in earnings that would hinder its deleveraging prospects.",
    "Fitch currently assumes a minimal direct tariff impact on Indian IT service companies and domestically focused sectors such as upstream and downstream oil and gas, cement and building materials, engineering and construction, telecoms, and utilities. However, if US tariffs are sustained at levels significantly higher than in other Asian markets, we see moderate downside risks to our projection that the economy will grow by 6.5% in FY26. This would weigh on the operating performance of more Indian companies. India\u2019s corporates could also be affected if US tariffs divert supply to other markets, including India, as this could present downside risks to our domestic price assumptions for some products, such as steel and chemicals."
