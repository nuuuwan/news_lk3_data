He urged everyone to set aside party politics and support the President\u2019s efforts to rebuild the country, according to the President\u2019s, Media Division.",
    "\u201cOver the past two years, our country has faced numerous international challenges. The initial challenge was securing the support of our creditor nations, including the Paris Club, for joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.",
    "Coordinating with various countries proved to be a complex task, but we successfully garnered their support for debt restructuring\u2014a significant achievement in our foreign policy. This success is largely due to President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s expertise in managing international relations.",
    "Recent visits to Japan, Singapore, Romania, and Poland have also been highly successful. These trips addressed many longstanding issues and facilitated the resumption of 13 suspended projects by Japan, worth $1.1 billion. Additionally, discussions with Singapore focused on investments, while talks with Romania aimed at creating new job opportunities. We also engaged in discussions with Poland regarding the establishment of an embassy.",

    "In response to potential crises in the Middle East, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed three special committees as a proactive measure. One committee focuses on national security, another on the economic situation and ensuring the availability of essential goods, and a third, chaired by the President and Prime Minister, oversees the work of the other two.",
    "The fuel crisis of 2022, exacerbated by the Russian-Ukrainian war, led to sharp increases in fuel, coal, and wheat prices, which the country struggled to manage. In light of these challenges, the President\u2019s decision to establish these committees represents a timely and prudent step to prevent a recurrence of such crises.",
    "We convened to develop a programme aimed at stabilising the country\u2019s energy sector and ensuring an uninterrupted supply of essential goods. While some situations are within a country\u2019s control, international events are not. However, we should not wait for external factors to cause a collapse.",
    "Over the past two years, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has demonstrated his capability to stabilise Sri Lanka without allowing it to become another Venezuela. We are therefore gratified by our decision in 2022 to support President Wickremesinghe in navigating the country through its crisis.",
    "Although we have moved from a dire situation to a level of stability, we are still at a precarious stage. Even a small misstep could lead us back into severe difficulties. The opposition must decide whether to further destabilise the country or contribute to its recovery. It is crucial for everyone to set aside party politics and support President Wickremesinghe\u2019s economic programme to build a robust economy\u201d."
