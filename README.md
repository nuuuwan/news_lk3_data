### ‘Kala Wewa Back to the Elephants’ project a success

*2025-09-08 04:47:33* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Kala-Wewa-Back-to-the-Elephants-project-a-success/56-781366) · `en`

The President’s Media Division (PMD) yesterday said that in parallel with the ‘Clean Sri Lanka’ initiative, the ‘Kala Wewa Back to the Elephants’ project was successfully carried out over three days in the floodplains surrounding the Kala Wewa National Park.

Due to the spread of invasive plant species, including Japan Jabara, across several tank beds in the North Central Province, the tender grass that usually grows in these areas and serves as vital food for elephants, has been destroyed. These grass varieties are rich in protein and highly favoured by wild elephants. It is estimated that around 400 elephants inhabit the vicinity of Kala Wewa, the PMD said in a statement.

A lack of adequate food has driven elephants into nearby villages, intensifying human-elephant conflicts. In recent months, several people have died as a result of elephant attacks. The area is also heavily cultivated with paddy, as well as soya, maize, fruits, and vegetables.

### Japan’s PM Shigeru Ishiba resigns after election drubbing

*2025-09-08 04:43:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Japan-s-PM-Shigeru-Ishiba-resigns-after-election-drubbing/56-781363) · `en`

Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba yesterday announced he was stepping down after less than a year in the role, following two major election losses, the BBC reported.

The move comes a day before his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was expected to vote on whether to hold an internal leadership vote that could have forced him out.

The LDP has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades, but under Ishiba, it lost its majority in the lower house for the first time in 15 years and then lost its majority in the upper house in July.

Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy and a key US ally, now faces a period of political uncertainty as tensions rise with China and regional insecurity mounts.

“Now that a conclusion has been reached in the negotiations concerning the US tariff measures, I believe this is precisely the appropriate time,” Ishiba said, referring to a deal signed last week to ease tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese cars and other exports.

### No rule of law unless rule of men defeated

This is a serious matter for the Government of Anura Kumara Disanayake which has declared an open war with fighting corruption

Chairing the late H.L. de Silva Memorial Events in 2012, the ex-Foreign Secretary H.M.G.S. Palihakkara openly questioned whether it is the rule of men or the rule of law which would usher prosperity to a nation.1 He answered his own question and opined that what was prevailing in Sri Lanka was not the rule of law but ‘a rule’ of men. For Sri Lanka to prosper, he said that the latter should be defeated. What he presented 13 years ago is valid for Sri Lanka even today.
