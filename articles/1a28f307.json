    "\u201cThe hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated,\u201d he said. The storm had \u201cspared nothing\u201d, he added.",
    "Establishing an accurate will be doubly difficult given that France\u2019s interior ministry estimates around 100,000 people live clandestinely on Mayotte.",
    "Some of them did not dare to venture out and seek assistance, \u201cfearing it would be a trap\u201d designed to remove them from Mayotte,\u201d said Ousseni Balahachi, a former nurse.",
    "Many had stayed put \u201cuntil the last minute\u201d when it proved to late to escape the cyclone, she added.",
    "The cyclone wiped out makeshift housing in the archipelago\u2019s shantytown, France\u2019s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said late Saturday.",
    "Mayotte\u2019s 320,000 residents were ordered into lockdown Saturday as cyclone Chido bore down on the islands around 500 kilometres (310 miles) east of Mozambique, with gusts of at least 226 kilometres per hour.",
    "Electricity poles were hurled to the ground, trees uprooted and sheet-metal roofs and walls torn off the shantytown housing inhabited by at least one-third of the population.",
    "One local resident, Ibrahim, told AFP of \u201capocalyptic scenes\u201d as he made his way through the main island, having to clear blocked roads for himself.",

    "The prefecture in La Reunion, another French Indian Ocean territory some 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said a first aid plane had landed in Mayotte.",
    "It carried three tonnes of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, authorities in La Reunion said, with two military aircraft expected to follow.",
    "A navy patrol ship was also to depart La Reunion with personnel and equipment including for electricity supplier EDF.",
    "Just northwest of Mayotte, the Comoros islands, some of which had been on red alert since Friday, were also hit, but suffered only minor damage.",
    "Cyclone Chido made in Mozambique landfall early Sunday around 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of the northern city of Pemba, weather services said. The death toll there so far stands at three, said local officials.",
    "UNICEF said it was on the ground in Mozambique to help the people hit by the storm.",
    "\u201cMany homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed and we are working closely with the government to ensure continuity of essential basic services,\u201d it said in a statement.",
    "Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fuelled by climate change, according to experts.",

    "The UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that some 1.7 million people were in danger, and said the remnants of the cyclone could also dump \u201csignificant rainfall\u201d on neighbouring Malawi through Monday, potentially triggering flash floods.",
