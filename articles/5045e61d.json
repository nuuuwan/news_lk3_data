  "original_body_lines": [
    "Ranil gave a very special place towards relations with India. He obviously knew its political leaders and most of the important officials intimately. He knew a great deal about their background and not only of their politics. I was often surprised with his deep knowledge of Indian political alliances and even personal family relationships. He had visited many times in both north and south and had friends from Kerala to Bihar. He never missed, when in Delhi, paying a call on those who had become over time, his personal friends.",
    "He always met in their homes I K Gujral, former Indian prime minister and Sonia Gandhi, leader of the Congress party. In addition, of course he had numerous opportunities of talking, lunching and dining with the former PM, Atal Behari Vajpayee, L K Advani, the virtual brain behind the BJP, former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh, the former minister of finance and several of the excellent younger ministers of the Cabinet. The relationships were easy between Ranil and these men, and they seemed to enjoy each other\u2019s company and the frequent visits of the Sri Lankan leadership.",
    "In between Ranil\u2019s visits, Milinda (Moragoda) would \u2018keep the home fires burning\u2019 with hurried dashes to the Indian capital. Both India and Sri Lanka had fine representatives at the time Nirupama Sen, a senior and thoroughly experienced professional of India in Colombo and the genteel and urbane Mangala Moonesinghe of Sri Lanka in New Delhi. They worked without much fuss and bother keeping the lines between the two capitals clear and following up diligently on the many new initiatives which Ranil was zealously pursuing.",
    "Two of the more important of these were the possibility of entering into a defence agreement and moving forward on the Free Trade Agreement towards a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). Discussions on consolidating the training and procurement arrangements with India into a defence pact surfaced during the last of Ranil\u2019s visits to New Delhi in October 2003. In fact these arrangements had been in force ever since the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of July 29, 1987. In the letters exchanged between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and President Jayewardene, which became an annexure to the Accord, it was agreed that India would \u201cprovide training facilities and military supplies for the Sri Lankan security forces\u201d.",
    "The Accord was never abrogated and this provision was faithfully carried out through the years. On an average over a thousand officers from the three services received advanced training at Indian staff colleges each year. As far as military supplies were concerned, this was restricted to what the security people called `non-lethal\u2019 commodities like trucks and communication material. A strengthening of these arrangements was all that was being considered and this was seen to be of use in a domestic situation in which the opposition was making a lot of ground by charging that the LTTE were building up their strength through arms shipments by sea in readiness for a future war, while at the same time the Lankan forces were apparently been kept purposely under-equipped by the government.",
    "The news that Indian help was forthcoming, at this stage, would make rubbish of the opposition claim, which in any event had no foundation. Opposition spokesmen were apt to repeat precise numbers, like 11, sometimes 15, arms shipments coming in without an iota of proof as to when they had come, what arms they carried, from where, and so on. If true, the Sri Lanka Navy would have had a great deal of explaining to do as to how this was possible with all the patrolling they were doing in the country\u2019s northern and eastern waters.",
    "The CEPA, Ranil had proposed, was to broaden the ambit of the FTA which had come into operation some years earlier. Under the Free Trade Agreement, bilateral trade in goods had increased by leaps and bounds but the balance had been, as was to be expected given the asymmetries in size and resources, in India\u2019s favour. Although trade was nominally free and without duty, there were negative lists and quota restrictions which were inhibiting Sri Lankan exports to India. Moving into a broader economic partnership agreement would enable our services \u2013 banking, tourism, air services, investment and so on \u2013 to expand and help close the gap in the balance of payments between the two countries.",
    "One of Ranil\u2019s final acts in India was to accept along with Vajpayee the Report of the Joint Study Group and approve its recommendations for immediate implementation. The liberalization of the bilateral air agreement and the inclusion of private air services (and open skies) was one such recommendation. The historic entry of two private Indian airlines, Sahara and Jet into Sri Lankan air space in March 2004 signaled the beginning of concrete action on this important initiative.",
    "It was clear that the Indian political leadership personally liked him and appreciated being kept in the picture about the evolving situation in Sri Lanka. Ranil was very familiar, too, with those in the Indian media world. He was invited as a guest speaker to the impressive \u2018India Today\u2019 global conclave in Delhi at the end of 2002 and made a major speech at the opening ceremony. He was also a close friend of the Ram family of The Hindu and would, when passing through Chennai, try to make contact with N Ram, its editor, who was a long time observer of the Sri Lankan scene. I know that he knew and enjoyed talking with Ms Jayalalitha, the mercurial and temperamental chief minister of Tamil Nadu.",
    "Ranil and his wife Maithree, who accompanied him on his visits, were very much at home in India and with things Indian. They could appreciate its music, food, and the writings of its many fine novelists. Between them they exuded a broader knowledge and familiarity with modern India and its achievements than most other Sri Lankan leaders in their position. They could quite genuinely exult in the news of Aishwarya Rai winning the Miss World contest, Arundhati Roy the \u2018Booker\u2019, Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s latest exploits in a Test Match or listen with pleasure to the haunting melodies, so close to the Sri Lankan, of A R Rahman in his exotic Bollywood musical, Bombay Dreams.",
    "As in other things, like in his dress and the films he enjoyed watching, in the range of his choice of music, he could move with ease from the baila, which he sang with zest along with his classmates in the Mustangs tent at the annual Royal-Thomian match, into the world of Khemadasa or Mozart. With his eclectic tastes some would have called Ranil the renaissance man. I used to think that Ranil would have enjoyed belonging to the post-modern world of the future.",
    "The heart of the peace process lay in the Cease-fire Agreement \u2013 sometimes and mistakenly called the MOU signed between Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE, and Ranil Wickremesinghe, prime minister, on behalf of the government of Sri Lanka. It was not like most other agreements signed by two people seated at the same table. This agreement was signed by Prabhakaran in Kilinochchi and Ranil Wickremesinghe in Vavuniya, on the same day \u2013 22 February 2002 \u2013 a few hours apart. Jon Westborg, the Norwegian ambassador at the time, played a notable role in formulating drafts and handling the text of the agreement as the `facilitator\u2019 of the Royal Government of Norway.",
    "It was the first time in the history of the conflict that we had gone so far as to agree in writing on the details of the cease-fire and the course of future action. The 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was between the two governments of India and Sri Lanka and the LTTE, the main actor in the conflict, was not directly involved.",
    "I am convinced that it was only possible to have come so far because of the facilitation. Without the \u2018middle man\u2019 the neutral intermediary \u2013 the actions of the \u2018spoilers\u2019 of whom there were many on both sides, would have been certain to have upset the process. The Cease-fire Agreement (CFA) was in the form of four Articles: Article 1 dealing with the separation of the fighting forces; Article 2 about measures necessary to bring about normalcy in civilian life in the north-east; Article 3 stipulating the duties and obligations of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM); and, Article 4 containing the standard sub-clauses as to the manner in which the agreement could be terminated by either party.",
    "It was specified that abrogation of the agreement needed a period of at least two weeks notice. This was obviously to prevent \u2013 instances of sudden attack by the LTTE, as had happened at least twice before in the history of the conflict.",
    "Ranil spent a great amount of his time domestically on the conduct of the peace process. He was occupied, sometimes preoccupied by it, every day on most weekends and sometimes late into the night. Literally hundreds of meetings big and small took place with a variety of players \u2013 almost daily with the Minister of Defence Tilak Marapone and his military officials; with the Norwegian facilitators, both Jon Westborg and Hans Brattskar whose commitment and patience in the face of a very critical media was outstanding; with visits from abroad of the Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister, Vidar Helgessen and his indefatigable men and women, who included the mystery man Eric Solheim; Yasushi Akashi of Japan with the legendary wisdom and experience garnered over several years in post-conflict management in the former Yugoslavia and Cambodia; the editors of the local newspapers and the free media movement, some of whom were supportive, and some very opposed, to what was going on; and sundry visitors from all part of the world like John Hume from Northern Ireland and ANC representatives from South Africa.",
    "Virtually every visitor to the country was very interested in the peace process and Rand had to spend a great deal of time explaining and clarifying how this fragile adventure was moving. There was never a dull moment and I was very glad to be closely involved. Bernard Goonetilleke, head of SCOPP (Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process) who was at the time doing a long shuttle between keeping the diplomatic fire going in Beijing and attending to his work in the Peace Secretariat in Colombo, was totally engaged as was Austin Fernando, then secretary of defence. We tried to take some of the load off Ranil but all the major decisions had to be taken by him, the sensitivities being so complex and far-reaching.",
    "The road to peace could literally be said to be marked by a number of illuminated sign posts \u2013 Bangkok, Berlin, Oslo, Hakone and Tokyo. In Oslo, between 2-5 December 2002 leading representatives of the two sides \u2013 Ministers G L Peiris, Milinda Moragoda and Rauf Hakeem on the government side and the leader of the Political Wing S P Thamil Selvam, Anton Balasingham and Jay Maheswaran on the LTTE side \u2013 achieved a great breakthrough. It culminated in the historic agreement when for the first time, the LTTE gave up its unwavering and consistent demand, of over 20 years, for a separate State of Tamil Eelam:",
    "Responding to a proposal by the leadership of the LTTE, the parties agreed to explore a solution founded on the principle of internal self-determination in areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people, based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka. The parties acknowledged that the solution has to be acceptable to all communities.",
    "This was a massive achievement apparent to anyone who had followed the history of the tortuous road of Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic conflict and attempts at its resolution. Ranil had won a major victory for his people and his country.",
