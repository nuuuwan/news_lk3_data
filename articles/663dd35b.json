  "original_body_lines": [
    "It is no secret that US president Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are both members of an exclusive mutual admiration society. Posting recently on his Truth Social platform,Trump praised Netanyahu lavishly saying there was \u201cno one that I know who could have worked in better harmony\u201d with him. Netanyahu responded  \u201cWe will continue to work together to defeat our common enemies, free our hostages, and quickly expand the circle of peace.\u201d",
    "Trump also  waded into a controversial  area to take up cudgels on behalf of Netanyahu. Referring to the on going cases of corruption in Israeli courts against  the Israeli premier, Trump  demanded that Netanyahu be let off the hook. According to  news reports,Trump wanted the cases against Netanyahu to  be \u201ccancelled immediately\u201d or he should be given a pardon, adding that he learned Netanyahu was due to appear in court on Monday. Trump described the case against Netanyahu as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. Trump described his long-time ally as a \u201cgreat hero, who has done so much\u201d for Israel, and a \u201cwarrior\u201d.",
    "Another western media analyst  observed thus \u2013\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s trials have been taking place against the backdrop of the conflicts Israel has been engaged in since the deadly and unprecedented 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, leading to delays in the legal proceedings.In particular, the length of the war against Hamas in Gaza has led to claims by some that Netanyahu wants to prolong the fighting to delay elections and the conclusion of his trials.\u201d",
    "It is against this backdrop that this column focuses  this week on the court cases concerning corruption charges against  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Even as Netanyahu  continues to unleash a cruel genocidal war against the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, The Damoclean sword of legal proceedings hangs above him. Legal circles opine that if convicted Netanyahu could face imprisonment up to ten years. Netanyahu has denied any wrong doing and emphasised his innocence.",
    "Benjamin Netanyahu known as \u201cBibi\u201d is the longest serving Prime Minister in Israel\u2019s history. He has served as PM from 1996 to 1999, 2009 to 2021 and from 2022 to date. Altogether \u201cBibi\u201dNetanhahu has been Israeli premier for more than 17  years.",
    "When allegations of corruption began to surface against Netanyahu, the Israeli Police commenced \u2013 in December 2016  \u2013 a  discreet   investigation despite the fact that Bibi was the prime minister of Israel. Subsequently news about the investigation became known to the public..",
    "On 3 August 2017 the Israeli Police announced that Prime Minister Netanyahu had been \u201cinterviewed\u201d on more than one occasion regarding allegations of corruption. Police said follow up action regarding  an indictment would be taken by the Attorney-General\u2019s department. On the following day newspapers reported that Netanyahu\u2019s former chief of staff Ari Harrow would turn state witness and testify against Netanyahu in court.",
    "Netanyahu dismissed the Police charges against him as \u201cbaseless and unfounded\u201d. He announced he would  continue to remain as prime minister and would not resign. This resulted in   demonstrations being held every Sunday in various parts of Israel.The protesters demanded that there should be no interference with the investigation and that legal action  should  not  be delayed.",
    "The  Police investigation focused on five areas and five different case files were opened. It was reported in the press on 25 November 2018 that Economic Crimes Division director Liat Ben \u2013 Ari had recommended that Netanyahu be charged for corruption.",
    "After an intense probe, Israeli State Prosecutor  Shai Nitzan  officially  recommended  on 19 December 2018 to Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be indicted on five charges..The following day on 20 December 2018, Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced he would \u201cwork quickly\u201d on the case, but emphasised that it would not be  \u201c at the expense of quality decisions and professionalism\u201d",
    "On 28 February 2019, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party filed a motion in the Israeli Supreme Court against the Attorney -General making a public statement regarding the Netanyahu investigation. The Supreme Court rejected it. Immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, Attorney -General Mandelblit announced publicly that  he would be indicting Prime Minister Netanyahu on three of the five charges recommended by the Police. The AG said the indictment would take effect after a public hearing.",
    "The hearing was held in October 2019. On 21 November 2019, the Israeli Attorney-General formally  indicted the Israeli Prime Minister in  three cases  -numbered 1000, 2000 and 4000 \u2013  on charges of Bribery,Fraud and Breach of trust.  Thus Benjamin Netanyahu became the first sitting Prime minister in Israel\u2019s history to be indicted for criminal offences. If convicted Netanyahu could  face prison sentences up to ten years for bribery and up to three years for fraud and breach of trust.",
    "Consequently  on 23 November  2019  Netanyahu  relinquished the ministerial portfolios held by him such as Agriculture, Health, Social affairs and Diaspora affairs. This was in accordance  with a legal precedent set in 1993 .Netanyahu continued to remain as Prime minister. It is  yet to be tested in courts whether an indicted Prime Minister could continue to remain in office.",
    "The indictment of Netanyahu in CASE 1000 concerns two billionaire businessmen One is well known Hollywood  movie mogul  Arnon Milchan and the other is James Packer the son of Australian media magnate Kerry Packer. The prosecution says Netanyahu has been receiving gifts of  expensive cigars and wine from both billionaires for several years The  value of these gifts are estimated at US$ 195,000.  The prosecution also alleges that Netanyahu\u2019s wife Sara received jewellery valued at 31,000 $ dollars as presents. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said the gifts were given continuously, \u201csuch that they became a sort of \u2018supply channel\u201d. Mandeblit said the gifts \u201c were given to Netanyahu \u201cin connection with his public roles and his status as Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u201d.",
    "In return Netanyahu is accused of using his influence as Prime minister to  help Milchan and his friend Packer  in commercial dealings such as company mergers. Netanyahu is  also accused of trying to secure tax exemptions for Milchan. It is also alleged that Netanyahu interceded thrice  with former US secretary of State John Kerry on Milchan\u2019s behalf.",
    "In  CASE  2000 the charges pertain to Netanyahu\u2019s relationship with Arnon Mozes the proprietor and publisher of  Israel\u2019s largest selling newspaper \u201cYedioth Ahronoth\u201d. Netanyahu is accused of a deal with Mozes by which the newspaper promoted Netanyahu and his family positively while projecting his political rivals negatively. In return Netanyahu is accused of introducing legislation  concerning the media that  helped impose restrictions on rival newspapers while aiding Mozes to maximise profits.",
    "Attorney -General Mandelblit in his  indictment summary said Netanyahu and  Mozes conducted three series of meetings between 2008 and 2014.During these meetings, Netanyahu and Mozes \u201cengaged in discussions regarding the promotion of their common interests: improving the coverage that Mr. Netanyahu received in the \u2018Yedioth Aharonoth\u2019 media group; and the imposition of restrictions on the \u2018Israel Hayom\u2019 newspaper\u201d, Mandelblit said in the summary.",
    "CASE 4000  concerns the communications conglomerate  \u201cBezeq\u201downed by entrepreneur Shaul Elovitch.Case  4000 indicts Netanyahu for granting regulatory favours to Bezeq in return for positive coverage of him and his wife on the  news website  \u201cWalla\u201dcontrolled by Elovitch.",
    "According to the Attorney -General\u2019s indictment summary ,Netanyahu, in his capacity as communications minister at the time, provided regulatory benefits to Shaul Elovitch, the owner of Bezeq who also controlled the news website Walla.The benefits reportedly included mergers and financial gains.In exchange, Elovitch provided favourable coverage of Netanyahu and his wife.",
    "Netanyahu \u201cdealt on several occasions with regulatory matters pertaining to Mr Elovitch, and took specific actions that promoted significant business interests of Mr Elovitch of substantial financial value\u201d, the indictment summary said.",
    "Apart from CASE 1000,CASE 2000 and CASE 4000 where Indictments were filed against Netanyahu, the Israeli Attorney -General did not proceed with two other cases. The first was CASE 1270 in which Netanyahu was suspected of trying to appoint district court president Hila Gerstel  as Attorney -General in return for the new AG   dropping charges against Sara Netanyahu over another matter. Gerstel reportedly refused the offer. The AG did not proceed with the case due to inadequate evidence.",
    "The other  was CASE 3000 concerning the purchase of  three Dolphin-class submarines and four Sa\u2019ar 6-class corvettes  from the German company \u201cThyssenKrupp\u201d by Israel costing more than a billion dollars.  It was alleged that the decision to purchase from the German company \u201cThyssenKrupp\u201d was a sordid, underhand  deal .Netanyahu\u2019s cousin and personal lawyer David Shimron, who represented the German company in Israel is one of the prime suspects. However Netanyahu was dropped as a direct suspect in the case after investigations.",
    "The  Netanyahu indictment trial commenced  on 24 May 2020, in the Jerusalem District Court, with judges Rivka Friedman-Feldman, Moshe Bar-Am, and Oded Shaham presiding, and Friedman-Feldman serving as the lead judge.",
    "The trial had four preliminary hearings in 2020. At the first hearing,  the judges read out the charges. Netanyahu was exempted from appearing at most subsequent hearings. On 5 April 2021, the trial moved into the phase of hearing witness testimonies.  Three former confidants of Netanyahu were implicated in criminal charges, and agreed to serve as state witnesses as part of plea bargain agreements.",
    "The prosecution rested in July 2024. Netanyahu\u2019s testimony was scheduled to begin on 2 December 2024. Due to several reasons including much \u201cfilibustering\u201d by Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers, it did not happen as scheduled. Finally Netanyahu\u2019s cross examination began on June 3, 2025.",
    "President Trump\u2019s public declaration that  the cases against  Netanyahu should either be dropped or a pardon should be given to the Israeli PM is likely to impact on the cases concerned. Trump\u2019s  glowing references to Netanyahu as a \u201cgreat hero, who has done so muchfor Israel\u201d  is likely to strike a responsive chord in the hearts and minds of many Israelis. In such a situation ,  a great question mark hangs over the  future of the  legal proceedings relating to  Benjamin  Netanyahu. Will the Israeli Prime minister be prosecuted and convicted for bribery,fraud and breach of trust?",
