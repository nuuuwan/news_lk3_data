The panel, moderated by Kunle Adeniyi, delved into challenges, opportunities, and best practices associated with integrating gender perspectives into climate policies, particularly concerning women\u2019s health.",
    "The policy dialogue also featured an exhibition showcasing best practices, innovations, and community-led actions in gender-inclusive climate action. Participants emphasized the need for collaborative efforts among government, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations to address the gender dimensions of climate change effectively.",
    "As the dialogue concluded, stakeholders expressed their renewed commitment to advancing gender-responsive climate policies and action, recognizing the imperative of placing women and girls at the center of climate action for a sustainable and equitable future.
