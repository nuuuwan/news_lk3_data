  "original_body_lines": [
    "It is bound to be hugely welcomed by civilized sections that some prominent Western states have voiced their backing for Palestinian statehood. The latest of such states to do so are Britain, France and Canada; all well within the G7 fold.",
    "Such increasing advocacy for a Palestinian state could be seen as a happy sign that humanity is finally triumphing over Realpolitik. It is quite apposite given current conditions in the Gaza that Western political leaders are increasingly voicing their protest over the lot of the Gazans and other Palestinian sections.",
    "It ought to be plain that it is the heart-rending conditions of the Palestinian people consequent to the unrelenting Israeli military action, that are awakening the consciences of these influential political personalities. This is in order because it is humane considerations that are of paramount importance at anytime, anywhere.",
    "However, humanity would need to be quickly accompanied by a political solution to the wasting Middle Eastern conflict and it is from this viewpoint that the \u2018Two State Solution\u2019 needs to be advocated with renewed interest. Whatever the criticisms leveled against it, it is only the above formula that holds out the promise of a just peace.",
    "A Palestinian state is a crucial need; equally essential is an Israeli state free of security worries. One could not be had without the other and those critical of the existence of Israel need to focus on this central truth.",
    "However, it does not follow from this premise that Israeli military excesses and inhumanity in the Gaza and other regions could be overlooked by the world community. A reduction in these abuses and excesses is an essential precondition for talks geared to finding a political solution to the Middle East tangle.",
    "Accordingly, the first phase of the peace process should aim at putting an end to the present armed hostilities between Israel and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas. The resultant comparatively peaceful environment could prove highly conducive to constructive talks between the sides.",
    "Meanwhile, it is also a triumph of humanity that more and more civilian sections worldwide are protesting the savagery in the Gaza. This amounts to a moral triumph for justice and peace. This cause needs to be backed in the days ahead with increasing vibrancy. Besides, these moves are of importance in the process of internationally alienating the Trump administration and in piling pressure on it to bring the Netanyahu regime to the negotiating table.",
    "In addition to \u2018people pressure\u2019, the Western governments that have voiced for Palestinian statehood are now obliged to ensure that more and more fellow states would be standing alongside them in this cause. Ideally, the rest of the G7 should be making common cause with them.",
    "Of the major Western countries mentioned, Canada has perhaps voiced some of the more constructive steps that could lead to a negotiated peace. The Mark Carney administration was quoted as stressing the need for proactive moves on the part of the Palestinian Authority to lay the basis for a political solution. Among other things, Canada said that the Authority should ensure the holding of general elections in 2026, \u2018in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.\u2019",
    "While the above steps could lead to the establishment of a democratic process in the Palestinian regions and ensure that the non-militant, unarmed sections of the Palestnian population would have a predominant role in the forging of their future, the advisability of militant groups being coopted into the democratic process, provided they lay down arms, needs to be also considered by the backers of peace.",
    "After all, some years back the PLO ensured the establishment of the Palestinian Authority by saying \u2018No\u2019 to a military solution. If some \u2018democratic space\u2019 is provided to the militant groups the chances are that they too would join the peace process.",
    "However, it is of some interest that President Trump too has voiced concern for the Gazans in their continuing suffering. He has taken the position that their material hardships should be ended. This provides an opening of sorts for the steady sensitizing of Trump and his administration towards taking some positive moves in the direction of ending the \u2018slaughter of the innocents\u2019 in the Gaza. The time\u2019s ripe for the more civilized quarters among the international community to mount steady moral pressure on the US President.",
    "The initiative on this front should come primarily from domestic civilian sections and supportive political groups, such as the Democrats. They could exploit the growing popular disenchantment with the US President to pressure him into taking concrete action to ease the lot of the Palestinians. Such moves could pay some dividends considering that mid-term elections in the US are not very far off. Central to this strategy should be the consideration that the Republicans cannot afford to lose face at the upcoming polls.",
    "Meanwhile pro-peace sections within the US need to consider it to be obligatory to raise domestic awareness on the need to end the Middle East conflict by peaceful means. In fact the ideal situation in this connection would be for pro-peace movements worldwide to team up to bring peace to the Middle East by uniting as a single but broad pressure group.",
    "However, it is not only the Israeli and US governments that possess the power and influence to end the Middle East conflict. There are external quarters such as Iran and other regional states supportive of Palestinian militancy who could prove decisive in ending the bloodletting. They too need to get their act together and bring pressure on Hamas and its allies to give a negotiated peace a try. It could not be emphasized enough that Israel and its backers need to be convinced that Israel could lead a secure existence beside a Palestinian state.",
    "Pro-peace sections should find it encouraging to note that the majority of UN member states are backers of Palestinian statehood. Their campaign has been further strengthened by key Western democracies, who had come to be seen as sworn allies of the US, now making common cause with them. It is up to this broad movement to ensure that its influence and power is decisive and impactful. They should stand up and be counted in the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council.",
