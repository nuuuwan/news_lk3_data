  "original_body_lines": [
    "Requesting newly elected president of Sri Lanka, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, to make a fresh beginning by using his sovereign Presidential powers and order the release of all Indian fishermen languishing in Sri Lankan jails as a token of goodwill and love, India\u2019s Congress MP, R Sudha, who was recently elected from Mayiladuthurai constituency, said such a gesture will add a lot of muscle to his avowed objective of giving Sri Lanka a new direction.",
    "In an \u2018open-hearted and open minded\u2019 letter to Dissanayake, the Indian MP asked the Sri Lankan President to release the fishermen and return all their boats in good usable condition as early as possible as a token of goodwill and love and said that such a gesture would add a lot of muscle to his avowed objective of giving Sri Lanka a new direction.",
    "A good beginning could be made by releasing the 37 fishermen from Mayiladuthurai constituency, she said, adding that 80 other fishermen and 173 fishing boats were under the custody of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIndia shares maritime boundaries with several nations, including such a belligerent neighbour like Pakistan. But, no country arrests, fines, damages and attacks fishermen from neighbouring countries so regularly as Sri Lanka does. The provocations come from the Sri Lankan side far too regularly, testing the patience and peace in the region. Fishermen cannot be treated like criminals for fishing in common waters like the Bay of Bengal,\u201d she said.",
    "But that was in the past, she said, adding: \u201cNow that you are at the helm, promising a fresh beginning, new outlook and prosperity for your nation, I request you to use your sovereign Presidential powers.\u201d"
