### Sri Lanka says Adani Port Project to continue despite US charges

*2024-12-13 13:04:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104211/sri-lanka-says-adani-port-project-to-continue-despite-us-charges) ┬╖ `en`

Indian conglomerate Adani GroupтАЩs port project in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite US charges against its founder and sudden changes to its financing, the island nation said Friday.

A bombshell indictment in New York last month accused billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani and several colleagues of deliberately misleading international investors as part of a bribery scheme.

The charges sent Adani stocks into freefall and again raised questions over corporate governance at the family firm, whose founder is considered a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But Sri Lankan ports minister Bimal Ratnayake said the allegations against Adani had no bearing on the deep-sea container terminal project in the capital Colombo.

тАЬThe problem between Adani and the US... is not our concern,тАЭ he told reporters during a tour of the port on Thursday night.

тАЬIt is of high importance for us that western container terminal development by Adani goes ahead.тАЭ
