It is clear that the electorate is seeking a break from dynastic politics and unaccountable governance in favour of pragmatic solutions and reformist policies тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The 2024 Sri Lankan general election marks a potential turning point in the nationтАЩs political trajectory, especially with the National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) movement challenging the dominance of established political forces.

This election, unlike previous ones, underscored the prominence of socio-economic concerns over the historical ethnic and religious issues that once polarised Sri Lankan voters.

### History Is Going To Repeat Again: Lifting Ban On Vehicle Imports Could Trigger It

*2024-11-20 05:39:18* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/history-is-going-to-repeat-again-lifting-ban-on-vehicle-imports-could-trigger-it/) ┬╖ `en`

History is going to repeat again. It is going to begin on 01 February 2025, with the lifting of import ban on passenger vehicles. With the blessing of the governor of the central bank, the government has already promised to remove the import restrictions of vehicles on February 01, 2025. On that day, it will begin to set the necessary conditions for a full-blown crisis again, possibly within a year or so. If the unrealized demand for vehicles for the past few years is accounted, the crisis could even begin within months.

This time only advisors are different. Previously, it was Dr. PB Jayasundera, presidentтАЩs secretary of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the former governor of the central bank. This time the advisors are Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the incumbent governor of the central bank and the Director General of customs.
