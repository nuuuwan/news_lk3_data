  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka should be vigilant about the Adani power project in the island, experts said, after Federal prosecutors in New York indicted Group Chairman Gautam Adani and seven others on multiple counts of fraud.",
    "Sri Lanka has often seen cases of significant corruption in the country being exposed in other jurisdictions, according to Nishan De Mel, Executive Director of Verit\u00e9 Research, a Colombo-based think tank.",
    "He referred to the allegations of bribery in Sri Lankan Airlines\u2019 purchase of aircraft from Airbus, which surfaced in a United Kingdom-based investigation a few years ago, and to the Pandora Papers that threw up names of local politicians and businessmen.",
    "\u201cIt is very important for Sri Lanka to redouble its efforts against corruption, to ensure that we are protected from corrupt deals,\u201d he told The Hindu.",
    "After news on the alleged bribery scheme of the Adani Group surfaced on Thursday, many citizens and activists in Sri Lanka took to social media and called for greater scrutiny of the Group\u2019s power project on the island.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who won the Presidency this September, and his National People\u2019s Power [NPP] alliance, which secured a historic, two-thirds majority in the November 14 general election, have pledged to root out corruption.",
    "Days before his election win, Mr. Dissanayake vowed to cancel the \u201ccorrupt Adani deal\u201d if his government came to power. Subsequently, Foreign Minister and Cabinet spokesperson of the interim administration said the government would \u201creview\u201d the project after the Parliamentary polls.",
    "The International Monetary Fund, too, in its ongoing programme with Sri Lanka, has underscored the need to arrest \u201ccorruption vulnerabilities\u201d.",
    "Adani Green Energy is investing $442 million in a wind power project in Mannar and Pooneryn in northern Sri Lanka. From the time the former Gotabaya Rajapaksa government roped in the firm in 2022, the project has remained controversial. The main political opposition accused the conglomerate of \u201cbackdoor entry\u201d, in the absence of an open call for tenders.",
    "The same year, a top Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) official told a Parliamentary panel that the project was given to the Adani Group after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u201cpressured\u201d President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The official subsequently resigned, after withdrawing his original statement.",
    "Regardless, the Ranil Wickremesinghe administration went ahead with the project, amid questions from corruption watchdogs. When the Adani Group came under the global spotlight in early 2023, and its stocks plummeted in the wake of U.S. short seller Hindenburg accusing it of pulling the \u201clargest con in corporate history\u201d, then Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka Ali Sabry said the Wickremesinghe administration was \u201cvery, very confident\u201d of the future of the project, which it saw as a \u201cgovernment-to-government\u201d deal with India.",
    "Earlier this year, environmentalists and Mannar residents moved Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court, challenging the project on grounds of potential environmental impact and \u201clack of transparency\u201d. The case was taken up by a five-member Bench and the next hearing is scheduled on March 18 and 19, 2025, according to sources familiar with the proceedings.",
    "The renewable energy project is one of two projects that the Adani Group is executing in Sri Lanka. Its other major investment is the Adani Ports-led container terminal project in Colombo. In November 2023, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) announced a $553-million investment in the project, a\u00a0 $700-million joint venture among Adani Ports, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings."
