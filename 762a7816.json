  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has rebuffed another invitation from President Ranil Wickremesinghe to work together with his administration, demanding instead that he dissolve parliament soon.",
    "SJB legislator Nalin Bandara told reporters on Tuesday July 04 that Wickremesinghe can do the party as well as the country a favour by dissolving parliament and facilitating an election so he may continue to govern with a newly elected SJB government for a \u201cwhile longer\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe whole country says the 225 members currently in parliament have no mandate. We too say this is a corruption of the mandate,\u201d said Bandara, responding to questions by journalists on the president\u2019s latest invitation to set aside political differences and work with him to steer Sri Lanka out of its various crises and towards development.",
    "\u201cHe is a cunning politician. He is only helping us to get what he wants,\u201d the MP said, demanding that the president put an end to what he called his \u201cdeal\u201d with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and dissolve parliament.",
    "The SLPP is controlled by the powerful Rajapaksa family led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The party backed its erstwhile arch rival Wikremesinghe en masse in July 2022 when parliament elected the successor of Raapaksa\u2019s younger brother Gotabaya who had just resigned having fled the country following widespread protests.",
    "Speaking at an event on Monday July 03, President Wickremesinghe repeated an invitation he had previously extended to the SJB led by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa to prioritise the national interest over politics and join him in resolving the problems faced by the public. Wickremesinghe said the SJB can remain in the opposition and continue to support his administration\u2019s recovery and reform agenda through the parliamentary committee system. Creating additional responsibilities for the opposition can also be discussed with the speaker of parliament, he said.",
    "\u201cI ask Premadasa and the entire opposition to at least now join us and together resolve the problems of the people,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cPlease, support the government. We will guarantee that there will be no threat to the post of opposition leader. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. The leader of the house has said he\u2019ll see to it,\u201d he said.",
    "In response, MP Bandara said the SJB can consider Wickremesinghe\u2019s offer to \u201chelp\u201d the SJB once he has dissolved parliament, something Wickremesinghe is legally capable of doing since March 2023.",
    "\u201cIf you want to help us, immediately dissolve parliament. That\u2019ll be a favour to us and the country. Then he can continue to govern with a new team for a while longer,\u201d he said.",
    "President Wickremesinghe in his speech on Monday expressed disappointment with the SJB for what he insinuated was a politically motivated attack on Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt restructuring plan, which was what prompted his invitation to the party whose members had walked out on him in 2020 abandoning the United National Party (UNP), the party he\u2019s been leading for over 25 years.",
    "The domestic debt optimisation (DDO) proposal was passed in parliament on Saturday July 01, though the SJB and a number of other opposition parties had voted against it. This was despite SJB legislator Harsha de Silva who chairs the parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (COPF) earlier expressing muted support for the plan as long as there was no haircut.",
    "\u201cAs long there is no principal haircut, as long as the depositors are safeguarded, as long as the EPF members are not unjustly impacted, then we can consider options. But we\u2019ll first have to see what the burden share is, how much the fiscal contribution is, how much the external debt relief is, and then what the domestic debt relief is expected to be,\u201d de Silva told EconomyNext on June 28.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s next election a battle of ideologies: Harsha de SilvaSee more",
    "The SJB, which promotes a social market economic system, was among the first to urge ex-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s government to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ahead of what became the country\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades.",
    "Sri Lanka eventually went into an agreement with the IMF for a 2.9 billion US dollar extended fund facility and is now under an ambitious reform programme that runs the risk of being politically unpopular. Proposed privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and fiscal consolidation plans have drawn harsh criticism from left-leaning parties in the opposition, with the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) dominating an increasingly hostile anti-IMF discourse. This is despite visible improvements in Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomic situation including rapidly falling inflation, though poverty has surged since the crisis and millions have yet to feel the benefits.",
    "Against this backdrop, critics of the SJB say the party has been forced to take an anti-reform position going against its own core beliefs. The party leadership has also been accused of embracing populism in the face of a slow rise in the president\u2019s popularity, at least among the urban middle classes.",
    "\u201cPresident Wickremesinghe may have gained some popularity in the last few months. I\u2019m not going to take that away from him. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the UNP has gained anything significant,\u201d said de Silva, speaking to EconomyNext on June 28.",
    "\u201cThe SJB, whether you like it or not, is the largest political grouping outside of the SLPP from the last election. The SLPP has deteriorated. It is nothing, really. The SJB has a fair number of people that are with us.",
    "MP de Silva\u2019s colleague Bandara, meanwhile, accused the NPP of abandoning the agitation against the government, criticising NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake over his highly publicised visit to Melbourne, Australia, where he was seen speaking to large crowds of Sri Lankans domiciled there.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re now on tour. But Sajith Premadasa and SJB continue to provide leadership against this wrong deal with the IMF,\u201d said Bandara. (Colombo/Jul04/2023)"
