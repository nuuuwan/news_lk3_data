    "A resolution endorsing the declaration received 142 votes in favor and 10 against, while 12 countries abstained.",
    "The vote comes ahead of a meeting of world leaders on September 22 - on the sidelines of the high-level U.N. General Assembly - where Britain, France, and Australia are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state.",

    "The United States described the vote as \u201cyet another misguided and ill-timed publicity stunt\u201d that undermined serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.",
    "\u201cMake no mistake, this resolution is a gift to Hamas,\u201d U.S. diplomat Morgan Ortagus told the General Assembly. \u201cFar from promoting peace, the conference has already prolonged the war, emboldened Hamas and harmed the prospects of peace in both short and long term.\u201d",
    "Israel, which has long criticized the U.N. for not condemning Hamas by name for the October 7 attacks, dismissed the declaration as one-sided and described the vote as theater.",
