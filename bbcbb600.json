    "COLOMBO (News 1st); US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that India\u2019s proactive actions have been critical to supporting the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 reform efforts.",
    "Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen was speaking at the at U.S.- India Business Council Ideas Summit on Tuesday (13).",
    "\"During the past six months, we have made progress across a number of areas. Debt distress in the developing world continues to pose a risk to macroeconomic growth and stability. Much more needs to be done to provide timely and comprehensive debt treatments. But we have taken steps forward on urgent cases like Sri Lanka \u2013 where India\u2019s proactive actions have been critical to supporting the authorities\u2019 reform efforts. We are continuing to push for urgent action in other cases as well,\" she added.",
    "\"We\u2019ve also made progress on our collective efforts to evolve the multilateral development banks to better address global challenges \u2013 like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. And we are working together to shape the digital economy. We are collaborating with India to deliver tangible outcomes on the G20\u2019s work to enhance cross-border payments \u2013 as well as our financial inclusion efforts to connect the unbanked around the world,\" she noted.",
    "First, we have made significant progress to strengthen our bilateral ties with India. The United States is India\u2019s largest trading partner. In 2022, our bilateral trade reached over $190 billion. And we have significant cross-border investments and durable people-to-people ties as the two largest democracies in the world.",
    "Our Administration has taken concrete steps to build on this robust foundation. The first step has been enhancing our economic dialogue. The U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership has been a centerpiece of our formal economic dialogue since the Global Financial Crisis. We have moved the EFP meetings from an annual to a quarterly cadence. And I have personally met with Indian Finance Minister Sitharaman over ten times since assuming office. This reflects the importance of our close collaboration with India on issues spanning the macroeconomy to climate finance to financial regulation. We have also been close partners in responding to global disruptions and advancing our shared goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific. We are working closely with India, Australia, and Japan through the Quad. And we are writing new rules for the 21st century economy with India and a dozen other countries through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Last month, IPEF member countries reached a first-of-its-kind international supply chains agreement under the Framework.",
    "Supply chain resilience has certainly been a major goal of our recent cooperation. After the shocks of recent years, the United States is pursuing a policy called \u201cfriendshoring\u201d to deepen integration with our trusted trading partners. Our aim is to expand trade ties with the broad array of countries we can rely on \u2013 in order to create more redundancies in our critical supply chains. India is one of our reliable trading partners. Among other initiatives, we are working to connect new communities to the global market. And we are working to do so in a way that helps these communities move up the value chain.",
    "Looking forward, I believe that we have significant potential to grow trade and investment between our nations. Both of our countries are advancing what I call \u201cmodern supply-side\u201d policies \u2013 investing in human capital, physical capital, and science and technology to boost our long-term economic potential. Prime Minister Modi has launched a massive infrastructure program \u2013 just as our country is beginning to see the early results of President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. India\u2019s infrastructure investments have significant potential to boost productivity and increase the efficiency of trade between our two countries. Treasury is actively working with the Indian government to help them attract more private sector capital to close India\u2019s infrastructure gap. Both of our countries are also pursuing leadership in clean energy technologies. Together, I believe our innovations can help push down the cost curves of new technologies and accelerate the world\u2019s transition to a net-zero economy.",
    "Second, beyond our bilateral relationship, we are working closely with India during its G20 presidency on global economic issues. I believe that our close collaboration is showing the world how advanced and emerging economies can bridge policy differences and make progress on our shared policy objectives. When India and the United States work together, we can add significant momentum to important efforts.",
    "During the past six months, we have made progress across a number of areas. Debt distress in the developing world continues to pose a risk to macroeconomic growth and stability. Much more needs to be done to provide timely and comprehensive debt treatments. But we have taken steps forward on urgent cases like Sri Lanka \u2013 where India\u2019s proactive actions have been critical to supporting the authorities\u2019 reform efforts.

We are collaborating with India to deliver tangible outcomes on the G20\u2019s work to enhance cross-border payments \u2013 as well as our financial inclusion efforts to connect the unbanked around the world.",
    "There is much more to do. As you continue your work, know this: you have a strong and reliable partner in me and the U.S. Treasury Department. I look forward to supporting American businesses in India. And I appreciate you letting us know where we can provide greater certainty and guidance to facilitate economic and commercial activity between our two countries.",
