  "original_body_lines": [
    "Newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto announced Indonesia\u2019s largest-ever Cabinet late Sunday, with 109 members representing his pledge for a strong government.",
    "He named his Cabinet of ministers, vice ministers and head of national agencies the \u201cRed and White Cabinet,\u201d referring to the colors of Indonesia\u2019s flag.",
    "Subianto became the eighth president of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy on Sunday.",
    "The Cabinet of Subianto\u2019s predecessor, Joko Widodo, had 34 ministers and head of government agencies.",
    "Subianto has said earlier that he needs a strong administration, even though analysts said that his \u201cfat\u201d Cabinet would bloat the bureaucracy.",
    "\u201cI want to create a strong government that would unite our multicultural society and diverse political interests,\u201d Subianto said before inviting more than 100 people for interviews at his residence last week. \u201cIt must be a big coalition, and some will say my Cabinet is fat.\u201d",
    "The Cabinet features politicians from a coalition of seven parties who supported his victory in the February election, and figures allied with Widodo\u2019s Cabinet, who were reappointed to continue their jobs under Subianto\u2019s presidency. Analysts said the move was a political reward to Widodo for the latter\u2019s tacit support in the election.",
    "Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodo\u2019s son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents don\u2019t typically endorse candidates.",
    "Subianto was a longtime rival of the Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019.",
    "But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing president\u2019s heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry.",
    "Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in February\u2019s direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity.",
    "Subianto reappointed nearly half of Widodo\u2019s Cabinet members, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, making her the first person to hold the ministry under three different presidents.",
    "Indrawati, 62, who has served as the executive director of the International Monetary Fund and managing director of the World Bank, is one of Indonesia\u2019s longest-serving finance ministers, having held the post for long stretches under Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo.",
    "She has earned considerable respect in international circles, particularly for her reforms of the chaotic Indonesian taxation system and her role in steering Indonesia through the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "\u201cWe regularly consulted with each other to discuss strategies for strengthening the Finance Ministry and the state finances to support his programs,\u201d Indrawati told reporters after meeting with Subianto last week.",
    "Other ministers from Widodo\u2019s Cabinet include Interior Minister Tito Karnavian, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia and State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir.",
    "Subianto has announced an ambitious goal of increasing annual economic growth to 8% by the end of his five-year term, and embarking on an ambitious spending program, including an increase in defense spending, hikes in civil servants\u2019 salaries, and a program to give 83 million children free meals."
