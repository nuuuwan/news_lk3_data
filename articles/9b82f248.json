    "Successfully completes phase one of \u2018Mahata Wahina Wasi Wassa\u2019 initiative",
    "DIMO, a leading diversified conglomerate in Sri Lanka, launched the \u2018Mahata Wahina Wasi Wassa\u2019 initiative to empower farmers by offering free laptops, tabs, electric bicycles, and overseas travel opportunities with each Mahindra tractor purchase.",
    "Farmers who purchase Mahindra tractors between 1 August and 30 November, are eligible for these exclusive gift packages with various choices available. The first package includes an electric bicycle, the second offers a group trip to Malaysia with meals and accommodation, the third combines a laptop and tabs, and the fourth includes two mud wheels and a laptop. Farmers can select their preferred gift package from these options with each Mahindra tractor purchase. The company successfully completed the first phase of this transformative project recently.",
    "DIMO is committed to advancing technological adoption in the local agriculture sector as a key distributor of globally renowned agri machinery brands. The Mahata Wahina Wasi Wassa initiative promotes this goal by providing farmers with laptops and tabs, enabling easy access to information on crop management, modern farming methods, pricing, and more to elevate their agricultural practices.",
    "DIMO Executive Director and Head of the Agri Machinery Division Rajeev Pandithage said, \u201cThe Mahata Wahina Wasi Wassa is more than a promotional offer, it is an opportunity to make a meaningful difference for farmers and their families. Laptops and tablets, for instance, can assist with children\u2019s education and allow family members to further enhance their knowledge through online courses. The electric bike provides a cost-effective transportation solution, while an overseas trip could broaden farmers\u2019 experiences and perspectives. Our thoughtfully designed gift packages meet the diverse needs of farmers and their families. We look forward to implementing more such initiatives in the future.\u201d",
