Former Minister Udaya Gammanpila has arrived at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) this morning (29) to lodge a complaint.

The complaint concerns the alleged transfer of monthly salaries by government Members of Parliament to a party fund, which, according to Gammanpila, is subsequently used for political activities.

Speaking to the media after filing the complaint, Gammanpila stated that Members of Parliament are not permitted to utilize their monthly allowances at their own discretion.

He alleged that 159 government MPs, by transferring over Rs. 30 million collectively each month into a party fund and using it for political purposes, are misusing public funds.

“Sending this money to party funds, which are then used to pay telephone bills, fuel expenses, and office maintenance, and subsequently directing it toward political activities, constitutes a misuse of public funds,” Gammanpila said.

As the global population nears 8.5 billion by 2030, we still waste 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually – enough to feed three billion people. Sri Lanka is no exception. This crisis calls for urgent action, and increasingly, young people are emerging as catalysts for change.

The traditional “take-make-use-discard” model has proved unsustainable. A shift toward circular approaches – refuse, regenerate, reuse, and redesign – is gaining global momentum. At the heart of this transformation lies a simple truth: when young people embrace circular principles, they can reshape communities and inspire wider system change.

### COPE, oversight, and boundaries of power: Necessary caution

*2025-09-29 05:53:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/COPE-oversight-and-boundaries-of-power-Necessary-caution/4-782303) · `en`

Strengthening COPE should mean better research support, stronger audit collaboration, and continuous capacity

As someone who has been privileged to represent all three critical domains of the COPE process — as a Chairman of a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE), a Secretary of a Ministry, and as a Chair of COPE — I feel a strong sense of responsibility to express my concerns about the recent proposal put forward under Standing Order 137 by the current COPE Chair, Dr. Nishantha Samaraweera, MP (NPP).

The motion seeks to amend Standing Order 120, granting COPE the authority to directly refer its findings to law enforcement bodies such as the IGP or the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). While I appreciate the spirit of accountability that underpins the proposal, I must stress — with the full weight of my experience — that such a reform must be approached with great care, constitutional awareness, and institutional intelligence.

### CPSTL to enforce merit-based hiring and promotions

Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd., (CPSTL) last week said future decisions on recruitment, promotions, and transfers will be based solely on merit, free from political or personal influence.

CPSTL Chairman D.J.A.S. De S. Rajakaruna, speaking at a media briefing marking one year of the Government’s tenure, said the company had operated without a clear human resources framework for more than three decades. A new policy has now been introduced to address this gap, he noted.

The Chairman urged the public not to seek jobs or transfers through Ministers or senior officials, stressing that only qualifications and experience would guide decisions.

Rajakaruna added that in restructuring its workforce, the company had to reduce staff numbers due to skills gaps and mismatched roles. The new organisational plan, prepared by a State institution after a comprehensive study, defines positions and appointments according to professional criteria.

### Sri Lanka budget deficit down 55-pct in August amid tax inflows, moderate capex

*2025-09-29 05:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-budget-deficit-down-55-pct-in-august-amid-tax-inflows-moderate-capex-242067/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s budget deficit fell to 411 billion rupees in August 2025, down 55 percent from a year earlier, amid a 30.7 percent rise in taxes and slower capital expenditure, official data showed.

Tax revenues grew to 3,068.5 billion rupees, from 2,348.5 billion rupees, and current spending also grew by a double-digit 11.2 percent to 3,381 billion rupees.

Sri Lanka has a public sector bloated by unemployed graduates, and salaries eat up a large volume of taxes, though nominal wage levels fell after recent currency crises and they now have to be increased. A salary hike was given this year.

Central bank wages have been steeply increased amid criticism as it was responsible for the high level of inflation and open market operations, which critics hold out as the height of unaccountability.

Central bank wages are not directly seen in the budget, but is an item that affects non-tax revenues.

### The sacrificial torch Dileepan is not related to the incident; Gajendra team is muddy on us -Ramalingam Chandrasekhar

*2025-09-29 04:55:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226361) · `ta`

Ramalingam Chandrasekhar, a member of the party's executive committee and minister, said the Gajendra team was muddy on us, saying that the sacrificial torch of Dileepan's commemoration on the last day of the pamphlets and the national people's power had nothing to do.

Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekhar made this statement while speaking to the media in Jaffna on Sunday (28).

Dileepan Memorial has been held for the past one week. Was blocked when we went to perform the observance there. After that a few days ago, the last day of memory ended. It was reported that someone had distributed pamphlets on that day and that the Gajendra team had dealt with their violence against him, and some others who had gone to hear justice.

The incident has nothing to do with the national people's power. There is no contribution in this. We don't have that downstream work. As a ruling party, we can take a different way if we want to take up the little ones. We do not do that iconic work.

*2025-09-29 04:45:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226360) · `ta`

I will completely eliminate the state administrative structure of the underworld groups and drug traders. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said many politicians were disturbed when many facts were revealed.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is on an official visit to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government, said this while addressing the Sri Lankan community living in Japan on Sunday (28) in Tokyo.

The drug has caused a massive destruction in the social structure. இளைஞர் யுவதிகளில் பெரும்பாலானோர் போதைப்பொருளுக்கு அடிமையாகியுள்ளார்கள். Most of the prisoners in prisons are involved in drugs and accusations.

The drug trade and the underworld groups are acting as a black kingdom. Negombo police and Tangalle police have been arrested in connection with the shooting incident within the Pudukkadai court.

Army officers who sold arms to the underworld have now been arrested and the T56 guns have gone out of the military camps.

The United National Party (UNP) Chairman Vajira Abeywardena said that we should continue to carry out those contacts.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the United National Party office in Galle on Sunday (28).

The media reported that it was going to look into the assets and responsibilities of politicians and celebrities. My name was also in it. I have submitted over 30 years in relation to my property and responsibilities. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been submitted to the presidency of Ranil Wickremesinghe, through the government's sanctioned anti -corruption law.

When some of our political parties showed up to the world as our country was corrupt, Ranil Wickremasinghe allowed the anti -corruption Bill on August 8, 2023, to Parliament on August 8, 2023.. Must remember one of the people in particular. Ranil Vikramasi, who ruled the country for two and a half years, has set up legal plans to curb this corruption within the country.
