    "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the new NPP government some home truths. Making a special statement, on Thursday, he stressed the need for Sri Lanka to meet the revenue targets set by the IMF and predicted that according to the results of last month\u2019s presidential election, no party will be able to secure an absolute majority in the next Parliament. Urging the public to vote for a team of experienced politicians capable of managing the economy properly, in the upcoming general election, he said only those contesting under the Gas Cylinder symbol fitted the bill. In saying so, he betrayed his bias, but some of the points he made in his statement are valid and deserve serious consideration.",
    "The IMF is being raked over the coals, in some quarters, for its constricting bailout conditions. But what Sri Lanka is required to do by way of meeting IMF conditions is what it should have done a long time ago on its own. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa government slashed taxes, printed a great deal of money, causing high inflation and the depreciation of the rupee and indulged in wasteful expenditure and corrupt practices. Most of all, Sri Lanka borrowed heavily and recklessly, under successive governments, thereby rendering its debt unsustainable. The way out is to make the country\u2019s debt sustainable, increase its revenue, curtail waste, eliminate corruption and attract foreign investment.",
    "Sri Lanka is solely responsible for its present economic crisis, and nobody has pressured it to seek IMF assistance, which it can reject anytime if it thinks there is a better alternative. No institution lends to a country whose debt is unsustainable and revenue is far below expenditure. Above all, a bankrupt nation cannot dictate terms to a lender. Beggars are said to be no choosers.",
    "Even the JVP-led NPP, which, in the run-up to last month\u2019s presidential election, declared its intention to renegotiate the IMF programme, has come to terms with stark reality; the NPP government has chosen to abide by IMF conditions\u2014and rightly so. It has endorsed the Debt Sustainability Analysis stipulated by the IMF. It has had to bite the bullet, but it has belied its critics\u2019 pre-election claim that it would derail the IMF programme if it secured the presidency. However, it will have to do much more to unlock the next tranche of the IMF loan.",
    "Wickremesinghe has said the new government will have to ensure that the country\u2019s revenue will be in the region of 15% of GDP in 2028, when its foreign debt repayment is scheduled to resume. State revenue remains as low as 8.4% of GDP. It will be a gargantuan task to meet the stipulated revenue target, given the pledges both the government and the main Opposition party, the SJB, have given to the public; they have promised tax and tariff reductions, various subsidies and welfare measures. Striking a balance between the task of achieving the aforesaid revenue target and pleasing the public to garner votes is a high-wire act.",
    "If Wickremesinghe\u2019s prediction that the next Parliament will be hung comes true, then political instability might set in, taking its toll on economic recovery efforts. Sri Lankan politicians are not known to cooperate for the sake of the country; what\u2019s in it for them is foremost on their minds when they do anything. Even the Yahapalana administration, which called itself the \u2018National Unity Government\u2019 experienced internecine disputes, which made it dysfunctional in the end, and national security became a casualty of the clashes between Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena.",
    "With the prospect of a hung parliament, there is a stark possibility that political leaders who are currently at one another\u2019s jugular will need to cooperate to maintain political stability and keep economic recovery efforts on track. After all, they keep telling us that they are even ready to die for the country, don\u2019t they?",
