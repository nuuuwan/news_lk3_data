    "SriLankan Airlines has expanded its fleet with the addition of a newly leased Airbus A320 aircraft, identified by the serial number \u20184R \u2013 ABS\u2019, bringing the total number of aircraft in its fleet to 22.",
    "Leased for a period of six years, the aircraft arrived in Colombo from Malaysia on Thursday night (21 Dec.), and is set to enter service promptly after customization and branding. Its inaugural flight is scheduled to take place on 29 December, to the Maldives.",
    "The Airbus A320 is equipped with Sharklet wingtips, contributing to reduced drag and increased fuel efficiency, and will primarily serve on short and medium-haul routes covering the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and the Middle East.",
    "Featuring a configuration of 12 Business Class seats and 138 Economy Class seats, the 4R \u2013 ABS will enable the national carrier to enhance its seating capacity on these routes.",
    "As of now, SriLankan Airlines operates 12 narrow-bodied aircraft and 10 wide-bodied aircraft. Despite the challenges faced by the airline industry throughout the year, including shortages of available aircraft and engines along with supply chain issues, this addition marks the beginning of a fleet expansion.",
    "By the start of January 2024, SriLankan anticipates three more aircrafts to join its fleet, including a wet leased A330 and the arrival of two additional engines. Another sister aircraft to 4R \u2013 ABS is also expected to be delivered in March 2024.",
    "SriLankan Airlines presently operates direct flights between Colombo and 36 cities in 21 countries and is a member of the OneWorld Alliance."
