    "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $200 million concessional loan to the government of Sri Lanka to help stabilise the country\u2019s finance sector following the sovereign debt and economic crises that started in April 2022 when it suspended its external debt payments.",
    "The Financial Sector Stability and Reforms Program comprises two subprograms of $200 million each. Subprogram 1 targets short-term stabilization and crisis management measures that were implemented in 2023, while subprogram 2 is planned to be implemented in 2024 and focuses on structural reforms and long-term actions to restore growth in the banking sector. The program will help strengthen the stability and governance of the country\u2019s banking sector; improve the banking sector\u2019s asset quality; and deepen sustainable and inclusive finance, particularly for women-led micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) latest review, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization, although a full economic recovery is not yet assured.",
    "\u201cThe program\u2019s overarching development objective is fully aligned with the country\u2019s strategy of maintaining finance sector stability, while ensuring that banks are well-positioned for eventual recovery,\u201d said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. \u201cThe expected development outcome is a stable financial system providing access to affordable finance for businesses in various sectors of the economy.\u201d",
    "The program is a follow-on assistance from ADB\u2019s crisis response under the special policy-based loan that was approved for Sri Lanka in May 2023. It is aligned with the fourth pillar of the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility provided to Sri Lanka to help the country regain financial stability. It is also in line with the government\u2019s reform agenda, including strengthening the operational independence of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and its designation as the country\u2019s macroprudential authority.",
    "In designing this subprogram 1 loan, ADB has maintained close coordination and collaboration with the IMF to design targeted regulatory reforms for the banking sector\u2014including the asset quality review\u2014and with the World Bank on strengthening the deposit insurance scheme.",
    "The loan is accompanied by a $1 million grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund to provide advisory, knowledge, and institutional capacity building for Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Finance and CBSL.",
