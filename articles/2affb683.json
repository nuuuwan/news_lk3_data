  "original_title": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna  National Organizer Namal Rajapaksa to Contest Presidential Poll as Business Magnate Dhammika  Perera Withdraws from Presidential Election  as SLPP Candidate",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is set to announce its Presidential candidate today. Earlier in the week, party General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam confirmed that the announcement would be made by SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa at 7:30 a.m. at the SLPP head office on Nelum Mawatha.",
    "While the event was initially scheduled to take place at the foyer of the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre, the venue was later changed to the party office for unexplained reasons. When asked about the change, Kariyawasam said the party felt the head office was the best venue to make such an announcement.",
    "However the SLPP presidential candidate remains uncertain after business leader-turned MP Dhammika Perera, in a letter to the party yesterday, expressed his intention to bow out of the race. In a letter addressed to Kariyawasam, Perera thanked the party for deciding to nominate him as its Presidential candidate but said he was unable to contest due to personal reasons. His sudden withdrawal has now left the SLPP candidacy shrouded in mystery as Perera was the only one circulating in political circles.",
    "Political analysts now speculate it is likely SLPP National Organiser Namal Rajapaksa will now emerge as the party\u2019s candidate. Reports are also rife that his nomination was confirmed by SLPP founder Basil Rajapaksa.",
    "Speaking to the media at the SLPP head office yesterday, Kariyawasam confirmed the candidacy announcement will go ahead and said the party is making the best decision for the future of the country. He expressed confidence that once the announcement is made and nominations are submitted, everyone will agree that the SLPP candidate chosen is the best choice for the Presidency.",
    "However, last week a majority of the SLPP Parliamentary group decided to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe instead, who has announced his intention to contest as an independent candidate, defying the SLPP\u2019s decision to field its own candidate.",
    "When asked about the MPs who extended their support to Wickremesinghe, Kariyawasam said the party expects all members who love the country to support their decision and return to their fold. \u201cThose who do not love the country can choose a camp they wish,\u201d he said.",
    "He added that in making this decision, the party has chosen to place their trust in the citizens rather than their representatives to ensure the victory of their candidate. Similar sentiments were expressed by SLPP National Organiser Namal Rajapaksa yesterday. \u201cThe grassroots levels are always with Mahinda Rajapaksa,\u201d he said."
