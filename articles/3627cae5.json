    "Sri Lanka is at a pivotal point, experiencing a demographic transition that presents unique opportunities for economic and social growth. With a large portion of the population in the 15-29 age group, there is an urgent need to provide sustainable employment solutions for the country\u2019s youth, particularly those in rural areas. Amidst challenges like unemployment, poverty, and limited access to skills development, the healthcare sector emerges as a promising avenue for empowering the youth. Nursing, in particular, offers a significant solution to the youth unemployment crisis. The global demand for nursing professionals is growing rapidly, driven by an aging population and the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries are facing shortages in healthcare professionals, making nursing one of the most secure and sought-after professions worldwide. Sri Lanka, with its high literacy rate and skilled youth population, is well-positioned to meet this global demand.",
