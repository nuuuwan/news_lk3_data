Geetanath Kasilingam, Chief Organizer of the Jaffna District of Sri Lanka PA, said that the concession on the concession of the newly elected National People's Power from the Jaffna District Ilangumaran is commanding.

He made the allegation in a press release issued on Monday (18) on the comments of MP Ilangumaran that he would not get any concessions for MPs.

Geetanath said that this claim is one of the clowns. The government's offer and allowances are aimed at serving the people.

Avoiding these privileges in any way, the country's economy or income is not going to be raised.

So use these offers and allowances to serve people. Although it is your choice to get and avoid these concessions, the people of Jaffna Kilinochchi Election District have elected you as a Member of Parliament by your confidence in your confidence.. People expect the problems and needs of the people to recognize that responsibility and provide them with a solution.

Biden’s move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States’ vital military support for Ukraine.

The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions

Post watershed election that has the potential to transform Sri Lanka socio-economically, MTI Consulting has recommended a radically different approach to restructuring the Cabinet of Ministers.

How nations, both developed and developing, structure their cabinets is often based on legacy practices with incremental, ad-hoc changes. There is very little ground thinking, first principles, and future-proofing (which are considered effective in organisational structuring) that goes into such a process.

In this backdrop, Sri Lanka now has an opportunity to think afresh and develop a Cabinet structure that can then permeate to the structuring of all Government institutions, even considering rationalisation and consolidation where needed.

Following their stunning victory in last week’s parliamentary election, the JVP/NPP leaders must still be pinching themselves to make sure that they are not dreaming. Their mammoth majority is sure to go down in Sri Lanka’s history. However, the bigger the majority, the greater a government’s responsibility and the higher the possibility of the public expecting miracles and becoming frustrated. Above all, the Actonian truism that absolute power corrupts absolutely has stood the test of time. Giving politicians, especially untested ones, steamroller majorities could be just as much a recipe for disaster as keeping teenagers, alcohol and car keys together.

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



P. Sathalingam accepts National List seat, vows dedicated service to people. Cites past failures due to opposition campaigns. Aims to address Wanni region's needs. Will continue as party General Secretary. Promises impactful work over next five years.

🟩

"I will accept the confidence of the party and dedicate the service to the people of this area," Parliamentarian P. Sathalingam said.

He said this while commenting to the media after the National List seat of the TNA.

A massive responsibility has been imposed on me. When I was a member of the Provincial Council I had made many development plans. But people rejected me for something. There is many reasons for that.

Opposition parties and rivals presented fake campaigns against me. It was a cause of failure. My career is not politics. I am a doctor. If the party did not give this post, I was in the intention of acting as a state official again.

Wanni Having is a territory where the systematic genocide is taking place. So the party has provided this seat to know the need for a Member of Parliament who can perform it.

I will accept the confidence in me and dedicate my service to the people of this area. Thanks to the people who did not vote in that way. Thanks to the party.

### Sajith's weakness is the cause of the fall of the United People's Power - Sarath Fonseka

*2024-11-18 02:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199026) · `ta`

Sajith Premadasa's weak leadership caused United People's Power's downfall, says Sarath Fonseka. Party members left due to informal management. Without a strong leader, people chose National People's Power instead.

🟩

The situation is due to the failure of Sajith Brahmedasa formally managing the leadership of the United People's Power.. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Sajith Premadasa did not act properly as the leader of the United People's Power but also the leader of the opposition.

I quit because of the weakness found in the leadership of Sajith Premadasa. As well as many senior members left the party. The two positions he held did not engage in formal administration.

So if the other members of the party want to choose Harsha de Silva as the leader. They cannot act as a strong opposition party led by Sajith Premadasa.

Due to the lack of an alternative, the people have chosen national power. Even those who voted for the cylinder in the last presidential election have chosen national people's power this time. He said the United People's Power should now fulfill its responsibility.

### Economic Challenges Of New Government: Road Ahead Not Smooth, But Treacherous

*2024-11-18 01:52:05* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/economic-challenges-of-new-government-road-ahead-not-smooth-but-treacherous/) · `en`

At the General elections held last week, voters from all over the country have overwhelmingly selected the candidates fielded by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake or AKD as legislators to frame laws for a five-year term. In his journey to presidency, AKD’s supporters sang the theme song of which an appropriate rendering in English will be, ‘Today the whole nation in a single file will hand the country over to Anura to usher prosperity to people’. But the election results showed that it was not in a single file but without the support of the marginalised citizenry from the upcountry, and the north and the east. Like a true statesman, delivering his victory speech at the Elections Secretariat, AKD admitted that he had been endorsed by some sections in society but there are those who had not voted for him. He said that he will serve all the people without any division or discrimination as their President[1].

The paddy and rice prices seem to be a political game but can be sorted out to a greater extent based on more coherent policies, planning and implementation mechanisms. Paddy and rice prices are socially sensitive issues that cause headaches for any government at different periods of the year. It is a pride of Sri Lankans to consume the rice produced locally. However, when the need arises, we will not hesitate to import rice to bridge the gap based on the requirement

### What has democracy got to do with unproductive coconut land?

It is unlikely that democracy will yield greater returns solely because of the moral fortitude of the agents entrusted with governing on our behalf

It is broadly accepted that the Sri Lankan coconut industry, especially the smallholder segment, is highly unproductive. It has been reported that the average yield per hectare in Sri Lanka is less than half the yield in Andhra Pradesh where the climatic conditions are not dissimilar. This problem is not new.

Thirty years ago, I was asked to evaluate several information projects including the coconut information system managed by the Coconut Research Institute. The information system was exemplary, but I concluded that it all seemed pointless because the end objectives of producing more coconuts and improving the livelihoods of the growers were not being achieved. During the entire period of study, yields were declining. I was not asked to conduct evaluations after that.

### IMF must respect voice of Sri Lankan voters

The importance of achieving debt sustainability without compromising the welfare and long-term interests of Sri Lanka’s populace is clear

Lender awareness that Sri Lanka’s debt exceeded Government revenue by a factor of 10 underscores a stark instance of predatory lending practices. This highlights a profound failure to adhere to established norms of responsible lending, which require creditors to assess a borrower’s capacity to repay before extending further credit. By continuing to extend loans under such unsustainable conditions, creditors blatantly disregarded these principles, exacerbating Sri Lanka’s financial vulnerability and contributing to its current debt crisis. This pattern of lending not only violated ethical standards but also undermined the spirit of shared accountability between lenders and sovereign borrowers

AKD’s biggest woe will be to comply with the quantitative targets set for him by the previous Parliament

This is a historic occasion in Sri Lanka because in the past no Sri Lankan leader has been able to unite the country through the power of the ballot in this manner. Their attempt at doing so by the power of the bullet has miserably failed. But along with this electoral record which has elevated AKD and his supporters to the highest pedestal of the reign of power, there is an unshirkable responsibility cast on him as well

### 2024-11-17 (Sunday)

### Mandate of heaven on Poya Day

*2024-11-17 23:57:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Mandate-of-heaven-on-Poya-Day/4-769337) · `en`

Unlike in the past, voters cannot afford to remain aloof as mere onlookers and critics of what the Government does – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

When the date for election was announced there were murmurs among a group of Buddhist monks that the date would fall on a Poya Day, that it would be a day for people to attend to their religious rituals and meditation and that therefore the polling date be postponed. But the Election Commissioner stuck to his guns and as proved by the results voters thronged in hundreds of thousands not to the temples but to the polling booths and delivered an unassailable mandate to their favourite party of choice, National People’s Power (NPP) under the leadership of their favourite son, Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD).

It was indeed as the Chinese would say a mandate of heaven delivered on a Poya Day through the voting citizenry. To the Buddhists at least, NPP’s historic victory and the enormity of its size would appear a divinely blessed outcome.

### Ballot unites Sri Lanka in 2024

This Government and this President have the best opportunity in decades to truly unify the country like none other – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

How with the overwhelming mandate from the people of the north and the east, the NPP has a unique opportunity to unite the country

The Rajapaksa family was duly credited with uniting the country after winning a relentless war with the LTTE. In May 2009 the war was won and the country was declared united as one.

But for years afterwards, racism continued to feature in political campaigns and while the peace was won, question marks persisted regarding the hearts and minds of the northerner. And doubts remained regarding their actual integration with their southern brethren.

2024 may be seen as a watershed moment in Sri Lankan history as a Presidential election was fought where racism was not an issue. Language and religion did not play a role and none of the candidates had a divisive agenda.
