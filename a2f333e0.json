    "Addressing a ceremony held at the Ministry\u2019s premises, Nanayakkara further alleged that several state officials did not support the decisions made in this regard, and instead served as \u2018obstacles\u2019 against their implementation.",
    "\u201cWhen we began implementing various proposals on behalf of migrant workers, we did not find any support, instead, we were faced with obstacles. We had to fight with certain officials in order to give some sort of relief to our migrant workers\u201d, the Minister said.",
    "Speaking on the recent duty-free housing loan approved to be given to migrant workers, Minister Nanayakkara revealed that although the Cabinet has approved the relevant move, and all necessary discussions have been held with the respective authorities at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and other banks, the officials of the Treasury and CBSL have not yet taken necessary measures for it.",
    "Meanwhile, the Minister further revealed that Cabinet approval was received 14 months ago to increase the duty relief given for migrant workers to purchase confectionaries at the airport, proportionate to the foreign exchange they\u2019ve generated.",
    "Despite the President having issued a gazette in this regard, Nanayakkara stated that officials of Sri Lanka Customs are yet to implement the proposal."
