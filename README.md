It is now 15 years since the end of a brutal 30-year conflict. Yet, we remain trapped in a cycle of grief, division, and mistrust. This cannot continue. If we do, we will head down a path to ruin.

A rare and golden opportunity stands before us now. The recently concluded general elections have sent a powerful message: our communities are ready to rise above the shackles of communal politics and chart a new course toward unity and hope.

Addressing the matter now has profound significance in view of the тАШMaaveerar NaalтАЩ (Great Heroes Day) that fell on 27 November, and comments made by a newly appointed independent MP representing the Jaffna District. Both are related.

### FranceтАЩs Macron seeks new prime minister as Barnier resigns

*2024-12-05 21:19:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104029/frances-macron-seeks-new-prime-minister-as-barnier-resigns) ┬╖ `en`

(Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron met allies and parliament leaders on Thursday as he sought to swiftly appoint a new prime minister to replace Michel Barnier, who officially resigned a day after opposition lawmakers voted to topple his government.

Barnier, a veteran conservative whom Macron appointed prime minister barely three months ago, became the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history after he failed to find enough support for a budget aimed at taming a wide deficit.

The Elysee Palace said Macron had asked Barnier and his government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.

Three sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Macron aimed to appoint a replacement swiftly, with one saying he wanted to do so before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral - renovated after a devastating fire. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among world leaders expected to attend.

Additional Customs Director Sivali Arukoda said that the Bribery Commission is conducting an inquiry into the 200 vehicles imported to Sri Lanka without notifying the Customs Department.

He said that 100 percent of the containers imported to Sri Lanka were not tested by the Customs Unit, and that the dangerous containers were tested here and could be brought into the country through an unbeaten container.

He said that the vehicles may sometimes be brought into the country due to the inadequacy of the containers, and that the imported containers do not inspect the imported containers so that the vehicles can be brought into the country.

Customs have the ability to earn 350 to 400 billion rupees per year by granting permission to import vehicles.. Remble

He was responding to a question posed by Dayasiri Jayasekara on Thursday (05) regarding the government's submission of accounting.

The account is one of the law we have already passed in relation to voting money. We are the first hand on that bill. Is by the law we passed on August 8th. My question is whether this account can be submitted in contrast to the legal source, though there is an urgent need.

It is necessary to advance public service for the first four months of next year, pay salaries to public servants and submit an account of the current projects that are currently being implemented.

We suspended the Standing Ordinance in accordance with the compliance with the party leaders at the meeting and submitted it to the House.
