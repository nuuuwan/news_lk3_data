### Kilinochchi journalist attack suspected retaliation for drug-trade exposé

Kilinochchi-based journalist Murukaiah Thamilchelvan, who narrowly escaped an attempted abduction by a group on Thursday, said that he believes the incident, along with the assault on him, was linked to his ongoing coverage of illicit drug-related issues in the area.

The incident reportedly took place along the A9 road near the Sri Lanka Telecom building in Kilinochchi.

Speaking to the Daily FT, Thamilchelvan said that he could identify one of the attackers, who is believed to have ties to the illicit drug trade in the area.

Closing plenary of COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan – Pic credit: UNFCCC Secretariat

The year 2025 lies ahead, and addressing climate change is high on the list of priorities for countries across the world as well as the global community at large. The 29th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended in the early morning hours of 24 November 2024; the 30th session (COP30) will convene on 10 November 2025. In between these sessions, much work remains to be done to advance climate action at the national and international level, including on a range of topics that include climate finance, the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), a new round of national commitments, and many more.

For many participants and observers, COP29 fell short of expectations. However, the conference still produced several decisions that lay out a roadmap for 2025 and beyond, while other agenda items were postponed until June or November 2025.

### Sri Lanka’s ill-fated LRT – following a train of thought  from policy derailment to being back on the right track (Part II of II)

*2024-12-27 23:52:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-ill-fated-LRT-following-a-train-of-thought-from-policy-derailment-to-being-back-on-the-right-track-Part-II-of-II/4-771083) · `en`

A vision to develop Sri Lanka’s railway infrastructure is the need of the hour even now, over four years after the island nation arbitrarily terminated a project that would meet its creaking infrastructural needs at concessionary terms from a friendly nation’s government

The project that was due to commence with land acquisition in 2020 and be concluded in 2024 with an LRT that would have trains running along an elevated track at four-minute intervals during rush hour and 10-minute intervals at off-peak times ended in ignominy for the Sri Lankan Government when the project was arbitrarily terminated by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration citing the ongoing economic crisis at the time

The railway community in Sri Lanka and all national-minded islanders commemorate 27 December as the day on which the inaugural Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) train ran between Colombo Fort and Ambepussa (34 miles on the main line) in 1864.

### Cost of living pandemic and food security

Although the current cost of living pandemic is the product of viruses originated from outside Sri Lanka, no preventive measures were taken by previous Governments to minimise the infection

There are a few academics and economists who seem to believe that Sri Lanka’s economic revival and future growth should follow the developed world’s techno-industrial trajectory. The former President Ranil Wickremesinghe turned out to be a disciple of this philosophy. Don’t they realise that it is that trajectory which has led humanity to the brink of self-destruction? Let us reject the one size fit all model and cut the cloth to suit our size. This is not a backward-looking strategy but one sustainable in the face of unpredictable and disastrous swings in mega economies

[This article is based on a talk given to the members of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service Association on the 10th of December, 2024]

I was invited to address you today on the topic of what the second coming of Donald Trump as President of the United States holds for the United States and the wider world outside of its shores. I was also requested to explain to you the Electoral College process by which a president is elected in the United States. This is a process that baffles even those familiar with the United States and the way its institutions function, as it is markedly different from the way in which other democracies elect their presidents and prime ministers.

I shall try my very best to not confuse you in my attempt to explain the manner in which the POTUS, to use the abbreviation for the President of the United States first used by telegraphic code operators in the 1890s, is elected.

After the elections, problem-solving must become the core business of politics again, added Steinmeier in a speech.

The president, whose post has been largely ceremonial in the post-war era, also called for the election campaign to be conducted fairly and transparently.

“External influence is a danger to democracy, whether it is covert, as was evidently the case recently in the Romanian elections, or open and blatant, as is currently being practiced particularly intensively on (social media) platform X,” he said.

The influence of Manmohan Singh, the leader of the visionary vision, crossed the national borders. When he was prime minister from 2004 to 2014, his transformation policies, such as the Right to Education Act and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Program, reflected his firm determination in equity and content.

He contributed to alliances like BRICS, and revealed significant diplomacy with achievements such as the Indo-American Nuclear Power Agreement. His humility, intelligence and commitment in public service will encourage future generations forever. Let his soul calm down and join the divine. ”. Remble

He made this statement during a press conference held in Panadura, expressing his disappointment with the current state of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).

Former MP Ellawala said, “What we expected is not within the SJB. Even though it is called the ‘Samagi Jana Balawegaya’, there is no unity within it. It is a great dictatorial rule. Anyone who wants to work is not allowed to do so there.”

He also pointed out that, in the near future, the SJB would find itself in a chaotic and deteriorating state.

“Because of these reasons, I am resigning from all positions in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, effective from today. I have decided to put an end to my political career from here on,” Ellawala said.
