  "original_body_lines": [
    "The tusker 'Muthu Raja' gifted by Thailand to Sri Lanka has been flown back for medical treatment early this morning from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Katunayake.",
    "The tusker was a gift from the Thai royal family to former President Chandrika Kumaranatunga in 2001 and she later handed over the elephant to the Aluthgama Kande Viharaya. It was one of two tuskers gifted by the Thai government.",
    "The tusker Muthu Raja was sent back to Thailand in a Russian Ilyushin-type cargo plane which arrived at the BIA.",
    "It was later revealed that the elephant faced severe abuse due to the inconsiderate behaviour of the mahout who was in charge of the elephant.",
    "Therefore, the Thai ambassador to Sri Lanka had Muthu Raja taken from the Kande Viharaya and entrusted it to the Dehiwala Zoo for medical care. However, the zoo had not been able to provide the necessary treatment due to lack of facilities, and the Thai authorities decided to take the elephant back to Thailand for expert medical care.
