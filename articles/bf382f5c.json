    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has received 2,234 tourists from Israel in the 52 days from November 1, official government data showed, despite threats over possible attack on a Eastern coastal tourism hotspot where more Israeli tourists gather.",
    "The number of tourists from Israel has increased to 24,147 as of December 22, compared to 21,913 at the end of October 31, the latest weekly tourism data showed. The island nation saw 19,517 Israeli tourists last year.",
    "Israel on October 23 asked its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Sri Lanka, leave coastal tourist areas including Arugam Bay and stop overt displays of Hebrew language in clothes or other signs that could lead to identification, following the US embassy in Colombo warned citizens not to travel to Arugam Bay in the island\u2019s Eastern Coast as there was credible information of an attack.",
    "Seven countries \u2013 the US, Israel, Russia, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia \u2013 issued travel advisories after at least three foreign intelligence agencies alerted of a possible attack in Arugam Bay.",
    "The travel advisories, however, were later removed amid government\u2019s actions to tight security in the concerned areas.",
    "Cabinet spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa on Tuesday (24) said the safety and security for all tourists have been ensured after the attack rumour. The police is still investigating into the possible terror plot with six including a Maldivian are under arrest.",
    "These seven countries have accounted for 29 percent of the 1.48 million tourist arrivals in the first nine months of this year.",
    "Soon after the travel advisories were issued, tourism operators raised concerns over possible cancellation of bookings due to the travel advisories.",
    "Any adverse impacts on the tourism industry could derail Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery from an unprecedented economic crisis after declaring sovereign debt default in 2022. Tourism has been one of the key components in the island nation\u2019s economic recovery.",
    "The island nation, however, is likely to miss its 2.3 million tourist target and end up around 2 million, industry analysts have said.",
    "Sri Lanka has received 1.97 million tourists in 2024 through December 22, which is much higher than last-year\u2019s total arrivals of 1,487,303, the data showed.",
    "Tourists from India have accounted for 20 percent of the arrivals up to December 22 this year, followed by Russia accounting for 9.6 percent. \u00a0(Colombo/December 25/2024)"
