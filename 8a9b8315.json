    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s job is to turn the economy around, an objective the government is now \u201cvery close\u201d to meeting, and his party wishes to contest and \u201chopes to win\u201d, Wickremesinghe said responding to a question on his re-election.",
    "Speaking to journalists at a meeting with media representatives at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on Tuesday November 14, President Wickremesinghe said he has introduced a \u201cnew economy\u201d sans politics.",
    "\u201cI have also introduced \u2013 which I want to do without politics \u2013 a new economy for Sri Lanka. Let\u2019s debate on it [and on] where we\u2019re going. Thereafter, let\u2019s see what we are doing,\u201d he added.",
    "Wickremesinghe was responding to a question by a journalist on whether he and his United National Party (UNP) intend to contest the presidential election due to be held by October 2024.",
    "The UNP was reduced to a single national list seat at the 2020 parliamentary election after a landslide victory by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) presidential candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019 triggered a mass exodus of UNP members to the newly formed Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). The SJB contested the 2020 parliamentary polls leading its own alliance and went onto become the incumbent main opposition party.",
    "Wickremesinghe said the UNP \u201cwants to contest next time and they hope to win because they\u2019re the only ones who spoke the truth and they had to go out of politics\u201d.",
    "\u201cI think that\u2019s going to be their strongest point,\u201d he said, adding that the party will have a \u201clot of new faces\u201d.",
    "\u201cWell, there are other parties also, in government and in the opposition who will contest. My first job is to ensure that we have terminated the bankruptcy. So once we have terminated the bankruptcy we\u2019re introducing new plans. At that stage we have to decide what is going to happen,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI come here to get all your support to terminate the bankruptcy,\u201d he added.",
    "Asked if would contest for the presidency himself if he was successful in turning the economy around, Wickremesinghe said: \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d",
    "The journalist responded that there might be a public backlash against her if she were to respond in the affirmative.",
    "\u201cWhy should there be a public backlash? I think I\u2019ll wait till it\u2019s over,\u201d replied Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cMy job is to turn the economy around. We\u2019ve come very close to it. And I have also introduced \u2013 which I want to do without politics \u2013 a new economy. Let\u2019s debate on it. Where we\u2019re going. Thereafter let\u2019s see what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Nov15/2023)"
