  "original_title": "Sinhala Cinema\u2019s Superstar Gamini Fonseka was an Artistically Acclaimed and Commercially Valued Actor.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Gamini Fonseka has been   my favourite  Sinhala film actor . since childhood. Gamini entered my life when I was about eight years old. The place he did so was a movie theatre in Maradana bearing his own name Gamini. \u2018Ran Muthu Duwa\u2019 was my first Sinhala movie.",
    "The family went to see it for two reasons. One reason, because it was the first Sinhala technicolour film and the other, to see the famed underwater scenes made possible by Mike Wilson. Gamini along with Jeevarani, Shane Gooneratne and Joe Abeywickrema starred in it. Gamini\u2019s acting, dancing and fighting captivated me. The song sequence \u2018Pipee Pipee Renu Natana\u2019 remains fresh in memory even now.",
    "I was well and truly hooked after seeing Gamini for the first time on screen. I never ever recovered. There was hardly a Gamini Fonseka film that I missed in my younger days. Gamini Fonseka became a permanent part of my childhood movie memories. He remains there forever.The movie-monarch\u2019s 89 th birth anniversary will be celebrated  on March 21.",
    "Gamini Fonseka was a man whom I loved as an actor, appreciated as a director, admired as a politician and above all respected as a decent human being. Writing about Gamini Fonseka is always a pleasant and delightful exercise for me. I have often done so before and will be revisiting some of my earlier writings to enhance this article.",
    "My formative years as a Sinhala film fan were heavily influenced and shaped by Gamini Fonseka. To me and millions of other likeminded people, Sinhala cinema was personified by Gamini Fonseka for a long, long time. Notwithstanding the brilliant creators of our times who have elevated the standards of Sinhala films, one is unable to imagine or visualise Sinhala cinema without thinking of Gamini Fonseka. Sinhala cinema was certainly not Gamini Fonseka but without Gamini Fonseka there was no Sinhala cinema either. He was the first and arguably the sole super star of Sinhala cinema.",
    "Gamini Fonseka was my hero during childhood mainly because he was an action hero on screen. Initially the attraction of was mainly the fight scenes. Gamini brought a refreshing naturalness to those scenes as opposed to the artificiality in South Indian ones. It was later that one learned to appreciate the finer points of his acting. A major reason for the naturalism in Gamini\u2019s fighting scenes was due to the nature of the man himself. He was a fighter both orthodox and unorthodox. He often got into brawls but always for a good cause.",
    "Among the many movies of Gamini was Titus Totawatte\u2019s \u2018Chandiya\u2019 in 1965.It was a milestone in Sinhala moviedom and Gamini\u2019s career. This was perhaps the first anti-hero role of Sinhala cinema. Gamini breathed and lived the part of a tough guy. Titus had a sequel \u2018Chutte\u2019.",
    "Gamini acting as \u2018Chandiya\u2019 \u2013 meaning tough guy \u2013 was in a way an instance of art imitating life because Gamini was in every way a \u2018Chandiya\u2019 in real life. Old  Thomians of yesteryear speak volumes about his martial prowess during school days. The benchmark of his fighting prowess however was the \u2018historic\u2019 encounter with Dehiwala\u2019s \u2018strongman\u2019 of yore \u2013 Karthelis.",
    "I had heard many versions of the Karthelis fight in Dehiwela but the most authentic and accurate account  was  told to me by my  old schoolmate and  former journalistic colleague Prasad Gunewardene.Prasad\u2019s paternal grandmother was Gamini\u2019s father Willie Fonseka\u2019s eldest sister. Prasad has regaled me over the years with several anecdotes and tit-bits about his  Gamini Mama.. Prasad Gunewardene who is no more gave me a detailed description of what had exactly happened then.",
    "The clash with Karthelis had originated with Gamini\u2019s father William Fonseka known as Willie. A friend of Gamini Fonseka was knocked down while crossing the road by Karthelis who used to drive a taxi in those days. Fortunately he sustained no injuries. Karthelis who was notorious for his rash driving had verbally abused the victim in raw filth. The man complained about this incident to Gamini\u2019s father Willie Fonseka, who was highly respected in the area. Willie Fonseka had accosted Karthelis and chided the Dehiwala strong man in public over his deplorable conduct.",
    "Later in the day Karthelis with a gang of 10 thugs arrived in two taxis at Willie Fonseka\u2019s house. Willie Fonseka opened the gate and faced the gang alone. Two of the men had swords. Willie\u2019s brothers Nelson and Garmoyle and cousin Fred (Prasad\u2019s father) who were in the house at that time also joined in the fight.",
    "Gamini was then eating in the kitchen. Hearing the commotion he came running. Clad in sarong and clogs, Gamini slipped and fell in his haste. Five of the thugs held him down and tried to hack Gamini with the swords. Fortunately Willie and the others came to Gamini\u2019s rescue and seized the swords. Karthelis and his goons fled, leaving the swords behind. They were displayed as trophies in the Fonseka household for years.",
    "Gamini himself was taken to Durdans Hospital and treated for his injuries. No complaints were made to the Police. Gamini vowed that he would teach Karthelis a lesson and challenged him to a \u201cman to man\u201d fight. Karthelis never accepted the challenge.",
    "Years later Gamini was driving his car on the Galle Road when he saw Karthelis standing near the Wellawatte-Dehiwala bridge. Gamini got down from his vehicle and went up to Karthelis. Then began the historic fight reminiscent of ASP Randeniya vs Goring Mudalali in \u2018Weli Kathara\u2019.",
    "Gamini thrashed Karthelis mercilessly in the one-on-one fight duel. The Dehiwala strongman was chased across the Galle Road one side to another and back by Gamini who pummelled Karthelis blue, black and blue. Gamini then went away telling Karthelis that he was ready for a return fight \u201cany day, anywhere, anytime\u201d.",
    "Karthelis was hospitalised after the fight. He never took up Gamini Fonseka\u2019s challenge. This was the beginning of the end for the Dehiwala strongman who simply faded away after the incident.",
    "Sembuge Gamini Shelton Fonseka was born in Dehiwela on March 21, 1936 as the third child of William and Daisy Fonseka. After initial schooling at a Presbyterian institution he went to S. Thomas\u2019 College, Mt. Lavinia.",
    "After finishing secondary school, the \u201ctough\u201d Gamini had first wanted to be a Policeman. He had applied for a sub-inspector post and was called up for an interview. His mother Daisy pleaded with him not to join the Police. Gamini then turned to what was his second love then \u2013 cinema.",
    "It was Lester James Peries who gave Gamini his first break in movies as an actor through \u2018Rekava\u2019. Gamini showed his face for the first time on screen in a scene in the film. He was working as a camera cum production assistant for Lester. It was Lester who made Gamini an assistant director for his second film \u2018Sandesaya,\u2019 in which he also played the second lead to Ananda Jayaratne.",
    "Three of Gamini Fonseka\u2019s memorable character portrayals on screen were as Jinadasa, Willie Abeynayake and Saviman Kabalana in the films \u2018Gamperaliya,\u2019 \u2018Nidhanaya\u2019 and \u2018Yuganthaya\u2019 respectively. All three were directed by Lester. Gamini\u2019s first attempt at directing was \u2018Parasathumal\u2019 in which Lester played a behind the scenes role as an adviser and guide.",
    "Gamini\u2019s first big break in acting came with \u2018Daiwa Yogaya\u2019 in 1959 where he played a secondary role. Senadheera Kuruppu and Rukmani Devi were in the lead roles. Then came Lester\u2019s \u2018Sandesaya\u2019 where nominally Gamini played second fiddle to Ananda Jayaratna but stole the show from him with a stellar performance.",
    "It was around this time that films like \u2018Adata Wediya Heta Hondai,\u2019 \u2018Ranmuthuduwa,\u2019 \u2018Getawarayo\u2019 and \u2018Dheevarayo\u2019 exploded on the screen and established Gamini as a box office draw. However Gamini  proved that he was not a melodramatic actor-singing, dancing and fighting-alone by making his mark as a character actor in Lester\u2019s \u2018Gamperaliya\u2019 that won the Golden Peacock in New Delhi. Once again Gamini was the \u2018third\u2019 to Henry Jayasena and Punya Heendeniya but gave a performance par excellence as Jinadasa.",
    "Gamini reached the peak of his popularity in the late sixties and early seventies as romantic action hero. When Sean Connery won over the western world as Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond in \u2018Dr. No\u2019 and \u2018From Russia With Love,\u2019 Mike Wilson cashed in on the \u2018007\u2019 craze with a Sri Lankan version. Enter our own man with a license to kill \u2013 Jamis Banda. Who else other than Gamini could do justice to the role in \u2018Sorungeth Soru\u2019?",
    "There were other popular roles too with Sri Lankan versions of the famous Tamil \u2018Vallava\u2019 film series starring Jaishankar and Manohar produced in Tamil Nadu by Ramasundaram of Modern Studios. Gamini was the mainstay of the \u2018Sooraya\u2019 film series in Sinhala. \u2018Soorayangath Sooraya,\u2019 \u2018Edath Sooraya Adath Sooraya,\u2019 \u2018Sooraya Soorayamai,\u2019 \u2018Hatharadenaama Sooraya,\u2019 etc.",
    "The action films of old had a simple underlying thread that good triumphs over evil. So Gamini like MGR gave us a happy feeling and inspired all to greater heights. This success in action movies did not mean that Gamini was playing stereotyped roles alone. Far from it! He played a variety of roles and proved his thespian skills in many.",
    "Other noteworthy films where his histrionic skills were strikingly displayed were \u2018Getawarayo,\u2019 \u2018Hulawali,\u2019 \u2018Oba Dutu Daa,\u2019 \u2018Sanasuma Kothanada,\u2019 \u2018Weli Kathara,\u2019 \u2018Sana Keliya,\u2019 \u2018Deviyane Oba Kohedha?\u2019 and \u2018Sarungale\u2019. His performances in films directed by him were all fabulous.",
    "Gamini combined shades of Marlon Brando, Yul Brynner and Paul Newman in his acting. His primary inspiration however was Brando. Though affected by Brando it must be said to Gamini\u2019s credit that he evolved his own \u2018fusion\u2019 style and distinctive method.",
    "Gamini gave an astounding performance acting as a Tamil in Sunil Ariyaratne\u2019s \u2018Sarungale\u2019. He played Nadarajah, the Jaffna Tamil clerk in a story that highlighted both the anti-Tamil communal violence as well as the caste contradictions among Tamils.Gamini himself was very proud of his role in that movie.",
    "Once in a conversation before the film\u2019s release he told me personally \u201cany Sinhala man who sees this film will never lay hands on a Tamil again\u201d. Alas! That was not to be and not many years later came Black July 1983.",
    "One thing that must be emphasised in the case of Gamini Fonseka is that he was a man with absolutely no trace of communalism in him. I have had only about four or five conversations with him including an interview for the \u2018Virakesari\u2019 in 1978.Those conversations and testimonies of persons who knew him well including Prasad convinced me of his bona fides in this respect.",
    "A notable feature of Sri Lankan film heritage \u2013 both Sinhala and Tamil \u2013 is the multi-ethnic diversity of the industry. Sinhalese, Tamils Sri Lankan and Indian, Muslims, Malays and Burghers have all contributed to this. The contribution of Tamils to the Sinhala film industry is massive. Gamini acknowledged and appreciated this immense contribution by the minority communities to Sinhala cinema. He was not afraid to state this publicly whenever the occasion arose.",
    "In an illustrious career spanning almost five decades Gamini Fonseka acted in 108 films and one teledrama. He played the lead role in 89 films and a supportive actor role in 19 movies. Gamini directed 10 and produced two films. He has also written lyrics and stories for a few films. The only teledrama Gamini acted in was \u2018Sudu Saha Kalu\u2019 directed by D.B. Nihalsinghe. Gamini acted as \u2018Kalu Mahathaya\u2019 in the teledrama.",
    "He has acted opposite many actresses but the one with whose chemistry Gamini hit it off best was Malani Fonseka. Two others who paired well with Gamini were Jeevaranee Kurukulasooriya and Veena Jayakody.",
    "According to Gamini, Sandhya Kumari was the most beautiful actress he interacted with while Malani was the best. The best actor according to Gamini was Joe Abeywickrema \u2013 not himself. Gamini also had immense respect for Tony Ranasinghe as the finest character actor. The best director who brought out the best in Gamini as director was Lester and Gamini himself.",
    "There have been several actor-directors who failed when directing themselves. It was a case of either underplaying or overacting. One man who performed this dual role creditably was Hindi cinema\u2019s Raj Kapoor (Awaraa, Barsat, Shri 420, etc.). In Sinhala cinema Gamini was one man whose acting did not falter when directing. Starting from \u2018Parasathumal\u2019 to others like \u2018Uthumaneni,\u2019 \u2018Sagarayak Medha,\u2019 \u2018Koti Waligaya,\u2019 \u2018Nomiyena Minissu,\u2019 etc., Gamini played his roles remarkably in those films. At the same time he stamped his auterial mark as director. One cannot place him in the class of an A plus director in Sinhala cinema. But an A minus director he certainly was.",
    "I remain to this day a firm Sinhala film aficionado not only of artistic  quality films but also of those  melodramatic \u201cmasala\u201d entertainment movies. Gamini straddled both these worlds with ease. He was both an \u201carty\u201d actor of powerful serious movies as well as a \u201cmelodramatic\u201d star of popular cinema too. He was artistically appreciated and commercially valued.",
    "For many decades Gamini Fonseka was the uncrowned monarch of Sinhala cinema. He made his mark as both actor and director. In the process he helped liberate Sinhala cinema from Indian influence and gave it fresh perspective and dynamic direction. Superstar Gamini Fonseka is inextricably intertwined with the evolution and growth of Sinhala cinema. He passed away at the age of 68 on 30 September 2004.",
