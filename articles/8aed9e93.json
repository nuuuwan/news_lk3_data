    "Speaking at the Cabinet press briefing, the deputy minister outlined that vehicle imports will be allowed under several specific categories, particularly for commercial vehicles. These imports will be regulated within the framework of foreign exchange restrictions, with due consideration of the country\u2019s reserve levels.",

Vehicle importation will proceed in phases, prioritizing essential categories and adhering to these limitations.\u201d",
