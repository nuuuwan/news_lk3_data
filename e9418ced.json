  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) announced that the Gazette imposing a maximum retail price (MRP) for sugar was revoked with immediate effect.",
    "The move comes following a sudden shortage created in the market after the Government increased the Special Commodity Levy imposed on imported sugar from 25 cents to Rs. 50 per kilo and subsequently imposing an MRP.",
    "On 3 November, CAA issued a Gazette under the powers vested in Section 20(5) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No. 09 of 2003 imposing MRP for sugar.",
    "The CAA had set the MRP for unpacketed white sugar at Rs. 275 per kilo and for packeted white sugar at Rs. 295.00 per kilo. Unpackaged brown sugar had an MRP of Rs. 330 per kilo and packeted brown sugar had an MRP of Rs. 350 per kg.",
    "As per the Gazette, no importer, manufacturer, distributor, supplier or trader can sell, supply, expose or offer for sale, display for sale, or supply for sale white and brown sugar above the MRP."
