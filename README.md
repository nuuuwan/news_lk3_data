The humanitarian crisis is in danger of intensifying the killing of humanitarian workers in Gaza, following the suspension of their humanitarian tasks.

Following the killing of seven humanitarian employees in the attack on World Central Kitchen's vehicle, many organizations involved in Gaza have suspended their work in view of the safety of their employees.

The Anara, a charity, has said that this is never a matter of fact, and we have come to the conclusion that there is no safeguard for humanitarian assistance as many humanitarian employees and their families have been killed.

We understand the worst effects of humanitarian aid suspension, but the risk of increasing during humanitarian aid distribution has created a position to suspend our tasks until our employees think they can work again.

Last month, the UN said that hunger and poverty could be developed at any time in Gaza.

Oxfam said the number of hunger facing hunger in the Palestinian region has increased several times.
