    "On Saturday 30 March 2024 in a YouTube message, Sujeewa Bandara, former Secretary to the ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, claimed that the people who gathered at the Mirihana house of Gotabaya seeking to remove him from power as president were not Sinhalese but Muslims.",
    "This is absolute nonsense, calculated mischief and bankrupt politics. Video clips of the event show there were no Muslims there but all Sinhalese. Thus the statement, on the eve of presidential or general elections, seems to be aimed at rousing Sinhalese against Muslims \u2013 perhaps to come to power as they had done since the island\u2019s independence in 1948.",
    "Fortunately for Sri Lanka, Sinhalese have woken up and openly dismiss racist politics. All what they want is solution to their burning day-to-day economic problems caused by racist politics.",
    "A day after, on Sunday 31 March in another video clip, Patali Champika Ranawaka, known for his racist politics, predicted that before the forthcoming elections there may be a bout of communal violence.",
    "This paradise of an island, turned into a living hell by racist politics, corruption, looting and mismanagement, is passing through the worst ever manmade economic crisis causing untold misery to people in their day-to-day life. The need of the hour is to solve these problems.",
    "Do these short-sighted politicians understand that due to their racist politics Sri Lanka is today a vessel state of United States, India and China? Once a shining example in the entire third world for its dynamic role in many fields, is today US-European Israeli war mongers stooge obediently serving their evil agendas.",
    "This is the reason why the country failed to condemn the US-European Israel genocide of innocent Palestinians in Gaza. Shameful state of affairs is such even the mainstream media refused to cover the US-European Israeli genocide in Gaza.",
    "It is also time that clueless Muslims indifferent to their own fate wake up to emerging threats especially in view of the presence of US, Israel and India\u2019s Hindutva RSS fascists."
