    "Driven by the desire for peace and stability, the founding members of the UN aimed to promote diplomacy, human rights, and economic development.",
    "\u201c80 years have passed, and the smoke of war has long since dissipated. However, the world today remains deeply turbulent,\u201d Ambassador Zhenhong told while addressing the gathering in Colombo late on Wednesday.",

    "\u201cWe remember history not to perpetuate the chains of hatred, but to forever cut off the evil roots that once dragged humanity into the abyss, and to welcome the dawn of true light.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe lessons of history are still fresh. They warn us that militarism will not bring lasting peace. Whether in a cold war, a hot war, a tariff war, or a technology war, there will be no winners.\u201d",
    "\u201cHegemonism and the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak must not be allowed to return. Faced with new circumstances and challenges, the authority and core role of the United Nations can only be strengthened, not weakened.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe purposes and principles of the UN Charter have never become outdated. On the contrary, they have become even more important. At this moment, only a profound consciousness grounded in the lessons of history can anchor our course and prevent humanity from falling back into the cycle of darkness and wars.\u201d (Colombo/August 21/2025)"
