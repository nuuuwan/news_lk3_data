    "Two decades have elapsed since the assassination of Lakshman Kadirgamar, a statesman who adorned the firmament of Sri Lankan politics. His achievements, which were numerous, in various fields, have been well documented. As Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Minister, he navigated the country\u2019s external relations during turbulent times, and his invaluable service to the nation cost him his dear life; he fell victim to an LTTE sniper on 12 August 2005.",
    "Yesterday, we published a review of Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda\u2019s book, The Turning Point. The Navy\u2019s contribution to the country\u2019s war against the LTTE is well known, but not enough has been written about how the Navy, through years of meticulous planning, fighting and sacrifices, decimated the Sea Tigers. The same is true of a turning point Kadirgamar made in the Eelam War at a time when the myth of the LTTE\u2019s invincibility had taken root. He was out of power at the time. This comment is about that watershed moment.",
    "Much has been written about the UNP-led UNF\u2019s victory in the 2001 general election and the signing of a ceasefire agreement, followed by several rounds of \u2018peace talks\u2019 although it was obvious that nothing was further from LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran\u2019s mind than peace. For him a separate state was non-negotiable, and his intransigence knew no bounds. But there was no let-up in international pressure on Sri Lankan governments to pursue the Sisyphean task of negotiating peace with the LTTE, which used all ceasefires and \u2018peace processes\u2019 to further its military interests.",
    "Prabhakaran would have used the Norwegian-crafted peace process to achieve his goal in the early 2000s but for a naval intelligence report that revealed his plan to cripple the Trincomalee harbour and the Palaly airstrip with simultaneous artillery attacks, bringing the movement of ships and aircraft to and from the North to a complete halt; had his efforts reached fruition, he would have been able to massacre thousands of troops deployed in that part of the country or give them safe passage under international supervision while creating conditions for a direct UN involvement in the conflict and perhaps resorting to UDI (unilateral declaration of independence).",
    "In fact, the LTTE had already moved some of its artillery pieces to areas south of Trincomalee and Palaly under the cover of a fragile ceasefire. In late 2003, Kadirgamar was entrusted with the task of briefing the Indian government on the impending danger. Having returned from New Delhi, where he met a group of top-notch Indian leaders, he held a special briefing for two newspapers including The Island. His presentation featured several detailed maps prepared by the Navy, indicating newly set up LTTE\u2019s gun positions and camps in strategic locations in the North and the East.",
    "When the big story was broken, all hell broke loose, with the UNP-led UNF government threatening to withdraw special security provided to Kadirgamar and evict him from his official residence for trying to \u2018scuttle the peace process\u2019, which was a misnomer. Thankfully, it could not carry out its threat because it was weak due to its clashes with President CBK, who subsequently took over the Defence Ministry, prematurely dissolved Parliament and went on to win a snap general election that followed.",
    "When hostilities resumed in 2006, the LTTE tried to carry out its aforementioned plan, but without much effect. The credit for foiling the LTTE\u2019s grand plan should go to the Navy under Karannagoda\u2019s command, Kadirgamar, and Kumaratunga. A naval officer who was instrumental in preparing the intelligence report under discussion became a victim of a political witch-hunt during the UNP-led Yahapalana government, and a similar fate has befallen some of the battle-scarred naval veterans who destroyed the LTTE\u2019s floating armouries and neutralised the Sea Tigers to make this country safe.",
    "The timing of the formalisation of the 2002 ceasefire here was of immense significance. One may recall that the Machakos Protocol, which paved the way for the creation of South Sudan in 2011, was signed between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army, a few months after the signing of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2002 ceasefire agreement. Three of the self-appointed Co-Chairs of Sri Lanka\u2019s peace process\u2014namely, the US, the UK, and Norway\u2014were associated with the Machakos Protocol as well. Neither Sudan nor South Sudan has achieved peace.",
    "The Co-Chairs of the lopsided peace process obviously did not want Sri Lanka\u2019s conflict to end with the elimination of the LTTE\u2019s military wing. They made a determined bid to prevent the decapitation of the LTTE, but to no avail. During the final phase of Eelam War IV in 2009, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa had to maintain radio silence, as it were, to avoid pressure from his western counterparts who wanted him to spare the LTTE leadership. No wonder those who refused to follow the dictates of those western powers during the war and went on to deliver a death blow to the LTTE are facing sanctions.",
    "Democracy has been rekindled in the former conflict zone, where people now lead normal lives and elect their representatives; democratic dissent is tolerated, and children can go to school without fear of being abducted on the way and turned into cannon fodder. Sadly, Kadirgamar could not live long enough to see the conclusion of the war and the subsequent revival of democracy in the North and the East.",
