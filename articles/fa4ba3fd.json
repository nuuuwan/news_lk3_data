    "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has started a special awareness campaign called \u201cAnti-Pyramid National Awareness Week\u201d from July 14 to 18, 2025. The theme is \u201cPyramid is a trap \u2013 don\u2019t get into the wrong track.\u201d This campaign is meant to warn people about pyramid schemes, which are fake money-making plans that can cause big financial losses. During this week, the Central Bank will reach out to schoolchildren, teachers, police officers, government workers, and the general public through over 6,000 schools and 14,000 local areas across the country. They will explain how these scams work, why they are dangerous, and how to avoid falling into such traps.",
    "While the slogan \u201cPyramid is a trap \u2013 don\u2019t get into the wrong track\u201c sounds catchy, it raises an important question: How can people avoid a pyramid scheme if they don\u2019t know what one looks like? For many Sri Lankans, especially those without financial education, pyramid schemes are often hidden behind friendly faces, smart-sounding plans, or online platforms that promise easy money.",
    "Therefore, telling people \u201cdon\u2019t fall into the trap\u201d is not enough unless they\u2019re clearly taught how to recognise the trap in the first place. Without showing what a pyramid scheme really is, how it works, and what signs to look for, this slogan risks becoming just a rhyme with no real impact.",
    "Pyramid schemes are deceptive and fraudulent business models that masquerade as legitimate investment or income-generating opportunities. The people at the top benefit, while those lower down the pyramid inevitably lose money when recruitment stalls.",
    "Figure 1 visually demonstrates how a pyramid scheme rapidly grows unsustainable due to its structure. If each participant must recruit just five new people, the numbers multiply at an exponential rate:",
    "*\u00a0 Round 3: 25 new recruits (each of the five recruits five more)",
    "That\u2019s over sixbillion people, close to the entire world\u2019s population. This mathematical reality highlights why all pyramid schemes must collapse: they require ever-increasing numbers of new recruits, quickly exceeding the number of people available\u2014even if everyone on earth participated. This makes them fundamentally unsustainable and ensures that the vast majority at the lower levels will inevitably lose all their money. (See Figure 01)",
    "Pyramid schemes are often cleverly disguised. They wear many masks: \u201cinvestment clubs, High-yield \u201copportunities,\u201d Multi-level or network marketing and \u201cpassive income,\u201d etc.",
    "In 2003, I was approached by a well-known banker and the dean of a leading state university\u2019s Faculty of Commerce, both of whom attempted to pitch the notorious Gold Coin pyramid scheme to me. During one of their public presentations, I intervened by illustrating the scheme\u2019s unsustainable mathematics\u2014demonstrating the inevitable collapse of the scheme to the audience helping many people avoid falling victim to the Gold Coin scam.",
    "To protect oneself, it\u2019s important to recognise the common warning signs:",
    "These red flags are almost always present in fraudulent schemes and should trigger immediate caution.",
    "History offers painful lessons about the damage pyramid and Ponzi schemes can inflict:",
    "*\u00a0 Charles Ponzi (USA, 1920): Promised 50% returns in 45 days, resulting in $20 million in losses and a public panic.",
    "* \u00a0Albania (1997): Two-thirds of the population invested in pyramid schemes; their collapse wiped out half of the country\u2019s GDP and sparked riots that left over 2,000 dead or injured.",
    "* \u00a0Russia\u2019s MMM (1990s): A pyramid scheme defrauded 10 million people, siphoning over $10 billion in public funds during a time of economic transition and weak governance.",
    "* \u00a0Bernie Madoff (USA, 2008): Orchestrated a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, highlighting deep flaws in financial oversight.",
    "* \u00a0Crypto-era schemes (2010s\u20132020s): Digital scams like OneCoin and BitConnect lured investors worldwide by misusing blockchain terminology. OneCoin alone defrauded people of more than $4 billion globally.",
    "These cases show that pyramid schemes adapt to their cultural and technological context, making them hard to detect and resist.",
    "In recent years, Sri Lanka has witnessed a rise in fraudulent pyramid schemes, especially those facilitated through digital platforms. With the economic challenges faced by many Sri Lankans, the appeal of fast money has grown stronger, creating fertile ground for these scams.",
    "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has taken several important steps:",
    "*\u00a0 Legal action: Section 83C of the Banking Act makes it illegal to operate, promote, or recruit for pyramid schemes. CBSL has investigated and taken action against several such operations.",
    "* \u00a0Awareness campaigns: In 2025, CBSL organised the National Anti-Pyramid Awareness Week, reaching over 50,000 people through 700+ educational events across schools, government offices, and local communities.",
    "* \u00a0Media strategy: CBSL has used television, radio, social media, and print advertisements to educate the public about the dangers of pyramid schemes.",
    "* \u00a0Partnerships: Engaged schools, the Tri-Forces, police, and civil organisations to spread the message widely.",
    "These actions represent a significant institutional effort to combat financial fraud and protect vulnerable groups.",
    "While CBSL\u2019s efforts are commendable, a critical look reveals areas for improvement:",
    "*\u00a0 Weak messaging: The slogan \u201cPyramid is a trap \u2013 don\u2019t get into the wrong track\u201d lacks emotional impact and clarity. It sounds more like a rhyme than a serious warning. Stronger, context-specific messages are needed.",
    "* \u00a0Lack of digital outreach: Pyramid schemes today often operate through encrypted messaging apps, fake crypto platforms, or \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d online influencers. CBSL\u2019s campaigns focus heavily on traditional media and may not effectively reach digital-first audiences.",
    "* \u00a0Absence of real-time reporting tools: Victims have no direct hotline or mobile app to report suspicious schemes. Quick reporting and verification can prevent further spread.",
    "* \u00a0Limited transparency: While CBSL investigates and prosecutes schemes, the public rarely hears about the outcomes. A lack of updates weakens deterrence and reduces public trust.",
    "* \u00a0Insufficient victim support: There is little visible effort to provide financial counselling or psychological support to those who\u2019ve lost money, further stigmatising victims and allowing fraud to flourish in silence. (See Figure 02)",
    "If you answer yes to two or more of these, walk away\u2014and report it! (See Figure 2).",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term success in combating pyramid schemes depends on modernising its strategy:",
    "*\u00a0 Create better awareness tools: Short animations, radio dramas, local-language leaflets, and testimonial videos from victims can resonate more than technical explanations.",
    "* \u00a0Target digital scams: Training programmes for digital literacy and scam recognition should be rolled out in partnership with universities and telecom providers.",
    "* \u00a0Establish reporting infrastructure: A national hotline, mobile app, and web portal for submitting complaints should be introduced. Anonymous tips could also help.",
    "* \u00a0Enforce with transparency: Regular public reports on investigations, legal outcomes, and recovered funds will show that justice is being served.",
    "* \u00a0Empower schools and youth: Make financial literacy part of the curriculum from secondary school onwards. Young people are frequent digital users and vulnerable to online scams.",
    "Pyramid schemes thrive where there is ignorance, desperation, and misplaced trust. While the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has taken commendable steps to address this growing threat, a more aggressive, digitally-savvy, and emotionally resonant approach is necessary. Public education must move beyond slogans to build resilience, foster skepticism, and offer real-time protection tools.",
    "Ultimately, the best defence lies with informed individuals. If something promises extraordinary returns with little effort, it\u2019s almost always a scam. Ask questions. Think critically. And when in doubt\u2014walk away, report, and protect your community.",
