  "original_body_lines": [
    "That's it then for this first ever Lanka Premier League Player Auction. Worth reminding that the LPL is just the third franchise league in the world to have a Player Auction.",
    "It had it's moments of confusion, and occasional pauses for clairifcations, but the auctioneer Charu Sharma did an excellent job at ensuring that the auction didn't run too long and that the teams were happy with the squads they had assembled.",
    "Matheesha Pathirana will surely be a big attraction when the Colombo Strikers take the field, with some good young talent to compliment the likes of Babar Azam",
    "Babar Azam, Matheesha Pathirana, Naseem Shah, Chamika Karunaratne, Pathum Nissanka, Niroshan Dickwella, Wahab Riaz, Lakshan Sandakan, Nipun Dananjaya, Movin Subasinghe, Lahiru Udara, Eshan Malinga, Sashika Dulshan, Nuwanidu Fernando, Iftikhar Ahmad, Lorcan Tucker, Jeffrey Vandersay, Angelo Perera, Dhananjaya Lakshan, Kanishka Anjula, Ramesh Mendis, Mohammad Nawaz, Ahan Wickramasinghe, Yashoda Lanka,",

    "We'll have the full squads for the five teams in a bit, but it's been an interesting auction.",
    "Left arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka is probably the happiest player of the auction, commanding the highest bid of USD 92,000. Jaffna Kings were the team that made that winning bid, and they will hope he carries his good form from the Sri Lanka 'A' series against South Africa 'A' into next month's LPL season.",
    "Another fast bowler, Binura Fernando also went for big money, USD 76,000, while Charith Asalanka, for the majority of the auction, was the player with the highest bid of USD 80,000.",
    "Dambulla Aura still have a couple of slots on their roster, so they nominate Manelkar de Silva for auction. There are no other bids, so he's sold for his base price of USD 5,000",
    "They have one more spot on the roster, and they have USD 20,000 in the bank, so Dambulla Aura nominate Praveen Jayawickrama. He goes for his base price of USD 20,000 and the Dambulla Aura have completed their roster of 24 players.",
    "Galle Titans nominate left-arm pacer Vishwa Fernando, and they get him for his base price of USD 10,000",
    "Dambulla Aura and Jaffna Kings are short of an overseas player each, so they are asked to nominate a player. Jaffna nominate Chris Lynn, at a base price of USD 50,000. There are no other takers, so\u00a0Chris Lynn is sold to the Jaffna Kings for USD 50,000.",
    "Dambulla Aura nominate Alex Ross, and he goes to Dambulla for his base price of USD 20,000.",
    "A late bid for Thanuka Dabare from BLove Kandy, and they get the batsman for USD 10,000.",
    "Ravindu Fernando, coming in at a base price of USD 5,000, finds a bidder in Dambulla Aura but they are the only one. He goes to the Dambulla Aura.",
    "Avishka Fernando on the board again, having gone unsold earlier. Galle Titans and Dambulla Aura exchange bids and he goes to the Galle Titans for USD 6,000.",
    "Ashan Randika to Jaffna Kings for USD 5,000 , Sonal Dinusha to Galle Titans",
    "Jaffna make the first bid for Ashan Randika, and there are no other takers.",

    "All-rounder Malsha Tharupathi is next, at USD 5,000, but that price rises to USD 13,000 which is the winning bid from BLove Kandy.",
    "Nandre Burger, of South Africa is on the board, but leaves it unsold.",

    "Pakistani Faheem Ashraf goes unsold but Aamer Jamal goes to BLove Kandy for USD 10,000.",
    "Akila Dananjaya bid for by the Colombo Strikers for his base price of USD 10,000. Galle Titans, up the bid to USD 11,000, and with no counter, the gavel goes down.",
    "Zimbabwean Ryan Burl, is next at USD 10,000, and has no takers. He goes unsold.",
    "Rassie van der Dussen comes up next, with a base price of USD 40,000, and after all that drama with Madushanka, there is not a peep. He goes unsold.",
    "Sikandar Raza is the next name out of the bag, and he goes unsold again.",
    "Starting with the Capped players, first up is Australian batsman Chris Lynn. His base price is USD 50,000.",
    "BLove Kandy have 17 playes signed, and need at least three more players, one of which has to be an overseas player, to complete their roster. They have USD 45,000 left to do so.",
    "Jaffna Kings meanwhile, have USD 183,000 left in the bank, but also need to sign five players to meet the minimum requirement of 20 players on the roster. They are also two overseas players short of meeting the six-player quota for overseas players.",
    "Colombo Strikers have the least to do, having already signed 20 players. They have USD 164,500 left which they could spend on upto four players, to be within the maximum number of 24 players on the roster. They need to sign atleast one more overseas player.",
    "Dambulla Aura have USD 76,000 in the kitty, but with 16 players already signed, they would need to sign atleast four more players to meet the minimum required number of 20 players. They are currently one player short of the six overseas player quota.",
    "And finally, Galle Titans have 17 players on the roster, four of whom are overseas players. They will need to sign a minimum of three players, two of whom have to be overseas players, when the Accelerated Auction begins at 8 pm. They have a healthy USD 218,000 left to spend.",
    "Three South Africans come up, but Duanne Olivier and Junior Dala are passed on.",

    "West Indian Fabien Allen and Afghan Azmatullah Omarzai with base prices of USD 40,000 go unsold.",
    "The silence is broken with a bid by the Colombo Strikers who bid for Lahiru Madushanka, at USD 20,000. BLove Kandy counter and the price rises of USD 26,000. Colombo Strikers are not keen to outbid them and neither are the Galle Titans keen to use their Right to Match.",
    "First up, Ruwanapura Dilshan Kanchana, at a base price of USD 5,000 which interests none of the team.",
    "Chamod Pushpa Battage, Lasanda Rukmal, Naleen Priyadarshana,\u00a0Roshen Chanura Fernando, Ratnarajah Thenuratha and Nipun Kanchana Premarathna are all base priced at USD 5,000, and are all passed on. ]",

    "Lahiru Samarakoon is next, also at USD 10,000, and Colombo Strikers and Galle Titans trade bids. The two teams bump up the bids for USD 25,000 and then USD 30,000. The next bump up from the Galle Titans takes the price to USD 40,000. That's more than the other franchises are willing to spend.\u00a0Lahiru Samarakoon goes to the Galle Titans for USD 40,000.",
    "Sineth Jayawardena, at USD 5,000, is first and he's passed on. The next player, Hirun Kapurubandara, also at USD 5,000, joins the unsold list.",
