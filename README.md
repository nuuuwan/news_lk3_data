The second question was how would the Government deal with the IMF. The third cynical question was how Thambuttegama Ranbanda’s Kolla would manage international affairs without competency in English.

This article explores recent fraud incidents, the importance of user education, and how financial organisations can protect their customers while ensuring convenience and minimising service disruption.

Globally, cybercriminals are exploiting the popularity of social media to launch sophisticated scams.

There will not be much problem as there are number of Muslim MPs who are ready to somersault, and opportunistic MPs like Sumanthiran, Devananda and some Sinhala MPs will give them support. Another problem to be faced is to get many NPP members elected at the next hustings. After proportional representation was introduced, no faction was able to secure two-thirds majority, and NPP cannot expect any better result than that.

### Eliminating Ethnic-Based Politics In Sri Lanka: A Path Toward National Unity

Sri Lanka, with its rich diversity of ethnicities, religions, and cultures, has long faced the challenge of balancing these identities in its political landscape. Ethnic-based politics, which has shaped much of the country’s history, continues to be a divisive force that hinders national unity, sustainable development, and long-term peace. Eliminating ethnic-based politics is essential for Sri Lanka’s progress toward a truly united, prosperous, and peaceful society.

Ethnic politics in Sri Lanka can be traced back to the colonial period, when the British promoted communal identities for administrative convenience. After independence in 1948, political parties began to align themselves along ethnic lines, leading to an entrenched system of division. The Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities were often pitted against one another as political elites manipulated ethnic tensions for electoral gains.

The violence ultimately forced Hasina to flee to India on Aug. 5 and an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge.

The tribunal’s proceedings, presided over by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar, saw prosecutors request arrest warrants for 50 individuals, including Hasina.

“I appealed to the court that if the accused, who are extremely influential, are not arrested, it will be impossible to conduct the investigation,” chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said.

பொருளாதார நெருக்கடிக்கு தீர்வு காண பாராளுமன்றத்தில் அனுபவம் வாய்ந்தவர்கள் இருக்க வேண்டும் என முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

"கடந்த இரண்டு வருடங்களாக என்னுடன் பணியாற்றியவர்கள் பொருளாதார நெருக்கடிகளை எதிர்கொண்ட அனுபவம் உள்ளவர்கள், எனவே அவர்கள் பாராளுமன்றத்தில் இருக்க வேண்டும். நீங்கள் எதிர்க்கட்சியாக இருந்தாலும் சரி, அரசாங்கத்தில் இருந்தாலும் சரி, இந்த அனுபவம் இல்லாமல் பாராளுமன்றத்தை நடத்த முடியாது. அதைத் தாண்டி முயற்சித்தால், இலக்குகளை அடைவதில் நீங்கள் தோல்வியடைவீர்கள்" என விக்கிரமசிங்க விசேட அறிக்கை ஒன்றில் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.
