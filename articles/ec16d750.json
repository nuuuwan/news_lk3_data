    "Yarl Dreamin\u2019 is Sri Lanka\u2019s premier community-driven Salesforce conference, hosted annually by the Yarl Salesforce Ohana in Jaffna. Launched in 2023 as the island\u2019s first community-led Salesforce event, it has grown into a platform uniting beginners, professionals, and industry leaders through hands-on workshops, expert sessions, and networking. This year\u2019s conference drew over 350 learners and professionals from the Salesforce ecosystem in Sri Lanka.",
    "The event created a platform to showcase the growing Sri Lankan Trailblazer Community, offering insights into the Salesforce AI-platform \u2013 Agentforce, and the opportunities digital transformation brings for businesses and professionals. Together with the Workforce Development Partners in Sri Lanka \u2013 Yarl Salesforce Ohana and Code Terriers, the community aims to skill around 1,000 learners over the coming year through structured training, mentorship, and local cohorts.",
    "The event spotlighted upskilling and providing career opportunities through hands-on workshops, bootcamps, and networking opportunities. Attendees gained access to trilingual learning resources and ongoing study cohorts, turning Yarl Dreamin\u2019 into a practical on-ramp for students, early professionals, and career-switchers to build future-ready skills and connections.",
    "The Yarl Salesforce Ohana also hosts Hackforce, an annual hackathon that engages developers, students, and aspiring professionals, offering real-world Salesforce exposure and ecosystem connections.",
    "\u201cCommunities thrive when people have open access to learning, local mentors, and real opportunities,\u201d said Arundhati Bhattacharya, President and CEO at Salesforce \u2013 South Asia. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s growth demands more than access \u2014 it needs empowerment. At Yarl Dreamin\u2019, we are not just teaching skills, but enabling choice, innovation, and opportunity in places where tech has too often been distant. We are trying to demystify technology by combining Trailhead, Agentblazer, and local partner programs, so that learners in Jaffna and beyond can turn credentials into capabilities, and talent into impact.\u201d she added.",
    "\u201cYarl Dreamin\u2019 shows what\u2019s possible when the whole community unites, supports one another, and succeeds together,\u201d said Thiriyambaga Sarma Sothinathan, Co-founder of Yarl Dreamin\u2019. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to welcome learners, builders, and employers who want to share knowledge and open doors.\u201d",
    "Unlike traditional conferences, Yarl Dreamin\u2019 is community-owned and volunteer-run. Salesforce\u2019s role is to support and enable that momentum\u2014through learning content, community programs, and connections that help learners meet employers across the ecosystem. The event underscores a wider national imperative: expanding future-ready skills and industry exposure, so that more young people can access high-value work and contribute to growth. Yarl Dreamin\u2019 provides a platform to businesses, partners, and prospective investors by spotlighting credible, skills-led stories, while opening doors for the next generation of Sri Lankan talent.",
