    "The annual Aadi Vel Festival was held at the Sri Murugan Temple at Slave Island in Colombo today. Devotees in bright clothes take to the streets to hold chariot parades, traditional singing, tinkling bells, and a Kavadi ceremonial offering dance. During the festival, they often perform rituals by piercing their cheeks and other body parts to fulfill vows. Pix by Pradeep Pathirana"
