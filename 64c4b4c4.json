    "Japan's Deputy Director General for Press and Diplomacy Yukiko Okano briefing journalists on the discussions between the two nations, said that a number of investment proposals had been put forward by the Sri Lankan government for Japan's consideration.",
    "\"The President raised several projects for Japan's favourable consideration,\" she said. However, Japan's focus at present would be to assist the debt restructuring process as quickly and smoothly as possible, Okano said.",
    "Specific projects, such as the scrapped Light Rail Transit (LRT) project which was to be funded by the Japanese government, were not discussed during this meeting, the official said.",
    "Okano stressed that new lending has to come only after a favourable outcome is reached with Sri Lanka's debt restructuring efforts. \u201cAs a responsible lender, we shouldn't be lending money to countries already in debt,\" Okano said. The Japanese government however will be discussing these projects with the Sri Lankan government, she added.(Kalani Kumarasinghe)"
