Colombo, April 17 (Daily Mirror) - Government officials continued to sound upbeat in striking a deal with the bondholders, however, authorities this week failed to reach a consensus regarding the terms of restructuring.

The restructuring of the debt, amounting to over US$ 12 billion, is a mandatory requirement set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the island nation to continue in its efforts to come out of the debt crisis.

According to the filing, Sri Lanka rejected the ‘Macro-Linked Bond’ (MLB) proposal as it still had concerns, whereas the members of the Steering Committee articulated the reasons why they believed the terms of their MLB proposal were fair and reasonable.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe took part in the World Bank’s Bio-Diversity Financing Forum on the sideline of the IMF/World Bank Spring Meeting in Washington late on Tuesday as the island nation is looking to borrow through nature-lined Green Bonds.

The money raised from Green Bonds, a nature-linked debt instrument, could be used only for green projects like renewable energy, unlike conventional corporate debenture, which could be used for anything the government wants.

The island nation has set targets to become carbon neutral in 2050 and is looking for $11.26 billion in investment to meet its renewable energy targets in eight years through 2030, government officials have said.

Who is responsible for emerging religious extremism in Tamil North? Let me tell you, it’s the callously irresponsible Colombo resident Tamil leaderships. In democratic electoral politics, the strength of leaderships lies in how open and committed they stand against injustice and for democratic and fundamental rights. In Sinhala South, mainstream political leaderships took over majoritarian extremism. In post-war Tamil politics, established political leaders failing to stand with their people allows religious extremism.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila has requested official documents from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the ceding of Katchatheevu Island from India to Sri Lanka. He submitted a Right to Information (RTI) request on 11 April.

Gammanpila said the request was made at an opportune time, as India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has brought up the Katchatheevu issue during the lead-up to India’s general election, which begins on 19 April.

He expressed a desire for the public to have access to the relevant documents, including what he termed historical evidence dating back to the 12th century BC and the exchange of letters between India and Sri Lanka on the subject.

The Katchatheevu issue was raised on Indian political platforms by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, who accused the rival Congress party of underhandedly giving the island to Sri Lanka. Modi also criticised the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for its alleged involvement in the matter.

*2024-04-16 22:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/soes-seen-as-failing-sls-ordinary-citizens/) · `en`

State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Sri Lanka have long served the interests of its employees and politicians, neglecting the welfare of ordinary citizens, Research Consultant at the Advocata Institute Rehana Thowfeek said.

Speaking at a recent media briefing titled, “Burden and The Urgency of State-Owned Enterprise Reform” held at the BMICH, Thowfeek emphasized the urgent need for reform, stating that despite Sri Lanka defaulting on its loan repayments for nearly two years, meaningful progress has been lacking in the country.

Thowfeek highlighted the detrimental impact state intervention in markets has on consumer welfare, attributing inefficiencies to the enrichment of politicians at the expense of taxpayers. She outlined recent reform efforts, including the passing of the SOE Reforms Act and a new Banking Act, alongside the establishment of the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SOERU) and the Holding Company.

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana delivered another match-winning performance for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on Sunday when they defeated Mumbai Indians fairly comfortably.

The right arm quick ended up taking four wickets for 28 runs keeping  CSK in the third spot of the points, very much in the running for play-offs.

Pathirana has so far played three games in the IPL 2024 capturing eight wickets and the 21-year-old seems to be flourishing in Chennai colours.

The former Trinity College speedster has done fairly reasonable job when representing the country. However, in certain games he was well below par.

One would wonder how has CSK been able to get the best out of Pathirana far more regularly.

It must be stated that CSK found Pathirana before the national selectors even considered him for Sri Lanka. Chennai probably have a better scouting system through which they had identified Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana.

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) -  The Court of Appeal has ordered the suspension of the previous allocation of quotas for Haj pilgrims for 2024 and to include an aggrieved travel agent for proper allocation.

Each year the Saudi Arabian government allocates quotas to each country in order to manage the influx of pilgrims.

Sri Lanka had been allocated 3,500 pilgrims this year which had been allocated to different travel agents.

The Court of Appeal made the interim order following a petition filed by a travel agent.

The travel agent alleged that the Haj Committee had arbitrarily suspended their travel license for a period of two years.

In the petition the petitioner United Travels said that the decision by the commitee to suspend his license for two years was done for collateral reasons.

The petitioner asked that he be registered as a travel operator for 2024 and to suspend the allocation made in December 2023.
