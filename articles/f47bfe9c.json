    "Sri Lanka\u2019s newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday (September 23, 2024) promised to strengthen democracy and \u201cwork hard to win people\u2019s trust\u201d, with the disclaimer that he is no \u201cmagician\u201d.",
    "\u201cI am not a magician; I am not a miracle-worker. There are things I know and don\u2019t know. But I will commit myself to doing the right thing at all times, and lead a collective effort to rebuild our nation,\u201d he said, in his first address as President, just after being sworn in at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo. It is the building that protesters stormed in July 2022, as they ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa amid a severe financial meltdown.",
    "Mr. Dissanayake, 55, takes over the country\u2019s top office when the island nation struggles to put a crippling economic crisis behind it. Scores of poor families are looking for urgent relief from the everyday economic strain amid high living costs and utility bills that shot up as part an IMF-led programme that introduced painful austerity measures.",
    "Mr. Dissanayake secured 42.31 % of the votes to win the September 21 presidential election, that he closely fought with Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa and former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. His National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Alliance campaigned on a plank of anti-corruption and has promised to change the country\u2019s political culture.  Mr. Dissanayake\u2019s victory marks a shift in Sri Lankan politics, away from the country\u2019s traditional parties and political elite. He leads the NPP\u2019s chief political constituent, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP or People\u2019s Liberation Front), a party with Marxist-Leninist ideology.",
    "Although Mr. Dissanayake emerged winner in the national election, he did not secure the majority vote share among the country\u2019s ethnic minority communities, especially the Tamils of the north and east. In a message apparently targeting them and others who voted for his rivals, he said: \u201cDemocracy helped me win. Some voted for me, and others didn\u2019t. But my pledge is to work hard to win the trust of those who didn\u2019t vote for me as well. This is an important part of my Presidency.\u201d Further, he pledged support to businesses and said he would work with all international actors, while keeping Sri Lanka\u2019s best interests in mind.",
    "President Dissanayake on Monday (September 23, 2024) appointed secretaries to various ministers. He is expected to appoint a new Cabinet on Tuesday (September 24, 2024), Colombo-based political sources said."
