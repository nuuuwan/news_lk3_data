    "The verdict, delivered by Colombo Additional Magistrate Pasan Amarasena, also included a fine of Rs. 1,500. In the event of non-payment, the court ordered an additional one month of imprisonment.",
    "The case, filed under Section 291 of the Penal Code, was based on remarks made by Gnanasara Thero during a press conference held in the Kirulapone area on 16 July 2016. The Thera said, \u201cIslam is a cancer\u2026 it must be eradicated,\u201d a statement deemed to incite ethnic disharmony and promote hatred against the Muslim community.",
