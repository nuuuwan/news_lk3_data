ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Net foreign assets of Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank have been brought to almost zero by September 2024, through consistent deflationary open market operations, after rates were hiked in April 2022.

By September 2024, the net foreign assets of the central bank were negative by only 175 million dollars from a peak of negative 4.6 billion US dollars at the height of the last currency crisis in August 2024, which ended in external sovereign default.

The central bank‚Äôs foreign reserves were a negative 4.0 billion dollars in March 2022 when the central bank hiked rates to contain domestic credit.

But due to reserves loaned by India through the Asian Clearing Union mechanism, the central bank continued to sell borrowed reserves and re-finance domestic credit through inflationary open market or standing liquidity facilities to maintain its policy rate, extending the balance of payments deficits.
