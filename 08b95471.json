    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A potential loss for Sri Lanka\u2019s Employee\u2019s Provident Fund from restructuring bonds, will depend on future market interest rates at which coupons and maturing restructured bonds are re-invested, an investment consultancy has said.",
    "If a 10 percent future interest rate is assumed the EPF could lose about 12.5 percent of potential interest earnings it would have made if its portfolio was not re-structured, according to a projection by Reliance Capital (Pvt) Ltd, (RCL) an investment consultancy, which is also the holding company of Charts.lk, an online data portal.",
    "In order to project a loss or profit, the rate at which coupons and maturing bonds are re-invested has to be projected for the next 15 years.",
    "Sri Lanka has high nominal interest rates and inflation due to a flawed monetary regime with conflicting anchors, which had led to a permanently depreciating rupee, pock marked by severe and less severe currency crisis, imposing regressive inflation taxes on the poor, critics say.",
    "The average one-year Treasury bill yield for the last 15 years was 10.66 percent according to RCL calculations, including 2008 and 2022 (when severe currency crises were triggered). The average 5-year bond yield was 11.76 percent and average inflation was 8.88 percent.",
    "When the two years were excluded the one-year bill rate was 8.58 percent and the 5-year bond yield was 10.53 percent.",
    "There is no public information on the exact securities in the EPF portfolio and RCL made the projection based on maturing bonds of each year, disclosed in published financial statements for 2022.",
    "Bonds in the existing portfolio, were assumed to mature at the end of year and not at different dates within the year.",
    "The coupon rate for bonds maturing in a given year was assumed to be the simple average of bonds maturing in that year.",
    "Only coupon income was considered in the calculation. Bonds are assumed to be swapped for face value, no discount or premium accrual was brought into the workings.",
    "Under the restructure, existing bonds would be swapped for 10 maturities which will pay 12 percent until 2025. Then they would then fall to 9.0 percent. Maturities would start from 2027.",
    "If the EPF rejects the offer, its tax rate would be hiked to 30 percent from the current 14 percent.",
    "If coupons and maturing bonds are re-invested at 10 percent, the EPF coupon interest income would fall from 9.698 billion to 8.450 billion if the DDR is accepted, or 12.5 percent.",
    "EPF\u2019s portfolio value would fall to 11.665 billion rupees from 12.718 billion rupees.",
    "In the non-DDR scenario, there is another 155 million rupees of bonds which mature after 2028, running 2045. This would increase the non-DDR fund value to 12.873 billion rupees.",
    "If the EFP is taxed at 30 percent, coupon income would fall to 6,872 million rupees, and the fund value to 9.892 billion rupees.",
    "It the future interest rate is 9 percent, EPF would lose about 11 percent of coupon income.",
    "If the future interest rate is 13 percent it may lose up to 17 percent of potential coupon earnings.",
    "Authorities who have more information on the actual portfolio has said the opportunity loss would be around 4 percent. It is not clear what the projected interest rate is.",
    "Related Sri Lanka EPF average yield now 11.5-pct, opportunity loss calculated: CB Governor",
    "Sri Lanka interest rates usually go up after the central bank aggressively cuts rates using liquidity injections from open market operations or other tools, in the pursuit of \u2018macro-economic policy\u2019 which trigger forex shortages and BOP deficits. (Colombo/July17/2023)"
