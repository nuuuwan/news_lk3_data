    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, who is in charge of police, has ordered to question former president Maithripala Sirisena over his comments on his knowledge over real plotters behind Easter Sunday attack that killed at least 269 people in 2019.",
    "Sirisena, who had been found guilty by the country\u2019s Supreme Court for his failure to prevent the carnage, on Friday said he knew who carried out the attack and was ready to reveal it confidentially to if there is a request or order from Court.",
    "\u201cAlready, there is an ongoing investigation. Some have been charged and there is a trail-at-bar is on the process. If somebody says like this, we have to investigate and he can\u2019t refuse to cooperate,\u201d Minister Alles told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cA judge will not ask anybody to appear in the court because somebody says in public that he knows something. It must be done through police.\u201d",
    "Sirisena, a legislator now and leader of the center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), was the president of the island nation when Islamist suicide bombers targeted Catholics and foreigners in six simultaneous blasts on the day of Easter Sunday, April 21, 2019.",
    "Investigations into the attack have revealed there had been serious lapses in intelligence where law implementing agency neglected a series of warning by Indian intelligence agency.",
    "Despite in-depth probe by the local authorities, the investigators failed to identify the real motive and the mastermind of the attack so far.",
    "In January 2023, Sirisena was ordered by the Supreme court to pay 100 million rupees as compensation to the victims for his negligence in preventing one of the country\u2019s worst terror strikes despite having credible information of an imminent attack.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Catholic leadership has repeatedly demanded an independent investigation into the Easter Sunday carnage.",
    "Political analysts say Sirisena in the past as well has drawn attention via some controversial statements and actions.",
    "In October 2018, Sirisena sacked his Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, who lost the 2015 presidency to Sirisena after a bitter fight.",
    "However, the Supreme Court found Sirisena\u2019s action unconstitutional and ordered to reinstate Wickremesinghe as the prime minister in December 2018 after 52 days of a \u2018constitutional coup\u2019.",
    "Sirisena, during this period, claimed that there was a plot by Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to assassinate him and Gotabaya Rajapaksa. However, such a plot was not proven with evidence. (Colombo/March 24/2024)"
