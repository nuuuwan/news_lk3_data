### Mahinda Rajapaksa responsible for bankruptcy of SriLankan Airlines

*2024-05-21 02:33:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Mahinda-Rajapaksa-responsible-for-bankruptcy-of-SriLankan-Airlines/14-762047) · `en`

Mr Editor, please give me a little space in your esteemed newspaper to enlighten a man who deliberately misled the readers by covering up the many vain deeds of Mahinda Rajapaksa (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Restructure-SriLankan-Airlines-but-no-mandate-for-sale/4-761891).

One of the most unpardonable deeds was to destroy a profit-making SriLankan Airline with a track record of accident-free flying. True it was CBK who successfully negotiated and brought in Emirates as a partner. The airline was running profitably with a foreign national as its head when MR assumed office as President.

### One more in the long line of rejections

*2024-05-21 02:31:32* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/One-more-in-the-long-line-of-rejections/14-762046) · `en`

The Sunday Times on 19 May carried the Foreign Ministry’s reactions on the OHCHR report on ‘enforced disappearances’ in Sri Lanka (https://www.sundaytimes.lk/240519/news/lanka-strongly-rejects-un-report-questions-its-mandate-and-timing-557860.html). It says Sri Lanka is rejecting the report.

This may be one more in the long line of rejections since the days of Gotabaya Presidency.

Interestingly, questions have been raised about the authority or mandate of the High Commissioner to issue such a report. But in their heady rush to reject the report, they may not have consulted important resolutions including the UNGA resolution establishing the post of High Commissioner.

These resolutions particularly stress the importance of the role of the High Commissioner as the voice of humanity on gross or grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, how the High Commissioner should express that voice and what format or method should be followed is left open.

### ICC prosecutor seeks arrest of Israeli PM Netanyahu and Hamas leader

*2024-05-21 02:03:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/ICC-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-of-Israeli-PM-Netanyahu-and-Hamas-leader/56-762037) · `en`

Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and Hamas’s leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has applied for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes.

Karim Khan KC said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October onwards.

Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with the group’s military chief Mohammed Deif, are also wanted for arrest.

ICC judges will now decide whether they believe the evidence is sufficient to issue arrest warrants - something which could take weeks or months.

Netanyahu said in a statement that he rejected “with disgust The Hague prosecutor’s comparison between democratic Israel and the mass murderers of Hamas”.

### Social media comes to the fore in Indian elections

*2024-05-21 01:50:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Social-media-comes-to-the-fore-in-Indian-elections/172-282992) · `en`

Chiefly YouTube, has emerged as the main mode of political communication overshadowing the traditional or “mainstream” electronic media

The 2024 Indian parliamentary elections will be remembered for many reasons. They are the longest to date, stretching from April 19 to June 1.

They are taking place in the midst of acute unemployment, skyrocketing prices and lack of demand in the market.

An unprecedented amount of money is being spent amidst corruption charges.  Divisive issues of caste, religion and region are being racked up. Sex scandals are sullying the reputations of some of the high and mighty.

But in the midst of the darkness, there is a silver lining. Social media platforms, chiefly YouTube, have emerged as the main mode of political communication, overshadowing the traditional or “mainstream” electronic media.

### Elections must be decided only by law - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-21 01:48:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Elections-must-be-decided-only-by-law-EDITORIAL/172-282991) · `en`

The elections in Sri Lanka are said to be conducted in a free and fair manner and according to the law. However, some laws have been promulgated in a manner that ruling parties can manipulate the law in their favour.

The Sri Lankan Constitution states “The President of the Republic shall be elected by the people and shall hold office for a term of five years.” It again says “The poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.”

Accordingly, the Election Commission (EC) on May 9 announced that the Presidential polls will be held between September 17 and October 16, this year. The Commission’s announcement was based on the country’s law and hence election could not be held before that period or postponed for a date after it.

### ICC chief prosecutor seeks Netanyahu, Hamas leaders’ arrest

(AP) — The chief prosecutor of the world’s top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war.

While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened Israel’s isolation over the war in Gaza.

The court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders — Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas.

### The Beautiful Terrible Signs: The Ongoing Saga Of Rheumatic Heart Disease

Every physician likely recalls an unforgettable moment from his or her clinical rotation as a medical student that profoundly impacted him or her, leaving an indelible mark. For me it was the encounter with a patient suffering from Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis in India. In fact, it was the presence of my larger-than-life clinical professor that made the moment even more memorable. His mesmerizing descriptions of the clinical signs, such as “opening snap,” “rumbling mid-diastolic murmur,” and “presystolic accentuation,” along with precise timing between the second heart sound and the opening snap, had elevated the experience to another level. However, amidst my fascination, I must confess, I had failed to recognize the true gravity of these signs—their reflection of extreme suffering on the part of the patient. It never even once occurred to me then that these captivating signs were, in fact, manifestations of medical failure, the root cause behind them.

The government is gearing up for the upcoming presidential election, with speculation about whether it will coincide with a general election due to political maneuvering. Former UNP parliamentarian Saman Ratnapriya confirms Ranil Wickremesinghe's preparation for the presidency, despite rumors suggesting otherwise. There's uncertainty over the timing, with some predicting a parliamentary dissolution in mid-June and others stating the presidential election must occur between September 18 and October 16. The President has affirmed the election's holding this year, aligning with constitutional requirements. Despite opposition claims, Ranil Wickremesinghe's efforts to stabilize the economy highlight his suitability for the presidency, ensuring his candidacy remains strong.

Some people say that the general election will be held in the country. They make such a campaign with their selfish political purpose.

But Ranil Wickremesinghe is preparing for the presidential election, said Saman Ratnapriya, a former UNP parliamentarian and director of the president's trade unions.

He was speaking at a press conference held at Sirikotha on Monday (20) as the UNP headquarters.

A few people say that the parliamentary election will be held in the country. Udayanga Weeratunga says parliament will be dissolved in mid -June.

Parliamentarian Dylan Perera said he was sure that the parliamentary election would begin.

At the same time, some are campaigning that Ranil Wickremesinghe will not contest the next presidential election.

Thus they are carrying out campaigns based on their political program. But according to the political system, the presidential election must be held on September 18 and October 16.
