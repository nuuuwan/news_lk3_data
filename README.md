Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Following the price reduction of Lanka auto diesel from last night, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said today that this fuel price revision is insufficient for a bus fare revision at this time.

Addressing the media he said that according to the National Bus Fare Policy, the recent amount of the fuel price revision cannot be calculated.

Accordingly, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) reduced the retail price of a litre of Lanka auto diesel by Rs. 30 with effect from last night.

"During the past months, we provided the service while incurring a loss of Rs. 27 per litre of diesel. Even after the previous fuel price revision the association had taken a decision not to go for a fuel price revision as it was not even 4% of the minimum fare hike needed for a fare revision.

"According to the policy calculation, only Rs. 3 will be reduced from the bus fare, but it is not more than the minimum calculation of 4%.

### Vehicle importers demand proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports

*2024-05-01 12:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98952/vehicle-importers-demand-proper-regulatory-framework-for-vehicle-imports) · `en`

The Vehicle Importers’ Association insists on the necessity of a proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports in Sri Lanka.

President of the association Indika Sampath Merinchige emphasized the need for the government to establish a committee inclusive of their association’s representatives to make decisions on this matter.

“When importing vehicles to Sri Lanka in the past few years, specifically in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 85% of the vehicles imported were used vehicles with only 15% new vehicles were imported. Out of that, 95% of the vehicles were sourced from Japan”, he added.

“In the future, it is imperative to prioritize the preferences of the people when importing vehicles. If the agents prioritize matters that are not aligned with the requirements of the people, there will likely be a decline in demand”, Merinchige said.

Today is International Workers’ Day, also known as Labour Day, which is observed annually on May 1 in Sri Lanka and the world at large.

The day, which has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement.

May 1 is observed as an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival, however, it became associated with the labour movement in the late 19th century after trade unions and socialist groups designated it as a day in support of workers.

The date was chosen to be International Workers’ Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago in the US, in which a peaceful rally in support of workers led to a violent clash with the police, leading to the deaths of at least 38 civilians and 7 police officers.

While 60 police officers and 115 civilians were injured. Those who died due to the clash were hailed as “Haymarket Martyrs”.

### Implement Premadasa’s policies to overcome current economic crisis

The dynamic policies of President Premadasa came to an abrupt halt 31 years ago

As one who had the opportunity to serve as the Chairman and Director General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission and later converted to the Board of Investment from 1991 to 1993 and prior to that as the Chairman of the People’s Bank during the period of President Premadasa, it will be appropriate for me to write about the importance to implement the economic policies of the Premadasa period to overcome the current economic crisis and achieve sustainable economic recovery on the 31st Death Anniversary of late President Premadasa. Although giving free handouts was the order of the day, Premadasa policies were able to change this concept by pushing economic development to the provinces. He did this by inviting the private sector businessmen to set up garment factories in the rural areas which provided employment and brought in the much needed foreign exchange.

Though the first 10 minutes, Indians stood out with some good defense, hosts Sri Lanka scored three unanswered first half tries, which put the Indians on the backfoot.  India spoiled many Sri Lankan moves but the lead the hosts created with very good foundation in the first half was too much for a catch up game.

Tarinda Ratwatte, Sohiru Anthony, Adeesha Weerathunga and Mursheed Doray were omnipresent. In fact Tarinda played a major role in the initial half as Centre and then moved to fill in Thenuka Nanayakkara’s fly half berth.

As Sri Lanka gets closer to the elections that are supposed to be held at the end of this year, a fierce contest seems to have occurred between the two main opposition parties, the Samaji Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Jathika Jana Balawegaya (NPP). Representatives of the SJB Economic Policy Committee, such as Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva, seem to have launched a strong attack on the NPP questioning the latter on economic policy matters.

One of the significant themes recurring in this attack is frequent references made to terms such as Socialism and Marxism. Addressing a press conference last week, MP Harsha de Silva stated that if the NPP Economic Council is not willing to come for a debate, the SJB economic committee trio would like to have the debate at the Galle Face Green, with cutouts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the opposing side.
