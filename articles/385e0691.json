    "Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation expanded by 6.5 percent year-on-year in January, as the prices rose across almost all categories from the one-off impact from the higher Value Added Tax and supply chain disruptions caused by the weather-related conditions.",
    "On a monthly basis, as measured by the National Consumer Price Index, the prices rose by 3.0 percent in January, from 1.4 percent a month ago, reaching the highest increase recorded in more than a year.",
    "The prices measured by the broader consumer price index followed the closely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index released three weeks ago, which also had a reading of 6.4 percent for January, from 4.0 percent in December.",
    "The recent price pressures aren\u2019t surprising, as the authorities were expecting the price gauges to reach in the neighbourhood of 7.0 percent in both January and February.",

    "The core prices measure the underlying price pressures in the economy and provide a better predictor of future inflation, thus watched more closely for policymaking.",

    "Almost all categories in non-food inflation registered price increases in January over the December levels, led by the increase in housing rent, prices of petrol and L.P. gas.",
    "As people are beginning to venture out more often for recreational activities, there is more pressure on non-food prices, as seen from the index, because what people spend at restaurants and hotels continues\u00a0to rise.",
    "Outlays on education had a considerable bearing on parents\u2019 pocketbooks in recent times, as tuition fees had risen sharply\u00a0in January."
