The Police have arrested over 200 foreign nationals, mainly Chinese, who were housed in several locations, including Kandy, Avissawella, Rajigiriya, and Negombo.

*2024-10-16 11:03:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102728/us-gives-israel-30-days-to-boost-gaza-aid-or-risk-cut-to-military-support) · `en`

The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off.

The letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties.

It says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month.

Israel is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country “takes this matter seriously” and intends to “address the concerns raised” with US counterparts.

Israel has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is under fire after buying a multi-million-dollar cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis.

Albanese made the purchase months out from an election in which the cost of living and housing are key issues.

The move has sparked backlash from across the political divide - with his opponents calling it “tone deaf” and some within his own party anonymously telling local media it left them “gobsmacked”.

Albanese defended his decision, saying he “knows what it is like to struggle” but bought the luxury property to be close to his fiancee Jodie Haydon’s family on the New South Wales Central Coast.

Property records show the four-bedroom, three-bathroom, and three-carport property in Copacabana - which has panoramic views - was sold for A$4.3m ($2.9m, £2.2m) last month, but the purchase is yet to settle.
