    "Colombo, April 17 (Daily Mirror) - Mage Rata organization president Sanjaya Mahawatta today, lodged a complaint with the Illegal Assets Investigations Division, calling for an inquiry into model Piumi Hansamali using the Range Rover vehicle previously used\u00a0 by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "\"It is clear that an election is near and politicians tend to inject all their saved black money into the upcoming election campaigns and it has become a good time for the people who engage with money laundering activities.",
    "\"Accordingly, we have some doubts on how Piumi Hansamal managed to get the Range Rover vehicle (CBM 1949) which was used by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "\"The question arises whether the Range Rover vehicle was given to the former president or if Gotabaya has given it to Piyumi,\" said Mahawatta and further alleged that the model currently resides in a super luxury apartment, owns other properties and leads an exceedingly luxurious lifestyle.",
    "Therefore, there are suspicions that Piumi Hansamali is being utilized for money laundering activities involving politicians' black money, he charged.",
    "\"Therefore, we have lodged a complaint with the Illegal Assets Investigations Division. The initial complaint pertains to the Range Rover vehicle previously associated with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and its transfer to Piumi Hansamali. This vehicle is estimated to be worth Rs. 100 million. Questions arise regarding how the vehicle came into Piumi Hansamali's possession, the reasons behind its transfer and how she could afford such a valuable asset while primarily engaged in selling cosmetics. Additionally, it is noted that Piumi Hansamali's has not made any television appearances lately.",
    "\"I personally know several individuals who rely on selling cosmetics for their livelihoods. But they struggle to cover their daily expenses with their modest incomes. However, Piumi Hansamali reportedly spends lakhs of rupees daily and leads a lavish lifestyle.",
    "\"The Mage Rata organization is vigilant over the extravagant spending of politicians during election campaigns and their potential involvement in money laundering activities,\" he stated.",
    "\"Hence, we anticipate an immediate investigation into this complaint,\" he added."
