    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s application for membership in BRICS has not been rejected, but not accepted due to the decision by nine members in the block, the island nation\u2019s Foreign Ministry said.",
    "Cabinet Spokesman Vijitha Herath last week said Sri Lanka\u2019s application to become a member in the BRICS has not been accepted by the group\u2019s current membership, but its request to become a member of BRICS\u2019 New Development Bank (NDB) has been accepted.",
    "\u201cNot accepted means our application was not rejected,\u201d a Foreign Ministry official said.",
    "\u201cOur application is in the process. We do not have to apply again for the membership.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka applied for the membership of BRICS when its delegation led by Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardena took part in the BRICS summit last month held in Russia.",
    "BRICS, an economic and political group, has been gaining increasing relevance in recent years.",
    "It poses several potential challenges to the global dominance of the United States and the central role of the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance.",
    "Cabinet Spokesman Herath said nine countries which are holding membership in BRICS have decided not to entertain any new membership this time.",
    "\u201cWe applied for membership only close to the October summit. We also spoke to foreign ministers of many countries to back us. Those countries also backed us. But when the summit decided not to expand membership, we won\u2019t get that opportunity,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut we applied to get the membership of the NDB Bank which comes under BRICS. We have got an opportunity to implement that. It should be decided by the Sri Lanka government. We will be deciding at the Cabinet in the future,\u201d Herath said.",
    "The Foreign Ministry in a statement also said the Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane, as leader of the Sri Lanka delegation announced Sri Lanka\u2019s interest.",
    "\u201cAt the Summit, the BRICS Member States also endorsed a new category of Partner Countries, whilst \u2018welcoming the considerable interest by countries of the Global South in BRICS\u2019 (Kazan Declaration),\u201d the Ministry said in the statement.",
    "\u201cPending requests for BRICS membership from many countries including Sri Lanka will be considered by BRICS member countries in due course.\u201d",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s intention to join the New Development Bank was welcomed by the President of the New Development Bank. The Foreign Ministry together with relevant Government agencies will review the procedures and timing in this regard.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere is no truth in the statement carried in certain local media that \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s BRICS application has been rejected\u201d.\u201d",
    "The Russian Embassy in Colombo in a statement also said Sri Lanka\u2019s application will be considered by BRICS in due course.",
    "\u201cThe Embassy would like to highlight that Sri Lanka has applied to join BRICS. The Russian BRICS Chairship welcomed Sri Lanka\u2019s interest,\u201d the Russian Embassy said in a statement.",
    "\u201cIts application will be considered by BRICS in due course in full consultation and consensus along with bids of numerous other countries who have also applied. The local media reports that Sri Lanka\u2019s application has been rejected are wrong.\u201d (Colombo/November 10/2024)"
