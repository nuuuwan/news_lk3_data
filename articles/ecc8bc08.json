An important feature of the Santapaws Xmas bazaar is that three complimentary stalls have been allocated to the Indira Cancer Trust, Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation and Sisters in Law, a charity that helps abused women and girls, for them to sell goods and raise funds for their own charities. The \u2018Jax Dip\u2019 a lucky dip named after the RAS mascot who is a miniature Dachshund, whose spine is broken in three places, will be available at the Cinnamon Grand Lobby by the RAS ticket counter and will be launched with the first donation of a toy by Kamal Munasinghe and other partners.
