### Plantation workers are poor, destitute, and helpless, but their poetic expressions are marvellous

*2024-09-30 05:46:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Plantation-workers-are-poor-destitute-and-helpless-but-their-poetic-expressions-are-marvellous/4-767334) · `en`

When the Britishers introduced tea as an export crop to old Ceylon in mid 19th century, it was a game changer. It transformed the traditional subsistence agricultural economy that prevailed to a modern plantation economy seeking to satisfy the demand for the new beverage called tea spreading like a pandemic across Europe and Americas. Initially, it was a beverage of the rich and the aristocrats. A pound of tea was sold, according to advertisements that were inserted in papers, for 25 Sterling Pounds. This exclusive product was made inclusive by ingenious marketing strategies adopted by tea traders like presenting it as a brain tonic.

### Social reformer AKD, Sri Lanka’s 9th President

*2024-09-30 05:35:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Social-reformer-AKD-Sri-Lanka-s-9th-President/4-767333) · `en`

The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil shocked the country’s political establishment and sharply divided opinion. While some warned that Bolsonaro—a far-right populist who admired Brazil’s military dictatorship—posed a serious threat to democracy, others believed that Brazil’s strong institutions, including an assertive press and independent judiciary, would curb his authoritarian tendencies. This debate mirrors the global discussion surrounding populist leaders. Similarly, Sri Lanka is undergoing a political shift, with citizens demanding accountability from elites who have long failed them.

President Anura’s meteoric rise as a “Leader of the People” to become Sri Lanka’s 9th Executive President is emblematic of this trend. However, his presidency faces significant challenges, particularly in balancing his populist appeal with the deep-seated demands of economic governance and institutional reform.

### Fervent appeal to Minister Amarasuriya; please free Royal College from deep rooted corruption

*2024-09-30 05:29:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Fervent-appeal-to-Minister-Amarasuriya-please-free-Royal-College-from-deep-rooted-corruption/14-767332) · `en`

To date, I have written over 25 letters to Principal Waththuhewa and over 10 to Education Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara, making the same appeal. I don’t mind their not acknowledging my emails, as long as they had acted to eradicate rampant money collections at the Royal Primary.

The Principal and his management team of 50 senior administrators completely ignore the thriving and omnipresent corruption happening right in front of them, employing a handpicked set of parents to rake in millions (without receipts/accounts/audits) and keeping the loot in private bank accounts. Please refer to the recent article where we showed the last year’s illegal collections topped Rs. 100 million (https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Education-Ministry-urged-to-probe-alleged-financial-malpractices-at-The-Royal-College-Primary/14-760265).

A recent session organised by the Policy Advocacy and Economic Contribution Committee (PAEC Committee) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) focused on how the private sector can act as a catalyst in fighting corruption, with a specific emphasis on the responsibilities of directors.

The recently enacted Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023, plays a pivotal role in reinforcing integrity and ethical conduct within public service.

The CA session aimed to raise awareness about anti-corruption initiatives, engage the private sector, and explore actionable measures beyond legislation.

Northern former MP Angajan Ramanathan has formally requested President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to take action to reopen several key roads in the high-security zones of Jaffna.

This request follows the President’s decision to reopen two streets near the President’s House in Colombo for public access.

Ramanathan’s appeal highlights that, despite the war ending 15 years ago, several vital roads in Jaffna remain closed, significantly disrupting daily life and transportation for the local population.

In his letter, the former MP pointed out that the Jaffna-Palaly road, particularly the east side next to the Vayavilan Central College, should be freed from military restrictions. This road connects to the Ponnalai road, an essential route for local traffic. He also emphasised the closure of the Achuveli Vayavilan-Tholakatti street, which has hampered the functioning of major Government and private enterprises in the region.
