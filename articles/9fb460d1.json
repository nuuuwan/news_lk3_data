    "\u201cAt American Water, every bottle of water sold isn\u2019t just refreshing, it\u2019s making a difference. Through our partnership with the OrphanCare Trust, a portion of proceeds from each bottle goes towards supporting orphaned children avoid a second abandonment. So, every time you choose our water, you are not only hydrating yourself but also contributing to a brighter future for the vulnerable orphans. It\u2019s a simple act with a big impact, ensuring that every sip counts towards a positive change,\u201d stated American Premium Water Systems Group Managing Director M.H.M. Fazal.",
