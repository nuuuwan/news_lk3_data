### India rejects food imports from several countries including Sri Lanka

*2024-11-26 15:25:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103781/india-rejects-food-imports-from-several-countries-including-sri-lanka) · `en`

India has taken strict action against substandard food imports, rejecting consignments of items like apples, nuts, alcoholic beverages, and sushi from countries including China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Turkey. These products failed to meet the quality and safety standards set by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

The FSSAI, India’s top food regulator, has made the details public through its recently launched Food Import Rejection Alert (FIRA) portal.

This platform helps authorities worldwide quickly share information about rejected food items, enabling swift action to prevent risks and ensure traceability and transparency.

Under Regulation 11(7) of the Food Safety and Standards (Import) Regulation, 2017, the FSSAI is empowered to issue food alert notifications. For instance, a cinnamon flower bud shipment from Sri Lanka was rejected in May because it required prior approval under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

My father would want to be remembered for his unwavering faith, calm demeanour, and boundless kindness. He taught me to face adversity with grace, to be generous and kind, and to live a life of integrity. Though he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on in the values he instilled in all of us

This will be my first Christmas without my father, Eric Cooray, who passed away three months ago. Life has felt strange since that inevitable moment, one I always dreaded, while never anticipating just how difficult his loss would be to accept.

Almost every day starts and ends with thoughts of my father, from fond memories of my childhood to imagining how proud he would be of his beloved grandchildren. Throughout my life, he inspired me in countless ways. Even now, I draw so much strength from memories of him that it still feels like he is guiding me from the heavens, giving me the strength to keep moving forward.
