    "Even though Vidyapathy was born and brought up in Sri Lanka\u2019s Kotte, the former student of Bachelor of Performing Arts (BPA) in Bhatkhande is extremely fluent in Hindi and well trained in Kathak. She gave the influence of Bollywood and Hindi movies as her inspiration for her fluent Hindi.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m extremely glad that my 10 years of hard work paid off and I am the only international student to bag the gold medal,\u201d she said, giving all the credit to her three Gurus Ruchi Khare Verma of Bhatkhande, Moksha Samasooriya and Vihanga Rukshan (her Sri Lanka teachers).",
    "Talking about her inclination she said, \u201cI come from a family of artists and I\u2019m the ninth generation in my family who has been into the profession of art including dance and music. In fact, my mother and father both met in a Kathak class, so it runs in my blood.\u201d",
    "Kanak Kulshestra, 24, has not bagged one or two medals, but eight gold medals for kathak, although she has no background in dance.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m in disbelief as I have no dance background. But today, I topped the university,\u201d said Kulshestra, the daughter of a businessman, who has been learning dance since the age of five.",
    "\u201cI remember the day when I wanted to study here but Bhaktkahnde was too big a name for me as I was a little sceptical if I would get admission, but today, I made it,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cAll credit goes to my mother who put me into the classical dance school in childhood seeing my interest in dance. My guru Ruchi Khare deserves equal credit for my success,\u201d said the Swaraj Nagar resident of Kanpur, who is currently pursuing UGC NET and wants to pursue a dance career to become a professor. \u201cI want to popularise it as we should be deep-rooted in our culture,\u201d she said."
