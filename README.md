### Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly tops Elon Musk as world’s richest person

Elon Musk briefly lost his title as the world’s richest person to Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle and an ally of US President Donald Trump.

Ellison’s wealth surged to $393bn (£290bn) on Wednesday morning, surpassing Musk’s $385bn (£284bn), according to the Forbes billionaire list.

The jump came after shares in Oracle, which make up a significant part of Ellison’s fortune, soared more than 40%, boosted by the database software company’s surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals.

But the firm’s share price had shed some of those gains by the end of the day, putting Musk back on top.

Before briefly losing it to Ellison, Musk had held the title of world’s richest person for nearly one year.

He could receive a pay package worth over $1tn (£740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed.

But shares in Musk’s most valuable business, Tesla, have fallen this year.

### Nepal Protests: No consensus yet on interim leader; death toll rises to 30

*2025-09-11 06:50:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112380/nepal-protests-no-consensus-yet-on-interim-leader-death-toll-rises-to-30) · `en`

Disagreement has emerged among “Gen Z” campaigners over who should lead an interim administration, as Nepal faces a political crisis following the fall of the K.P. Sharma Oli government, triggered by a youth-led protest against corruption.

Gen Z campaigners, who have been holding discussions on the digital platform Discord, remain divided, according to Indian media reports.

Some are backing former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, while others support Balendra Shah, the current Mayor of Kathmandu.

Youth protest groups have now gathered in front of the Army headquarters in Kathmandu after failing to reach a consensus.

The Nepal Army, which has been tasked with negotiating with Gen Z campaigners, has asked them to first agree among themselves before talks can move forward.

Meanwhile, the total number of casualties from the Gen Z-led protests in Nepal has reached 30.

### Time and space to eclipse  the sad face of Sri Lanka

Of course, no lover of a land like no other in their right mind would gainsay what Vijitha Herath told the watching world in the aftermath of the blood moon

The blood moon of the night of 7 September brought with it a panoply of portents for Sri Lanka. A lunar eclipse lasting almost one and a half hours, its visibility was marred to some degree by intermittent scudding clouds. Very few islanders however, usually superstitious to the nth, paid heed to prophecies of doom and gloom; opting instead to interpret the celestial show as favourable for once.

In the wake of the night-time heavenly spectacle came Sri Lanka’s showing at the 60th United Nations Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva. Led by the redoubtable Vijitha Herath fronting the island’s case as its foreign minister, the once embattled nation state had many eyes squinting at the fine print of the text.

### Eurasia rising, Anura’s SCO absence, strategic-security blindness, and NPP-Israel axis

Sri Lankans are trapped in a triangular matrix of three Big Lies:

(I) ‘The Aragalaya was mainly for system-change’. If true, almost a million people who flooded Colombo on July 9th 2022 morning couldn’t have shrunk to about 15,000 by nightfall after they’d successfully evicted Gotabaya. The numbers never reassembled but returned only to explore and picnic outside occupied/liberated buildings. The Aragalaya was specific and concrete, mainly about limited and legitimate ‘regime-change’, not ‘system-change’: sending Gota home, just as in the Philippines in 1986 it was about deposing Marcos.

Families of the disappeared have called for international oversight of the investigations, fearing that the truth will be buried with the victims

There are credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law committed by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). The Chemmani mass graves, uncovered in 1998 near Jaffna, are an unresolved case of alleged State-sponsored atrocities during the Sri Lankan civil war, which include summary executions and systematic efforts to cover up the crimes. Killings in Chemmani and other crimes must be resolved for Sri Lanka to have closure of its tragic civil war.

### Banking on trust: Shaping responsible  AI agenda for Sri Lanka

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to reshape every sector it touches. Yet history reminds us that new technologies are often met with caution and fear as to how they will alter the ways we live, work, and communicate, and by extension, how they impact livelihoods, relationships, quality of life and even our sense of purpose.

And with AI, this sense of caution is certainly warranted. The implications for economies and societies are profound, yet unpredictable. Will it widen the gap between nations, or help close it? What we know from past revolutions is that first movers that are able to effectively navigate emerging risks associated with new technologies gain disproportionate advantages—potentially compressing decades of progress into just a few years.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Wednesday at a Utah college event in an act that drew renewed attention to the threat of political violence across the United States.

The death was announced on social media by Trump, who praised the 31-year-old Kirk, the co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA, as “Great, and even Legendary.”

“No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account.

The suspected shooter has not been arrested, Orem, Utah, Mayor David Young said. A person who was taken into custody by law enforcement at the university where Kirk was speaking was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly.

A small jungle shrine in Block V of Wilpattu National Park, used in the past for a modest annual feast by local fishing communities, fell into disuse during the civil conflict. After the park reopened in 2010, the site grew into a large church complex through illegal construction, clearing of forests, and increased human activity.

Wickremesinghe noted that assaults on government officials, including the foreign minister, reflected a worsening crisis, stressing that women’s rights had been gravely violated and that such events had damaged Nepal’s standing abroad.

### Nepal protests ‘hijacked’, Gen Z claims, as army patrols streets

Nepal’s army has deployed patrols on the streets of the capital Kathmandu, as the Himalayan nation reels from its worst unrest in decades.

Protests against corruption spiralled into arson and violence on Tuesday. The prime minister quit as politicians’ homes were vandalised, and Government buildings and parliament torched. 30 people died and more than 1,000 were injured over two days of violence.

“Gen Z” groups spearheading the protests distanced themselves from the destruction, saying they had been “hijacked” by “opportunists”.

On Wednesday, Kathmandu’s airport reopened and the capital was relatively quiet as most residents obeyed a curfew, but smoke still rose from burning buildings.

The military, which is trying to control a spiralling situation, has invited the Gen Z protesters to engage in peace talks. Student leaders are consolidating a fresh list of demands, one of their representatives told the BBC.

### Trump lobbies EU for 100% tariffs on China and India

Donald Trump has called on the European Union (EU) to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% to force Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials on Tuesday discussing options to increase economic pressure on Russia, a source familiar with the discussions has told the BBC.

Trump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on “day one” of becoming president, is struggling to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv, and Russia’s strikes on Ukraine have intensified.

Separately, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he plans to talk to Putin on a call this week or early next week.

China and India are major buyers of Russian oil, which helps to keep the country’s economy and war machine afloat.

Last month, the US imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, which included a 25% penalty for its transactions with Russia.
