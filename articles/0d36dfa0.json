    "Colombo, Feb 20 (Daily Mirror) - The recent decision by Israeli authorities to terminate the employment of 72,000 Palestinian migrant workers has sparked widespread condemnation and calls for justice from international organizations and human rights advocates.",
    "Israeli officials cited security concerns as the basis for the mass dismissal, which targeted workers primarily employed in construction projects across the country.",
    "However, critics argue that the move represents a blatant act of discrimination and a violation of labour rights.",
    "Organizations such as the Voice of Migrants Network have issued strong statements denouncing Israel's actions, emphasizing the need for fair treatment and equality for all workers, regardless of their nationality.",
    "The Voice of Migrants said that Israel has opened job opportunities for migrant workers from other countries, including Sri Lanka, in a situation where many countries hesitate to send their workers due to Israel's actions being considered unethical.",
    "\"Working people should not be discriminated against in any state, under any circumstances, because they are not parties to this conflict but victims,\" they said in a statement."
