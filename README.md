### Sri Lanka Tourism’s “unsung hero” Renton de Alwis

I was lucky enough to associate with Renton for over two and a half decades. Maybe almost three, I believe. Memory goes back to “De Alwis Advertising Agency” owned by Anandatissa de Alwis, where Renton was driving the agency. I was the Marketing Manager for Elephant Lite Corporation Ltd. (ELCL). Marketing “Laxapana” dry cell batteries and ‘De Alwis’ was our advertising agency. When we launched “Fuji” batteries, as a very young marketing professional, strategic level advice received by visionary leader ‘Renton’ was unmatchable. Input I received for my launch presentation by him made me a different person. Teacher, Advisor, Consultant and dear friend, it is so sad to miss you suddenly and the message was shocking news to me.

### FAO introduces innovative technologies to build resilience in Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with funding from the government of Norway, has taken a significant step toward enhancing resilience and sustainability in Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector by handing over a multi-day fishing boat equipped with advanced cooling technology and a fuel-saving bulbous bow. This initiative promotes the adoption of new technologies to reduce post-harvest losses, lower operational costs, and improve the quality of fish for both local and export markets.

Sri Lanka’s multi-day fishing vessels, essential for deep-sea fishing, especially in the tuna export industry, often rely on ice to preserve fish during long voyages. However, this practice frequently compromises quality, leading to post-harvest losses. The Fish Loss and Waste (FLW) Assessment conducted by FAO in 2022–2023 found an average quality loss of 41.4% in the catch from Sri Lanka’s multi-day fisheries.

### State-hood and survival: Tamils, Palestinians and self-determination

Do Sri Lankan Tamil demands for a separate State or even ‘Eelam’ have the same status and legality within the international system as a Palestinian State?

Ultimately, the relative strengths and legitimacy of Palestinian claims to State-hood vs. Tamil claims to State-hood are based on the balance between the right to self-determination of one group vs. the right to maintain the existing territorial integrity of the other group. An interesting point to note is that in this thought experiment, the Northern Tamils are more analogous to the Jews than to the Palestinians. If this sounds counterintuitive, it is because comparisons of the two projects for State-hood are tenuous, as are attempts to make the rationale for one, a precedent for the other

### Peradeniya University student struggle of 1975-’76 and State suppression

The death of Peradeniya University student W.M. Weerasuriya, who was shot dead by police on 12 November 1976 during a student protest, was the beginning of the end of the then Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Her Government which took office in 1970 was deeply unpopular by then but the killing of Weerasuriya let loose public anger at her and led to the routing of the SLFP-led Government in the 1977 general elections.

Rajasinghe Bandara was a fellow student at the Peradeniya University at the time and decades later he has written about the experience and the State suppression of students in a book released recently on the 1975-1976 student movement.

Bandara who is now domiciled in the UK has written with a sense of personal loss on the authoritarian manner in which the student movement was crushed by the then Government and blood was spilt on the grounds of the University of Peradeniya.

The only way to find out electoral preferences of the state sector employees is to study the way the postal votes were casted during the elections. Prior to 1982, results of postal votes were not available on the website of the Election Commission. Starting from the Presidential Election of 1982 the postal vote preferences were indicated under each district in both Presidential and Parliamentary Elections except for the Presidential Election held in 1999 where the main contestants were Chandrika Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickremesinghe. For this analysis I have considered only the results of the Presidential Elections held from 1982 to 2024 except in 1999.

Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious island nation that has experienced both the triumphs and challenges of diversity. With a population comprised of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, and other ethnic groups, the country’s identity is inherently pluralistic. Ethnic diversity can be a source of strength, providing a rich tapestry of cultures, perspectives, and talents that can drive national development. However, Sri Lanka’s history also reflects the dangers of ethnic division, with conflicts that have significantly hampered progress.
