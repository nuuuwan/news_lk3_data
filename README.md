### NPP victory boosts female representation in Parliament to 9%

*2024-11-22 03:36:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/NPP-victory-boosts-female-representation-in-Parliament-to-9/56-769554) · `en`

In a landmark achievement, Sri Lanka has seen a 75% increase in female representation in Parliament following the recent election, with a total of 22 women now set to serve as Members of Parliament.

This number is just over 9% out of the total MP representation in Parliament, up from the previous 6%. The previous Parliament had just 12 female MPs, but this election has ushered in 21 newly elected female candidates.

Additionally, the National People’s Power (NPP) has appointed Attorney-at-Law Lakmali Hemachandra to one of its 18 National List seats, further boosting the figure to 22.

The number could potentially rise if other political parties, such as the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), decide to allocate one of their National List positions to a female candidate, further enhancing gender representation in the legislature.

MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday attended the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament as the National List appointment of the New Democratic Front (NDF).

Speaking to the media, he affirmed that his appointment via the NDF’s National List was legal, insisting that he was rightfully nominated by the party.

“It is just two members who are making a big fuss over my nomination, not the entire party,” he claimed, commenting on the controversy surrounding his nomination as the NDF National List candidate.

MP Karunanayake argued that as a senior member of the United National Party (UNP) he has sacrificed a lot and underwent many challenges for the betterment of the party. “We cannot sacrifice our party for the benefit of mere 2-3% of people. Those who know, know,” he said.  Karunanayake said once the agreements that were agreed by the parties are released to the public domain, it will answer many of these questions.

### A pile of welcome shifts in the plate tectonics of local politics

Even a cursory glance at the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2024 will amply demonstrate that the earth has well and truly moved under our feet

The super majority that the president enjoys in parliament may well be the silver bullet a nation that was once more than morally bankrupt needs to extricate itself from its present manifold predicaments – endemic/systemic corruption first and foremost among them… IF the endorsement of a subsequent (almost) 6.9 million voters doesn’t turn his head, or the realities of the realpolitik that may become necessary to run the republic cause the ship of state to founder

Politics is the art of the possible. And more often than not, the gradual erosion of the political soil by the dirt and debris of decades makes the seemingly impossible also come to pass.

### ’மக்கள் ஆணைக்கு எதிரான செயல்படும் அரசாங்கம்’

*2024-11-22 01:24:16* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/மக்கள்-ஆணைக்கு-எதிரான-செயல்படும்-அரசாங்கம்/175-347600) · `ta`

கடந்த அரசாங்கத்தின் மக்களை அழுத்தங்களுக்கு ஆளாக்கும் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியத்தின் ஒப்பந்தத்தையே தற்போதைய அரசாங்கமும் முன்னெடுப்பதாக கூறுவதானது மக்கள் ஆணைக்கு எதிரான செயல்பாடாகும் என எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவர் சஜித் பிரேமதாச தெரிவித்தார்.

பாராளுமன்றத்தில் நேற்று வியாழக்கிழமை இடம்பெற்ற ஜனாதிபதியின்  கொள்கை பிரகடன உரைக்குப் பின்னர் ஊடகங்களுக்கு கருத்து தெரிவிக்கும்போதே இவ்வாறு தெரிவித்த அவர் மேலும் கூறுகையில்,

தற்போதைய அரசாங்கம் தேர்தல் மேடைகளில் முன்வைத்த சில விடயங்கள் இன்று பாராளுமன்றத்தில் முன்வைக்கப்பட்ட விடயங்களோடு ஒப்பிடும் போது முரண்பாட்டை காண்பிக்கின்றன. சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியத்துடனான இணக்கப்பாட்டில் இருதரப்பு கடன்கள், பிணை முறிப் பத்திரக் கடன்கள் போன்றவற்றில் முன்வைக்கப்பட்ட விடயங்கள் குறித்து செவிமடுத்த போது ஒருவித அதிர்ச்சிக்கு ஆளானோம். ஏற்கனவே  இணக்கப்பாடு காணப்பட்டிருக்கும் ஒப்பந்தத்தை மாற்றி புதிய ஒப்பந்தத்தை எட்டுவதாக தற்போதைய ஆட்சியாளர்கள் தேர்தல் மேடைகளில் பிரஸ்தாபித்தனர். ஆனால் அரசு தற்போது அதில் இருந்து விலகி செயல்பட்டு வருகிறது. இது பாரதூரமான விடயம்.

### Sri Lanka’s SMEs: Debt-trapped dilemma

*2024-11-22 01:22:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-SMEs-Debt-trapped-dilemma/4-769525) · `en`

A substantial portion of Sri Lankan SMEs, approximately 70%, are currently insolvent or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy

A cornerstone of successful debt recovery lies in preserving the business’s operational viability rather than resorting to liquidation. Many debt restructuring solutions fall short by neglecting the critical aspect of cash flow matching, which is fundamental to servicing debt obligations. By strategically realigning assets based on their utilisation, it is possible to strike a balance between debt recovery and cash generation, fostering a more sustainable recovery process

### Pathway for economic development of Sri Lanka

It appears that FDIs most probably have deliberately avoided investing in SL mainly due to the poor political instability prevailing in the country from about 1956

The path to prosperity of Sri Lanka starts from political stability to enable it to attract mainly FDI as it lacks the capital, skills, technologies and the required international market access to start an export-led strategy of economic development to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty. In this strategy it is important to emphasise on promoting especially the productivity (of the private sector, (which has been described as the ‘the engine of growth’) apart from upgrading the macroeconomic stability of the country and the international market access

🟩

Eran Wickremaratne and Hirunika Premachandra, who worked hard for the United People's Power, lost by a small number of votes. "We are trying to get them a national list," said Harsha de Silva, Colombo district MP.

I am firmly in the position that the National List of the United People's Power should be resolved quickly.Eran Wickremaratne and Hirunika Premachandra, who worked hard for the party, lost by a small number of votes. We are trying to get them a national list seat.

The president's speech has been mentioned many things. The President noted that the project with the Monetary Fund continues to be carried out. This is what we have been saying from the beginning.

The president does not clearly mention his policy declaration on foreign policy. So this is a bit of a matter of observation. He said the government should reveal what kind of foreign policy it is.

### End of Tamil nationalism? Not according to the numbers

*2024-11-22 00:55:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/End-of-Tamil-nationalism-Not-according-to-the-numbers/14-769523) · `en`

An analysis of Sri Lankan election data highlights a collapse of many Government affiliated parties and reveals why Tamil nationalism might be growing – not shrinking

The 2024 Sri Lankan Parliamentary election concluded last week, in which the ruling National People’s Power (NPP) gained a record majority and made headway into the Tamil homeland. There were notable casualties for senior Tamil nationalist politicians and for the first time ever a southern political party managed to gain a majority in all but one district in the north-east. Commentators have since speculated whether the result spells the beginning of the end for Tamil nationalist politics.

Instead, the figures highlight a range of factors, including the fall of other southern Opposition political parties, leftist coalitions and paramilitary groups that allowed the NPP to siphon votes and grow their base amongst those who had already previously voted for pro-state forces.

You have been elected as a new Speaker, not a Member of Parliament before, in the changing political age. We bow down to the judgment of the people who voted to make this change..

🟩

Today is a special day in our Parliament. The authority was handed over to both groups. Our side has empowered the last presidential election. It is important in the history of Sri Lanka.Most MPs have been selected in our country's electoral system. All the provinces and people have contributed to it as the North and East.

Political parties have been formed on the basis of provinces, nationalism and religions for so long. So the separation, doubt and racism were strengthened between people. When racism is strengthened on one side, racism will be strengthened against it. Racism will not be in the same place. We have seen the history of it in our country, politics and society. But we thank all the people who believe in us.

There are people who believe in other parties without trusting us. That is democracy. It is not democratic to create people's activities surrounding a single party.
