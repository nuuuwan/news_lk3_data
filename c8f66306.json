    "\u201cA senior Police officer arrived on the scene soon after and dismissed the matter, stating it was not a serious issue. He then requested that I come with them to the Police station \u2013 the same station that he said the officers involved in the attack were a part of. I was not willing to risk my safety, so I did not go to the Police station and instead demanded that he conduct an inquiry at the site where there were witnesses.\u201d",
    "Ponnambalam explained that two individuals in civilian clothing had arrived on a motorbike to the grounds where he had been addressing a meeting with members of a sports club.",

    "\u201cMy research officer had asked for their identities, at which point one of them informed him that they were CID intelligence officers.",
    "When I heard this being said, I approached the two individuals and asked them to produce their official identification, which they refused to do.",
    "They also insisted that there was no reason for them to show their IDs and that the meeting we were carrying out was illegal.\u201d",
    "He said that after refusing to show their identification, one of the individuals had attempted to flee, prompting him to give chase, but that he had then been assaulted.",
    "\u201cIn the course of that conversation one officer attempted to leave the area. I pursued him and continued to ask him for his identity. When he tried to move away I tried to apprehend him, which was when he began to run.\u201d",
    "The MP said that two Police officers had then arrived and demanded the release of the plain-clothed individuals and went on to aim a pistol at him.",

    "One was in a Police uniform, the other was in Police sports attire. They shouted across the fence saying that those individuals were Police officers and to let them go.",
    "\u201cWhen I said that I needed to see their IDs to ensure who they were because they acted in a suspicious way, the officer in sports uniform across the fence began to shout abuse in foul language, at which point I stopped engaging with them and continued to try and get the identity of the officer that we had managed to apprehend.",
    "The officer concerned resisted identifying himself and the sports club members began to shout, saying that the officer across the fence in the sports uniform had taken out his pistol and was pointing it at me,\u201d Ponnabalam charged."
