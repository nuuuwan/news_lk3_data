    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has raised its world growth forecasts for the year since the June Global Economic Outlook (GEO) on better-than-expected incoming data for 2Q25, but expects world GDP to slow significantly this year, it said.",
    "\u201cThere is now evidence of an underlying US slowdown in \u2018hard\u2019 economic data and positive surprises on eurozone growth have partly reflected US tariff front-running,\u201d the ratings agency said.",
    "Global growth is now forecast to be 2.4 percent in 2025, Fitch said.",
    "This is up 0.2pp since June, but is a \u2018sizeable\u2019 slowdown from 2.9 percent last year and below trend.",
    "China\u2019s forecast has been raised to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent, the eurozone\u2019s to 1.1 percent from 0.8 percent and the US\u2019s to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent.",
    "\u201cThere has been a reduction in uncertainty over US tariff policy after a flurry of announcements.",
    "\u201cOur latest estimate of the average US effective tariff rate (ETR) is 16%, very close to the rate assumed in June.",
    "\u201cMexico and Canada face lower ETRs, due to better USMCA compliance and Europe\u2019s ETR is also slightly lower, but this is offset by higher-than-expected rates for Asia excluding China.\u201d (Colombo/Sep15/2025)"
