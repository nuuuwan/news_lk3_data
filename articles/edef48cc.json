    "The Veyangoda warehouse complex has only issued rice stocks deemed suitable for human consumption by the expert committee appointed by the Gampaha Divisional Health Services Director for distribution in the school meal program, says the Presidential Secretariat.",
    "The committee has provided relevant recommendations relying on analytical reports from the Government Analyst\u2019s Department and the Medical Research Institute, it said issuing a statement.",
    "This comes after the Public Health Inspectors\u2019 Union (PHIU) alleged, earlier today, that the stocks of rice stored in a government warehouse in the Veyangoda area, which was to be used in the meals program for schoolchildren, have been found to be substandard and have become unfit for consumption due to insect damage.",
    "It was reported that the rice stocks in question were set to be used in the school meals program implemented in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), to provide free nutritious lunches for schoolchildren.",
    "However, the Presidential Secretariat\u2019s Partnership Secretariat for WFP Co-operation has issued a special press release clarifying the relevant facts and responding to the allegations.",
    "It said that in order to ensure compliance, all Provincial Chief Secretaries are instructed in writing to mobilize a team that represents the health sector to conduct a thorough re-inspection and retrieval of the rice stock confirmed safe for consumption by multiple institutions from the Veyangoda warehouse complex. Additionally, they are tasked with strategizing to utilize this rice stock before May 01.",
    "As per protocol, prior to distributing the rice stock from the central warehouse to the respective provinces, it is mandatory for the senior officer from the Provincial Department of Education and a Public Health Inspector (PHI) representing the province to ensure its suitability for human consumption.",
    "Only after their official confirmation through signature, the rice stocks are released to the respective provinces, the statement said.",
    "To enhance health safety and food quality for schoolchildren, the directions further emphasize the necessity for the rice supplied by the World Food Program to undergo inspection by the Public Health Inspector and a representative of the School Nutrition Committee before being distributed to school cooks.",
    "Compliant with international food packaging quality standards, this batch of rice is advised to be utilized before May 31.",
    "As the rice has been received as a grant, the packaging is labelled \u201cNot for Sale.\u201d This label does not indicate that the rice is unsuitable for consumption, it added.",
    "Following a comprehensive inspection representing diverse health sector considerations, the World Food Program has confirmed its suitability, the Presidential Secretariat further said."
