    "Due to my deep involvement in the entertainment industry and showbiz, several leading Western musicians in Sri Lanka became my friends from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties. One of those friends was Sohan Weerasinghe, the leader of Sohan & The X\u2019Periments, featuring Estelle and Judy.",
    "In 1991, I received an unexpected call from Sohan. \u201cMr. J, I just recorded a new English song with the band at my studio. It\u2019s called \u2018Whispers in the Sand.\u2019 If I send you the rough mix, would you be willing to share your thoughts?\u201d The request took me by surprise. \u201cSohan, you know I\u2019m not a musician and don\u2019t have any musical training. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to give advice,\u201d I replied. Nevertheless, he sent the rough mix my way.",
    "After listening to the song, Sohan called back to hear my opinion. \u201cSohan, congratulations! \u2018Whispers in the Sand\u2019 is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful English songs ever recorded in Sri Lanka. You should create an equally stunning music video for it. If you\u2019re looking for someone to direct and produce it, I\u2019d be eager to take on the challenge.\u201d Sohan enthusiastically agreed and granted me full creative freedom for the project.",
    "At that time, Sri Lankan music videos were quite basic, typically featuring the singer performing with scenic visuals interspersed. I aspired to do something different\u2014a video with a compelling storyline with professional actors or models. My first bold move was to exclude Sohan from appearing in the video. Although shocked, he respected my creative vision and allowed me to proceed as planned.",
    "I quickly learned how to draft a detailed storyboard, consulting film-makers I knew from my acting days. Willie Blake, an award-winning cinematographer and director\u2014and a close friend\u2014was on holiday in Sri Lanka and staying at Mount Lavinia Hotel. His guidance was invaluable during the planning phase. Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) generously provided the location and sponsored the production, while ITN network supported us with technical resources and a skilled crew.",
    "We dedicated an entire day to shooting and spent a full night in ITN\u2019s editing suite, crafting a music video that would go on to be nominated for the Best Music Video of the Year award in 1992.",
    "During the night I spent with Sohan and the ITN editing team, I was introduced to the art of song composition. I was surprised to learn that Sohan first created the tune for \u2018Whispers in the Sand\u2019, then wrote the lyrics, and finally invited me to craft a story for the video. Initially, I believed the process should unfold in reverse: story \u2013 lyrics \u2013 music. In doing so, created my first song composition \u2013 \u2018Fleeting Moments\u2019 that night.",
    "The song was inspired by a personal experience I had at Bentota Beach Hotel on New Year\u2019s Eve, 1974, when I faced the challenge of having double-booked dance partners \u2013 a Sri Lankan teenage girl and a Swiss teenage girl.",
    "Sohan arranged the music for \u2018Fleeting Moments\u2019 and performed the song, while I wrote the storyboard and directed the video, which was filmed at Mount Lavinia Hotel during the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner dance at the Empire Ballroom. The song quickly became a hit, climbing the charts and inspiring me to write lyrics for five more songs. Each of these songs reached the top of the charts in Sri Lanka, and three were voted by readers of The Island newspaper as the most popular English songs in the country.",
    "A cross section of 20 leading singers (who sang the song: \u2018Fitness Fever\u2019) during the launch of my cassette at the Little Hut Night club in 1993",
    "After producing The Island Music Awards on three occasions, I embarked on my largest production yet. The event, The Show, was staged at Sri Lanka\u2019s largest venue, the BMICH National Convention Centre. At the time, I was also the General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel Catering Services at BMICH. This production marked my final major show in Sri Lanka before I left the country, and I was determined to make it something truly spectacular and unforgettable.",
    "For The Show, I brought my vision to the table and invited input from the musicians on the organizing team. The collaborative process proved to be effective, and most of their suggestions were incorporated. This helped elevate the production to a level far beyond anything I had previously produced in Sri Lanka. I planned the sets and worked with the best set designers in Sri Lanka.",
    "Our team for the show included 153 professionals, ranging from musicians and dancers to choreographers, set designers, sound engineers, lighting experts, special effects specialists, make-up artists, photographers, video recorders, and my trusted stage manager, Kenneth Honter, who was my right-hand man.",
    "We introduced two key features: a complete dress rehearsal at BMICH the day before the performance and a video launch of the show on TV a week later. The show began precisely at 7:00 p.m., with an audience of 1,506 in attendance.",
    "As outlined in my concept document and detailed cue sheet with minute-by-minute steps of the production process, became the team\u2019s map and the compass. The show was divided into two segments, each with contrasting sub-themes. Each segment was supported by distinct music, choreographed dance performances, special effects, lighting, and sound. The production featured two ambitious set changes with groundbreaking special effects, adding an extra layer of excitement to the show\u2019s two contrasting segments.",
    "Sunil Perera congratulating us for winning 1992 Island Music Awards \u2013 \u2018Most Outstanding Showbiz Personality\u2019 and \u2018Entertainer of the Year\u2019 for Sohan, Female Singer of the Year\u2019 for Judy de Silva and \u2018Composer of the Year\u2019 for me (shared with Noeline Honter for our song \u2013 \u2018Nature\u2019).",
    "The first half of the show was themed \u2018Nature\u2019, immersing the audience in a lush, vibrant landscape with waterfalls, towering trees, mist, and 34 young ballerinas performing as butterflies, birds, and blossoming flowers in a rainforest awakening at dawn. A gentle ray of morning sunlight gradually revealed the lead singer of the first song, Noeline, as she became visible to the audience. The scene was slow-moving and misty, with a backdrop of greens and blues, enhanced by soft lighting. It was a delicate and joyful celebration of nature\u2019s beauty.",
    "The second half shifted to \u2018Future\u2019, depicting humankind\u2019s scientific progress through flying rockets, while also highlighting the destructive impact of short-sighted policies, global warming, wars, and societal disruptions. The atmosphere was intense, with explosive sounds and smoke, complemented by a backdrop of red and orange, with flashing lights to heighten the drama.",
    "In one particularly striking scene, a rocket landed on stage, and militants emerged, taking singer Sohan as a prisoner before flying off, leaving the BMICH stage. This scene served as a stark warning about humanity\u2019s selfish disregard for the planet\u2019s well-being.",
    "Together with Noeline and Sohan, I co-wrote two new songs that aligned with the thematic segments of the show (they did most of the work!). The song \u2018Nature\u2019 became a chart-topping hit in Sri Lanka for several weeks. A year later, Noeline and I were jointly honoured with The Island Music Award for \u2018Composer of the Year.\u2019",
    "My next composition, \u2018Am I Guilty?\u2019, became the most popular song I had written. I followed my usual process of \u2018story \u2013 lyrics \u2013 music\u2019, with Sohan as my co-composer and arranger. I selected Darlene Suby for the lead vocals, with Sohan providing supporting vocals. We filmed the music video at Colombo Airport and the Airport Garden Hotel.",
    "The song dominated the pop charts for eight consecutive weeks as Sri Lanka\u2019s most popular English song. At the same time, I composed another song, \u2018Faithful\u2019, which was arranged by Chandralal Fonseka and featured vocals by both Chandralal and Crystal Williams.",
    "My sixth and final song composition, \u2018Fitness Fever\u2019, was by far my most ambitious project. The song featured 20 top Sri Lankan Western musicians in the studio and 16 semi-professional actors in the music video. We filmed it over the course of a day at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel. The song quickly ascended to the top of the pop charts, holding the number one spot for three weeks as Sri Lanka\u2019s most popular English song.",
    "I later produced a cassette titled \u2018Fitness Fever\u2019, which included four of the songs I had composed. All participating singers, actors, and technicians volunteered their time and expertise, and we donated the entire proceeds to Ranaviru Sevana, a charity dedicated to caring for Sri Lanka Army members who are differently abled due to injuries sustained during the country\u2019s separatist war. To launch the cassette, we held a grand event at the Little Hut nightclub at Mount Lavinia Hotel.",
    "As a lifelong learner, I was grateful for the opportunity to action learn directing music videos for TV, composing songs for radio, and producing large-scale shows for stage. While there are many individuals and groups I wish to thank, I would like to extend a special thank you to one community in particular\u2014the Western Musicians of Sri Lanka, whose collaboration made these creative projects possible. To them, I say, \u201cThank you for the music and the friendship!\u201d",
