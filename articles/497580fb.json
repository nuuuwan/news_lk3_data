    "The dollar index (.DXY), opens new tab was 0.3% lower, making gold cheaper for overseas buyers, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury fell to a more than one-month low.",
    "Traders boosted bets the Fed could start cutting interest rates in May to around 30% after the jobs report, although June remained the mostly likely scenario at 80%.",
