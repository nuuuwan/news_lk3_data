    "Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) - Despite an abundance of eggs and chicken in the country, prices have surged due to the inadequate supply to meet the demand, All Island Poultry Association (AIPA) President Ajith Gunasekara said.",
    "Sufficient eggs were available in the market by April 5. By that time the price of an egg was Rs.35 in the local market.",
    "But with the higher demand by April 10 in view of the Muslim festival (Eid al-Fitr) and Sinhala and Tamil New Year, the producers were unable to provide the sufficient requirements.",
    "He said the price of an egg was between Rs.40 and Rs.45, but now an egg is being sold at a price between Rs.50 to Rs.60."
