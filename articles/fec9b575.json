    "Sri Lanka is set to host the 53rd International Seminar on Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention (ISCEP) from 13 to 24 October 2024 in Colombo.",
    "Co-hosted by RemediumOne and the University of Kelaniya, this prestigious 10 day seminar will gather 36 global fellows and 10 internationally recognised experts in cardiovascular research and prevention, offering an immersive learning experience aimed at combating the global burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).",
    "RemediumOne, a pioneering clinical research organisation in Sri Lanka, and the University of Kelaniya bring their extensive expertise in cardiovascular research to the forefront of this global event. RemediumOne has contributed to international studies in heart disease and stroke, while also championing decentralised clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hosting ISCEP 2024 strengthens their commitment to advancing cardiovascular research, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).",
    "The seminar will offer participants hands-on training in epidemiological methods and prevention strategies, focusing on cutting-edge research methodologies and collaboration. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with global leaders in the field, including experts from the United Kingdom, India, Canada, the USA, Portugal, and Sri Lanka.",
    "ISCEP 2024 holds particular relevance for Sri Lanka, where cardiovascular diseases account for over 40% of all deaths. The seminar aligns with national priorities to combat non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and strengthens the local healthcare and research ecosystem. It also highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s growing role as a hub for global health research and its strategic importance in South Asia.",
    "Additionally, this event will offer Sri Lankan scientists invaluable opportunities for skill development, networking, and collaboration with international experts, further enhancing the country\u2019s research capacity. The presence of world-class faculty will not only benefit local talent but also contribute to advancing the country\u2019s public health infrastructure.",
    "The core mission of ISCEP is to promote global collaboration and equip healthcare professionals with the tools needed to prevent and manage CVDs. The seminar, supported by the World Heart Federation, has trained over 1,600 experts from more than 100 nations since its inception in 1968. This year\u2019s event will continue this legacy, focusing on innovative solutions to cardiovascular challenges faced by LMICs. By hosting ISCEP 2024, Sri Lanka reinforces its position on the global health map, paving the way for future collaborations and international conferences."
