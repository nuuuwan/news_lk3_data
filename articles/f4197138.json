  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says Govt. should have consulted civil society groups before abolishing the NPC, it would have shown respect",
    "Highlights work carried out by NMSJ to bring about NPC and says it is merely an attempt to highlight importance and not challenge Govt.\u2019s decision",
    "Claims if Govt. wishes to pursue any shared goals that serve the public interest it is ready to provide its full support",
    "The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) led by former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has said the Government should have consulted the organisation before abolishing the National People\u2019s Council proposed by it which was intended to function as a participatory democratic model promoting active public involvement. Following the election of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a decision was also taken by the Cabinet to dismantle the National People\u2019s Council Secretariat set up to implement the concept which had been allocated Rs. 700 million through the last Budget.",
    "In a statement this week, the NMSJ said consulting with the organisation and others during the decision-making process would have shown respect for the civil society groups working for the country\u2019s greater good.",
    "However, the NMSJ said if the current Government wishes to pursue any shared goals in any form that serves the public interest, the NMSJ is ready to provide its full support, regardless of the name given to the initiative.",
    "The organisation also provided a detailed justification for the setting up of the National People\u2019s Council Secretariat to implement the concept, a passion project of NMSJ\u2019s chairperson Karu Jayasuriya highlighting its importance.",
    "\u201cIt drew inspiration from the Panchayat system introduced by Mahatma Gandhi, which remains part of India\u2019s Constitution. We adapted it specifically for Sri Lanka, aiming to create a democratic, voluntary organisational structure that would allow peripheral communities to participate in decision-making processes at the village level,\u201d the NMSJ said. It noted the work it had put in to study historical examples like the ancient Village Council system, the modern Local Government structure, and successful initiatives like the Jana Sabha in countries such as India.",
    "However, it also added that the statement issued by the NMSJ is not intended to challenge the Government\u2019s decision and is merely to highlight the importance of the concept."
