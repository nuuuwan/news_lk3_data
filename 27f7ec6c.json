    "Underlying causes of the crisis in Sri Lanka require commitment from the government and the Sri Lankan people",
    "Sri Lanka has made progress in some areas regarding reconciliation and implementation of the UNHRC resolution.",
    "There are still significant challenges in the human rights situation in the country",
    "Ahead of the closure of the Norwegian Embassy in Colombo,\u00a0 Ambassador Trine J\u00f8ranli Eskedal takes questions from Daily Mirror on the reason for it and the future of bilateral relations in the absence of a resident mission in Colombo. Norway started its mission in Colombo in 1996 given its role in Sri Lanka\u2019s peace and reconciliation process.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is the reason for Norway to close down its mission in Sri Lanka in its move to rationalize its foreign missions?",
    "In September last year, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in\u00a0 Oslo decided to make certain changes in its diplomatic presence abroad.\u00a0 These changes included closing several missions across the world,\u00a0 including our Embassy in Colombo.",
    "The background for this difficult decision is the need to\u00a0 shift our diplomatic resources abroad. To uphold Norwegian interests, we\u00a0 see the need to scale up our presence in some locations, particularly\u00a0 in Europe. Due to budgetary constraints, this also entails drawdowns in\u00a0 other places. In this situation, it has become clear that it will not be\u00a0 possible to maintain a permanent mission in Colombo.",
    "As I\u2019ve mentioned elsewhere, I would like to reiterate that\u00a0 the closing of the Embassy in Colombo is not an expression of\u00a0 dissatisfaction on any matter and is based purely on overall\u00a0 administrative assessments related to the need for reallocation of the\u00a0 Foreign Service\u2019s resources. Norway values the strong ties that exist\u00a0 between our two countries and wishes to maintain our excellent bilateral\u00a0 relationship. Relations as longstanding as ours involve extensive\u00a0 informal cooperation, people-to-people ties and a wide range of\u00a0 activities. Our aim is for the excellent ties between our two countries\u00a0 to continue.",
    "Norway intends to accredit the Head of Mission and assign\u00a0 diplomatic staff at the Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi to Sri Lanka to\u00a0 ensure the continuation of the amiable and long-standing bilateral\u00a0 diplomatic relations. An Honorary Consul-General for Norway based in\u00a0 Colombo will also be announced in due course.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does this mean for Norway\u2019s relationship with Sri Lanka?",
    "Norway has a long-standing and excellent relationship with\u00a0 Sri Lanka. We continue to work to preserve the good relationship going\u00a0 forward, even without a constant presence in Colombo.\u00a0 Historically, an important part of the rationale for our\u00a0 Embassy in Colombo was linked to our role in the peace and\u00a0 reconciliation process. Today, Norwegian involvement in Sri Lanka is more\u00a0 limited.",
    "The closing of the Embassy does not imply that Norway will\u00a0 stop engaging in developments in Sri Lanka. Our countries have strong\u00a0 people-to-people links, many Norwegians visit Sri Lanka for tourism and\u00a0 there is deep concern and interest among the Norwegian population for\u00a0 the welfare of the Sri Lankan people. It is an important aim for the\u00a0 Norwegian government to maintain the relationship through other\u00a0 diplomatic means than a locally based embassy.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does it mean for development assistance to Sri Lanka?",
    "The closure of the Embassy in Colombo only concerns\u00a0 Norway\u2019s physical presence in Colombo. It is not a decision about the\u00a0 future of our bilateral development cooperation as such. Norwegian aid\u00a0 to Sri Lanka, which goes back to the 1960s, has gradually reduced in\u00a0 recent times, as Sri Lanka transitioned to middle-income country status.",
    "However, Norway still supports a range of ongoing,\u00a0 long-term development projects, such as support for employment and food\u00a0 security in former war-affected areas (through the ILO) and support to\u00a0 UNDP\u2019s governance programme to realize SDG 16. A decision has already\u00a0 been made to transfer one cooperation project to Norad, for\u00a0 administration there under Norad\u2019s Fish for Development programme. For\u00a0 the rest of the cooperation programme, an assessment will be made in\u00a0 future.",
    "In 2021, total Norwegian development assistance to Sri\u00a0 Lanka was NOK 59.7 million, of which NOK 21 million was channelled\u00a0 through the Embassy. In 2022, during Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, Norway\u00a0 provided humanitarian support amounting to a total of NOK 18 million to\u00a0 the humanitarian response in Sri Lanka through UN organizations (NOK 13\u00a0 million through the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF (United Nations\u00a0 Children\u2019s Fund) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and approx.\u00a0 NOK 5 million via the UN\u2019s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).",
    "It is of course possible to continue development\u00a0 cooperation with Sri Lanka even without a locally based embassy. In\u00a0 other countries, such as Guatemala and Zimbabwe, Norway has maintained\u00a0 significant aid cooperation even though our physical presence in those\u00a0 countries has ended.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How will Norway help Sri Lanka to overcome the economic crisis?",
    "We recognize that Sri Lanka currently finds itself in an\u00a0 exceptionally difficult situation, given the economic crisis, the\u00a0 humanitarian needs, and the change of government last year. One way in\u00a0 which Norway will help Sri Lanka is through the continuation of\u00a0 development cooperation with Sri Lanka. The same applies to the\u00a0 possibility of contributing humanitarian support in the future. Despite\u00a0 the decision to close the Embassy, Norway will continue to engage in the\u00a0 development of Sri Lanka.",
    "However, it is also pertinent to mention that the\u00a0 underlying causes of the crisis in Sri Lanka require commitment from the\u00a0 government and the Sri Lankan people, and also multilateral solutions\u00a0 and cooperation. The international community is working together to\u00a0 contribute to support the Sri Lankan authorities in finding a way\u00a0 forward. Norway will continue to follow the situation and engage in\u00a0 constructive processes that contribute to sustainable solutions for Sri\u00a0 Lanka.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is the latest focus of Norway - Sri Lanka bilateral ties?",
    "As I mentioned earlier, in addition to development\u00a0 cooperation which went back to the 1960s, historically, an important\u00a0 part of the rationale for our Embassy in Colombo was linked to our role\u00a0 in the peace and reconciliation process.",
    "However, the pillars of our commitment to Sri Lanka will\u00a0 not change and these continue to be our focus in Norway-Sri Lanka\u00a0 bilateral ties. These pillars include a commitment to human rights,\u00a0 including the issues of reconciliation, accountability, transitional\u00a0 justice, and the inclusion of minorities, after the civil war in Sri\u00a0 Lanka. We will continue to follow up on these issues, including through\u00a0 the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is your assessment of Sri Lanka\u2019s achievements on\u00a0 the ground as far as reconciliation is concerned and the implementation\u00a0 of the UNHRC resolution?",
    "While Sri Lanka has made progress in some areas regarding\u00a0 reconciliation and the implementation of the UNHRC resolution, there are\u00a0 still significant challenges in the human rights situation in the\u00a0 country. Norwegian authorities will continue to follow the situation in\u00a0 Sri Lanka, including how the country\u2019s authorities follow up on the\u00a0 resolutions adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.",
    "At the next meeting of the Human Rights Council, there will\u00a0 be a report presented on the implementation of the resolution on the\u00a0 situation in Sri Lanka. As before, Norway will engage actively on the\u00a0 issue, in close consultation with like-minded countries. An important\u00a0 pillar of Norway\u2019s engagement in Sri Lanka is human rights. This\u00a0 commitment to the human rights agenda will continue even without an\u00a0 embassy located in Colombo.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How do you recommend Sri Lanka as a tourist destination?",
    "Having lived in Sri Lanka for the past four years, I have\u00a0 had the opportunity to travel extensively in Sri Lanka. Your country is\u00a0 unique - beautiful with a wide array of attractions from beaches to\u00a0 nature, wildlife, cultural attractions and more. There is something for\u00a0 everyone. We have always been encouraging Norwegians to visit Sri Lanka,\u00a0 and we are pleased to see that the tourist arrival figures have\u00a0 increased in recent months. There are also some Norwegian businesses\u00a0 involved in the tourism sector in Sri Lanka.",
    "Q\u00a0 \u00a0Norway is a country with expertise in green energy. Will you encourage investments in Sri Lanka in this field?",
    "Yes. Norway has actively promoted green energy-related\u00a0 investments in Sri Lanka, as there is great potential here. We believe\u00a0 that renewable energy is part of the answer to the key challenges faced\u00a0 by Sri Lanka in terms of climate change and economic dependence on oil,\u00a0 gas and coal imports.",
    "Norwegian Development Fund (Norfund) has recently made\u00a0 their first investment of USD 4 million in renewable energy in Sri Lanka\u00a0 together with the French company Volta and the Sri Lanka partner Gaia\u00a0 Greenenergy Group. The plan is to accelerate the construction of solar\u00a0 power plants, developed and installed on the roofs of Sri Lankan\u00a0 schools. The investment is made from the new Norwegian Climate\u00a0 Investment Fund that was set up last year to be managed by Norfund. Sri\u00a0 Lanka is one of eight prioritized countries for the new fund. Other\u00a0 Norwegian private sector investors have also shown an interest in\u00a0 investing in green energy projects in Sri Lanka, and the current reforms\u00a0 in the sector are promising for this.",
    "On the other hand, there is also ongoing university\u00a0 cooperation between the University of Western Norway and the University\u00a0 of Jaffna on renewable energy. As part of this cooperation, the Embassy\u00a0 in Colombo helped to set up a lab at the university and opened the first\u00a0 floating solar plant in Sri Lanka. The Embassy in New Delhi will\u00a0 continue to encourage investments and help to scale up activities in Sri\u00a0 Lanka in this field."
