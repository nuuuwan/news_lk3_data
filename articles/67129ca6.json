    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The government\u2019s decision to allow cannabis cultivation in an export processing zone in Mirigama, close to Colombo, was not a good plan, an opposition legislator has said.",
    "\u201cI personally don\u2019t oppose plans to cultivate cannabis [kan-sa]; if it brings investments into the country, suits the export economy, and you can forget what you said in the past, it is ok [ka-mak ne-he],\u201d Nalin Bandara told parliament.",
    "\u201cBut Mirigama land is not suited for this [ko-heth-ma su-du-su ne-he].\u201d",
    "\u201cThe land you have identified for the purpose in the Mirigama zone shouldn\u2019t be given for kansa cultivation; it\u2019s infrastructure facilities should be developed and it should be given for other investments targeting export goals.",
    "\u201cKansa should be grown in areas well known for its cultivation; Wellawaya, Pahala Uva.\u201d",
    "Lands in export zones closer to Colombo like Mirigama, Biyagama, Katunayake, Koggala, and Malwathu Hiripitiya are short of land to offer other investors, he said.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t have lands in zones around Colombo left to give investors.\u201d",
    "\u201cAlthough there is land available in the Bingiriya zone, which I was part of, investors want lands closer to Colombo.\u201d",
    "About 99 percent of land in the Mirigama zone was already given to investors, Bandara said. (Colombo/Aug21/2025)"
