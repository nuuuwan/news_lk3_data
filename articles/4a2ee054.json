    "Former Foreign Affairs and Justice Minister Mohamed Ali Sabry PC said the arrest of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as predicted by a YouTuber, was a troubling development.",
    "\u201cSuch actions reflect a disturbing trend of vindictive and destructive politics which undermines our institutions and our future. This cycle of hatred and retribution must end. Sri Lanka deserves a politics of reason, stability, and gratitude to those who have time and again safeguarded our nation,\u201d Ali Sabry said in a statement.",
    "He added that Wickremesinghe had been instrumental in stabilising the country during three major crises. \u201cIn 1993 following the assassination of President R. Premadasa, he ensured continuity of governance and prevented the country from descending into anarchy. In 2000, when the nation faced its first recession, he restored growth and stability. In 2022, at the height of the worst economic crisis in our history, he assumed leadership and steered Sri Lanka back from the brink of collapse.\u201d",
    "Against this backdrop, his arrest as predicted by a YouTuber is deeply troubling, Ali Sabry said."
