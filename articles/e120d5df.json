    "Local and international experts to share insights on \u201cLaw in the 21st Century: Exploring New Frontiers\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka Law College (SLLC) will hold its first ever International Research Conference (IRC) titled \u201cLaw in the 21st Century: Exploring New Frontiers,\u201d from 28 to 29 November at the BMICH.",
    "The two-day academic conference sets the stage for legal academics, researchers and practitioners from Sri Lanka and overseas to share insights, challenge assumptions and sail into the uncharted waters of legal practice in this dynamic and ever-fluid world we call home.",
    "The conference will follow the standard format of an IRC which comprises keynote speeches, panel discussions and sessions for presentation of research-based papers which will focus on various aspects of law, giving the participants a plethora of choice.",
    "Delving into the importance of this conference, a common misconception regarding law in Sri Lanka is that it is a very stereotypical tree, the kind often found in a children\u2019s colouring book, monotonously branched out into Civil Law, Criminal Law and Commercial Law. This might have been the case a century ago. However, with the advent of globalisation alongside rapid technological and societal development, the legal tree itself has sprouted deeper roots and grown more branches which bear leaves of various colours. A core aim of the IRC is to critically analyse, comprehensively appreciate and spread awareness about the developments in domestic and international legal systems.",
    "To elaborate on this variety, the sessions at the conference will comprise of such topics as Construction Law, Maritime Law, Air and Space Law, Child Rights and Gender Justice Laws, Alternative Dispute Resolution, Sports Law, Entertainment Law, IT and Cyber Law and Investment Law alongside many more interesting and novel fields of law! Any individual interested in finding out the specific areas of law and the respective keynote speakers, is merely required to visit the \u201cProgram\u201d page of the website that Sri Lanka Law College has tailor-made for this research conference. The website can be found at, https://sllcirc.com/conference/.",
    "One of the most favourable aspects of this conference is that it is accessible to both legal and non-legal professionals. Given the projection of Sri Lanka as a commercial hub of Asia, which is substantiated by the immense potential held by the Colombo Port City, a multi-services special economic zone located in Colombo, it is vital for all professionals within the paradise island to be familiar with the latest developments in the legal sector, both at home and abroad, which would no doubt be beneficial in channelling the foreign collaborations and investments which Sri Lanka greatly looks forward to in the current context. Those participating will also have the opportunity to interact with legal luminaries from around the globe and immerse themselves in novel legal research.",
    "Those interested in participating are encouraged to register without delay, as limited slots are available and registrations close soon. For the relevant registration form, fee structure and further details, those interested can visit the \u201cRegistration\u201d tab on the website, which will take you to the Google Form which contains a hyperlink to the Registration Fee Document. The Google Form can be found at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7sItDpxc3EvBZlYARhXB43WFt31mIuVv16GIjJG91aI3Bew/viewform.",
    "The inaugural IRC, being the most ambitious new venture, promises an array of new information which will be delivered by only the very best in the respective fields including present and former Justices of the Supreme Court, several professors of law, PhD holders in law, international and local legal experts and legal practitioners, and non-legal professionals.",
    "The motto of Sri Lanka Law College is \u201cFiat Justitia\u201d, which is translated into English as \u201cLet Justice Be Done\u201d, and the IRC in itself will assist in justice being done in the legal disputes of the present and the future, which are guaranteed to only get more complex and technical overtime."
