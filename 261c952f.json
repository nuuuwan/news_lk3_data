    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Trade Minister Nalin Fernando has placed wheat flour on a \u2018specified goods\u2019 list of the Consumer Affairs Authority by a gazette notice.",
    "The CAA is the agency that usually impose price controls and trigger shortages and black markets in essential foods and other items.",
    "Wheat flour has been put on the \u2018specified goods\u2019 list because it is deemed essential for the lives of the general public, Fernando said in the gazette notice.",
    "Liquefied petroleum gas has been dropped. Price controls on LP Gas triggered losses in Sri Lanka\u2019s Laugfs Gas and undermined its balance sheet.",
    "The CAA has previously triggered shortages in eggs, tinned fish, dhal and sugar with price controls.",
    "There is now a shortage of eggs in the market after the CAA price controls drove farmers to kill layer chicken for meat.",
    "The collapsing demand for layer day old chicks then made hatcheries cull parent birds.",
    "Sri Lanka is now importing eggs. Report said hatching eggs will also be imported to boost chick production. (Colombo/June19/2023)"
