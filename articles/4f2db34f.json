    "Kevin Elias has been a musician for many years now, but, I guess, not many music lovers in the scene here would remember Kevin as he left for Switzerland in 1988.",
    "He is now based in Germany and is quite active in the scene there \u2026 as a solo artiste, also as a duo and trio, depending on the occasion.",
    "Right now he is doing the duo scene with former Moonstones\u2019 guitarist Anura Herat.",
    "In the past, he had a four-piece band, but the pandemic changed everything.",
    "Hotels and entertainment venues made drastic cuts, where payments to musicians were concerned, with most venues opting for duos, said Kevin, adding that quite a few nightspots, in Germany, have also put up shutters.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m lucky I have work at hotels, and I also perform on a cruise ship, singing German, Spanish, Italian and English songs. I do a show \u2013 let\u2019s say a very entertaining performance!\u201d",
    "In Sri Lanka, Kevin performed with several bands, including Super Pink & Purple and Climax, and had his own band, as well \u2013 Zodiac.",
