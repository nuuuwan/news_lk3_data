    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s primary dealers are making excessive use of the central bank\u2019s standing facilities to fund their government securities portfolios though they have been cut off from liquidity auctions, an International Monetary Fund report said.",
    "\u201cNon-bank primary dealers for government LKR debt have access to standing facilities and routinely use Standing Lending Facility (SLF) to fund their portfolios,\u201d the report said.",
    "\u201cThe share of non-bank primary dealers in SLF accounts for about 46 percent or about 76 bn LKR as of end-April 2023,\u201d",
    "\u201cCentral Bank of Sri Lanka should start phasing out the use monetary instruments to support LKR bond market development.",
    "\u201cMonetary policy instruments should therefore not be made available to non-bank primary dealers to support their activity in LKR bond market.\u201d",
    "Primary dealers are already cut off from open market operation auctions.",
    "Central banks of low inflation countries (with floating exchange rates, including the US) provide liquidity facilities to dealers.",
    "The use of central bank standing facilities should only be used to clear transactions on a single day and are not expected to be used for days or weeks on end, analysts say.",
    "Ideally any such borrowings should be cleared before the next auction by selling the securities to real investors.",
    "In Sri Lanka due to the peculiar way Treasury bills are sold, including mandatory dumping of Treasuries on dealers in subsequent stages after the initial auction, dealers have no money to pay for them.",
    "In a reserve collecting central bank, it is irrelevant whether inflationary open market operations provide money to banks, bank primary dealers, or non-bank primary dealers or the government directly.",
    "The balance of payments will go into deficit and the government will lose the ability to repay maturing debt regardless to which counterparty liquidity is injected to mis-target rates.",
    "In the case of private credit being re-financed through the open market operations, imports may be generated faster than through financing the government, since most government expenses are domestic in nature. The BOP deficit may come in a second round, as the money is loaned out to private customers who invest it in buildings or other investments.",
    "Banks which get central bank credit directly from open market operations also lend to customers without deposits, triggering external imbalance, currency depreciation, exporter holdback, importer early covering, leading a spike in domestic credit and more injections.",
    "The IMF report did not say \u2018Monetary policy instruments should therefore not be made available to banks support their loans in thed credit market\u201d.",
    "Term OMO re-financing, or rolled over overnight operations are no different to rural credit re-financing that brought discredited free trade agenda\u2019s of Dudley Senanayake and J R Jayewardane of private credit, analysts say.",
    "State-owned banks have traditionally been the worst users of such facilities, while top private banks sparingly usee such facilities, before the last crisis and foreign banks maintain excess rupee reserves, not contributing to currency crises or BOP deficits at all.",
    "State banks have used the largest volume of central bank credit from multiple facilities, showing the extent to which they contributed to the economic crisis, according to the IMF report.",
    "However the data 2023 data is the residual remaining facilities, which did their damage in 2022 as lost foreign reserves or was absorbed into an expansion of reserve money as the currency collapsed.",
    "In 2023 the the central bank had started deflationary policy and the BOP was in surplus, and term and outright facilities were slowly going down.",
    "Foreign banks were net depositors of cash in the central bank. In this crisis, some foreign banks deposited more cash than normal as they sharply cut lending in the interbank market to other commercial banks.",
    "If there was no policy rate, or there was a widely corridor and call money rates were not narrowly targeted, excess rupee reserves deposited in a hard pegged monetary authority lead to an automatic rise in foreign reserves as it did before the central bank was set up in 1950.",
    "Before 1950 any government deposits in the monetary authority also led to a rise in foreign reserves, and a drawdown led to a fall. It still happens in stable areas like Hong Kong, where currencies cannot depreciate.",
    "When a soft-pegged central bank (a central bank which creates chronic forex shortages and depreciation due to an already flawed operating framework and imposes exchange controls) injects money deeming there is a \u2018structural shortage\u2019 (usually after intervening in forex markets), it leads to a permanent loss of foreign reserves.",
    "There can a \u2018structural shortage\u2019 of liquidity due to a rise in inflation or a collapse of the currency, which push up prices requiring a larger reserve money.",
    "Any new money banks get by selling Treasury bills  outright to the central bank will also re-finance longer domestic credit and lead to depreciation (or a permanent loss of reserves if the peg is defended against the new money).",
    "One advantage of allowing primary dealers to access auctions, however is that market credit conditions are quickly communicated via the reverse repo auction rates and it leads to market rates rising faster towards the policy ceiling, warding off any currency pressure early when interventions are made in the forex market.",
    "High bid rates by primary dealers, can also signal the need to raise the ceiling policy rate in a reserve collecting central bank to stop the erosion of reserves and prevent depreciation.",
    "Balance of payments troubles started to emerge in Western nations after the Federal Reserve invented the policy rate and open market operations in the 1920s.",
    "Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, GCC nations and lately Cambodia have avoided currency depreciation, severe banking crises, social unrest and political upheavals by not having a policy rate. (Colombo/Sept28/2024)"
