  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), endemic to the island and with fewer than 1,000 mature individuals remaining in the wild, faces a precarious future as it struggles against habitat loss, prey depletion, snares, and retaliation killings.",
    "As a keystone species and a vital contributor to Sri Lanka\u2019s ecosystems, eco-tourism, and national economy, its survival is of immense importance. However, human-leopard conflict continues to pose one of the greatest threats, with predation on unattended livestock and pets often leading to retaliatory killings, an instinctive act of protection by rural communities, but one that tragically diminishes the nation\u2019s most iconic wildlife.",
    "To break this cycle, LOLC Holdings, together with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka\u2019s Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) and the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka (WNPS), under the guidance of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, has introduced a pioneering Livestock Insurance Scheme through LOLC General Insurance.",
    "This first-of-its-kind initiative provides financial compensation to farmers who lose livestock to leopard predation, eliminating the need for revenge killings and offering a practical, sustainable solution for coexistence. The pilot project will be rolled out in Hingurakgoda, Sigiriya, Minneriya, and Dambulla, targeting cattle farmers with herds of 100 or fewer. Verified predation cases will qualify for insurance claims, ensuring timely relief while safeguarding the leopard\u2019s future.",
    "Speaking at the launch held in August 2025, which was graced by representatives of LOLC Holdings, the Department of Wildlife Conservation, WNPS, and UNDP BIOFIN, Mr. Kithsiri Gunawardena, Chief Operating Officer of LOLC Holdings PLC, shared his thoughts,",
    "\u201cProtecting our biodiversity is as vital as advancing livelihoods. As Sri Lanka progresses, it is imperative that we strike a careful balance between development and conservation. This insurance scheme goes beyond supporting farmers, it represents a commitment to securing the long-term survival of our apex predator, a true national treasure. The responsibility rests with all of us individuals, organizations, and the nation as a whole to preserve our wilderness and safeguard it for generations yet to come.\u201d",
