But at one point, Tamanna's chances began to decline after the arrival of the new heroes. Now Bollywood film opportunities have begun to come to him. Bollywood has played next Garda and Last Storms 2. In both of these films he played kisses and bedroom scenes. In the meantime, he has separated from a short love with Bollywood actor Vijay Verma.

Tamanna, who is now single, has spoken about Kalyanam. In it, I want to be the best life companion to the one who is going to marry. He must think that I have got him in this way because of his honor.  I am now working for that lucky. I don't know who is giving. ”

### Trump heads for historic second UK state visit

Donald Trump will get the red carpet treatment this week on an unprecedented second United Kingdom state visit, as Britain counts on royal pomp and circumstance to woo the unpredictable United States president.

From a flyby and carriage ride with King Charles III to a grand state banquet at historic Windsor Castle, Britain is pulling out all the stops to flatter Trump, who has long been fascinated with the monarchy.

The aim is to keep Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Trump’s good side when they meet at the British leader’s country residence for talks centred on trade, tariffs and the Ukraine war.

Trump will also be kept far away from crowds and protesters, with all the action taking place outside London, where a large demonstration against the 79-year-old Republican is set to take place.

Labour leader Starmer is not a natural bedfellow for right-wing firebrand Trump, but he has worked hard to win him over since the US president returned to the White House in January.

### Sri Lanka central bank buys US$781mn less to August 2025 than last year

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank bought 142.5 million US dollars from commercial banks in August 2025, taking the total so far this year to 1,238.6 million US dollars so far this year, official data show.

In 2024, the central bank bought 2020.4 million US dollars in the same period with stronger deflationary policy and lower private credit.

In late 2024 the central bank re-started inflationary policy through aggressive open market operations to mis-target the interbank rate, as private credit picked up, leading to sharply reduced collections in November and December.

However, in 2025, there was no inflationary policy per se, other than dollar-rupee buy-sell swaps. Dollar purchases were also unsterilized under the latest phase of the IMF program no longer requiring a sell down of CB held g-secs, which analysts say is a mistake.
