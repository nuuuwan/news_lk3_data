### Sri Lanka central bank net foreign reserves just above zero

*2024-12-04 07:28:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-net-foreign-reserves-just-above-zero-191861/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka net foreign assets moved to positive territory in October 2024, with about 63 million dollars over its reserve related liabilities, official data shows, after two years of deflationary policy with interest rates to match.

Sri Lanka’s central bank’s reserves became negative by 4.6 billion after rate cuts were enforced by inflationary direct and open market operations.

The central bank also borrowed reserves through swaps, and also busted a special drawing rights allocation (a type ‘reserve’ created by the International Monetary Fund) in the course of mistargeting rates through a policy rate which ended in a sovereign default.

A ‘transmission mechanism’ then spreads the mis-targeted rates along the yield curve.

When reserves were hitting negative territory during the last currency crisis, the central bank already had loans from the International Monetary Fund taken during currency crises triggered by earlier rate cuts.

VAT payments in the construction industry work in strange and sometimes unfair ways

Some Inland Revenue Department (IRD) officers have misunderstood that contractors’ bills have been settled as per their satisfaction. This is a myth, because although a portion of contractors’ dues have been paid by previous Governments, these bills have been stagnant for two or three years. By that time, bank interests have eaten up all of their profits and have pushed them towards great losses. Further, many bills remain uncertified and these have not been settled for contractors. In such a context, some IRD officers have quoted statements regarding the settlement of these old dues to pursue contractors for tax payments within unreasonable time periods.

Arugam Bay is no Gaza, thankfully, but Chabad-Lubavitch members are bringing Gaza into Arugam Bay – just as Maccabi Tel Aviv fans brought Gaza into Amsterdam

They are back, creeping of the woodwork. The gathering outside Colombo’s main railway station was mercifully small, just the mandatory monk and a handful of civilians. Having offered flowers to a statue of the Buddha, they proceeded to violate his teachings by trying to ignite an ethno-religious fire. Their target was the welcome decision by the NPP/JVP Government to release some of the military-occupied land in the north to their original owners.

The monk accused President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of being a diaspora agent trying to rejuvenate the Tigers and start the next Eelam War. Madubhashana Prabath, the secretary of Sinhala Ravaya, called the new president King Elara of Tambuttegama and promised to struggle till the ‘last drop of blood’ to ‘save the nation’.
