    "The Secretary to the President issues an unprecedentedly haughty 11-page edict, regulating/restricting the interface of the diplomatic and donor community including UN agencies with national leaders, local authorities and institutions-- with a Ministerial division playing Cerberus.",
    "An \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019 is beginning to fall. It has nothing to do with leftism, except as a caricature. The System is being reconfigured so it is impermeable and impervious to universal norms, international interactions and critical national thinking.",
    "The BBC noticed the U-turn and informed its global audience.",
    "\u2018\u2026The IMF deal became controversial as it led to severe austerity measures, tax rises and cuts in energy subsidies - hitting common people hard.",
    "During the campaign Dissanayake and his alliance promised that they would re-negotiate parts of the IMF agreement.",

    "\u201cThis is not the time to discuss if the terms [of the IMF loan] are good or bad, if the agreement is favourable to us or not... The process had taken about two years, and we cannot start all over again.\u201d\u2026\u2019 (https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevgl3gdnrjo)",
    "President AKD reiterated this in his economic policy address in the New Year, kicking-off his Clean Sri Lanka program.",
    "\u201c\u2026Over the past year, we achieved some stability on the surface level of the economy and officially emerged from bankruptcy in the latter half of the year. This progress is owed to the immense efforts of officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the political leadership\u2026\u201d (https://www.ft.lk/top-story/President-promises-new-economic-policy-framework/26-771307)",
    "If \u201cthis is not the time\u201d to discuss whether the IMF agreement is good or bad, favourable or not, and must be continued unaltered since it has already taken two years; if \u201cthis progress is owed to the immense efforts of officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the political leadership\u201d\u2014 the political leadership being Ranil Wickremesinghe--when exactly did this \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 dawn on AKD?",
    "Why did he say the opposite during the \u201ctwo years\u201d the process took, including \u201cover the past year\u201d of stabilisation, in his manifesto and election speeches in September and November?",
    "He was given a mandate to do what he and the NPP said at the time. He\u2019s blithely doing the exact opposite now on the biggest issues. It is a betrayal of the mandate the people gave him and the NPP, and a transgression of the Social Contract.",
    "Any half-way progressive President and Government would have embarked on a threefold strategy:",
    "President AKD and the NPP Cabinet did none of this. Instead, he appointed the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce as negotiator and rushed to sign the debt restructuring/repayment deal that the neoliberal Ranil Wickremesinghe presidency had agreed to.",
    "AKD\u2019s sellout on sovereign debt will certainly \u2018clean out Sri Lanka\u2019 starting 2025, not 2028, as Dhanusha Pathirana explains. (https://youtu.be/7_ukDK1SzEQ?si=d1ObUJNzJFrJ7CUf)",
    "Anura leads a party which calls itself Marxist, but he is no longer a Marxist of any sort, which is bad news because he has thrown overboard the key insights of Marxism as a contribution to social science which every world-renowned economist has taken on board certainly since the 2008 Crash. I refer to \u201cthe economic structure of society\u201d as \u201cthe real foundation\u201d (Marx).",
    "By contrast, \u2018Anura Chinthanaya\u2019 (Anura Thought) holds that other factors are foundational.",
    "\u201cTo construct any strong building or initiate any successful project, a solid foundation is essential. Our nation, however, is one that has lost its foundation, its very groundwork. For this reason, we have focused our initial efforts on successfully establishing the fundamental groundwork required to rebuild this country. This foundation encompasses political authority, State mechanisms, the rule of law, respect for and protection of the Constitution, and a rejection of corruption, fraud, and bribery. These elements form the bedrock necessary to advance the nation. We are rapidly and systematically laying this foundation. The benefits of the robust economy built on this foundation must flow to our citizens.\u201d",
    "In the most famous definitional summary of his own contribution, Marx identified:",
    "\u201c\u2026the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure, and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social, political, and intellectual processes of life\u2026\u201d",
    "(Karl Marx, Preface, \u2018Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\u2019, 1859)",
    "\u201c\u2026This foundation encompasses political authority, State mechanisms, the rule of law, respect for and protection of the Constitution, and a rejection of corruption, fraud, and bribery. These elements form the bedrock\u2026The benefits of the robust economy built on this foundation...\u201d (ibid)",
    "(i) Denies that the economic structure is the real foundation.",
    "(ii) Holds to the contrary that the economy itself rests on another foundation.",
    "(iii) Substitutes as the foundation, what Marx calls the \u2018superstructure\u2019 \u2013 law, politics, social consciousness\u2014in place of the \u2018economic structure\u2019 which Marx calls \u2018the real foundation\u2019.",
    "AKD is not a \u2018post-Marxist\u2019 who absorbs the best of Marxism into a new synthesis. Nor is he \u2018non-Marxist\u2019. He has abandoned the materialist conception of history and converted to the idealist conception. He is \u2018counter-Marxist\u2019 or \u2018anti-Marxist\u2019.",
    "He speaks of \u201csolid foundation\u2026fundamental groundwork\u2026the bedrock\u201d without knowing what and where that is. He intends to \u201cconstruct\u201d a \u201cstrong building\u201d but doesn\u2019t know what the foundation consists of and therefore doesn\u2019t commence with laying it.",
    "A. His epistemological and conceptual fundamentals; the \u2018foundation\u2019/\u2019groundwork\u2019/\u2019bedrock\u2019 of his thinking on society and the economy; his very model, are wrong.",
    "B. He has dynamited his actual (not imaginary) foundation: The net outflows from the debt-restructuring/repayment deal with ISB holders he needlessly capitulated to without trying to move the needle, structurally preclude fund inflows needed for industrialisation and development.",
    "Since the 13th amendment was born in late-1987, Tamil nationalism had two responses:",
    "ii\u00a0 Others sought to push it to its limits and beyond, immediately.",
    "Neither attempted to work 13A and entrench devolution, enabling evolution.",
    "2. Assuming that Diaspora-driven Western support was more significant than Delhi.",
    "3. Initially seeking instant and full implementation of the 13th amendment (Vardarajahperumal 1988-89) at a time when Colombo couldn\u2019t be seen to concede, with state power in the South hanging by a thread, threatened by a JVP-DJV growing exponentially due to its anti-India/anti-devolution stand.",
    "4. Seeking to block and go beyond 13A by supporting the LTTE which was waging war for a separate state against the Indian Peacekeeping Force.",
    "5. Maintaining that support even after the LTTE assassinated Rajiv Gandhi who obtained devolution for the Tamils.",
    "6. Rejecting 13A as framework or baseline/starting point of negotiations with Mahinda Rajapaksa, even after the LTTE had been decimated and Prabhakaran eliminated.",
    "7. Embracing every possible option, foreign and local\u2014 \u2018Co-Chairs\u2019, Norway and South Africa; Chandrika and Ranil\u2014that might extricate them from 13A.",
    "8. Presenting themselves devoid of any political \u2018real estate\u2019, as a bulwark against China, instead of securing the Northern and Eastern PCs.",
    "9. Belatedly seeking India\u2019s help in securing the implementation of 13A when Delhi had moved on to securing its own strategic and economic interests bilaterally.",
    "Tamil nationalism now has to deal with an NPP Government characterised by:",
    "No commitment nor even lip-service to 13A or provincial-level devolution.",
    "No recognition of a specific Tamil National/Nationalities Question requiring an autonomy/devolution-based answer.",
    "It took July 1983, a Tamil insurgency and Indian troops to secure devolution-- and couldn\u2019t secure anything beyond 13A.",
    "Spurning existing devolution within the unitary state (13A) precisely because it was within the unitary framework, in a drive to get to federalism, Tamil nationalism has pretty much lost devolution within the unitary state with no prospect of securing devolution beyond and outside it (federalism).",
    "Syria\u2019s Assad and the autonomous Kurds \u2013 sworn enemies\u2014learned that neighbouring Turkey was more relevant than Washington or Moscow. Non-cooperation by Northern nationalists has deleted \u2018Tamils\u2019, \u2018devolution\u2019 and \u201813A\u2019 from the bilateral Indo-Lanka relationship and agenda. De-coupling 13A and Delhi has forfeited the external leverage Tamil nationalists could bring to bear. Historically, Tamil nationalists are at their weakest.",
    "First, Imthiaz Bakeer Markar\u2019s letter, now Rehan Jayawickreme\u2019s resignation. The inability to retain a mediagenic, progressive, personable, decent young politician like Rehan, Aragalaya activist (and literate Che Guevara fan) with an impeccable UNP lineage, who should have been a poster-boy for the SJB but never was, is a damning indictment of the main Opposition party. (https://www.ft.lk/news/Rehan-resigns-from-SJB-and-Weligama-organiser-role/56-771386)",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa was the last Leader of the Opposition (2002-2004) to be elected to the leadership of Sri Lanka. Long before Sajith Premadasa, the UNP leader and Opposition leader had stopped being elected the country\u2019s leader. The last time the UNP was elected to lead the country was 1989, over 35 years ago.",
    "Logically then, the problem with Sajith and the SJB is not the failure to reunite with the UNP, but the failure to rupture with the ideas and ideology of Ranil\u2019s UNP to which voters are obviously allergic; the failure to disentangle from the UNP\u2019s decades-long electoral downswing and downsizing.",
    "The SJB is like an infant whose umbilical cord (with the UNP) has not been completely cut. Having lost at its first General Election, SWRD\u2019s SLFP breakaway from DS Senanayake\u2019s UNP won its second election (1956) -- unlike the SJB. The SLFP won in the wake of the 1953 uprising, the Hartal, because it was never nostalgic about the UNP and presented a clear alternative to it, overtaking the Left which led the Hartal.",
    "The SJB lost its second General Election (2024) because it was ambivalent about the \u2018parent\u2019 party and the policies of its \u2018forever leader\u2019 Ranil Wickremesinghe. SWRD\u2019s shadow Finance Minister Stanley de Zoysa never endorsed post-Hartal incumbent Kotelawala\u2019s economics. Harsha de Silva endorsed post-Aragalaya incumbent Ranil\u2019s.",
    "When Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga wrested the SLFP leadership from her mother and revived the party, leading it to a victory at the Presidential election that has been the largest to date and larger than even the NPP\u2019s parliamentary landslide (CBK polled 63%, NPP 61%), her economic policy-shift did not affect the \u2018left-of-centre\u2019 ideological identity of the SLFP since she remained within the overall shift of the centre-left globally to the Blair-Clinton \u2018Third Way\u2019.",
    "Correctly shedding the SLFP\u2019s Sinhala-Buddhist excesses, Chandrika\u2019s abiding folly was throwing the patriotic baby out with the chauvinist bathwater in wartime.",
    "Faithful to the statist-patriotism of SWRD and Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Mahinda always saw himself and his party as progressive and centre-left, even as \u2018left\u2019\u2014entirely understandable given the ideology of his father, uncle, cousins and elder brother.",
    "The SLFP\u2019s self-identity remained firmly centre-left until Gotabaya as Secretary/Defence began encouraging the Islamophobic BBS. The outcome was that Mahinda who had always benefited from the SLFP\u2019s Muslim vote and his own\u2014due to his support of the Palestinian cause\u2014lost that vote and the 2015 election.",
    "The SLPP was the organised political product of the \u2018Bring Back Mahinda Movement\u2019/ Joint Opposition (JO) originating with the Nugegoda rally of February 2015. It stayed faithful to the patriotic centre-left identity of the Bandaranaike-Rajapaksa SLFP (1951-2015) through Mahinda\u2019s mammoth JO May Day mobilisation at Galle Face (2017) to the Local Government election sweep (Feb 2018).",
    "By mid-2018/2019 the SLPP had been infiltrated by the Gotabaya group. Basil reneged on his promise to hold the balance and safeguard \u2018Mahinda Chinthanaya\u2019. He facilitated chauvinist lectures by Viyath Maga personalities to Pohottuwa audiences. The party was infected with rightwing ultranationalism. That gave the SLPP a steroid spike in 2019-2020, but its ideological irrationality made it indulge in lunatic policies which caused Gotabaya\u2019s overthrow.",
    "The SLPP must grasp why AKD got 42% but the NPP got 61% at the parliamentary election. After GR\u2019s overthrow, the target of mass anger shifted to the SLPP-SLFP parliamentarians. The oldest political Establishment sat fossilised in Parliament since 1994.",
    "Namal Rajapaksa rescued the SLPP core, courageously pivoting it away from Ranil and the \u2018Gas cylinder\u2019 SLPP defectors.",
    "The SLPP potentially has the most dynamic and personable Presidential candidate for 2029: Namal. But there\u2019s the downside. Namal is a Formula One racer in a car designed, driven and maintained by one elderly uncle (Basil) and totalled by another (Gota). The challenge he faces is to emulate the great racing driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale in Ford Vs. Ferrari) who enabled Ford to do the impossible: beat Ferrari at Le Mans (1966). Miles ripped out everything that the Ford factory had installed in the car which could possibly retard speed on the track.",
    "Mahinda took the SLFP forward by ripping-out CBK\u2019s vacillatory policy towards the Tigers and reinserting nationalism and statism back into the mix, without however making the blunder of returning to the Sirimavo model of \u2018self-sufficiency\u2019 and the economics of scarcity.",
    "The younger Mahinda had an appeal way beyond and different from the BBS/Dan Priyasad/Iraj types --the hardcore Gota constituency. MR had a broad sociocultural appeal including in the city of Colombo, which he had inherited from his older cousins George and Lakshman, and expanded. Warm, likeable, he rolled with modernist artistic-cinematic personalities, progressives and leftists. MR was a populist-progressive. Though intra-SLFP rivals, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Vijaya Kumaratunga were quite similar contemporaries (charming, charismatic, courageous, had been jailed), competing for the same space.",
    "Namal\u2019s strengths are his father\u2019s historic role, and his own likeability and \u2018smarts\u2019. His biggest liability is the Pohottuwa\u2019s baggage of postwar BR-GR vintage. NR\u2019s most crucial challenges are:",
    "To place himself and the SLPP at a political, ideological and cultural location that enables him to win over \u2018Aragalaya Generation\u2019 NPP voters (not JVP-NPP\u00a0members).",
    "To cull the dinosaurs and dispel the SLPP\u2019s Jurassic Park vibe which drives youth, women, professionals, Tamils, Muslims and Catholics/Christians to the NPP, SJB and UNP."
