  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a significant development, nearly all Senior Deputy Inspector Generals (Senior DIGs) of Police, except for the Northern Province Senior DIG, are set to be reassigned to new posts, according to sources from Police Headquarters.",
    "The reshuffle will impact Senior DIGs managing administrative divisions including the Western, North Western, Eastern, Southern, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. Among the notable changes, Senior DIG Ajith Rohana, formerly the Police Spokesman and currently overseeing the Eastern Province, is expected to be transferred to the Wayamba Province.",
    "Reports also indicate that this reshuffle will extend beyond Senior DIGs, affecting Deputy Inspector Generals (DIG) of Police and several Senior Superintendents of Police (SSP) across various divisions.",
    "The transfers are reportedly part of a strategic effort to strengthen special police units, particularly those combatting organised crime. Experienced and capable officers are being reassigned to enhance the efficiency of these units, sources added."
