  "original_body_lines": [
    "The US Coast Guard said Thursday a \u201cdebris field\u201d was discovered by a remotely operated vehicle near the Titanic and within the search area for the missing submersible with five people aboard.",
    "\u201cExperts within the unified command are evaluating the information,\u201d the Coast Guard said. It is unclear if this debris field is connected to the missing submersible. The Coast Guard said it plans to host a press briefing at 3 p.m. ET to \u201cdiscuss findings from the Horizon Arctic\u2019s ROV on the sea floor near the Titanic.\u201d",
    "The news comes as the search for the vessel has reached a \u201ccritical\u201d stage, the co-founder of the company operating the submersible said Thursday.",
    "\u201cToday will be a critical day in this search and rescue mission, as the sub\u2019s life support supplies are starting to run low,\u201d Guillermo Sohnlein, the co-founder of OceanGate, the company operating the expedition, said in a statement Thursday.",
    "Sohnlein said he is \u201ccertain\u201d that pilot Stockton Rush and the crew \u201crealized days ago that the best thing they can do to ensure their rescue is to extend the limits of those supplies by relaxing as much as possible. I firmly believe that the time window available for their rescue is longer than what most people think.\u201d",
    "The submersible, known as Titan, began its descent Sunday to explore the wreckage of the Titanic with an estimated 96 hours of life support. With estimated oxygen levels ever depleting, the search for the submersible has kicked into high gear.",
    "\u201cWe continue to find in particularly complex cases that peoples\u2019 will to live really needs to be accounted for \u2026 and so we\u2019re continuing to search and proceed with rescue efforts by bringing this new capability online this morning,\u201d US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger told NBC on Thursday.",
    "The Titan lost contact with its mother ship Sunday about 1 hour and 45 minutes into its dive to explore the Titanic\u2019s wreckage at about 13,000 feet below sea level \u2013 a trip that costs participants $250,000, an archived version of its website shows.",
    "Aboard the Titan are Rush, the OceanGate CEO and founder, along with British businessman Hamish Harding, Pakistani billionaire Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood, and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, according to relatives and social media posts. Officials have not publicly named those aboard.",
    "The expedition reflects the ongoing fascination with the Titanic\u2019s wreckage more than a century after it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage, killing more than 1,500 people. The journey is also part of the growing business of wealthy adventure tourism, along with the space flights of Blue Origin or the rise of guided tours to Mount Everest.",
    "The focus on the vessel has also renewed criticisms of OceanGate\u2019s approach to safety from employees and other industry leaders.",
    "A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was looking for the submersible on the sea floor, the US Coast Guard\u2019s Northeast District tweeted Thursday morning. An ROV from a French vessel has also been deployed, and equipment from Magellan, the team that mapped the Titanic wreckage site last year, was headed to the site to assist.",
    "Further, aircraft are scanning a search zone about twice the size of Connecticut and as deep as 2 1/2 miles, Capt. Jamie Frederick, the response coordinator for the First Coast Guard District, said Wednesday.",
    "Medical personnel specializing in dive medicine and a hyperbaric recompression chamber arrived on scene Thursday, according to a spokesperson for the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax of the Canadian Armed Forces.",
    "Banging noises detected underwater Tuesday and Wednesday in the massive search area provided hope for survivors, though their origin was not clear. The underwater sounds detected by sonar devices on Tuesday first came every 30 minutes and were heard again four hours later, according to an internal US government memo update on the search.",
    "Naval experts were analyzing recordings of the sounds to determine their origin. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the noises are,\u201d Frederick said.",
    "If indeed there are survivors, the crew would have \u201climited rations\u201d of food and water in the 21-foot submersible, which has rudimentary controls and no room for passengers to stretch out, officials have said.",
    "\u201cWe need a miracle,\u201d oceanographer and water search expert David Gallo told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cBut miracles do happen.\u201d",
    "The number of assets in the search operation is expected to double in the next day or two, Frederick said Wednesday. A Canadian Coast Guard boat with sonar capabilities, the John Cabot, arrived Wednesday, and the US Navy is sending a lift system that can pull heavy objects up from 20,000 feet deep to help if the submersible is found.",
    "\u201cThe Coast Guard has done a very good job in putting the right tools with the right team in the right spot. So, the chances are as good as they can be,\u201d Gallo, the senior adviser for strategic initiatives at RMS Titanic Inc., told CNN on Thursday morning.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s tough because the oceans are pitch black, you can only use sound to image effectively, and you\u2019ve got to be pretty much on top of the object to actually see it,\u201d he added.",
    "Environmental factors in the ocean are likely complicating efforts to identify the noises, said Rick Murcar, the international training director for the National Association of Cave Divers. Currents can deflect the sound so it appears it\u2019s coming from miles away from its source, Murcar explained, likening the effort to locate the noise to trying to pinpoint a snare drum in a stadium full of cheering fans and other instruments.",
    "If the submersible is found at depth, it would take a while to bring it to the surface, and there won\u2019t be a way to get oxygen into it, said ocean explorer Tom Dettweiler, who was part of the expedition that discovered the Titanic wreckage in 1985.",
    "\u201cThe thing to do would be to bring it up as quickly as possible and open the hatch and get to the people. Unfortunately, it cannot be brought up all that quickly when it is on the end of a cable and dependent on the speed of a winch to bring it up,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cYou\u2019re still talking about hours, potentially, to get it up.\u201d",
    "As aircraft, ships, sonar buoys and robots comb through the ocean, experts warn conditions are likely dire aboard the 23,000-pound submersible \u2013 especially if it\u2019s still deep underwater.",
    "Ret. Navy Capt. David Marquet, a former submarine captain, described Wednesday what he imagines the five passengers are experiencing in the Titan beyond hunger, thirst and discomfort.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re freezing cold. The water entirely surrounding the ship is at freezing or slightly below. When they exhale, their breath condenses. There\u2019s frost on the inside of the parts of the submarine,\u201d Marquet told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cThey\u2019re all huddled together trying to conserve their body heat. They\u2019re running low on oxygen and they\u2019re exhaling carbon dioxide.\u201d",
    "The submersible has a \u201climited ability\u201d to absorb the exhaled carbon dioxide, which at high levels could trigger headaches, confusion and nausea, Marquet said. \u201cThe oxygen and the carbon dioxide and the freezing are what they got to hold onto as long as possible to give the rescuers the time they need.\u201d",
    "Those onboard will need to conserve energy, said Joe MacInnis, a physician and renowned diver who\u2019s made two trips to the Titanic wreck.",
    "\u201cResting, breathing as little as possible, and trying to keep calm \u2013 that is the most important thing,\u201d he told CNN early Wednesday.",
    "Per Wimmer, an adventurer and acquaintance of Harding and Rush, said he believed they would know to conserve oxygen.",
    "\u201cI still have hope,\u201d Wimmer said on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cI remain optimistic, positive, and hoping for a miracle here, at least until it\u2019s proven otherwise.\u201d",
    "The last communication between the vessel and its mother ship, the Polar Prince, came in at 11:47 a.m. Sunday. With no GPS underwater, the submersible is only guided by text messages from the surface ship.",
    "Indeed, \u201cissues with computer control\u201d were among the reasons Discovery Channel\u2019s \u201cExpedition Unknown\u201d host Josh Gates and his team decided after a 2021 test dive of Titan against filming a segment on the vessel as it \u201cbecame clear to us at that time that there was a lot that needed to be worked out with the sub,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cA lot of the systems worked but a lot of them really didn\u2019t. We had issues with thrusters and issues with computer control and things like that. Ultimately, it was a challenging dive,\u201d Gates told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Wednesday.",
    "\u201cWe were inside Titan for two or three hours, and there were a lot of things that weren\u2019t really ready for prime time, it seemed,\u201d he said, adding he couldn\u2019t get comfortable with the Titan at that time.",
    "OceanGate declined safety review of Titan submersible, industry leader says",
    "The disappearance of Titan and the international dash to find it have put its operator under the microscope.",
    "At least two former OceanGate employees years ago expressed safety concerns about the vessel\u2019s hull, including the thickness of the material used and testing procedures, CNN has learned. The 23,000-pound craft is made of highly engineered carbon fiber and titanium.",
    "OceanGate Expeditions strayed from industry norms by declining a voluntary, rigorous safety review of the vessel, according to an industry leader. If the company had pursued a certification review \u201csome of this may have been avoided,\u201d Will Kohnen of the Marine Technology Society told CNN on Wednesday.",
    "The company also faced a series of mechanical problems and inclement weather conditions that forced the cancellation or delays of trips in recent years, according to court records. The scuttled excursions led to a pair of lawsuits in which some high-paying customers sought to recoup the cost of trips they said they didn\u2019t take. The complaints alleged that the company overstated its ability to reach the Titanic wreckage.",
    "OceanGate did not respond to the claims in court and could not be reached for comment.",
    "Some expeditions were delayed after OceanGate was forced to rebuild the Titan\u2019s hull because it showed \u201ccyclic fatigue\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be able to travel deep enough to reach the Titanic\u2019s wreckage, according to a 2020 article by GeekWire, which interviewed the company\u2019s CEO."
