    "Workers representing about 200 public sector trade unions held a two-day sick-note campaign on Tuesday and Wednesday, demanding a 25,000-rupee allowance. They have threatened to intensify their trade union action unless the government grants their demand. The protesting workers are demanding that they be paid the same allowance (Rs. 25,000) as the Executive Grade officials in the state sector. All state employees received a 10,000-rupee cost of living allowance increase from Budget 2024.",
    "There is no gainsaying that workers, in both public and private sectors, deserve pay hikes. The cost of living has gone through the roof. Inflation may be down, but \u2018greedflation\u2019 keeps the general price level extremely high. However, one must not lose sight of the broader economic context.",
    "The government would have the public believe that there is a \u2018political conspiracy\u2019 behind the current wave of trade union action. It usually \u2018sees more devils than vast hell can hold\u2019. An election year is characterised by strikes and demands for pay hikes. But ca\u2019cannies and work stoppages must be avoided at any cost at this juncture, for they have the potential to derail the fragile economic recovery process, which consists in, inter alia, a substantial increase in GDP.",
    "Let it be repeated that no reasonable person will deny that state employees deserve a better deal, but the question is whether it is feasible to grant a huge allowance or pay hike amidst a crippling economic crisis.",
    "True, the blame for the current crisis should be apportioned to all those who have been in power during the past several decades, which have seen a huge increase in the country\u2019s debt besides chronic economic mismanagement. The incumbent dispensation precipitated the debt crisis by slashing taxes, indulging in waste and corruption, and increasing politically-motivated government expenditure while mismanaging the economy. It has now become imperative that state revenue be increased to at least 15% of GDP in the short run for the country to be able to manage its debt crisis. In fact, it is one of the IMF conditions. Increases in state expenditure owing to pay hikes, allowances, wasteful expenditure, corruption, etc., will make economic recovery impossible. Previous governments resorted to money printing to grant pay hikes and increase welfare expenditure, but money can no longer be created in that manner; the only way the government can increase revenue is to jack up taxes.",
    "It behoves the protesting trade union leaders, government politicians and their panjandrums to arrive at a negotiated settlement instead of trying to battle it out at the expense of the economy and the public.",
    "How the government will tackle the ongoing workers\u2019 protests remains to be seen, but the burgeoning state service has to be downsized as a national priority; there are about 1.5 million public employees in Sri Lanka and this works out to about one state worker for every 14 citizens! Obviously, the country can manage with a much smaller state service. There has been a sensible proposal for reducing state sector recruitment to a bare minimum, retraining the excess personnel and reassigning them to the institutions where vacancies exist.",
    "Let the warring trade unions and the government be urged to stop the ongoing game of chicken, soften their stands and work out a compromise formula without hurting the economy and worsening the people\u2019s lot.",
    "Equally, the people\u2019s representatives in both the government and the Opposition ought to share in the people\u2019s suffering by making sacrifices like taking pay cuts and forgoing some of their perks, including duty-free vehicle permits. They should set an example to the public.",
