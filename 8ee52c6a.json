    "New principal appointments are scheduled to be made without affecting the transfers of principals of five leading schools in the country, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that the principals of the five leading schools, such as Royal College, Colombo, D.S. Senanayake College, Colombo, Mahanama College, Colombo, Mahinda Mahinda Rajapaksha College, Homagama and Central College Kuliyapitiya have not been mentioned in the transfer list.",
    "However, he said the principals have been selected for 34 leading schools following interviews and those selections have been sent to the Public Service Commission (PSC) for approval.",
    "But the five school principals mentioned on the list were not on the PSC list. However, the list was rejected and the PSC was told to send the complete list. Even on the second list sent to the PSC, the above-mentioned schools were not listed.",
    "From today onwards, the principal's post of Royal College, Colombo will be vacant, and it has been reported that a person who had connections with former Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam is to be appointed as the principal.",
    "Stalin mentioned that the person who was selected for the principal's post of Royal College had not attended the interview and had not even submitted any applications for transfers.",
    "Therefore, the selected principals for the Royal College vacancy are in a very difficult situation.",
    "However, the CTU had decided to take legal action against the move to appoint a principal who was not even on the interview list.",
    "Meanwhile, the CTU General Secretary said that no teacher transfers had been made in several leading national schools during the Annual Teacher Transfer programme due to actions taken by the newly appointed director of the Education Ministry's Teacher Transfer Department.
