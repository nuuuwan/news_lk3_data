### Why Does The JVP Need The Support Of Monks?

*2024-10-07 18:11:41* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/why-does-the-jvp-need-the-support-of-monks/) · `en`

A significant portion of Sinhala-Buddhists, including monks, supported the JVP-led National People’s Power (NPP) in the recent September 2024 presidential election. The results indicate that the JVP captured a considerable share of votes from Mahinda Rajapaksa’s traditional Sinhala-Buddhist base. Emerging in the late 1960s as a radical leftist political entity, the JVP initially advocated for social justice and anti-imperialism. Over time, however, socio-political dynamics among Sinhala-Buddhists shaped the party’s ideology and its relationship with the Buddhist clergy. This commentary examines the interaction between the JVP, Buddhist monks, and Sinhala-Buddhist hegemony, highlighting their mutual influence on Sri Lanka’s political landscape.

### Will there be an October Surprise to sway the 2024 election?

*2024-10-07 14:36:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/will-there-be-an-october-surprise-to-sway-the-2024-election/) · `en`

An October Surprise is defined as “an unexpected political event or revelation in the month before a presidential election, especially one that seems intended to influence the outcome”. Since 1980, there have been a few “October Surprises” which may have changed the history of the nation.

The phrase originated in 1980, during the presidential election season of that year. Militants in Iran had seized 66 American citizens from the US Embassy in 1979, and held 52 of them hostage for over a year. Jimmy Carter was the incumbent president at the time. His failure to have the hostages released was the main reason he was losing in the polls to Ronald Reagan. The hostage crisis occurred after the Iran’s Islamic revolution and the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty. Carter had planned to negotiate a last-minute release of the hostages which would win him the election. It never happened.

### Sir John becomes PM, the Queen’s visit and the 1956 landslide

*2024-10-07 14:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-john-becomes-pm-the-queens-visit-and-the-1956-landslide/) · `en`

The prime minister’s father too had been named John Kotelawela and there was always a whiff of mystery surrounding `John Sr’. There had then been rumours of high intrigue, of family feuds, contract killings and near unassailable alibis. The kavi kola karayas – the wandering minstrels who preceded the radio as purveyors of news in my childhood had sung the story in racy jingles, doubtless embellishing it as time went on. But what was spoken about in whispers was that John Sr had died in prison while awaiting trial after arrest in a foreign land for killing a brother-in-law.

### Israelis, scarred and battling on multiple fronts, mark a year since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack

*2024-10-07 14:19:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102505/israelis-scarred-and-battling-on-multiple-fronts-mark-a-year-since-hamas-oct-7-attack) · `en`

Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country’s history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly.

The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis’ sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military.

Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on and Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8. There is also an escalating conflict with Iran which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups that threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration.

And on Monday, Hamas showed that it was still putting up a fight. It launched rockets that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, as well as closer to the Gaza border.

### The challenge confronting Anura Kumara

*2024-10-07 14:19:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-challenge-confronting-anura-kumara/) · `en`

Anura rose from the humblest of origins to the pinnacle power. In the months to come more lyrical and elegant commentators than this one will serenade this young man’s story and compare it to the expedition that America’s greatest president undertook from log-cabin to White House. An astonishing matter is that the promises Anura gave the nation at the time he was sworn-in was very long; good governance, punishment of corrupt politicos and hangers-on, prosecution of malignant officials, unification of the nation and abolition of racism.

His great American predecessor rather more pithily summed it up in a few words “government of the people, by the people, for the people”. He engaged in war for two inseparable objectives: “To consecrate a portion of the field for those who gave their lives so that the nation might live” and secondly to lay the ground for the Proclamation of Emancipation on January 1, 1863.

(Excerpted from the autobiography of Dharmasiri Pieris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

One could not however easily get away from managing. Besides the day to day management that was necessary to maintain paper and information flows, one had to service important meetings and conferences. There was the perpetual follow-up of numerous matters, each day bringing new material. In the midst of all these, someone often created a crisis, which ultimately ended up with us.

One such, during this time was the strong attack made by the Finance Minister Dr. N.M. Perera, on United States PL 480 assistance to Sri Lanka, before a large gathering on May Day. To the Americans, this attack by a senior Minister and the Finance Minister on an important program of official assistance was indeed inexplicable and unfriendly. Chris Van Hollen the Ambassador was not unnaturally quite exercised over this.
