    "Gunaratnam says President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Govt. bear significant responsibility to investigate deaths of JVP members killed during the 1987\u20131989 insurrection",
    "Stresses JVP supporters and families are still yearning for justice for all those who gave their lives at the time",
    "Claims FSP is willing to support President in this endeavour",
    "Dilith Jayaweera demands Govt. to appoint commission to investigate deaths of Rohana Wijeweera and other JVP martyrs",
    "Reminds President to show concern for JVP heroes similar to his concern for Waseem Thajudeen, Lasantha Wickramatunge, and Prageeth Ekneligoda",
    "Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) General Secretary Kumar Gunaratnam and Sarvajana Balaya Alliance leader businessman Dilith Jayaweera have called on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to deliver justice to Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) members who lost their lives in the 1987\u20131989 insurrection, including JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera.",
    "Speaking at the FSP\u2019s annual November Heroes Commemoration (Il Maha Viru Samaruma) held yesterday in Colombo, Gunaratnam emphasised that the Government, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake who is also the current leader of the JVP which leads the ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party, bears a significant responsibility to investigate the deaths of JVP members killed during the 1987\u20131989 insurrection.",
    "\u201cToday marks the 35th Il Maha Viru Commemoration. During the 1988\u20131989 period, an entire generation that raised its voice for justice was killed. Over 60,000 comrades, including Comrades Rohana Wijeweera and Upatissa Gamanayake, lost their lives. Each of them stood for the ideals of the JVP, the main political party of the NPP, which now holds power,\u201d he noted. He said, therefore, the 35th Commemoration will be historic.",
    "Gunaratnam likened the Government\u2019s crackdown on the 1987\u20131989 insurrection to a crime against humanity, calling it one of the most brutal genocides in world history.",
    "\u201cPeople still yearn for justice for all those who gave their lives in relentless sacrifice. The families, friends, and loved ones of JVP members, who dedicated themselves to bring JVP to power, were brutally killed. This gives the NPP Government a greater moral responsibility and authority than previous administrations to conduct a thorough investigation into the 1988-89 period and to hold all those responsible for these crimes against humanity accountable. As the FSP, we hope that President Dissanayake will take up this responsibility,\u201d he said.",
    "Gunaratnam also noted that the FSP is ready to offer any necessary support in this endeavour.",
    "Gunaratnam\u2019s party, a breakaway group of the JVP, also expressed similar sentiments in a communique to President Dissanayake earlier this week.\u00a0 The communique called on the President to initiate an immediate investigation into the alleged State-sanctioned crimes of 1988-89 and to do justice to the lives of the dead JVP heroes, including Rohana Wijeweera.",
    "The FSP paid tribute to Rohana Wijeweera and others who lost their lives in the struggle for socialist transformation, highlighting the kidnappings, enforced disappearances, and unlawful killings carried out through \u201cState terrorism\u201d during that period. Accordingly, the FSP underscored the importance of uncovering the truth behind these atrocities.",
    "With the leader of the JVP now in office as President, the FSP urged for a comprehensive inquiry to take priority, focusing on uncovering the truth behind the deaths and disappearances of Rohana Wijeweera and others.",
    "Meanwhile, Dilith Jayaweera has also called on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to establish a commission to investigate the deaths of Rohana Wijeweera and other JVP martyrs.",
    "Speaking at a public rally in Kadawatha over the weekend, Jayaweera voiced his demands.",
    "\u201cPresident Anura Kumara, since the day you assumed office, people in our villages have been waiting for answers about the murder of your dear comrade Rohana Wijeweera, whose life ended in the crematorium. Friends from our university days, all innocent villagers without power in Colombo, were killed. The concern you show for Thajudeen, Lasantha, and Ekneligoda should also be extended to our November heroes. I urge him to remember that.\u201d",
    "He added: \u201cWe are coming to Parliament as a bold Opposition. We will present a proposal to establish a commission to uncover the fate of all innocent people killed in this country. We stand with Comrade Anura Kumara in this effort.\u201d"
