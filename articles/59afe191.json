    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Multiple electric vehicle makers are offering lower output motors in Sri Lanka for models which are sold with higher outputs in Australia and Thailand, and authorities are likely to test them as well, a top official said.",
    "Sri Lanka customs originally detained around 1,000 BYD Atto 3, vehicles with a 100kW motor rating after a complaint that the vehicle is sold with 150kW motor in other markets. Later around another 1,000 including other models were detained.",
    "Electric vehicle makers may reduce power output of vehicles for price discrimination (charge a premium for higher performance), to match tax brackets or to extend their range.",
    "Motor output in EVs is usually managed and controlled through software (firmware-limited) using electronic control modules (ECU/ECM).",
    "Some of the EVs offered in Sri Lanka show that the same models are offered with multiple power outputs in other markets based on dealer websites.",
    "It is not clear yet whether the other makes are also offering different power outputs with \u2018firmware limited\u2019 motors.",
    "Sri Lanka Customs Director General Seevali Arukgoda said a committee to look into EV motor issue and conduct tests will be appointed this week.",
    "Other makes also seemed to offer models with different outputs, and they will be subject to the same tests, he said.",
    "The questions did not arise in the case of other makes earlier, and they did not come in such large numbers, he said.",
    "Among models with different motor variants are the Deepal S07 which is offered with 99 kW in Sri Lanka and Nepal is offered with 160kW in Australia.",
    "The Deepal L07 which is offered with 99kW in Sri Lanka is offered with 190kW output in Thailand.",
    "The Tata Tiago is offered with 48kW output in Sri Lanka, but it is also available in a 55kW option.",
    "The Tata Currve is offered with 98kW in Sri Lanka and is offered at 110kW and 123kW elsewhere.",
    "The MG ES5 is offered with 99kW in Sri Lanka but is offered in 125kW or 170 and 180kW versions elsewhere.",
