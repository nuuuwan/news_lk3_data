    "The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has called on Members of Parliament from both the Government and the Opposition to support a no-confidence motion against Speaker Asoka Sapumal Ranwala over allegations concerning his academic qualifications.",
    "SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam yesterday announced the party\u2019s intent to move a no-confidence motion, accusing the Speaker of misleading the public by initially claiming to hold a doctorate. \u201cThe Speaker\u2019s actions have deceived the people, and such a fraudulent person is unfit for this esteemed position,\u201d Kariyawasam said.",
    "Adding to the controversy, New People\u2019s Front organiser Dinesh Abeyskoon lodged a formal complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on the matter yesterday. Abeykoon alleged discrepancies between the Speaker\u2019s educational qualifications presented during elections and those cited in the Parliamentary website following his appointment. Addressing the media outside the CID, Abeykoon called for an in-depth investigation into the Speaker\u2019s credentials.",
    "The allegations have sparked widespread debate on social media, with criticism mounting against Speaker Ranwala. In response, the Speaker is set to address Parliament on 17 December to clarify the matter. Chief Government Whip Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa confirmed that the Speaker plans to make a formal statement regarding his doctorate to address the allegations and criticisms.",
    "Asoka Sapumal Ranwala was elected Speaker of the Tenth Parliament on 21 November. However, the controversy surrounding his academic claims has cast a shadow over his appointment, intensifying political tensions within Parliament."
