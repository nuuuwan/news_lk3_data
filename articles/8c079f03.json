    "FPC member MP G.L. Peiris says current Govt.\u2019s term will last a mere 46 days",
    "Says with only 92 MPs now supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Govt. has lost its simple majority in Parliament",
    "Criticises current administration for what he described as an unprecedented assault on the judiciary",
    "Accuses President of facilitating widespread fraud and corruption to bolster own political prospects",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris has announced that the broadest political alliance in recent times will be formed on 8 August in support of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s candidacy at the upcoming election.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo, MP Prof. G.L. Peiris said while the current Government\u2019s term will conclude in 46 days, that only 92 MPs are now supporting the President, who was elected with 134 Parliamentary votes. According to Peiris, this reduction in support signifies that the Government has lost its simple majority in Parliament.",
    "Peiris criticised the current administration for what he described as an unprecedented assault on the judiciary. He accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of publicly denouncing judges, which, according to Peiris, has rendered the judicial system ineffective. He also voiced strong opposition to the summoning of judges to the Parliamentary Privileges Committees, arguing that this undermines judicial independence.",
    "Peiris highlighted recent Supreme Court rulings against Government-related corruption, including the decision on the VFS visa transaction. He contended that these rulings are part of a broader pattern of attacks on the judiciary by the Government, aimed at discrediting and undermining the legal system.",
    "He further alleged that the President has facilitated widespread fraud and corruption to bolster his own political prospects. Peiris recalled that Wickremesinghe, then Prime Minister, had taken personal responsibility for the Central Bank robbery of 2015 when Arjuna Mahendran was appointed as Governor. Peiris drew a comparison between the Central Bank bond scam and the VFS visa scam, suggesting that both scandals were part of election-related manoeuvres.",
    "Peiris said a new Government led by Premadasa would implement a Constitutional Amendment to combat fraud and corruption. He also advocated for expanding the powers of the Bribery and Corruption Commission and emphasised that such changes would require a referendum to secure public approval, as a two thirds Parliamentary majority alone would not suffice."
