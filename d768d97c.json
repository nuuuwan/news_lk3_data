    "During the All-Party Conference at the Presidential Secretariat today (26), President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the significance of discussing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution with all parties, as it is a matter that affects the entire country. He highlighted that a decision on this matter should involve input from all relevant parties.",
    "The conference was organized to update the Parliament\u2019s party leaders on the National Reconciliation Program and the North-East Development Plan, the PMD reported.",
    "President Wickremesinghe recalled that neither he nor the previous seven Executive Presidents had the authority to pass new laws to address existing problems; that power rested solely with the Parliament.",
    "He asserted that he was bringing forth relevant proposals for the betterment of the country, but the responsibility of implementing them lay with all the representatives in the Parliament, as he alone couldn\u2019t achieve it with his single vote.",

    "He suggested granting provincial councils powers over subjects currently under the central government, including grassroots activities like agriculture and tourism.",
    "According to President Wickremesinghe, the central government should formulate policies for the country, while provincial councils should provide the necessary facilities for the successful implementation of development activities in all fields. Collaboration between all parties and levels of government was crucial for progress and development.",
    "In addition, President Ranil Wickremesinghe called for collective discussions among all parties to decide on granting police powers to the Provincial Councils as outlined in the 13th Amendment of the Constitution.",
