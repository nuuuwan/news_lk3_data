    "Accuses Govt. of making false assertions about Sri Lanka being in stable situation",
    "Claims no investments either foreign or local are coming in due to Govt. failure to elicit trust",
    "Urges the President to dissolve parliament and allow people to form new Govt.",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo Mayoral candidate Mujibur Rahman yesterday accused the current Government of deliberately attempting to conceal economic crimes committed by it in the guise of economic recovery efforts.",
    "\u201cToday we are faced with the problem of how long will we be able to continue in the current economic crisis. The Department of Census and Statistics and the Central Bank have reported on the current situation. Similarly, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has also elaborated on the country\u2019s current economic situation. Accordingly, we can understand where we are today,\u201d he said.",
    "Rahman accused the President, the cabinet, and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of making false assertions about Sri Lanka being in a stable situation. \u201cThey are attempting to conceal various economic crimes which occurred under the current Government in the guise of rebuilding it,\u201d he alleged.",
    "Presenting the latest statistics issued by the Department of Census and Statistics and the FAO on the economy and its devastating effect on the people, Rahman accused the Government of not utilising the IMF funding to initiate development in the production process.",
    "\u201cNeither have we witnessed investments coming in. Instead, we see manufacturers closing down factories and jobs being lost. The economy is shrinking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tall claims of the President, cabinet spokespersons and Ministers are not the reality,\u201d he added.",
    "The SJB stalwart blamed the Government and its failure to elicit international trust for its repeated failures. \u201cAn environment conducive to investments has not been created. Not even local investors are investing anymore. They are attempting to save their funds instead,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe longer the President and the Government are in power, the increase in poverty and the shrinking of the economy is leading to chaos. This cannot be subdued through the introduction of suppressive laws,\u201d he noted.",
    "Rahman called on the President to dissolve parliament and allow the people to create a new political situation in the country. \u201cA cabinet consisting of those who stole public monies cannot rebuild the country nor gain international trust,\u201d he said."
