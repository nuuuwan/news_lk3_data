    "Criticises President\u2019s policy statement accusing him of failing to acknowledge JVP\u2019s historical role in damaging SL\u2019s legal system",
    "Claims JVP-led insurgency in 1988\u201389 created climate of fear, necessitating unprecedented security measures for MPs and Ministers",
    "Accuses JVP of promoting racial discord since 1971 and opposing Provincial Council system aimed at devolving power",
    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday called on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to issue an apology for the alleged actions of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the past, which he claims undermined Sri Lanka\u2019s rule of law.",
    "Addressing a press conference, Madduma Bandara criticised the President\u2019s recent policy statement in Parliament, where he pledged to uphold the rule of law. The SJB General Secretary argued that the President missed an opportunity to acknowledge and apologise for the JVP\u2019s historical role in damaging the country\u2019s legal framework.",
    "\u201cThat would have been the human thing to do. But he didn\u2019t,\u201d Madduma Bandara remarked.",
    "Madduma Bandara further criticised the President for failing to acknowledge the JVP\u2019s violent past during his policy statement. He noted that during the JVP-led insurgency in 1988 and 1989, the group\u2019s actions created an atmosphere of fear and lawlessness that necessitated unprecedented security measures, including police and military protection for MPs and Ministers. \u201cIn those days, MPs did not have police or military protection, and even the Prime Minister travelled in one vehicle. But the JVP\u2019s terror forced a change,\u201d he claimed.",
    "Despite commending the Government\u2019s current commitment to upholding the rule of law, he argued that the President should have apologised for the JVP\u2019s role in dismantling it during that period. Madduma Bandara added that the SJB is ready to support genuine efforts to protect the rule of law.",
    "Madduma Bandara also welcomed the President\u2019s assertion that there is no room for racist politics in Sri Lanka. He claimed, however, that the seeds of racial discord were sown as far back as 1971, citing the JVP rhetoric on Indian expansionism in their ideological teachings. He further criticised the JVP\u2019s historical opposition to the Provincial Council system, which was introduced to devolve power to the North, South, and Central Highlands, and accused the JVP of assassinating Provincial Council members and candidates at the time. \u201cThe JVP destroyed the politics of the country,\u201d he said, while commending their current acknowledgment of the need for ethnic and racial harmony. \u201cThe Samagi Jana Balawegaya has always stood for unity and coexistence. We are glad that after 53 years, the JVP and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) have finally understood this important principle,\u201d he added.",
    "Madduma Bandara also criticised the President for inconsistencies in his promises to provide relief to the people. \u201cThe President, who initially claimed relief would be provided within 24 hours, has now asked for six months,\u201d he remarked, pointing out that presenting a Budget does not require such a long delay. He highlighted that while the President announced in Parliament that the Budget would be presented in April, it should have been presented in January.",
    "Madduma Bandara further noted that several promises made by the Government remain unfulfilled, including salary increases for Government employees, addressing the salary disparity of teachers, and providing relief to farmers and fishermen. While the President spoke of reducing child malnutrition and malnutrition among pregnant mothers, Madduma Bandara argued that no clear plan was outlined. \u201cWhat we saw in Parliament was a repetition of the speech he gave during the election campaign. It appears President Anura Kumara Dissanayake continues to mislead the people,\u201d he said.",
    "He alleged that the Government\u2019s decision to present the Budget only after all elections is a calculated move to deceive the public further. However, he affirmed the SJB\u2019s willingness to support efforts to bring corrupt individuals to justice and eradicate fraud. \u201cIf the President takes meaningful steps in these areas, we are ready to extend full support. But instead, we hear reports of corrupt officials being appointed to key institutions, which raises serious concerns,\u201d he added."
