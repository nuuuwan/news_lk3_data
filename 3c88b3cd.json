    "Colombo (News 1st): On Thursday (16), News 1st reported that in April 2020, five months after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected as President, the country missed out on an opportunity to access over USD 160 Million from the International Monetary Fund.",
    "News 1st reported this fact by quoting the Supreme Court ruling that found Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Former Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Basil Rajapaksa, Former Secretary to the President P. B. Jayasundara, Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal among others, to have violated the fundamental rights of the citizens.",
    "The court ruling also noted that the Governor of the Central Bank had made continued warnings that the country's economy would be in crisis, but no action was taken to prevent it.",
    "On 4th August 2020, the then Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Professor W. D. Laksham in a report had drawn the attention of then Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on multiple issues relating to the status of the economy and challenges envisaged due to many reasons.",
    "He had noted that the downgrading by the rating agencies due to the growing concerns on debt sustainability, possibility of further downgrading on the basis that the economic growth and the growth of foreign currency earnings are not on par with the rising debt stock, in the event planned funding did not materialize.",
    "Furthermore, the importance of active engagement with major multilateral and bilateral agencies was highlighted by the then-Governor while observing that loans from such agencies are likely to follow an IMF facility.",
    "According to the Supreme Court ruling, this report had been compiled by then-Governor of the Central Bank in compliance with the Monetary Law.",
    "Eight months from the initial report, on 06th April 2021, the then Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Professor W. D. Lakshman submitted another report to then-Minister of Finance Mahinda Rajapaksa under sections of the Monetary Law.",
    "In the said report challenges faced by the Central Bank due to decline of official reserves were described and emphasized the need for the Government to secure adequate foreign financing on an urgent basis.",
    "Furthermore, it is said that the Central Bank was actively working with the Government to facilitate enhancing non-debt sources of foreign exchange inflow in view of \u201cthe Government\u2019s stance not to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for emergency financing.\u201d",
    "Then-Governor of the Central Bank Professor Lakshman while recognizing positive results of facilities provided by certain agencies such as People\u2019s Bank of China, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China Development Bank, Reserve Bank of India and SAARCFINANCE in foreign exchange inflows, reported that these inflows are barely sufficient to finance the remaining debt service obligations and the likely deficit in the balance of payments.",
    "This statutory report from the Then-Governor of the Central Bank to the then-Finance Minister dated 06th April 2021, needs to be examined along with a development that had taken place within the Monetary Board, said the Supreme Court ruling, adding that the Monetary Board had established two Committees to monitor the external debt situation.",
    "The two committees had proposed to then-Finance Minister Rajapaksa on the Need for a Close Engagement with the International Monetary Fund on 02nd February 2021.",
    "The report having set out the decline of foreign reserves to USD 4.8 billion by end January 2021, had predicted that the reserves will further decline to USD 4 billion by end March 2021, based on the confirmed projected inflows and outflows.",
    "It is the first time that reserves had declined below USD 5 billion after 2009.",
    "The report had further detailed the concerns raised by and the reluctance showed by different sources of foreign funding agencies to continue with any funding facilities to Sri Lanka, in the absence of an IMF intervention.",
    "Against, this backdrop Mahinda Rajapaksa was replaced by Basil Rajapaksa as the country's Finance Minister.",
    "The next report to then-Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa by the then-Central Bank Governor Professor W. D. Lakshman on the 14th of September 2021, repeatedly highlighted the warnings of an economic crisis.",
    "However, Basil Rajapaksa too has repeatedly rejected to secure assistance from the IMF noting that it was NOT the policy of the government.",
