    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s last rate cut has raised inflation risks and there is limited room for further \u2018loosening\u2019 in the short-term, an International Monetary Fund report has said.",
    "\u201cAn additional policy rate cut of 100 bps in November to 10 percent has raised inflation risks,\u201d the report said.",
    "\u201cGoing forward, the monetary policy stance needs to be carefully calibrated to strike the right balance between maintaining a credible inflation path close to the target and supporting economic stabilization\u2026\u201d",
    "\u201cExcessive loosening may make it difficult to control inflation later and even require a policy reversal which would hurt CBSL\u2019s credibility.\u201d",
    "Room for further loosening in the near-term is limited given potential upside inflationary pressures from new taxes and \u00a0possible weakening of the exchange rate, the IMF report said.",
    "A weakening of the exchange rate could come from banks covering dollar exposures from restructuring Ceylon Petroleum Corporation debt, the report said.",
    "A large repayment of Sri Lanka Development Bonds led to central bank sales of reserves in that month.",
    "Large central bank reserve sales are usually accompanied by money printing to offset the sale to maintain a policy rate. Such injections lead to a permanent loss of reserves.",
    "Analysts have also warned that rate cuts in that past including in 2012 and 2018 had led to missed reserve targets and currency collapses.",
    "Sri Lanka interest rates are dictated by the IMF reserve target, not inflation",
    "To collect dollars to cover bank net open position gaps on its foreign exchange book, banks have to use rupee proceeds to buy dollars instead of giving domestic credit, analysts say.",
    "Unless the government repays banks with printed money, such transactions cannot result in forex shortages.",
    "Foreign exchange shortages are a result of inflationary open market operations made to enforce rate cuts or other types of refinancing operations of the central bank.",
    "The IMF claimed that import relaxations could also put pressure on the exchange rate and inflation.",
    "Imports cannot have any impact on the balance of payments unless they are backed by some inflationary credit operations of a central bank to cut rates.",
    "A currency can weaken from imports only if they are financed by an expansion of the circulating medium (the note-issue) on the liabilities side of a central bank.",
    "No private individual or company is capable of generating money and creating balance of payments deficits.",
    "That is why countries that do not have a policy rate like Singapore or Hong Kong have free trade, free flow of capital and no exchange controls, while bigger countries like Argentina or oil producers like Venezuela or Iran have depreciating currencies.",
    "If monetary operations are deflationary (central bank domestic assets are sold down), the exchange rate will not depreciate, but will be under appreciation pressure, triggering an \u2018excess\u2019 of dollars, or a balance of payments surplus.",
    "However, excess dollar purchases to meet reserves targets, which exceed the deflationary securities sales operations of the central bank, can lead to depreciation, after private credit picks up, analysts have warned. Why is Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee appreciating?",
    "In October the central bank was a net buyer in the forex market. In early December also the central bank was buying dollars, market participants say.",
    "Under current accounting definitions, reserves built up by non-note-issue banks in the process of covering NOP gaps are not considered a \u2018balance of payments surplus\u2019.",
    "However, such financial account outflows will contribute to a current account surplus or a narrowing of the current account deficit as per definitions.",
    "Inflationists are now claiming that real interest rates are high, to pressure the central bank to cut rates.",
    "However analysts have pointed out repeatedly that the interest rate is determined by the reserve target and domestic credit, and not the inflation index. Meanwhile the IMF reports said the \u2018neutral\u2019 real policy rate was about 2.5 percent. \u00a0(Colombo/Dec13/2023)"
