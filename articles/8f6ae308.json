    "Nepal\u2019s Parliament building has been set on fire, as protesters have broken in and smashed windows",
    "Hundreds of protesters stormed Nepal\u2019s Parliament building in Kathmandu yesterday after days of anti-corruption demonstrations, setting part of the structure ablaze and vandalising its interior, the BBC reported.",
    "Protesters smashed windows, spray-painted anti-Government slogans, and carried paintings and uprooted plants out of the compound on motorbikes. Around a fire lit at the building\u2019s entrance, many waved Nepal\u2019s flag and chanted against corruption. One graffiti message read: \u201cyou took the wrong fight.\u201d",
    "The unrest followed the resignation of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, who stepped down on moral grounds after at least 19 people were killed during the protests, local media reported. Seventeen died in Kathmandu and two in the eastern city of Itahari, according to police. Dozens more were injured in clashes.",
    "Thousands of demonstrators, many identifying as Generation Z, had gathered outside Parliament to oppose a Government ban on platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, while also calling for an end to political corruption. \u201cRather than the social media ban, I think everyone\u2019s focus is on corruption,\u201d protester Sabana Budathoki told the BBC. Another demonstrator said the ban was meant to \u201csilence\u201d voices, prompting them to \u201craise\u201d their voices instead.",
    "Police responded with water cannons, tear gas, batons and rubber bullets after crowds breached restricted zones. Kathmandu Valley Police spokesman Shekhar Khanal confirmed fatalities and said force was used when protesters scaled the Parliament wall. Tear gas also reached a hospital treating the injured, with one official telling AFP it created \u201ca disturbing situation\u201d for doctors.",
    "The Government argued the social media restrictions were necessary to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. Since Friday, users have faced difficulty accessing platforms, though some have turned to VPNs. Two services have since been restored after registering with authorities.",
    "The United Nations Human Rights Office called for a \u201cprompt and transparent investigation\u201d into the deaths and raised concerns over allegations of disproportionate use of force.",
    "A curfew was imposed around Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu. A Nepal Army spokesman confirmed troops were deployed to enforce order.",
    "The BBC reported the protests have become the most violent in Nepal in years, with grievances over corruption and economic stagnation converging with opposition to the Government\u2019s social media clampdown."
