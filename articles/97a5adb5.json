    "Japanese Ambassador Akio Isomata on Wednesday attended the opening ceremony of the Habarana-Veyangoda Transmission Line Project at New Habarana grid substation, together with Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) General Manager Wasantha Edussuriya, and JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Kenji Kuronuma.",
    "This yen loan project funded by the Government of Japan worth approximately $ 65 million aims to contribute to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic development by strengthening transmission capacity, enhancing the reliability of the power supply and reducing transmission loss through the construction of low-loss transmission lines and substations between Habarana and Veyangoda.",
    "This project is a significant milestone as it is the first yen-loan project which has been completed and handed over to Sri Lanka since the disbursement of 11 suspended yen-loan projects was resumed in July last year, after the interval of three years due to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka.",
    "In his remarks, Ambassador Isomata recollected Japan\u2019s assistance in the electricity sector of Sri Lanka over the past decades and highlighted the features of this project including low-loss, large capacity and long-distance transmission, which also helps Sri Lanka reduce CO2 emissions by cutting down on transmission loss. He also referred to the ongoing bilateral cooperation in promoting the use of renewable energy through the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) under the framework of Article six of the Paris Agreement, as exemplified in three completed or ongoing solar power projects in Sri Lanka. Ambassador Isomata emphasised the importance of inviting foreign investments for the economic development of Sri Lanka, including those from Japan, referring to eradication of corruption, improvement of infrastructure, enhancement of business environment, as well as development of articulate industrial promotion policy, as essential elements to attract foreign investments.",
    "Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody said that that the project was a vital part of Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity system, ensuring stability, reliability, and greater capacity, and it would help prevent the power failures faced in the recent past. He also expressed sincere gratitude to the people of Japan for their long-standing friendship and support and noted that Sri Lanka looked forward to more Japanese investments in future projects."
