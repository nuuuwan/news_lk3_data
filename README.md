ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 189.5 million US dollars from forex markets in October 2024, higher than the 96 million US dollars a month ago, official data showed.

From around late 2022 the central bank has run broadly deflationary policy, triggering balance of payments surpluses amid negative or weak private credit and net repayments of state energy enterprise credit.

When a reserve collecting central bank runs deflationary policy and mop up liquidity from dollar purchases, (generating a BOP surplus) it can either appreciate, depreciate or hold the exchange rate.

The central bank also allowed the exchange rate to appreciate amid balance of payments surplus in sharp contrast to other IMF program, where currencies are not appreciated even in deflationary policy for ‘competitive exchange rates’.

### Qatar suspends role as mediator between Israel and Hamas

Qatar has suspended its work as a mediator in ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, officials say.

The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel “show their willingness” to negotiate.

It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza.

Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas’s political office in Doha “no longer serves its purpose” were “inaccurate”.

“Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,” a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.

“Qatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.”

### GLIMPSES OF COLONIAL CEYLON (1935 – 1947)

*2024-11-10 04:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/glimpses-of-colonial-ceylon-1935-1947/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical anecdotes by LC Arulpragasam)

This is not meant to be a history of the colonial years, but rather a cherry-picking of childhood memories for their quaintness rather than for their historical truth, for socio-cultural insights rather than for historical facts. I can only touch on some cultural oddities of the English-speaking middleclass of those times, since I knew no other. Likewise, I can write only of the last years of colonial rule, since I lived through no others. I write as ‘an old man in a hurry’, because at the age of 88 years, I doubt that there will be others left to recount these tales.

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Pieris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Senior public officials have often to act as buffers between ministers, other important political actors, and other stakeholders in society. On many occasions, one had to absorb a significant degree of shock and act as a facilitator, mediator or referee. A rousing example of this side of one’s responsibilities came by courtesy of Mrs. Vivienne Goonewardene, the LSSP Member of Parliament for Dehiwela-Galkissa and wife of Mr. Leslie Goonewardene, Minister of Communications.

When my son was 11 years old and in middle school, he chose to write about his grandfather, starting his essay with the statement, “my grandfather is an enigma.” I am not sure whether to his young mind my father was so much a puzzle, being both a super -cool grandpa and an exacting teacher, or just simply unpredictable. My father was someone who could relate to his grandchildren only when they were old enough to debate the merits of the separation of state and church or play a championship game of chess. But he also had wonderful adventures which fired my son’s young imagination.

### When Sir John Kotelawala visited St. Joseph’s College

Seventy-four years ago, Fr. Peter A. Pillai OMI, a distinguished educationist and the Rector of St. Joseph’s College, proposed the groundbreaking idea of constructing an Olympic-standard swimming pool at the school. This initiative met with resistance from some old boys and parents. At that time, no school in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) had an Olympic-size pool, let alone a sub-standard swimming facility. The announcement of this ambitious project took the school community by surprise and marked a significant moment in the institution’s history. Fr. Pillai’s vision aimed not just to enhance the school’s facilities but to foster a culture of sports and physical education, paving the way for future generations.

She is the first woman, Black American and South Asian American to be elected Vice President of the US, District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California.

### MONKS IN CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS

*2024-11-10 04:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/monks-in-confrontational-politics/) · `en`

Whether the participation of monks in representative politics is permissible (or proper), has been a matter of periodic discourse in the media.

In preparing this note, I can claim no expertise (nor authority), on the discipline or set of rules for the Maha Sangha. Incidentally, I personally prefer to be considered as “one who seeks to follow the Dhamma,” rather than as a “Buddhist”.

The ordained ones have themselves chosen to enter the Community referred to collectively as “The (Maha) Sangha” They have voluntarily resolved to abandon the lay life and to observe the rules of conduct (more than two hundred), included in the Vinaya Pitaka.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the “forest dweller” (vanavasa) tradition prevails, where the monk lives alone, often in a natural cave, and devotes himself to continuous meditation and solitude, with minimum contact with others. In the commoner monastic tradition, a community of monks live together, with each engaging in his own spiritual practices.
