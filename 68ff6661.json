    "Emmanuel Macron appointed 34-year-old Education Minister Gabriel Attal as his new prime minister on Tuesday, as the French President seeks to breathe new life into his second mandate ahead of European parliament elections.",
    "The move will not necessarily lead to any major political shift, but signals a desire for Macron to try to move beyond last year\u2019s unpopular pension and immigration reforms and improve his centrist party\u2019s chances in the June EU ballot.",
    "Opinion polls show Macron\u2019s camp trailing far-right leader Marine Le Pen\u2019s party by around eight to ten percentage points.",
    "Attal, a close Macron ally who became a household name as government spokesman during the COVID pandemic, will replace outgoing Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.",
    "One of the country\u2019s most popular politicians in recent opinion polls, Attal has made a name for himself as a savvy minister, at ease on radio shows and in parliament.",
    "He will be France\u2019s youngest prime minister and the first to be openly gay.",
    "\u201cGabriel Attal is a bit like the Macron of 2017,\u201d said MP Patrick Vignal, referring to the point at which the President first took office as the youngest leader in modern French history, at the time a popular figure among voters.",
    "Vignal, who belongs to Macron\u2019s Renaissance party and first met Attal more than ten years ago, added that the education minister \u201cis clear, he has authority\u201d.",
    "Attal and Macron would have a combined age just below that of Joe Biden, who is running for a second mandate in this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.",
    "Macron has struggled to deal with a more turbulent parliament since losing his absolute majority shortly after being reelected in 2022.",
    "\u201cThe Macron-Attal duo can bring a new lease of life (to the government),\u201d said Harris Interactive pollster Jean-Daniel Levy.",
    "But opposition leaders were quick to say they did not expect much from the change in prime minister, with Macron himself taking on much of the decision-making.",
    "\u201cElisabeth Borne, Gabriel Attal or someone else, I don\u2019t care, it will just be the same policies,\u201d Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure told France Inter radio."
