### குழந்தைக்கு அப்பா யாரு? நீலமான லிஸ்டை காட்டிய  19 வயசு மாணவி

*2025-09-17 15:34:41* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/குழந்தைக்கு-அப்பா-யாரு-நீலமான-லிஸ்டை-காட்டிய-19-வயசு-மாணவி/175-364774) · `ta`

குழந்தைக்கு அப்பா யாரு? என்ற கேள்விக்கு 19 வயதான மாணவி, ஏழு பேரை கை காட்டிய சம்பவம் இடம்பெற்றுள்ளது.

வேலூர் மாவட்டத்தின் அழகிய தனியார் கல்லூரி, பசுமையான காம்பஸ், இளைஞர்களின் சிரிப்பும், கனவுகளின் ஓட்டமும் நிறைந்த இடம்.

அங்கு படிக்கும் பிரியா, பார்ப்பதற்கு சினிமா நடிகை சினேகாவைப் போன்ற அழகியாக இருந்தாள். நீண்ட கூந்தல், இளம் முகத்தில் ஒளிரும் புன்னகை, உடல் அமைப்பு அனைவரையும் கவர்ந்தது.

கல்லூரி மாணவர்கள் அவளைப் பார்த்து மயங்காதவர்கள் இல்லை. "பிரியா வருகிறாள்" என்றாலே தலை முடியை கோதியபடி இளைஞர்கள் கனவு காண்பார்கள். ஆனால் அவளது வாழ்க்கை, வெளியில் தெரிந்தபடி அழகாக இல்லை.

சிறு வயதிலேயே தாயை இழந்த பிரியா, தன்னுடைய அப்பாவின் இரண்டாவது மனைவி குயிலியின் அரவணைப்பில் வளர்ந்தாள். குயிலிக்கும் அவளது முதல் கணவன் மூலம் ஒரு மகன் இருக்கிறான். பிரியாவை விட இரண்டு வயது இளையவன். இருவரும், உடன் பிறந்த அக்கா, தம்பி போல பழகி வந்தார்கள்.

Several Asian countries, including India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, have already implemented legal strategies to enable overseas voting, and experts consider such reforms in Sri Lanka both timely and necessary.
