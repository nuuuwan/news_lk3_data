    "Accountability remains the \u201cfundamental gap\u201d in Sri Lanka\u2019s attempts to deal with the past, a senior U.N. official has said while warning that \u201cas long as impunity prevails, Sri Lanka will achieve neither genuine reconciliation nor sustainable peace.\u201d",
    "Referring to the Sri Lankan government\u2019s plans to set up a Truth Commission, to probe allegations of war crimes and grave human rights violations during the country\u2019s civil war, U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif noted that Sri Lanka has \u201cwitnessed too many ad hoc commissions\u201d in the past that failed to ensure accountability.",
    "\u201cWhat is needed is a coherent plan that connects the different elements of truth, redress, memorialisation, accountability and creates the right enabling environment for a successful and sustainable transitional justice process,\u201d she said, in an oral update to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva on Wednesday.",
    "While it is fundamentally the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 responsibility to directly acknowledge past violations and undertake credible investigations and prosecutions the international community can \u2013 and should \u2013 play complementary roles in the process until the \u201caccountability deficit\u201d remains, Ms. Al-Nashif said, amid known resistance within Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhala-majority to any international participation.",
    "Further, pointing to recent arrests of a stand-up comedian and a Tamil legislator, the U.N. official said the past months witnessed \u201cthe old reflex of using draconian laws to curtail opposition and control civic space, with a heavy-handed approach to protests far too often\u201d.",
    "While \u201cencouraging\u201d President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s dialogue with Tamil political parties, and \u201cwelcoming\u201d his promise to stop land acquisition for archaeological, forestry or security purposes, the U.N. official underscored the need for new laws, policies and practices that will \u201cmake good on these promises and bring about tangible changes\u201d.",
    "Commenting on the island\u2019s persisting economic crisis, the Deputy Chief of Human Rights observed that it continues to severely impact the \u201crights and well-being of many Sri Lankans\u201d. Terming the International Monetary Fund\u2019s $ 2.9 billion-support an \u201cimportant first step\u201d, she called for \u201crobust safety nets and social protection measures\u201d, in order to ensure that \u201cthe burden of reforms does not further compound inequalities.\u201d",
    "Referring to last year\u2019s historic people\u2019s uprising [Janatha Aragalaya] in the island nation, that ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Ms. Al-Nashif noted that the \u201cfull potential for the historic transformation that would address long-standing challenges has yet to be realised.\u201d"
