    "President Donald Trump said he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next Friday in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, a potential breakthrough after weeks of expressing frustration that more was not being done to quell the fighting.",
    "The Kremlin has not yet confirmed the details, which Trump announced on social media, but both nations had said they expected a meeting could happen as soon as next week.",
    "Such a summit may prove pivotal in a war that began more than three years ago when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths \u2014 although there\u2019s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
    "In comments to reporters at the White House before his post confirming the date and place, Trump suggested that any agreement would likely involve \u201csome swapping of territories,\u201d but he gave no details. Analysts, including some close to the Kremlin, have suggested that Russia could offer to give up territory it controls outside of the four regions it claims to have annexed.",
    "Trump said his meeting with Putin would come before any sit-down discussion involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump also previously agreed to meet with Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy. That stoked fears in Europe that Ukraine could be sidelined in efforts to stop the continent\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II.",
    "Trump\u2019s announcement that he planned to host one of America\u2019s adversaries on U.S. soil broke with expectations that they\u2019d meet in a third country. The gesture gives Putin validation after the U.S. and its allies had long sought to make him a pariah over his war against Ukraine.",
    "Early in Putin\u2019s tenure, he regularly met with his U.S. counterparts. That dropped off and the tone became icier as tensions mounted between Russia and the West after Moscow illegally annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and faced allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.",
    "Putin\u2019s last visit to the U.S. was in 2015, when he attended the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. The meeting in Alaska would be the first U.S.-Russia summit since 2021, when former President Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva.",
    "After announcing Friday a framework aimed at ending decades of conflict elsewhere in the world \u2014 between Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2014 Trump said he would meet with Putin \u201cvery shortly.\u201d His subsequent post said \u201cthe highly anticipated meeting\u201d would happen Aug. 15 in Alaska and more details would follow.",
    "Trump had told reporters that the summit would have been sooner, \u201cbut I guess there\u2019s security arrangements that unfortunately people have to make.\u201d",
    "Trump said, \u201cPresident Putin, I believe, wants to see peace, and Zelenskyy wants to see peace.\u201d He said that, \u201cIn all fairness to President Zelenskyy, he\u2019s getting everything he needs to, assuming we get something done.\u201d",
    "Trump said a peace deal would likely mean Ukraine and Russia would swap some territory they each control.",
    "\u201cNothing easy,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut we\u2019re gonna get some back. We\u2019re gonna get some switched. There\u2019ll be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d",
    "Pressed on if this was the last chance to make a major peace deal, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t like using the term last chance,\u201d and said that, \u201cWhen those guns start going off, it\u2019s awfully tough to get \u2018em to stop.\u201d",
    "Exasperated that Putin did not heed his calls to stop bombing Ukrainian cities, Trump almost two weeks ago moved up his ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement.",
    "The deadline was Friday. But the White House did not answer questions that evening about the state of possible sanctions after Trump\u2019s announcement of an upcoming meeting with Putin.",
    "Prior to Trump announcing the meeting with Putin, his efforts to pressure Russia into stopping the fighting had delivered no progress. The Kremlin\u2019s bigger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at great cost in troops and armor while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities. Russia and Ukraine are far apart on their terms for peace.",
    "Ukrainian forces are locked in intense battles along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line that snakes from northeast to southeast Ukraine. The Pokrovsk area of the eastern Donetsk region is taking the brunt of the punishment as Russia seeks to break out into the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine has significant manpower shortages.",
    "Intense fighting is also taking place in Ukraine\u2019s northern Sumy border region, where Ukrainian forces are engaging Russian soldiers to prevent reinforcements being sent from there to Donetsk.",
    "In the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk, a commander said he believes Moscow isn\u2019t interested in peace.",
    "\u201cIt is impossible to negotiate with them. The only option is to defeat them,\u201d Buda, a commander of a drone unit in the Spartan Brigade, told The Associated Press. He used only his call sign, in keeping with the rules of the Ukrainian military.",
    "\u201cI would like them to agree and for all this to stop, but Russia will not agree to that. It does not want to negotiate. So the only option is to defeat them,\u201d he said.",
    "In the southern Zaporizhzhia region, a howitzer commander using the call sign Warsaw said troops are determined to thwart Russia\u2019s invasion.",
    "\u201cWe are on our land, we have no way out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we stand our ground, we have no choice.\u201d",
    "The Kremlin said Friday that Putin had a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, during which he informed Xi about the results of his meeting earlier this week with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff. Kremlin officials said Xi \u201cexpressed support for the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis on a long-term basis.\u201d",
    "Putin is due to visit China next month. China, along with North Korea and Iran, have provided military support for Russia\u2019s war effort, the U.S. says.",
    "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X that he also had a call with Putin to speak about the latest Ukraine developments. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, which the American president says is helping to finance Russia\u2019s war.",
    "Putin\u2019s calls followed his phone conversations with the leaders of South Africa, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Belarus, the Kremlin said.",
    "The calls suggested to at least one analyst that Putin perhaps wanted to brief Russia\u2019s most important allies about a potential settlement that could be reached at a summit with Trump.",
    "\u201cIt means that some sort of real peace agreement has been reached for the first time,\u201d said Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst.",
    "Putin said in a previous statement that he hoped to meet with Trump as early as next week, possibly in the United Arab Emirates.",
    "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an assessment Thursday that \u201cPutin remains uninterested in ending his war and is attempting to extract bilateral concessions from the United States without meaningfully engaging in a peace process.\u201d",
    "\u201cPutin continues to believe that time is on Russia\u2019s side and that Russia can outlast Ukraine and the West,\u201d it said."
