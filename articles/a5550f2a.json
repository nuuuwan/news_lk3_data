    "Attorney-at-Law Chamari Priyanka Perera, the spouse of the late former Water Supply State Minister Sanath Nishantha, expressed her willingness to fill the void left by her husband's demise",
    "She said the decsion will depend on the request of the Puttalam district\u00a0people\u00a0or the party leaders.",
    "She made her statement after visiting the residence of Anuradha Jayakodi, the security officer of the former state minister who died in a car accident recently.",
    "\"My husband did great service to the Puttalam district as well as to the people of the country. No one who sought help from him was ever turned away empty-handed. My children and I cannot believe what happened to him, and it is still like a dream. Even before my husband's death, some media have announced that I would join politics. No one has asked me when publishing such news. I have not made any statements to any media so far saying that I am joining politics,\" she said.",
    "\"Even though I managed half of the political affairs of my husband and worked as his personal secretary, I had no hope of ever entering politics. There is still no such hope. But if the people of Puttalam, the people of the country and the party leadership ask me to take over the position left by him and continue the mission of the people, I may have to think about it,\" she said."
