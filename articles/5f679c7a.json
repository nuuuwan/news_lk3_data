    "The staff of the Public Utilities Commission will review and revise the tariff proposal before public hearings.",
    "The CEB is forecasting net generation of 8,636 GigaWatt hours from January to June with one coal power plant to shut for scheduled maintenance in June, according to its tariff filing.",
    "Storage from better rainfall will be used for the dry season in the first quarter.",
    "CEB is projecting 2,216.9 GWh of hydro,  4,745 GWh of thermal and 1,674.7 GWh of other renewables.",

    "After that there was marginal surplus of 2.3 billion rupees.",
    "\u201cHowever considering the inherent uncertainties associated with hydroelectric predictions for the year 2025, the projected surplus must be evaluated with caution,\u201d the CEB said.",

    "\u201cIn the light of this, and to ensure financial and operational stability while avoiding potential risk to the reliability of electricity supply, the CEB proposes to maintain prevailing tariff structure for the first six months of 2025.\u201d (Colombo/Dec12/2024)"
