I have always been struck by two distinct moments in history. First, in June 1865, during the tenure of President Abraham Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the United States of America. And yet, there were slaves who were reluctant to embrace the associated freedoms. They appeared to be too attached to their chains.

Then, in July 1945 C.W.W. Kannangara introduced an act in parliament to ensure free education for all Sri Lankans. He was compelled to debate for hours extolling the virtues of this move. There were many who attempted to throw sand in his wheels. Among the elites there were even those who argued that if this piece of legislation was passed, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to find a boy to pluck coconuts on their extensive properties.

We believe that in three days, the new Parliament, made up of representatives elected by the people, will take on a greater responsibility than ever before in history.

This is especially important given the irresponsible behaviour we have seen in Parliament in recent years. Both the incoming Government and the Opposition will have a huge responsibility. Their first task should be to strengthen democracy by helping the country recover from the financial crisis we are facing. Additionally, the new Parliament must reflect the political culture that the people expect, with both the ruling party and the Opposition playing their part.

*2024-11-12 22:30:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/need-for-sustainable-approach-to-development-urgent/) ¬∑ `en`

Professor Mohan Munasinghe, an esteemed academic and Nobel laureate, highlighted the urgent need for a balanced, sustainable approach to development at the University of Colombo‚Äôs Annual Research Symposium.

Speaking to a diverse audience of policymakers, academics and students last week, Prof. Munasinghe stressed the importance of adopting ‚ÄúBalanced Inclusive Green Growth‚Äù (BIGG) to combat the interconnected challenges of climate change, poverty, and economic inequality.

Munasinghe, known for pioneering the ‚ÄúSustainomics‚Äù framework, warned that unchecked climate change and overconsumption by wealthy nations could destabilize ecosystems and deepen global inequalities.

Notably, he said that the world‚Äôs wealthiest 1% emit greenhouse gases at 175 times the rate of the poorest 10%, revealing the stark imbalance in resource consumption and environmental impact.

### The demand of the people's uprising from Pottuvil to Polikandi

*2024-11-12 16:14:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198514) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Tamil people demand self-determination. Sri Lankan election Nov 14 imposes Tamil Eelam issue. Tamil nationalism unity needed. Reject Sinhalese communal parties like JVP. Left parties oppose Tamil self-rule. Vote for Tamil unity candidates. Universal referendum key to permanent solution.

üü©

The solution to the ethnic problem of the Tamil people will be permanent by the use of our self -determination.

Therefore, the people's upgrading movement has called for the use of the Tamil people's votes to use the unity of the Tamil nationalism and the strength of the Tamil people.

The Sri Lankan parliamentary election is scheduled for November 14. While this is an election that will decide its power, this election has been imposed on the Tamil Eelam.

While the Sri Lankan Parliament does not provide any solution to the political issue of the Tamil people, we are in a compulsion to ensure our representation. Similarly, there is a need for the Tamil people to express our political position.

Sri Lanka's chauvinist parties are just as the saints of the Tamil people, and the Tamil people are demanding a mystery, especially the younger society, as there is no political issue for the Tamil people.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs state-run Ceylon Electricity Board‚Äôs re-structuring faces execution risk, Fitch Ratings said, while confirming its ‚ÄòBB+(lka) rating on expected state support.

‚ÄúThe new Electricity Act includes provisions to unbundle CEB‚Äôs generation, transmission and distribution into separate entities,‚Äù Fitch said.

‚ÄúWe believe the unbundling will improve CEB‚Äôs efficiency and competitiveness. The utility is already preparing separate financials, maintains separate bank accounts and is in the process of allocating assets and liabilities for the three units.

‚ÄúHowever, we believe the restructuring faces execution risk and may be contingent on the outcome of Sri Lanka‚Äôs general election on 14 November.‚Äù

A deviation from cost reflective tariffs is risk to the CEB‚Äôs balance sheet.
