### Extreme Asian heat spurs LNG demand ahead of summer months

*2024-05-31 19:26:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99569/extreme-asian-heat-spurs-lng-demand-ahead-of-summer-months) · `en`

Extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region as importers seek cargoes ahead of summer, with imports in South Asia hitting records.

This could tighten available supply and further lift Asian spot prices that have already gained a third since April, with heatwaves across South and Southeast Asia boosting air-conditioner use and other cooling demand. Prices are now at a near six-month peak at $12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and are expected to remain elevated.

“Spot prices are now driven by Asian demand. Temperatures in South Asia are rising due to a heatwave, increasing power demand,” said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE.

While China may still see lower demand compared with its record breaking shipments in 2021, demand from India and the rest of Asia has compensated for any drop-off, Adibi said.
