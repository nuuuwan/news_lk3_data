    "Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the country\u2019s relationship with India does not depend on New Delhi\u2019s ties with China, adding that the island nation would not do anything to hurt India\u2019s security.",
    "In an exclusive interview with Firstpost, Wickremesinghe said, \u201cIndia worried about its own security. Sri Lanka won\u2019t do anything to hurt its security.\u201d",
    "When asked about his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, Wickremesinghe said, \u201cI have known Narendra Modi since he was a Chief Minister. Our vision was a step forward. We talked about trade and investment.\u201d",
    "He also highlighted India\u2019s help when the country underwent an economic crisis last year. In May, India extended a $1bn credit line for Sri Lanka by a year. The credit line is part of the $4bn in emergency assistance extended by India.",
    "Talking about the upcoming general election in India, the Sri Lankan president said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what the state elections say.\u00a0 BJP has the advantage, it is a single party led by a single leader. Sri Lanka must live with what happens in New Delhi.\u201d",
    "Commenting on the current economy in Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe said, \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet but will come out. We still have to balance the budget and trade and increase our revenues. I hope things will get better in 2024-2025. We can\u2019t go on in traditional mode and need a new economy.\u201d"
