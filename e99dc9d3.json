    "Thai Ambassador in Sri Lanka Poj Harnpol stressed that the Thai government has not taken any decisions regarding Thai Raja, Kandula Raja or any other elephant gifted to Sri Lanka, although diverse views in this regard appear in social media.",
    "During his visit to the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy to look at the tusker Thai Raja gifted by the Thai government to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, he told the media that the Thai government has not taken any diplomatic-level decisions to reclaim any elephant gifted to Sri Lanka. Thai Raja is at present under the care of the Suduhumpola Rajamaha Vihara.",
    "However, he said Thailand was prepared to provide the expertise to care for elephants in Sri Lanka. The Ambassador further said that tusker Muturaja was now getting on quite well and that false rumours would only create controversies.",
    "Diyawadana NIlame Pradeep Nilanga Dela said as the entire domesticated elephants were not subject to cruelty despite minor incidents, it is a matter of concern that a veterinary hospital provides treatment to elephants after surgery.",
    "Senior Professor Asoka Dangolla of the Veterinary Medical Faculty of the Peradeniya University who provides medical treatments to the elephants of Sri Dalada Maligawa, was present at the occasion. (Shane Seneviratne)"
