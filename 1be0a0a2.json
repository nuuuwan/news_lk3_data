    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The National Water Supply and Drainage Board says it is working on introducing a revisable water tariff formula, much like the fuel price formula, in the future.",
    "\u201cWe need electricity, which has risen in cost, to treat and supply water. We need to import chemicals to treat water, so there is a dollar component. So we are focusing on introducing a water tariff formula factoring in these,\u201d State Minister for Water Supply Sanath Nishantha said.",
    "\u201cOur officials are currently working on this, it will be like the monthly fuel price formula.\u201d Water prices were unlikely to come down in the near future, Nishantha said.",
    "\u201cWe are working with the ADB to come up with a formula in January,\u201d Minister of Water Supply and estate infrastructure development Jeevan Thondaman said.",
    "Both ministers were speaking at a media briefing held to announce an upcoming International Water Conference to be held in Sri Lanka from Dec 14-15.",
    "Thondaman pointed out the lack of rain water harvesting methods. \u201cYou use water treated at a high cost through loans, that is fit to drink, to wash cars and dogs and water plants,\u201d Thondaman said.",
    "The International Water Conference 2023 will see various topics discussed such as how best to use renewable energy and energy efficiency in water supply and treatment, rainwater harvesting, exchange of knowhow between international experts and local officials, how to use smart technology in water resource management, and promote public private partnerships in water supply.
