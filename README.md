### Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba decides to step down

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to resign to avoid a split within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the broadcaster NHK is reporting.

The announcement on Sunday comes weeks after Ishiba denied reports he planned to step down over a historic defeat his LDP-led coalition suffered in a July election, saying he wanted to make sure the tariff deal struck with the United States was appropriately implemented.

Since assuming his role last October, Ishiba has seen electoral losses wipe out his party’s majority in both houses of parliament, with a bruising electoral defeat in October leaving it with a minority in the more powerful lower house.

The defeats have made it more difficult for Ishiba’s coalition to implement its policy objectives.

Amid the country’s growing political instability, the prime minister has faced calls to resign from mostly right-wing opponents within his party, who urged him to take responsibility for the results of July’s vote.

Australian authorities on Sunday (Sep 7) deployed drones and a helicopter to monitor the waters around a popular Sydney beach after a surfer was killed by a great white shark on Saturday, officials said.

Two beaches in Australia’s most populous city remained closed on Sunday after the attack on Saturday morning that took place about 100m from shore while the man was surfing with friends at Long Reef Beach, in the north of the New South Wales state capital.

The experienced surfer was pulled from the water by other surfers, but had lost too much blood and died at the scene, police said. It was the first shark-attack death in Sydney since a swimmer was killed off a beach in February 2022, which was the city’s first since 1963.

On Sunday, the state’s main water rescue organisation, Surf Life Saving NSW, deployed drones and a helicopter to surveil the area for the shark, New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) said.

### இன்றுசந்திர கிரகணம் :  நிகழவுள்ள அதிசயத்தை பாருங்கள்

2022ஆம் ஆண்டுக்குப் பிறகு நிகழும் மிக நீண்ட முழுச் சந்திர கிரகணம் (Lunar Eclipse 2025) இன்றிரவு நிகழ்கிறது.

இந்தப் பிரபஞ்சம் பல வானியல் அதிசயங்களைக் கொண்டதாகும். இங்கு நிகழும் பல விஷயங்கள் நம்மை வியப்பின் உச்சத்திற்கே போய்விடும். இப்படிக் கூட நடக்குமா என நாம் யோசிக்கும் பல வினோத நிகழ்வுகள் கூட நடக்கும்.

அப்படித் தான் இன்றைய தினம் மிக நீண்ட முழுச் சந்திர கிரகணம் நிகழ்கிறது. கடந்த 2022க்கு பிறகு மிக நீண்ட ஒரு சந்திர கிரகணமாக இது இருக்கும்.

இதுபோல அடுத்த முழு சந்திர கிரகணத்தைப் பார்க்க, நாம் 2028 டிசம்பர் 31 வரை காத்திருக்க வேண்டும் என்கிறார் புனேவில் உள்ள தேசிய வானொலி வானியற்பியல் மையத்தின் (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics) இணைப் பேராசிரியருமான திவ்யா ஓபரோய்.

கிரகணங்கள் அரிதானவை என்றும், ஒவ்வொரு பௌர்ணமி அல்லது அமாவாசையிலும் நிகழாது என்றும் ஓபரோய் விளக்கினார். சந்திரன் பூமியைச் சுற்றிவரும் பாதை, சூரியனைப் பூமி சுற்றி வரும் பாதையிலிருந்து சுமார் 5 டிகிரி சாய்ந்துள்ளது என்பதே இதற்குக் காரணமாகும்.

### 88 postal operators suspend services to US over tariffs: UN

*2025-09-07 07:23:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112241/88-postal-operators-suspend-services-to-us-over-tariffs-un) · `en`

Postal traffic to the United States plunged more than 80 per cent following Washington’s imposition of new tariffs, with 88 operators worldwide fully or partially suspending services, the Universal Postal Union said on Saturday (Sep 6).

The UPU, the United Nations’ postal cooperation agency, is working on “the rapid development of a new technical solution that will help get mail moving to the United States again”, its director general Masahiko Metoki said in a statement.

US President Donald Trump’s administration announced in late July that it was abolishing a tax exemption on small packages entering the United States from Aug 29.

The move sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in Australia, Britain, France, Germany, India, Italy and Japan, that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.

The UPU said data exchanged between postal operators via its systems showed that traffic to the United States was down 81 per cent on Aug 29, compared to a week earlier.

Director General of the Bureau Dipani Weerakoon said that the decision was taken following discussions held after an accident that occurred a few weeks ago, where a school van collided with a sand tipper truck.

Accordingly, Weerakoon stated that vehicles engaged in mineral transportation during these time periods must be parked in appropriate areas off the main roads.

She further said since September 4, instructions have been issued throughout the country via Divisional Secretariats.

### Rare total lunar eclipse ‘blood moon’ to be visible from Sri Lanka tonight

Sri Lankans will have a rare opportunity to witness the phenomenon known as “blood moon” later today (07), said Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, the Head of the Department of Physics and Director, Astronomy and Space Science Unit of the University of Colombo and the Chairman of the Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies.

The spectacular celestial event is set to light up the skies tonight, as the Moon undergoes a total lunar eclipse, turning an eerie, deep red for 82 minutes.

Known as a Blood Moon, this will be the last total lunar eclipse of the year and is expected to be visible to nearly 85% of the global population. Unlike many eclipses confined to specific regions, this phenomenon will be observable across much of Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa, with Sri Lanka offering some of the clearest views.

### UK police arrest about 425 at protest for banned Palestine Action

*2025-09-07 05:45:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112236/uk-police-arrest-about-425-at-protest-for-banned-palestine-action) · `en`

British police arrested around 425 people on Saturday (Sep 6) at a demonstration backing Palestine Action, the pro-Palestinian group banned by the government as a terrorist organisation.

Britain outlawed Palestine Action in July after some of its members broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged military planes. The group has also targeted defence firms with links to Israel, accusing the government of complicity in alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near parliament in London to oppose the ban, holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”

Police said those detained were arrested for offences including assaulting officers and supporting a proscribed organisation. “Officers ... have been subjected to an exceptional level of abuse including punches, kicks, spitting and objects being thrown, in addition to verbal abuse,” London’s Metropolitan Police wrote on X.

### A Passage North

*2025-09-07 01:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-passage-north/) · `en`

Soon after I read Brotherless Night, I found another book about the conflict, which was also a sort of pendent to the Booker Prize winning Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, and had indeed been shortlisted for the book the year before Shehan Karunatilleka won it.

Unlike those two, which were a retelling of history, this was an introspective novel that explores something of the suffering caused by the war – though it did have set pieces within that were in fact retellings of actual episodes during the war.

*2025-09-07 00:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-guardians-of-the-world/) · `en`

By cultivating within ourselves the qualities of moral shame and fear of wrongdoing we not only accelerate our own progress along the path to deliverance, but also contribute our share towards the protection of the world. Given the intricate interconnections that hold between all living forms, to make the sense of shame and fear of wrong the guardians of our own minds is to make ourselves guardians of the world. As the roots of morality, these two qualities sustain the entire efficacy of the Buddha’s liberating path; as the safeguards of personal decency, they at the same time preserve the dignity of the human race.

### POWER POLITICS

*2025-09-06 23:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/power-politics-2/) · `en`

It is said that Kotelawala made an application to the Central Bank for the transfer of a large sum of money to Britain for the purchase of property. NU mentioned that the application was made during the first premiership of Dudley Senanayake, “as financial protection from unsettling forces which he [Kotelawala] felt would overtake the country” (N.U. Jayawardena, c.1985, p.62). According to the Central Bank and Exchange Control regulations at that time, the transfer of such a large sum was not permissible, and would have violated existing regulations. As such, NU recommended the refusal of Kotelawala’s application to the Finance Minister J.R. Jayewardene and Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. This action would have serious repercussions in the future. NU’s daughter describes this episode:

### Arundhati Roy’s international splash with her 2025 non-fiction book

*2025-09-06 23:50:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/arundhati-roys-international-splash-with-her-2025-non-fiction-book/) · `en`

She writes autobiographically on her life with her mother and brother and titles her book Mother Mary Comes To Me, mother Mary being her own mother – Mary Roy, a Malayali Jacobite Syrian Christian who was educator and women’s rights activist known for winning a Supreme Court lawsuit in 1986 awarding equal rights to women to inherit family property. The book is published by Hamish Hamilton. I was sent a Guardian article which was an edited extract from the book.

It carries the long title: Arundhati Roy on her fugitive childhood: ‘My knees were full of scars and cuts – a sign of my wild, imperfect, fatherless life.’ The book appears to be starkly telling, cruelties and all, with a mother who was ill with asthma and on steroids and very very short tempered, who vented her wrath on her two small children. It seems to be brutally honest and thus the sympathy the reader feels will be for the two children; the mother too.

At this meeting Lalith and Premachandra who were Cabinet ministers at that time had also voted in favour of a confidence vote in the President though by this time they had affixed their signatures to the motion referred to by the Speaker.

### China’s Xi Jinping hosts a Summit of leaders of half the world, with a spectacular display of military force

On September 1, The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) based in The Hague, Netherlands, passed a resolution that “legal criteria have been met to establish Israel is committing genocide in Gaza”.

Israel’s conduct also meets the legal definition as laid out in the 1948 United Nations convention on genocide, which was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany. The convention defines genocide as “crimes committed with intent to destroy, in whole or part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.

The IAGS recognize that while the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage, was itself a war crime, “Israel’s response has not only been directed towards Hamas but has targeted Gaza’s entire (Palestinian) population”.

United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has been in politics for more than five decades. Wickremesinghe who has served as Member of Parliament, Deputy Minister, Cabinet Minister, leader of the Opposition, Prime Minister and President has often been described as a “spent force” in politics. The resilient Ranil has always proved his detractors wrong by bouncing back into the ring spiritedly. Recent events seem to indicate that the irrepressible Ranil Wickremesinghe may yet again demonstrate that he is a person who cannot be written off easily.
