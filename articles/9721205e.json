    "Professor Liyanage Amarakirthi of Peradeniya has written a book in Sinhala, vishvavidyalaya yanu kumak da? (A university, what is it?). His treatment of the subject is eclectic, and an adequate response will need an essay of at least 20 pages. I have not seen any comment on the book for nearly two years. I will remark on some selected themes, holding in my mind that the book is reading material for Sinhala readers, for whom the supply is scanty.",
    "The characteristic feature of a university is that it is a teaching institution; absent students, no matter how many researchers it has, there is no university. If it does carry on research only, it is a research institute and not a university. (There are two exceptions: All Souls College in Oxford, where except during a few years past, it has had no students although its accomplished Fellows taught in the university; the other was Rockefeller University in New York City, where for many years, there were only research scholars; now it has scientists who also teach graduate students in medical sciences.) Secondly, universities are old venerable institutions developed in Europe in the Middle Ages and spread worldwide, later. There are now universities in British Columbia to Brisbane and in Santiago de Chile to Osaka in Japan with Africa in between. Wherever they are, certain features have remained unchanged. Were a professor from St. Andrews University in 1487, to visit Ibadan University today, he would meet a vice-chancellor wearing the same clothes of office and a dean, attend a faculty meeting and, with luck, sit on a committee where a student defended his thesis for the award of a Ph.D. degree. He would be reminded of \u2018disputations\u2019 (disputandum), a standard procedure for examining students in his own university, in an age without paper examinations.",
    "There are thousands of universities in the world today and they vary in what is taught and how students are taught. Oxford and Cambridge are famous for close supervision of their students; and there are many universities where lectures are delivered from a remote podium to hundreds of students, who listen on loudspeakers. And there are MOOCs. Many university graduates complain that they never saw the star scholars or scientists in their university whom they see on television. Universities also vary in ownership. In the US, 70 percent of all undergraduates study in government universities and colleges. Wisconsin University, where Professor Amarakirthi studied, is one of the best-regarded land grant colleges as are those of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York. City or county governments run their universities and colleges e.g. City University in New York, Hunter College in Manhattan and Queens College in Fresh Meadows. Some universities were started by the community (e.g. Harvard College in 1635) and prospered with donations of foundation money by alumni and other philanthropists. Princeton was a college run by the Methodist church and the first lay president was Woodrow Wilson in 1802. (His father was a Methodist priest.) Johns Hopkins provided the initial funds to start the University which became a singularly important institution. The first universities were started by government in China, India, Japan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka. In some countries, there are universities owned by the church (e.g. Ateneo universities in the Philippines) or private persons, some of which are run for profit. One can buy shares in privately owned for-profit universities on the Manila stock exchange. This variety is sorely missed in Professor Amarakirthi\u2019s book. Harvard was not the first university in the world; universities exist worldwide, the private sector does not always own them, and there are high-quality government universities All the same, they are fundamentally teaching institutions; some undertake research, others don\u2019t.",
    "Similarly, the distinction between liberal arts education and training for professions is very old. In medieval universities, there were five faculties: arts, law (canon and civil), theology, medicine and philosophy. Theology, Law and Medicine Faculties taught students for the professions. On completing 4 years in the faculty of arts, a student received a B.A. degree and after 2 more years of learning, he received an M.A. degree. Some were designated as ius ubique docendi, qualifying them to teach in other institutions. In older universities, even now, some students are awarded a B.A. degree no matter their engineering graduation (There are still docents in some European university systems.) The highest faculty was the philosophy faculty. Even now, your professors are philosophiae doctor. The other faculties have their own doctoral degrees: J.D. or LL.D., M.D. and D.Th. Holders of these degrees may proceed to receive a Ph.D. degree. The present arguments about liberal arts education spring from new concerns.",
    "What universities and their prototypes taught have changed over time and place. (I dealt with this question in two lectures delivered in Colombo: [Sarasvati meets Lakshmi (2004) and What are universities for? 2004.)] The market has always determined university output. In medieval Europe, the church (sacerdotum) was the most powerful institution in the res publica Christiana. The other two imperium and studium were, in many ways, subordinate to the first. Universitas generale primarily served the church. They were controlled and run by clergymen, although graduates in other faculties were more numerous. Even those like Thomas More, Cranmer and (later) Richelieu who served in royal courts were churchmen. The principal motive of settlers who set up Harvard College was \u2018educating civic leaders and preparing a learned clergy\u2019.",
    "It took a long time for universities to become institutions critically important to the economy and society. Inventions that summed up the Industrial Revolution in England were the work of talented and skilled craftsmen. We have the evidence of Edward Gibbon and the recent analytical work of Joel Mokyr (The enlightened economy, 2009) that the two English universities had little to do with those advances in technology, that brought about an industrial revolution. In a blurb for the official history of Cambridge University, it is remarked that \u2018In 1970 the university was a provincial seminary enhanced by a traditional prestige\u2026.\u2019. Someone remarked at the beginning of the 19th century that \u2018Princeton University was the most expensive men\u2019s club in US.\u2019 Universities became important agents in the economy after about 1850, because the economy changed to need their participation. Discoveries in physics, chemistry and biology in universities began to be exploited by both industrialists and farmers. Far-flung enterprises like railways needed managers with special training. The land grant colleges in US were partly a response to these demands. The \u2018Wisconsin Idea\u2019 of a university as a \u2018service centre\u2019 where people resorted to solving their problems was symptomatic of this transformation. \u2018\u2026 a very high proportion of the leading industries in the United States, perhaps as many as 80 percent, are derived from discoveries in American universities.\u2019 (Jonathan R. Cole, 2009). The rest of the world has many of those industries. The Cavendish Labs in Cambridge and universities in Britain, Germany, France and Russia were similarly and equally productive. We have reached a new age where a discovery or an invention in a university itself becomes an industry. Silicon Valley provides examples. There are \u2018enterprise incubators\u2019 in universities like Harvard and MIT.",
    "During the 19th century, population congregations became more urbanized and complex. Individual scholars (Karl Marx) and other thinkers set out to understand those complexities and to find ways of improving living in exploding cities. There are gruesome accounts of filth and squalor in cities including Chicago in the 19th century and Dickens provided such pictures of urban life in England. Universities were established to seek solutions to such problems. In Britain, the London School of Economics and Political Science of the University of London was a response. In Cambridge, the faculty of Economics and Politics came up much later and the first students sat for the tripos in 2005. All over the world, there was a rapid growth of university departments where economics, sociology, anthropology, politics and history were studied. These massive changes in the economy and society demanded responding changes in universities. That interest is now shown in the acronym STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects taught in schools and universities. Liberal arts studies have suffered in comparison. I am not sure that Armageddon is around the corner if teaching liberal arts in universities were to decline.",
