    "The European Union has congratulated Anura Kumara Dissanayake upon his election and inauguration as President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.",
    "Issuing a statement, the EU further said that the people of Sri Lanka demonstrated once again their commitment to democracy, with a high voter turnout at the presidential elections held on 21 September.",
    "\u201cElections took place in a peaceful manner and in a competitive political environment. By invitation of the authorities of Sri Lanka, the EU deployed an Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) to undertake an independent, impartial and technical assessment of all aspects of the electoral process. This further reflects EU\u2019s close cooperation with Sri Lanka on good governance and democracy\u201d, the statement added.",
    "Furthermore, it said that the EU EOM indicated in its preliminary report that fundamental freedoms were broadly respected and that the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) conducted the process independently and with resolve, ensuring transparency at all key stages of the election.",
    "\u201cThe EU EOM identified areas where progress is needed, in particular, enhancing transparency in political finance and advancing women participation in public and political life. The EU EOM will publish a comprehensive final report including recommendations to improve future electoral process,\u201d the EU highlighted.",
    "Meanwhile, it also stated that Sri Lanka is an important and valued partner of the EU, adding that the EU\u2019s cooperation on good governance, human rights and the rule of law, our relationship as trade and investment partners, and our joint work to combat climate change and promote green transition are built on shared commitment to democratic values.",
    "\u201cWe look forward to working with President Dissanayake and continue EU\u2019s support to Sri Lanka\u2019s reforms to bring the country to economic recovery, lasting reconciliation and inclusive prosperity and growth\u201d, the EU mentioned."
