    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s government continues to defend its domestic debt optimisation (DDO) programme against opposition criticism, noting that the banking system remains intact and assuring superannuation fund holders that their savings are safe.",
    "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya told reporters on Wednesday July 05 that unlike with Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign debt holders, domestic holders of government securities have not been asked to go for a haircut.",
    "\u201cThere is no talk of a cut. It\u2019s just a maturity extension,\u201d Siyambalapitiya said.",
    "The state minister said the island nation is looking to restructure 17 billion of its total external debt. Sri Lanka\u2019s total debt is estimated to be around 83.6 billion dollars, the domestic component of which is about 42.",
    "Out of this 42 billion dollars, Siyambalapitiya said, nine billion will be restructured.",
    "\u201cThere are 57.2 million bank accounts. Many were worried that their bank balance would be affected,\u201d he said, adding that the DDO programme has protected the banking system.",
    "Opposition MPs and other critics, however, have claimed that the burden of the DDO has been placed unfairly on superannuation funds such as the employees\u2019 provident fund (EPF) and employees\u2019 trust fund (ETF) without the consent of their respective membership.",
    "State Minister Siyambalapitiya claimed that the account balances of EPF and ETF holders will not be affected by the DDO, nor will the interest paid to individual members on their savings.",
    "Opposition MPs have raised concerns about a historical lack of consent in the state-controlled superannuation funds\u2019 investments over the decades.",
    "In a recent parliamentary debate on the DDO, legislators questioned the net present value (NPV) hit on the EPF from the restructuring programme given the lack of disclosure on its investments by its management.",
    "Opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M A Sumanthiran said in parliament that the EPF did not disclose the purchase price, face value and market price of each investment, which was required under its law.",
    "Sri Lanka legislators question NPV hit on EPF from DDRSee more",
    "Sri Lanka has asked foreign holders of its international sovereign bonds (ISBs) to take a 30 percent haircut. Holders of locally issued dollar-denominated bonds have been given three options to choose from: a 30-percent haircut with a six-year maturity at a 4-percent interest rate, no haircut with a 15-year maturity at a 1.5-percent interest rate, and exchanging their current bonds to local currency-denominated bonds with no haircut and a 10-year maturity at the standing lending facility rate plus 1-percent interest rate.
