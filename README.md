### Dynasties of Deceit: The Philippines‚Äô Curse

*2024-12-22 02:52:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dynasties-of-deceit-the-philippines-curse/) ¬∑ `en`

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, crafted in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution, was supposed to mark the dawn of a new democratic era. The ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., after decades of corruption, repression, and dynastic rule, was a victory for the Filipino people, or so they were told. Yet, the Constitution, supposedly a tool for dismantling the oppressive old order, contains a glaring, unimplemented clause: Article II, Section 26, which bans political dynasties. Nearly four decades later, this promise remains a cruel joke, the prohibition nothing more than a symbol of a nation shackled by its own feudal past. Political dynasties thrive unabated, and the Philippines remains trapped in a cycle of oligarchy, where power is passed down like a family heirloom, not earned through democratic means.

### Ronnie de Mel‚Äôs George Keyt Paintings

*2024-12-22 02:49:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ronnie-de-mels-george-keyt-paintings/) ¬∑ `en`

I first met Ronnie de Mel (1925-2024) less than six months before his passing. At the time, he was 98 years old and confined to a wheelchair, yet his memory and sharp intellect were as formidable as ever. The purpose of our initial meeting was to interview him for information about another former politician with whom he had worked somewhat closely in the legislature. De Mel hailed from a different era‚Äîthree or perhaps four generations before mine. Despite the age gap, his critical thinking and incisive responses often made more sense than those of many of his successors. In his most recent book Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha commented de Mel was ‚Äú‚Ä¶intellectually head and shoulders above all subsequent Finance Ministers‚Äù. It is no exaggeration to say that de Mel was one of the architects of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Open Economy, introduced in 1977. As Minister of Finance, he successfully balanced 11 consecutive budgets and was a trusted confidante of President J.R. Jayewardene.

### Sri Pada ‚Äì certainties, myths, memories

*2024-12-22 02:49:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-pada-certainties-myths-memories/) ¬∑ `en`

With the poya of December, the Sri Pada season is declared open. This announcement was made on Dec. 14 ‚Äì Unduvap Poya ‚Äì a week ago. As always, with seeing the press announcement, a rush of memories crowded my mind. They had to be shared. Personal but permissible, I expect.

Sri Pada, aka Adam‚Äôs Peak and Samanala Kanda, is the fifth tallest peak in Sri Lanka‚Äôs Hill Country at 2,243 m or 7, 359 ft. The mountain rises from its foothills grown commercially with tea, and soars as a conical shaped single rock whose peak now has been flattened to accommodate viewing areas and buildings, including a temple where the monks in charge live. It is under the religious purview of the Saman Devale in Ratnapura. Needless to mention is the fact that its fame is due to the footprint at the very summit, gold painted.

### Some Vignettes of Italy

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of memoirs by LC Arulpragasam)

I need now to recount my sailing adventures, or shall we say, misadventures. Although I had never sailed before, I did not think twice before I shoved off on my own. On my first effort, with the wind at my back, I unfurled my sails in goose-wing style and was soon hurtling along at a whistling pace. I cannot describe the exhilaration of being one with the water and the wind, with the wind at my back and the gurgle of water in my wake. After about two hours, I reached the other side of the lake near Trevignano, just as the sun was setting.

Although her political aspiration was ‚Äúto lighten the burden on the suffering masses‚Äù Sirimavo soon found that the economic realities would not allow her a free hand. In the early sixties the terms of trade, which had been favourable in the fifties, declined sharply. The Korean war boom had run its course. The rise in the price of tea had plateaued and the trend was now downwards. Our external assets were diminishing and when Felix became finance minister he had no alternative but to cut down on imports drastically.

### Ranil skips two presidential elections backing common candidates Fonseka and Sirisena

Mahinda‚Äôs victory (in 2005) marked an inflection point. He did not abrogate the ceasefire agreement he had inherited, and even engaged in a round of negotiations with the LTTE. At the same time, he allowed the Sri Lankan military a freer rein. In December 2005, for instance, the navy retaliated to an LTTE bombing by attacking a residential area in the northern town of Mannar.

In 2006, the JVP, then in Mahinda‚Äôs alliance, filed a case in the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of an earlier merger of the Tamil-dominated North and East, effected in 1987. Fighting escalated and the ceasefire collapsed. Mahinda and Gota ‚Äì by then appointed the secretary to the ministry of defence ‚Äì followed the LTTE‚Äôs example by opting for a strategy of total war.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka has to avoid ‚Äòstop-go‚Äô (boom-bust) cycles involving unsustainable monetary and fiscal stimulus that lead to crises, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana has said after Fitch upgraded Sri Lanka from default status.

Sri Lanka completed a restructuring of sovereign bonds on December 20, and the country was classified as CCC+, 5 levels above restructured default.

‚ÄúAll the hard work and sacrifice, particularly by the people of Sri Lanka, has now paid off and Sri Lanka has the opportunity for a fresh start in the New Year,‚Äù Siriwardana said in an x.com post.

‚ÄúHowever, this growth cannot come at he expense of economic stability,‚Äù Siriwardana said.

‚ÄúAll too often in the past, whenever the economy has stabilized following a shock, we are too eager to provide unsustainable fiscal and monetary stimulus to re-invigorate growth.

‚ÄúThe result is a rapid return to instability ‚Äì which has characterized several stop-go cycles in Sri Lanka‚Äôs post-independence economic history.‚Äù

Iceland‚Äôs president presented a new government on Saturday under Social Democratic Prime Minister Kristrun Frostadottir that aims to cut inflation and interest rates and hold a referendum on European Union membership by 2027, public broadcaster RUV said.

Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir, leader of the Reform Party, will be minister of foreign affairs, it added.

It will be the first time in Iceland that the leaders of all the governing parties will be women, and the first time that the country will have a female prime minister and a female president - Halla Tomasdottir - simultaneously, the broadcaster said.

### President Dissanayake to visit China mid-January: Report

Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will travel to the island‚Äôs largest bilateral lender China for talks in January, he said on Saturday, days after completing a long-delayed foreign debt restructure.

China accounted for more than half of Sri Lanka‚Äôs bilateral debt at the time of the 2022 economic crash, when Colombo ran out of foreign exchange to pay for essential imports such as food, fuel and medicines.

Its economy is recovering after receiving an International Monetary Fund rescue package and imposing austerity reforms aimed at repairing the government‚Äôs ruined finances.

Leftist Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.

‚ÄúI will be going to China mid next month‚Äù, he told reporters, without setting an exact date.

This is because we do not know it or not, but in our family and relatives.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka has allowed the import of buses, special purpose vehicles like cranes and gully bowsers and small motorized vehicles like go karts with penalties if importers carry large unsold stocks for over three months.

The first stage of import relaxation started through a gazette issued on December 18.

Sri Lanka has suffered imports controls, exchange controls, depreciation and social unrest due to initially central bank re-finance of rural credit, purchase of maturing debt from past deficits to keep rates down (direct market operations) and inflationary open market operations after the end of a civil war.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank has cut rates to 8.00 percent and also started a ‚Äòsingle policy rate‚Äô ahead of opening vehicle imports.

Analysts had warned that it could lead to a credit shock being accommodated by the central bank with negative consequences on the exchange rate, which is in any case under an inconsistent policy.
