The National Peace Council has urged the new presidential election to be given priority to inter -government reconciliation.

In this regard, the report issued by the Peace Council on Tuesday (17).

As the presidential election campaigns end, the focus from the election contest must return to the country's emergency challenges. While the election results are uncertain, the new president is going to take responsibility for a country that is wrestling with the economic stability and the deepest rooted corruption and punishment culture.

A challenge to note in the presence of the new government that requires a long -term racism through a political solution based on devolution. The new president must give priority to this issue to bring about sustainable peace and unity to the country.

### Sri Lanka’s next leader: can make or break the nation

*2024-09-18 02:03:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-next-leader-can-make-or-break-the-nation/4-766815) · `en`

As Sri Lanka prepares for its upcoming Presidential election, the stakes have never been higher. In 2022, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis that brought the nation to a standstill, marked by fuel shortages, soaring inflation, and widespread protests. Since then, the country has taken steps toward stabilising the economy, but much remains to be done. This election is not just about choosing a leader but about securing the nation’s future and ensuring continued recovery from the devastating economic collapse.

The road to recovery has been difficult, but significant progress has been made since 2022, largely supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. However, Sri Lanka remains vulnerable, and the next president must navigate the country through this challenging period with a steady hand. Voters, therefore, must consider candidates who possess the qualities necessary to complete the recovery process and set the nation on a path to sustainable growth.

Either the country enters a new era on 21st with AKD at the helm or continues to struggle facing crisis after crisis under the current system

The success of NPP’s entire economic trajectory hinges on reforming governance. This is the pillar on which the new system would be built and that was the message from the Aragalaya generation. AKD’s resolve to change the rotten political culture and moribund system of governance should therefore stabilise the economy faster with IMF assistance and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth with equity. Voters seem to have understood this message for the first time

Thirty-eight candidates vying for the ‘hot seat’ literally, makes Sri Lanka a laughing stock in the eyes of the world.

The expense of printing ballot papers of the length required is gargantuan. How dysfunctional can a country be, declared bankrupt.

Meaningless exercise in a country struggling under strain of billions of Dollars in Sovereign Debt and no means or plan of payback.

Unrest and conflict in the Middle East and Eastern Europe adding to economic woes.

We the voter who is today the VVIP for all purposes will decide on the proffered one.

Incumbent President has the advantage of media coverage and attention ad lib. He also while promising a rosy future as always, keeps passing bills in parliament to gain favour and fervour.

Salary increases and other delectable benefits to the naive uninformed electorate.

The notion that Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability is more fragile than the narrative suggests is reinforced by the IMF’s own warnings to Sri Lanka; that its debt sustainability and economic recovery remains on a “knife edge”

This article considers the weaknesses and flaws in the current trajectory of Sri Lanka’s economy and the need to reassess the path we are taking towards debt sustainability. It will present the views of professional economists that have critically evaluated the outcomes of Sri Lanka’s IMF program and debt restructuring negotiations.

There are a number of questions to ask about the current trajectory, but we must first understand that the broad targets are all aimed at generating debt sustainability and increasing Sri Lanka’s international credit ratings so that it is able to re-enter capital markets to finance part of the country’s foreign exchange requirement. Given below are these broad targets of the IMF:

During our initial meeting, where he interviewed me for a position within his Group, I was struck by his gentle and humble demeanour. Our conversation revolved around the importance of family, and he shared the story of his father, late Albert Page, who came from Manipay, Jaffna to Colombo, eventually succeeding in business. Little did I realise that this conversation will lay the foundation for a lasting professional and personal relationship.

### Conscience At The Polls: A Forgotten Tool To Guide Our Future

Why explore the concept of conscience now, on the verge of a presidential election? Though volumes have been written, and it has been the subject of deep discussions by psychologists, researchers, and religions, there’s an urgency to revisit it. The idea of “conscience” often carries moral implications and is typically viewed as an inner sense of integrity. Properly harnessed, conscience—this inner integrity itself—can help anyone attain the highest state of mind, alongside its other functions like providing the ability to discern right from wrong. It equips any healthy individual to monitor, evaluate, and control their actions.

### Why the doom and gloom?

*2024-09-17 22:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/why-the-doom-and-gloom/) · `en`

It is true that in the distant past Sri Lankan elections were emotionally charged affairs resulting in violence. However, as a battle-hardened nation with an increasingly well-informed citizenry, that trend has changed for the better. For example, Sri Lanka 2022 Human Right report stated, “Domestic observers described the election as peaceful, technically well managed, and safe considering the COVID-19 pandemic but noted that unregulated campaign spending, abuse of state resources, and media bias affected the level playing field,” referring to the 2020 election. As of this writing, the Election Commission has reported a 43% drop in violations in the current cycle with eleven instances of violence. Even though no violations can be accepted, this is a promising trend, people are beginning to see through the heinous intentions of the perpetrators. One would expect that trend to continue and, judging by the low-key election fervor, which appears to be the case.
