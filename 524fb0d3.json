  "original_body_lines": [
    "(Text of Budget Speech Delivered in Parliament by Preside Ranil Wickremesinghe in his Capacity as Finance Minister on 13 November 2023)",
    "The Lord Buddha has elucidated on a concept called \u201cSamjeewikatha\u201d (balance living). He explained this concept in the Vyagghapajja Sutta. The concept elaborates on how to balance our budget.",
    "The Buddha has advised against leading a pompous and extravagant life, while receiving a low income. He explains that a mindful person would lead his life in a way that his income is aligned with expenditure.",
    "We should spend according to the income we receive. That is what the Buddhist economic philosophy demonstrates to us. But, for the majority of the 75 years following the independence, our spending has often diverged from our generated revenue. When I say this, one might think that the governments of this country spent lavishly and wasted money. Not just governments. The country as a whole has lived beyond its means.",
    "We resorted to borrowing or printing money to provide jobs, increase salaries, distribute free rice, offer relief, and maintain state-owned enterprises. We won elections by making promises about giving government jobs, safeguarding public resources, delivering relief packages, reducing commodity prices, and increasing salaries. We became indebted to the country as well as to the world to lead pompous and extravagant lives by not aligning revenue to our expenditure.",
    "In the Samajjapala Sutta, the Lord Buddha has emphasized that we should borrow for investment rather than for consumption. But we borrowed for consumption. Ina Sutta in Anguttara Chakka Nipatha specifically points out that it is very dangerous to borrow and pay interest in this manner.",
    "After 75 years of independence, we now find ourselves in a dire situation as a result of ignoring Samajeewikatha and the Buddhist economic philosophy. Our economy collapsed completely, leading us to a status of bankruptcy.",
    "We fought over meagre litres of petrol. Conflicts emerged over obtaining a gas cylinder. We remained in darkness for ten to fifteen hours a day. Our supermarkets began to sell firewood. Businesses collapsed. The tourism industry crumbled. Jobs were lost. Essential goods became scarce. There were queues everywhere. All public transport failed. Schools were closed. We could not conduct examinations. There was a food crisis due to the lack of fertilizer. The situation reached a point where we felt as if we were left not with a country but we were in a state akin to hell.",
    "No one stepped up to accept the challenge of rescuing the country in the face of this challenge. Instead, they gave up offering various excuses similar to those given by Andare when confronted with the task of lifting the rock. Some individuals turned to astrology for guidance, while others imposed conditions that could not be constitutionally accommodated",
    "It is under these circumstances that I assumed the responsibility of leading this nation.",
    "At the time, I took over a patient who was dying. A country that resembled a living hell. A derailed economy that had been brought to its knees.",
    "We began to work day and night following a formal and systematic plan despite numerous obstacles and challenges. We strived to rescue the country from the hellish conditions it was facing. Government employees demonstrated dedicated hard work, contributing to our endeavors to salvage the nation. All our friendly nations took care of us and offered relief.",
    "At this juncture, I openly communicated to all of you that I will work hard to revive the economy through a comprehensive reform programme and to liberate the people from the economic hardships. I was not the only one who contributed to this hard work and commitment. Every citizen of this country strived for this. They were committed to achieve this. There were also certain segments who were not a part of this collective effort and who tried to pull the country further backward. But, we have now been able to stabilize the country to a certain extent, dampening their hopes.",
    "We successfully redirected the economy, which was derailed and collapsed, to get back on track. Several temporary measures were implemented, including the temporary suspension of imports, to achieve this. However, it is not advisable for the economy to sustain such restrictions indefinitely. This is the moment to implement enduring and sustainable actions. To propel the economy forward, these actions must be undertaken. It is through these measures that we can fully rejuvenate the economy, rescuing it from the brink of collapse.",
    "This is not an easy task. But we can do it. We can overcome this challenge by embracing new concepts and following the path we have already embarked upon.",
    "History has demonstrated that seeking solutions solely for political advantage, deviating from the principles of \u201cSamajeevikatha,\u201d is not a successful approach. Why we would continue to do so when we are aware that such actions would be unsuccessful?",
    "You might tell fairy tales, but the progress of a country cannot be achieved through such narratives. A country cannot be developed by making false promises. The country moved backward because of the electoral promises made by political parties throughout time. We have witnessed that the ultimate result of this is the country becoming bankrupt. Unfortunately, many segments of the population have not come to realize this yet.",
    "I beseech you that we should stop propagating lies for political motives. Let\u2019s be honest with ourselves. Let\u2019s think about the country rather than about our politics. Let\u2019s get together to uplift the country. Let\u2019s think about the political agendas when our country is strong.",
    "Our country\u2019s situation is now better than what it was before one year. I am not saying that the economy has completely recovered. It has become comparatively better. We have attained that position by facing difficulties, making sacrifices and enduring various hardships.",
    "We can certainly create a more favourable economic environment in the near future if we gradually move forward in this difficult terrain.",
    "When we look back at the past year, it is 100 percent confirmed that we are on the right track. The people in the country, who once struggled to obtain petrol, can now buy it without being in a queue or without any limitations. The people who had to wait in queues for weeks to obtain a gas cylinder can now purchase it with a single phone call. People who endured power cuts for ten to twelve hours can now enjoy uninterrupted power supply. The country where firewood was sold from supermarkets to retail shops has now completely transformed. This all means that we are on the right track. Our plans are sound. Our strategies are effective. Hence, let\u2019s continue the rest of the journey even amidst difficulties.",
    "As we progressed along this path, there were certain mistakes. We have acknowledged this. We will humbly rectify those deficiencies and mistakes.",
    "The economy which was derailed was put back on track. But this achievement alone is not satisfactory. Just by this, we would not feel great relief or comfort. Our difficult times have not ended. The entire country continues to grapple with various hardships in different aspects.",
    "As we were able to reduce inflation up to a single-digit level, we could rescue the country from the high inflationary pressures. But, we still could not correspondingly increase salaries and income to match the high cost of living which increased due to this severe crisis. The increase in prices of fuel and electricity adversely impacted all households. The increase in tax rates has also shaken up individuals and businesses, both small and large. Production costs have also escalated.",
    "We are well aware of the difficulties faced by the people of this country. The path toward a stable and developed economy is not beautiful. It is difficult, hard and challenging.",
    "Reviving an economy in a state of bankruptcy is a formidable task. However, if we successfully navigate through this challenging period, we can create a free and decent society. Instead, if we continue to build sand castles by giving relief to the people based on political motives, the country will again be bankrupt.",
    "The success of the path that we have undertaken thus far lies on the economic reform programme that we commenced. This reform programme have laid the foundation to progress, steering us away from economic turmoil such as the one experienced in 2022.",
    "Since 2013, the practice of revising the electricity bill in accordance with the government expenditure on electricity generation has not been followed. Due to this, the Ceylon Electricity Board suffered enormous losses. Until 2022, loans were obtained from the two-state banks to offset these losses. Similarly, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which suffers unbelievable losses offsets its losses through the two state banks. This escalated to a critical situation where the balance sheets of the two state banks are now in a very weak state. Government has to provide funds to strengthen these banks. Where would we get such funds from? The tax revenue levied from the public is used for this purpose.",
    "Loans are obtained from state banks to offset the losses of the state-owned enterprises. Hence, the Government provides funds to the banks when they become weak to prevent them from collapsing. To find such funds, the government will need to increase the tax burden on the people.",
    "Some groups protest demanding a salary increase. Not only the public servants, but the whole country suffers nowadays. We have to move forward day by day, step by step toward a recovery from this difficult situation. It\u2019s a tough journey. On one hand, the strikes deteriorate the country\u2019s way forward. On the other hand, the majority of the people are suffering.",
    "I wish to mention about the salary increments. Salary increments cannot be done on an ad-hoc basis. 35 percent of the Government revenue is spent to pay salaries for the public servants. To increase salaries, the revenue of the government also has to be increased.",
    "Even without increasing the revenue, salaries can be increased. But how? We have to print money. Or else, borrow from a foreign country. Or else, impose new taxes. That is against the \u201cSamajeewikatha\u201d principle. Such actions may again drive the country downwards.",
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board spends a significant amount on power generation. Therefore, we lifted all legal barriers to add low-cost mega-scale renewable energy generation to its main grid network. The legislation process is ongoing to restructure the inefficient Ceylon Electricity Board, as an efficient institution. Upon implementing the institutional changes to generate power efficiently, the cost of power to the people will be eased.",
    "Some political groups are against restructuring the Ceylon Electricity Board as an efficient institution. They demand to reduce the power tariff at any cost. This will lead us again to be trapped in the same vicious cycle. It is against the \u201cSamajeevikatha\u201d concept.",
    "There are criticisms over increasing the government taxes. Why we were supposed to increase taxes? We neglected to change tax structures and tax restructuring for ages. This made the fiscal sector weak. To strengthen the fiscal sector structural changes in the tax system were necessary.",
    "Rs. 93 billion is spent each month to finance the salary bill of the Government. Rs. 70 billion is required to for the social Welfare Schemes such as Aswesuma, Elders allowance, Pensions etc. Meanwhile, Rs. 220 billion is spent to settle loan interest payments. The public expenditure spent on these requirements is Rs. 383 billion per month. The Government revenue collected within the first 9 months of the year 2023 is Rs. 215 billion. The shortage is Rs. 168 billion. To meet this shortage, it is compelled to obtain more loans.",
    "How was this shortage financed so far? Through foreign loans. Through bank overdrafts. When it is not possible to meet the shortage through these methods, through money printing.",
    "Until the Foreign Debt Restructuring is completed, the foreign financing and loans we can obtain are constrained.  Bank overdrafts amounting to Rs. 900 billion have been obtained in the year 2021. Currently, the total overdrafts are brought to a lower level of Rs. 70 billion.",
    "According to the new Central Bank Act, Money Printing is not allowed. Therefore, if we can\u2019t increase the government revenue by 10 percent to 15 percent we will end up with an economic hell again. If the taxes are reduced, that gap has to be filled with something else. This issue cannot be resolved by simple and sweet promises, as some groups are proposing.",
    "Our revenue target for this year is Rs. 3,415 billion. Out of that, we have collected Rs. 2,410 billion so far. This represents that we have failed to generate the targeted revenue. We have to work hard to collect the targeted revenue.",
    "We requested several times from the people who earn higher incomes, to open a tax file. However, the majority of them did not proceed. The main reason is they believe that there will be unnecessary troubles if they open a new tax file. Yes, It is true. There are unnecessary complexities in tax collection. Taxpayers have to obey the unnecessary influences of some officers. There are payment methods that make the payment of taxes a headache.",
    "Likewise, we have identified several critical issues in our tax system. At present the burden of taxes is placed only on a few slices of the society. Tax evasion happens due to the long-lasting weaknesses and negligences of the tax collection systems.",
    "We have included several proposals to this Budget to rectify these issues. These proposals cannot be implemented overnight. They should be implemented gradually. We will be able to provide more tax concessions in the future when the Government revenue is increased through these proposals.",
    "Some people state that the burden of taxes on the people can be reduced by reducing the government Revenue. However, the major portion of the government revenue, 35 percent is spent on public servant salaries and social welfare. The workforce in the public sector is 1.3 million. We cannot remove them from their jobs even though the number is excessive. If we do so it will lead to a social issue. Therefore, these issues have to be confronted sensitively and carefully.",
    "However, we have to stop unnecessary expenditure. How much money is wasted at the government institutions? How much time is wasted? We have to avoid these wastages. How much time, effort, and money are wasted when an ordinary citizen goes to a government institution for their necessity? We have to rectify these deficiencies also.",
    "The public suffers due to the loss-making state-owned enterprises. The loss of these institutions is borne by the public. The political groups that call them national treasures are piling up the burden of these loss-making state-owned enterprises and pulling the whole nation backward.",
    "Meanwhile, corruption and fraud are spread everywhere over the country like cancer. We have introduced the laws and acts that avoid stealing the wealth of the nation. There are allegations on some persons claiming that they have stolen the wealth and resources of the Nation.  However, we have to rethink the people who stole the wealth and resources of the nation as well as the future of the nation.",
    "Several political groups stole the future of the nation by nationalizing successful enterprises. Some groups stole the future of the nation by protesting against the leasing out of unutilized properties such as Trincomalee Oil Tanks. Some groups stole the future of the country by protesting against the apparel industry. The future was stolen by developing the port. The list is lengthy. Remember. They also steal.",
    "The political groups who protested against every development project did not allow the development of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Complex.",
    "They wanted to allow the Nuwara Eliya Post Office to crumble down in the same manner they allowed the oil tanks to corrode and crumble down.",
    "Allocation of Nuwara Eliya Post Office for the tourism industry is not an isolated incident. It\u2019s a part of the Nuwara Eliya Development Plan. The establishment of a university in Nuwara Eliya is also a part of the same Development Plan. There are several massive projects are being implemented in Nuwara Eliya.",
    "They did the same thing for the old post office located inside the Galle Fort. Now that building has been crumbled down. If we allocated that building for the tourism industry at the right time, we still have that historic landmark building. And we earn foreign exchange.",
    "I would like to quote a recent post on Facebook, posted by Mr. Susantha Ariyarathne, an Economic Analyst.",
    "The formula to protect national treasures is none other than harnessing the maximum benefit out of them. Not protesting \u201cDon\u2019t touch National Treasures\u201d. Then these resources will not become a burden to the others.",
    "So far what we have done was hide behind the slogan \u201cProtect National Treasures\u201d and avoid utilizing them. Making them a burden that the country could hold.",
    "Think. The political and economic concepts that we implemented in our country have been failed. Please understand that. Make your neighbor understand that.  We have no journey ahead if we do not construct a fresh political and economic system.",
    "The political and economic system that prevailed in the country has to be completely upended. I pointed out this during my previous budget speech. As Sugathapala de Silva wrote in his play \u201c Marat/Sade, we must have a fresh perspective.",
    "The social convention deep-rooted in the country was the Government has to do everything. This is why the Government intermediate in every enterprise by making them weak and taking them over. However, it is confirmed that the said social convention is failed and outdated.",
    "We have to construct our own economic and political system considering past experiences, global trends, and future challenges. A new social convention has to be constructed.",
    "The economy is being healed due to the correct procedures and methodologies we followed during the past year, building the foundation of this system. The essential commodities are now available in abundance. Interest rates declined from 30 percent p.a. to 15 percent p.a. Continuous power supply is ensured. There is no shortage of fertilizer. The primary deficit of the year 2021 was 5.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). During the first half of the year, we were able to achieve a primary surplus. Amid the deep economic crisis, we were able to increase the tax revenue by 50 percent in the first six months of the year. The inflation which was sky rocketed up to 70 percent in September 2022, declined to 1.5 percent in October 2023. Foreign reserves increased to USD 3.5 billion from zero. The confidence placed in us by foreign countries was restored. However, we have a long way to go.",
    "We were able to achieve increasing progress during the past year because of the honest sacrifices made by the majority of our people. Because of their courage against various difficulties. The Government will gradually set the background to ease these difficulties. We are devoted to providing more facilities and benefits as our economy recovers and our economy stabilizes.",
    "We cannot put ourselves back in the hell that our country was in 2022. Some groups are trying day and night to put the country in that place and achieve their political targets. We do not have any political target. The only target we have is uplifting the country.",
    "Some people denote this budget as an Election Budget. The reason is the Presidential Election and the General Election is scheduled in the next year. Such a Budget is designed to provide various concessions and salary increments aiming at an election victory. This is what happened during the past 75 years since the independence.",
    "However, this Election Budget is different. This is a Budget that constructs the future of the country. This is a budget that was prepared for the victory of the county. A Budget that was prepared according to the Buddhist philosophy. Several proposals have been included in this budget, based on the concept of \u201cSamajeewikathaa\u201d concept to ensure victory for the country and the country\u2019s future.",
    "I will now present the 2024 Budget proposals to this Parliament.",
    "Government employees have not received a salary increase since 2015. Therefore, I propose to increase public sector salaries without affecting the fiscal balance.",
    "There are about 1.3 million (1,300,000) public sector employees. Their families have more than 5 million members. These government employees are currently receiving a Cost of Living Allowance of Rs. 7,800. We propose to increase their Cost of Living Allowance to Rs. 17,800 by Rs. 10,000 from January, 2024.",
    "The General Treasury begins to receive government revenue typically by February and March. Therefore, we can only add this allowance to the monthly salary from the month of April. We will take steps to pay the balance accumulated from January to March 2024 in installments within a 6 month period, starting from October 2024.",
    "There are about 730,000 public pensioners. Currently, they are only receiving a Cost of Living Allowance of Rs. 3,525 per month. We will increase the monthly Cost of Living Allowance of public pensioners to Rs. 6,025 by Rs. 2,500. This increase will be implemented from April, 2024. Rs. 386 billion will be spent on public pensions in 2024.",
    "W&OP scheme is a contributory pension scheme in which employees contribute 6-7 percent of their basic salary. The Government spends Rs. 65 billion annually for the payment of the W&OP scheme. The total annual contribution from employees for W&OP scheme is Rs. 38 billion. Hence, the contribution from the public employees is not sufficient for the payment of the same. Therefore, I propose to revise the deduction percentage from the salary for this pension contribution to 8 percent for all service categories from April 2024 onward. With this adjustment, an additional Rs. 9 billion can be collected annually, and it will ensure the continuity of the pension scheme for widows, widowers and orphans.",
    "The allowance provided to police officers who travel long distances to attend duties does not match with the current situation. Hence, instead of the allowance that is paid at present, I propose to pay a food and lodging allowance with food and lodging allowance with appropriate adjustment for three groups of officers in the Police Department.",
    "Due to the economic hardships that prevailed in the country, several measures were taken to carefully manage public expenditure. In that process, the entitlement of Public Servants for the Distress Loan given during unexpected and unprepared hardships faced by them was subjected to some limitations. Hence, I propose to provide the Distress loan facility for all the public servants effective from January 01, 2024 as previously done.",
    "We started providing Aswesuma benefits with the support of development partners including the World Bank. However, in the next year we will provide benefits to the people from our own funds. In the previous years, we have spent Rs. 60 billion for this programme. Now, it has been increased to Rs. 183 billion. In the year 2024, it is expected to spend three times the amount spent on the social security programs in the previous years for the Aswesuma programme. This will provide relief for 2 million families.",
    "Aswesuma programme is based on objective selection criteria. The delays in implementation when transitioning in to the new programme is being addressed. A programme is implemented to provide justice to families who face injustice. Retroactive payments will be made to eligible recipients who faced payment delays.",
    "We will use the knowledge and experience of Samurdhi officers to empower beneficiaries of the Aswesuma programme.",
    "About 130,000 persons with disabilities and kidney patients are paid a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000. I propose to increase the payment up to Rs. 7,500. It is a 50 percent increase. The present monthly payment of Rs. 2,000 for elderly citizens will also be increased to Rs. 3,000. Around 530,000 persons will benefit from this.",
    "The beneficiaries who were on the waiting list and are already receiving financial assistance will be entered into the list of beneficiaries from 2024. For this purpose, a total of Rs. 138 billion will be allocated for this.",
    "Some families may face sudden calamities. The breadwinner of the family may die or meet with an accident. Or he may lose his job. In such situations, the whole family becomes helpless. Such families need to wait for a long time to get Aswesuma relief according to the current system. However, in future, we will review the Aswesuma beneficiaries once in every 6 months. This will allow new families to be added to the beneficiary list without a delay.",
    "I will increase the allocation for cash transfers provided through Aswesuma and allowances provided to persons with disabilities, kidney patients and the Elderly to Rs. 205 billion in next year.",
    "We have identified many shortcomings and weaknesses in the system of providing a monthly allowance of Rs. 4,500 to pregnant mothers. Rs. 10 billion rupees has been allocated to resolve such issues and make this program more systematic.",
    "SMEs have been badly affected by the economic crisis and COVID-19 pandemic. A recent survey revealed that about 20 percent of such enterprises have either temporarily or permanently closed down. The survey also revealed a decrease in the performance volume of the currently operating enterprises. We want to fast track the journey towards a production economy. Therefore, SMEs should be further strengthened, encouraged and facilitated. For this purpose, we are introducing a concessionary loan scheme of around Rs. 30 billion with the support of the Asian Development Bank.",
    "This programme is the first phase of action which will collectively provide a major impetus to the SMEs. In addition to concessionary credit facilities, capacity development programs are implemented for the participating institutions. Steps will be taken to link SMEs with the value chains of large companies in the industrial sector. The required provisions have already been included in the Budget 2024.",
    "Accordingly, the total amount allocated for the development of SMEs is Rs. 50 billion. As a result, a financial space worth around Rs. 250 billion is created.",
    "Waste Land Ordinance was passed in 1897. The British government acquired thousands of acres of rural land across the country under that Ordinance. Afterwards, in 1935, under the Land Development Ordinance, those land slots were distributed among farmers under the license system. But although around hundred years have passed, the ownership of these farmlands has not been handed back to the farmers who own them. As mentioned in the drama \u201cChalk Circle\u201d, \u201cfarmers with good conduct; should win the land and villages\u201d We are handing over the lands to farmers who lost the ownership of their traditional lands during the British colonial era. We expect to commence this task in 2024 and complete it within another few years. Two million (2,000,000) families will get the ownership of land and farmland. I allocate Rs. 2 billion for this purpose.",
    "Houses constructed under various urban development programmes have been rented to low-income families. A monthly rent of around Rs. 3,000 is obtained from those families. I will completely stop collecting rent from these families. Not only that, the full ownership of these houses will be given to those families. In 2024, nearly 50,000 families will be given the ownership of these houses.",
    "By the completion of the programme of providing land and housing rights to the people, about 70 percent of the people of this country will become the owners of land and houses.",
    "Estate dwellers are not owners of lands. We will take steps to grant land ownership and build houses for them. As the initial step, I expect to allocate Rs. 4 billion.",
    "Under the Bimsaviya Programme which commenced in 1998, one million land plots have been covered out of the total number of land plots of 12 million. In order to provide the necessary facilities to expeditiously complete this programme, I allocate Rs. 600 million.",
    "Due to the difficult situation in the country and the lack of funds under the decentralized budget programme in the past, regional development programmes could not be implemented. As these programmes were temporarily suspended, public representatives could not contribute to the rural development activities. We will recommence the decentralized budget programme. I will provide Rs. 11,250 million through the district coordination committees for this purpose. This programme will be implemented under the supervision of the Department of National Planning using a methodical and standard approach.",
    "The public infrastructure and services available in the hill country are relatively underdeveloped due to disparities in the distribution of resources for various reasons. This disparity is also reflected in the living standards of the people. The government has recognized the importance of giving priority to rural development in the hill country. A 10-year multipurpose rural and community development program from the year 2024 including all the 89 Divisional Secretariat divisions that belong to the hill country areas of Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces as well as Badulla, Matara, and Kurunegala districts. I propose to allocate Rs. 10 billion for the year 2024 for this purpose.",
    "We have already introduced a new mechanism to approve development projects. A Government Committee has been established to review new projects. As per recommendations of the Committee, the Minister of Finance will grant approval for projects. Government will not allocate funds for projects that deviate from this procedure.",
    "This will enable to allocate capital expenditure to give a higher contribution to the economic growth. This is very important for fiscal and debt sustainability. To achieve this objective, I will increase the expenditure capital expenditure to Rs. 1,260 billion. This is equal to 4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).",
    "The implementation of number of projections have been temporarily suspend due to the economic crisis. I will allocate another Rs. 55 billion to recommence and complete these projects and to provide necessary provisions for the capital expenditure proposals mentioned in this Budget Speech.",
    "We will allocate this by transferring Rs. 55 billion from the Vote of the National Budget Department to Capital Expenditure Vote. Thus, we would allocate Rs. 1,260 billion for the development activities of next year.",
    "Further, a number of projects that was implemented under foreign loans and grants have been temporarily suspended. We will have the opportunity to recommence these projects after the completion of foreign debt restructuring activities.",
    "It is observed that the project management committees have been unable to achieve expected objectives fo the development projects. Hence, I propose to establish a unit for this purpose under each Ministry from 2024 onwards, to include project related activities to the duty list of the permanent staff and to procure human resources under contract and duty basis only when related specialists are not available in the public sector.",
    "Since the last few years, it has not been possible to carry out the maintenance and management of rural roads properly, I propose to allocate Rs.10 billion for the year 2024 for the renovation of such roads which have become dilapidated.",
    "We had to face adverse weather conditions during the last few months. Roads and bridges were damaged due to floods and landslides. I allocate Rs. 2,000 million to rehabilitate damaged rural roads.",
    "There are issues with regard to drinking water in all provinces of the country. We will prioritize drinking water projects when allocating the decentralized budget and obtaining foreign loans.",
    "The future of a country can be enriched by introducing an education system that is suitable for this era. Our country has an outdated education system. It is an education system that produces memorizers. Creative people are not generated under this system. Also, the benefits of free education are not fully available to the people.",
    "Therefore, we are implementing a series of comprehensive education reforms. We appointed a group of 25 experts to prepare this new national education policy framework. Those proposals were further polished through the direction of a Cabinet Committee headed by me. This policy framework has now been adopted by the Cabinet.",
    "I would like to inform this House about several key institutions that will be established under these reforms. These are the Higher National Council on Education, National Higher Education Commission, and the National Skills Commission.The detailed information in this regard will be informed to this House by the Minister of Education in the next two weeks.",
    "Recently, this post written by Ajana Ranagala on Facebook has taken my attention.",
    "\u201cMy child is suffering not just for days, weeks, months, but for years due to his decision to do A/Ls in the national curriculum as he wanted to gain admission to a local university. His friends who studied the international stream are going abroad for higher education\u201d",
    "This is the real situation. Hence, we will provide the opportunity to obtain higher education without delay to every child who passes A/Ls.",
    "We will take steps to establish four new universities considering the current trends for the technical sector.",
    "(i) Seethawaka Science and Technology University (Lalith Athulathmudali Post Graduate Institute will be incorporated to this University)",
    "Also, I propose that the rules and regulations should be adopted to convert the following private higher education institutions that are currently in operation into universities.",
    "As per the 13th Amendment, provincial councils have been empowered to establish universities. We expect that provincial councils will also establish universities in the future.",
    "I propose to establish an Education University focused on education by integrating 19 Colleges of Education. Bachelor of Educational Degrees will be offered to students who complete a four-year programme under an existing College of Education in accordance with the relevant standards. This programme will be implemented step by step and I propose to make a Rs. 1 billion budgetary provision for the year 2024 for this programme.",
    "A new Technology University will be established in Kandy under the guidance of IIT University in Chennai, India. India will fully support us in this endeavour.",

A number of steps that lay the foundation for that are included in this budget document.",
    "It is expected to implement a long-term program in a new form under \u201cVisit Sri Lanka\u201d from 2024 to promote the tourism sector. Our expectation is to bring at least five million tourists to Sri Lanka every year. To facilitate this, the government, provincial councils, and local government institutions should do a lot of work. Also, we are working to adopt a new law regarding the tourism sector. A provision of one billion rupees is given for these works.",
    "The responsibilities of meeting the basic needs of the tourism sector are assigned to the Provincial Councils. Provincial tourism boards are being strengthened for that. An amount of Rs. 750 million is allocated for the development of related infrastructure. The necessary support is given to the Provincial Councils through the Finance Commission.",
    "There are more than 720 government-owned resorts and tourist bungalows. This can provide approximately 3,750 rooms. I also propose to prepare a program to attract local and foreign tourists by modernizing the government resorts and using them to promote tourism. I propose to allocate Rs. 600 million for these development activities.",
    "Kithulgala Water rafting Area, Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and other tourist attractions around it are being developed as tourist zone. The Rambukkanana entrance of the Central Expressway is used for that purpose. The proposed Galigamuwa New Town is being promoted as the hub of this tourism region. An amount of Rs. 750 million rupees is allocated to implement this project as a joint program within a period of 3 years.",
    "Creativity plays an important role in culture and society. The foundation of the creative economy is technology and innovation. Therefore, I invite relevant stakeholders to take the lead in creating collaboration between creative spaces, industry and academia. The government is ready to assist in building the creative economy of Sri Lanka.",
    "Considering the new trends in gig economy activities and e-commerce transactions, including cross-border transactions of goods and services, it is proposed to introduce a simple policy and regulatory framework to facilitate gig economy and e-commerce transactions, including cross-border transactions. It covers the areas of payment system, fiscal revenue, and employee welfare.",
    "We need to create a green economy in Sri Lanka to face the future with strength. The climate resilience plan is the basis for the future vision of the sustainable development agenda.",
    "By establishing a Climate Finance Unit in the Treasury and a Climate Change Office in the President\u2019s Office, steps are being taken to create the institutional structure that will support the implementation of Sri Lanka\u2019s Climate Prosperity Plan.",
    "We have allocated 600 acres of land beyond the Kothmale Reservoir to establish an International Climate Change University.",
    "Sri Lanka is working hard to develop renewable energy sources including green hydrogen, green ammonia, and solar and wind.",
    "We are working to establish a climate change commission soon.",
    "It is predicted that food shortages may occur in several countries in the Asian region due to climate change. In this situation, I propose to allocate Rs. 250 million to launch a suitable program to ensure food security in the future and supply of essential food to consumers without shortage and to provide technical and other facilities required by small and medium-scale processors engaged in the food production process.",
    "We want to create a green economy that protects trees and greens, environment..!",
    "We want to create a green society that loves the trees and greens, environment\u2026!",
    "We were able to present a green budget that would create a green economy and a green society. It is a green budget that strengthens the country\u2019s future.",
    "This green budget is an approach to a new economy. A prelude to a strong future. A confirmation of the concept of symbiosis.",
    "We were able to present a budget that will strengthen the country\u2019s future despite there are many problems. But in this journey, there are a number of other problems in front of us that must be faced and overcome. There are no beautiful answers to these questions. Creating fairy worlds will not solve these problems. We have to find answers to these questions gradually and scientifically. These issues should be resolved without breaking the concept of symbiosis. That is the challenging work we are doing now.",
    "What will happen if we terminate this practice as suggested by some opposition groups? Or what will happen if this practice is interrupted and disrupted? The series of reforms carried out with the support of the International Monetary Fund will stop. If that happens, the debt restructuring operation will come to a standstill. Confidence is broken and foreign exchange flow into the local banking system will stop.",
    "With the shortage of foreign exchange comes the shortage of essential goods. Power cuts, fuel shortages occur again. The prices of goods and inflation are rising beyond imagination.",
    "Since the International Monetary Fund program was approved in March, the foreign income we started receiving again will halt. The government will have to borrow more from the domestic market by raising interest rates again.",
    "If that happens, we will slide back into economic hell. Our economy is derailed beyond repair. Remember! If that happens again, no one in the world will come forward to save Sri Lanka. The trust placed in us by all parties, including our external creditors, the International Monetary Fund, is broken. We are inheriting the unfortunate situation that happened to a country like Lebanon.",
    "In order not to fall back into such a situation, the economic and political system of our country must be created anew. A new social consensus should be established. What we have done in this budget document is to lay the foundation for it.",
    "We can no longer become a nation dependent on others. After independence, our first development project, the Gal Oya campaign, was carried out with our own funds. At that time we also gave loans to Britain. But today we are begging in front of the whole world. Should we give the next generation a poor legacy? Or a proud possession?",
    "So, I request all the parties of this House to join the work order to rebuild the country. If there is a better program than ours, present it to this House in detail. Let\u2019s discuss. Let\u2019s implement the most suitable program. Let\u2019s inherit a proud title for our future generations.",
    "I am particularly thankful for the instructions given by the Honorable Prime Minister for the presentation of this year\u2019s budget. Ministers of State Hon. Ranjith Siyalapitiya and Hon. Shehan Semasinghe always give me their maximum support. Thanks to them both.",
    "For this year\u2019s budget, many people from the public and private sectors, including honorable members of this House, gave their opinions and suggestions. I also express my thanks to them. I express my gratitude to the colleagues of the honorable Cabinet and the members of parliament who have provided support. I would like to express my gratitude to the Treasury Secretary and other government officials who worked hard to prepare the budget and to my staff."
