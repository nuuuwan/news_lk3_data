    "The government plans to expand Sri Lanka\u2019s IT workforce from 800,000 to two million within the next four years as part of a broader strategy to drive the country\u2019s digital economy, a top official from the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) revealed.",
    "ICTA CEO Sanjay Karunasena stated that the digital economy is a key growth agenda, with targets to increase the sector\u2019s revenue from $5 billion to $30 billion in the next three to five years.",
    "\u201cWe have outlined a strategy to collaborate closely with the private sector, particularly SMEs, which contribute over 50% of GDP,\u201d Karunasena said. He made these remarks at an event where ICTA partnered with Rotary International to launch an initiative supporting SME growth. The event was held at the BOI Auditorium in Colombo\u2019s World Trade Centre earlier this week.",
    "Under the partnership, ICTA and the Rotary SME Conclave have selected 35 key SMEs for a targeted programme focusing on capability development and market access. Karunasena emphasized that the digital economy\u2019s expansion is being supported by strengthened IT infrastructure, developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Digital Economy.",
    "Addressing the briefing, Rotary District Governor (Sri Lanka and Maldives) Delvin Pereira warned that nearly 263,000 SMEs have either shut down or are on the verge of collapse \u2013 a trend that could severely impact the economy, given SMEs\u2019 dominant contribution.",
    "Pereira, a veteran banker, cautioned that without immediate intervention, Sri Lanka risks economic default by 2028.",
    "Rotary SME Project Chairman Dr. Rohantha Athukorala noted that within just three weeks of launching, the initiative has already engaged SMEs in Galle and Kurunegala through programmes coordinated with local divisional secretariats.",
