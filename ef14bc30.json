  "original_title": "Sumanthiran , Shritharan  and Yoheswaran in  Triangular Contest to Become   Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Latchi (ITAK)President..",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) known in English as the Federal Party (FP) is the premier political party of the Northern and Eastern Sri Lankan Tamils.The ITAK/FP was formed on 18 December 1949. The  75th birth anniversary of ITAK  will be celebrated next year.",
    "The ITAK was the leading political party of the Sri Lankan Tamils before the advent of the Tamil armed struggle. Though the ITAK has diminished in size and influence over the years, it is still \u201cPrimus Inter Pares\u201d (First among equals) in comparison with other Sri Lankan Tamil nationalist parties.",
    "It is indeed noteworthy that the ITAK/FP is the only Sri Lankan Tamil political party that has parliamentary representatives from all five electoral districts in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Currently the party has six seats in Parliament including one on the national list. Of these two were elected from the Jaffna electoral district and one each from the Wanni, Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts. The national list MP is from the Digamadulla/Amparai electoral district. It could be seen therefore that the ITAK represents Tamils from all electoral districts of the North-East in Parliament.",
    "The ITAK has had from its inception in 1949 a colourful history with many ups and downs. In the new millennium the party became the dominant entity in the premier Sri Lankan Tamil political configuration known as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). The TNA contested Parliamentary, Provincial and local authority elections under the ITAK symbol of House from 2004 onwards.",
    "The split in the TNA early this year has resulted in two of the three constituent parties of the TNA  namely the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) moving out and re-configuring along  with three other parties as the  Democratic Tamil National Alliance(DTNA). Since the TELO (3) and PLOTE(1)  have four MP\u2019s, the TNA tally in Parliament has dropped from ten to six MPs all of whom belong to  ITAK. Thus the ITAK continues  to be the Sri Lankan Tamil Political party with the highest number of seats in Parliament.",
    "Currently the ITAK seems to be on the threshold of a potential intra-party crisis. The  ITAK\u2019s long delayed party convention is scheduled for the last week of January next year. A crucial change of leadership is on the cards as the  current ITAK president Somasuntharam Senathirajah known as \u201cMaavai\u201d  is on the verge of relinquishing his post. \u201cMaavai\u201dhas been ITAK president since 2014. Hence a new president will be elected at the convention  to be held next January  in Trincomalee.",
    "What appears to be problematic from a party perspective is the fact that three contenders are in the fray for the ITAK presidency. The three aspirants to ITAK leadership are Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran, Sivagnanam Shritharan and Seenithamby Yoheswaran. As is well known,  Sumanthiran and Shritharan are both Jaffna district MP\u2019s while Yogeswaran is a former Batticaloa district parliamentarian.",
    "An inner party election to  elect a new leader is by itself  a welcome feature . However the ITAK has from its inception never experienced an inner party poll to elect its president. It has adopted the practice of avoiding a direct contest and instead opted  to elect the leader unanimously. From the time  it was founded in 1949, the ITAK/FP has followed this consensual method of electing the leader.",
    "Samuel  James  Veluppillai Chevanayagam known as \u201cThanthai Chelva\u201d was the co-founder and first president of the ITAK/FP.  SJV Chelvanayagam was venerated by his party members as the \u201cEezhathu Gandhi\u201d(Gandhi of Eelam). He could have remained president of the party during his lifetime if he had wanted to. Chelva however stepped down as President after two terms   and let others succeed him as President.",
    "Nevertheless Chelva remained the supreme leader while  his deputies like  Vanniasingham, Naganathan,Rajavarothayam,Rasamanickam and Amirthalingam served as party presidents in rotation. There was no election as an  arrangement by consensus  with Chelva\u2019s blessings would be worked out early. In 1973 there was a possibility of an election with the then  Vaddukkoddai ex-MP Appapillai  Amirthalingam and the then Batticaloa MP Chelliah Rajadurai vying with each other for the party presidency. It was feared that the tussle could rupture the party. Chelvanayagam intervened and persuaded Rajadurai to withdraw from the contest.",
    "Now for the first time in ITAK\u2019s history the party seems to be heading for an  inner -party poll to elect a new President. It will be a triangular contest with two sitting MP\u2019s from the north and an ex-MP from the east in the ring All three aspirants  entered Parliament together  as Tamil National Alliance(TNA) MPs in 2010 after the war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil  Eelam(LTTE) ended in 2009.  All three are members of a common age group, born within years of each other.",
    "The \u2018senior\u201d of the  competing trio, MA Sumanthiran  was   born in 1964 and is a lawyer by profession. He  was first appointed as a national list MP in 2010. Subsequently he was elected to Parliament from Jaffna district in the 2015 and 2020 elections.",
    "The next  in the trio is S. Shritharan born in 1968. He is a former teacher and school principal. Shritharan was elected successively to Parliament from Jaffna district in 2010, 2015 and 2020 elections.",
    "The youngest of the trio is S.Yoheswaran born in 1970. Yoheswaran\u2019s profession as well as  vocation is social service.  Yoheswaran  was elected from Batticaloa district to Parliament in 2010 and 2015. He  contested the 2020  poll but was not elected.",
    "The  nomination   procedure within the ITAK   to  elect a  Party president is for  a minimum of six members of the central working committee to propose a name with the prospective candidate\u2019s consent. If there is only one candidate then obviously there wont be an election. If there are two or more candidates , then there will be a contest unless   the contenders barring one pull out or withdraw from the hustings.",
    "If an election does take place, the ITAK\u2019s  General Council members would be eligible to vote.. According to the party Constitution, the  General Council will consist of representatives elected by the party branches and  the Central Working  Committee membersThe \u201cMathiya Seyal Kuzhu\u201d or Central working committee has 50 members. The party branch representatives are 260 in number/ Thus the \u201cPodhu Sabhai\u201d or General council in total will have  310 members>.Thus a  general council \u201celectorate\u201dof 310 will get to elect the new party president. Thereafter the president would be endorsed unanimously at the party convention.",
    "The 50  member  central committee comprises those elected as representatives at district level and appointed by the party leadership to represent special interests. The  other general council  members  will consist of representatives   zonal branches of the party. There are 51  zonal branches  from the eight districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces/  There is also one from Colombo. Each branch will  have five representatives each . The  zonal branch representatives in the General council wlll be 260 members",
    "When nominations closed on 30 November  2023, there were only two candidates in the fray namely Sumanthiran and Shritharan. An announcement was made  to that effect However a third nomination  dated 30 Nov sent by registered post was received by the ITAK acting secretary Dr.P. Sathialingam two days later. This was sent from Batticaloa on Yoheswaran\u2019s behalf. Thus it became a triangular contest instead of a direct duel between the Jaffna parliamentarians.",
    "Although a minimum of six central committee members could nominate a candidate, Sumanthiran had a dozen endorsing his candidacy. These consisted of four from Jaffna  district and one each from the  districts of Kilinochchi,Mannar, Mullaitheevu, Vavuniya, Amparai, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Colombo. Among those proposing Sumanthiran\u2019s name were  Batticaloa MP Shanakian Rasamanickam, ITAK administrative secretary Xavier Kulanayagam and ITAK senior vice -president and ex-chairman of the Northern provincial council CVK Sivagnanam.",
    "In the case of Shritharan, the Jaffna district MP\u2019s political stronghold is the Kilinochchi district. Although Kilinochchi is a separate administrative district, it is part of the Jaffna electoral district. The bulk of Shritharan\u2019s preference votes have come from Kilinochchi in the past elections. As such he was nominated by six from Kilinochchi including former Northern provincial minister Kurukularajah and Karaichchi PS chairman Vaelamaalihidhan.",
    "Seenithamby Yoheswaran was also nominated by six from Batticaloa district. Among these was former Batticaloa MP Ariyanendran. It is also noteworthy that Yoeswaran\u2019s candidacy was indeed a surprise. While there was always  speculation  about Sumanthiran and Shritharan being potential contenders, Yoheswaran\u2019s name was never mentioned. Even now there are some who opine that Yoheswaran may be persuaded to withdraw from contesting prior to D-day if he is promised the party secretary post.",
    "Under these circumstances ,it appears that the ITAK presidential election would turn out to be a \u201cduel in the sun\u201d between Sumanthiran and Shritharan even if Yogeswaran does not pull out. News reports indicate that both have commenced  canvassing by meeting members of the ITAK Working committee  and General Council. Meanwhile supporters and sympathisers of both contenders are propagating the merits and virtues of their favourites over social media. The campaigns whether official or unofficial have not descended to low levels. At least not yet. But the possibility cannot be ruled out as the campaigns begin to gather momentum after 2024 dawns.",
    "Most political parties in Sri Lanka do not have a real election to elect the party leader.  It is done by  prior arrangement and is supposedly a unanimous choice. This has been the practice in the ITAK too. But the prospect of a leadership election  would be a progressive and welcome feature. Inner party democracy would be strengthened and a genuinely elected leader;s stature and credibility will be enhanced. But since this would be a new  chapter in the party\u2019s history many are perturbed by doubts and fears.. This is very much so among grassroot supporters of the ITAK.",
    "What old timers and stalwarts of the ITAK as well as concerned observers of the Tamil political scene  worry about is the dismal prospect of a dirty and vicious leadership contest. It is feared that such a duel would tear the party fabric asunder and cause a serious rupture.  Implicit threats by supporeters about the  unsuccessful candidate breaking away from the ITAK and forming a new party or joining another party has contributed to this growing anxiety. The chief candidates have both indicated that they would work unitedly for the party whether they are successful in the leadership bid or not.",
    "Despite assertions that  the loser would be willing to work alongside the winner after the election, it may not be possible for one to work with the other after a bitter, no holds barred tussle. The respective supporters themselves may not be in favour of such \u201cunity\u201d. In a tight election the winner would feel insecure and be paranoid about plots by his rival. Hence the loser would be treated with suspicion. . Besides it must not be forgotten that the history of Tamil politics in this country has been a series of ego clashes posing as ideological differences. This applies to Tamil militancy too.",
    "The mainstay of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalist politics has been the recurring phenomenon of a single political party  winning a sizable bloc of seats from the North and east. This has enabled the party concerned particularly the ITAK to make and/or unmake Governments in the past. In recent times the TNA too has been able to engage with presidents and governments on the basis of being the premier political configuration representing Northern and Eastern Tamils in parliament. It has also given them international approval.",
    "The recent break-up of the TNA as well as increasing fragmentation of the Tamil polity both horizontally and vertically suggests that no single Tamil party would be able to command a majority of seats in the next Parliament.  The  relatively middle of the road ITAK itself is likely to fare poorly , losing out to the school of  Tamil Confrontational  politics on the one hand and the school of Tamil conciliatory politics on the other.",
    "If the ITAK fractures  as a result of the Sumanthiran -Shritharan leadership tussle, the consequences for either faction would be drastic. There is the danger of both factions being marginalized.  The calamity of a potential split can be avoided at best or postponed at worst if the election is negated by the contestants arriving at a compromise.",
    "Another potential danger if and when the ITAK leadership election takes place would be  extraneous intervention. External agencies and actors could try and influence the outcome with not so benign motives. There are three possibilities. Elements from the Tamil Diaspora, elements from India and elements from the Sri Lankan deep state. I do not wish to elaborate more on these aspects at this juncture but would do so if necessary in the future.",
    "As stated earlier the election campaign has just started and is yet to gather steam. I interacted with several Tamil journalists in the north and east to gain an insight  about the  ITAK/FP presidential race. According to these journalistic sources, Sumanthiran is tipped to win with a slender majority.  But the situation could change as the campaign intensifies. Hence it is prudent and easier for well-intentioned ITAK stalwarts and well-wishers to intervene now and bring about a compromise.",
    "I am thinking of ITAK leaders like Sampanthan Maavai Senathirajah, CVK Sivagnanam, Kurukularajah as well as  \u201coutsider\u201d well-wishers like   lawyer K. Kanaga-Iswaran, academic Nirmala Chandrahasan and a few influential newspaper editors as people who could work positively and constructively in this regard. I do hope they would take the initiative and that the contenders  and their supporters would act in the best interests of the ITAK and the long suffering Tamil people.",
    "There are people  who  may think a settlement between Sumanthiran and Shritharan  would be impossible. They may be right. But nothing is lost by making a reconciliation attempt. After all, let it not be forgotten that Sumanthiran and Shritharan  worked as a team and conducted a joint campaign at the 2020 Parliamentary election. That is why they were the only two ITAK candidates to win from Jaffna. The Sumanthiran -Shritharan duo  should  not forget the saying \u2013\u201cUnited we stand, divided we fall\u201d.",
