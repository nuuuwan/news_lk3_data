    "SLPP General Secretary says no necessity for the Minister of Health to step down",
    "Rambukwella says ready to face no-confidence motion and continue to serve the public",
    "Protests against Minister and health service crisis held in several hospitals across the country",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary and MP Sagara Kariyawasam yesterday said that despite the growing opposition and protests surrounding the ongoing crisis in the health service, there was no necessity for the Minister of Health, Keheliya Rambukwella, to resign.",
    "\u201cThough various people may call for the Minister to be replaced, the Minister has been elected by the people\u2019s vote. He was then appointed to carry out certain duties. At the time he took over the Ministry of Health, the country was amidst a severe forex crisis. He has been successfully carrying out his duties since then,\u201d Kariyawasam maintained.",
    "\u201cNo probe to date has concluded that the crisis has occurred due to a fault, act or intervention of the Minister,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP likened the situation to the exploding gas cylinders of last year. \u201cOnce President Gotabaya Rajapaksa stepped down the explosions stopped. If there was a specific reason for cylinders to explode almost daily while he was President only to stop after his resignation remains unknown. But these incidents can take place in countries,\u201d he noted. Kariyawasam said any issues must be resolved through deep consideration rather than through the resignation of Ministers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Minister Keheliya Rambukwella on Sunday while addressing the party supporters in Kundasale said he is ready to face any obstacle that may come his way including a no-confidence motion in parliament.",
    "\u201cThis is my eighth Ministerial position. The post does not matter to me. However I have a duty to the people,\u201d he said. Rambukwella said he was ready to refute the malicious lies being spread by the opposition, expressing his willingness to provide evidence to counter their claims. The Minister also mentioned that his fellow colleagues in parliament have assured him of their support in the event of any future no-confidence motion being brought against him.",
    "A protest was held yesterday at the National Hospital in Colombo by the All Ceylon Nurses\u2019\u00a0 Union against the Minister and the importation of substandard medicines to the country. Protests were also held at several other hospitals across the island."
