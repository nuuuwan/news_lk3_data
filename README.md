### Sri Lanka bank interest rates edge up amid ‘ramrod anomaly’ in bills

*2025-09-22 06:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-bank-interest-rates-edge-up-amid-ramrod-anomaly-in-bills-241410/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s bank interest rates have continued to edge up after a rate cut in May 2025, amid a strong economic recovery made possible by the stability provided by the central bank through past deflationary policy as well as stable government policies.

According to central bank data the weighted average new fixed deposit rate fell to 6.62 percent in May and climbed to 6.85 percent in June and 6.90 percent in July.

However, banks are now mobilizing 12-month deposits at 7.75 percent and above to finance strong credit demand and an economic recovery.

The economic recovery may also have been helped by reduced government capex, which reduced domestic state borrowings and allowed private citizens to deploy resources to the most productive areas, bringing compounded long-term growth rather than bureaucratic spending.

The weighted average new lending rate climbed to 10.56 percent in April from 10.46 percent in March, fell to 10.28 percent in June, a month after the rate cut.

The clause had prohibited Litro from using storage facilities owned by competing suppliers to store imported gas reserves, a safeguard long considered essential to prevent market manipulation in the critical gas sector.

குப்பைமேட்டை போன்றதாகவே எதிர்க்கட்சிகளின் தற்போதைய ஒன்றிணைவு காணப்படுகிறது. நாட்டு மக்கள் தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தி பக்கம் உள்ளார்கள். ஆகவே மக்கள் இனியொருபோதும் ஊழல்வாதிகளையும், நாட்டை வங்குரோத்து நிலைக்குத் தள்ளியவர்களையும் ஆட்சிக்கு கொண்டு வர போவதில்லை என போக்குவரத்து,நெடுஞ்சாலைகள் அபிவிருத்தி துறைமுகம் மற்றும் சிவில் விமான சேவைகள் அமைச்சர் பிமல் ரத்நாயக்க தெரிவித்தார்.

அம்பாறை பகுதியில் 20ஆம் திகதி சனிக்கிழமை நடைபெற்ற மக்கள் சந்திப்பின் போது மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டார்.

கடந்த காலங்களில் திருடர்கள், ஊழல்வாதிகள் என்று ஒருவரையொருவர் தூற்றிக்கொண்டவர்கள் இன்று ஒரே மேடையில் ஒன்றிணைந்துள்ளார்கள். அதிகாரத்தை கைப்பற்றுவதற்காக நாம் ஒருவரை ஒருவர் திருடர் என்று விமர்சித்துக்கொண்டோம் என்று ஸ்ரீ லங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் பொதுச்செயலாளர் சாகர காரியவசம் குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.இதனை மக்கள் கூர்ந்து அவதானிக்க வேண்டும்.

Success will require both Government and citizens to embrace a shared vision — supporting reforms, backing key sectors, and investing in the nation’s future

All Share Price Index growth: 10,119 points or 93% gain post Presidential election

Market PE stands at 9.2, highly undervalued compared to regional peers

To truly understand the story of a nation, one need not look further than the pulse of its stock exchange. It is a living, breathing entity that discounts the future, processes the present, and is invariably haunted by the ghosts of the past. For 16 tumultuous years, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has been the most honest narrator of Sri Lanka’s modern saga—a tale of euphoric triumph, devastating despair and now become the forward barometer of Sri Lanka’s economic rebirth.

In exactly one year since the Presidential elections, the ASPI has gained more than 90%, gaining 10,119 points from 10,966 to 21,085 as of 19 September 2025.

Since the digital space is rich with resources, it naturally draws the interested persons to hack the systems to gain an undue enrichment. Hence, hackers and modes of hacking are aplenty.3 Government institutions are hacked not only for money but also to embarrass the rulers through temporary stoppage of government activities. Hence, AKD Government which is bent on making a digital transformation of the Sri Lanka economy is correct in its action to setup an outfit that will monitor the work of the key institutions day and night and prevent cyber attackers from destroying the system

### A no -confidence motion on the Speaker; At the meeting with the opposition leaders of the end result

*2025-09-22 01:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225693) · `ta`

No final decision has been taken on the proposal against Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne. United People's Power District Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said that the final decision will be taken during a meeting with opposition leaders this week.

The actions of Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne are completely contrary to parliamentary principles and the basic aspects of democracy. He does not protect the democracy of Parliament and the rights of the opposition parties. He acts on behalf of the ruling party.

It is doubtful whether the Speaker is unaware of the power and responsibility of his post. Pimal Ratnayake is directing the Speaker.

The Speaker has ignored the no -confidence motion against Deputy Minister of Defense Aruna Jayasekara.

Various parties have urged the Speaker's unilateral action to bring a no -confidence motion against him.

### Airport cyberattack disrupts more flights across Europe

Fallout from a cyberattack that disrupted check-in systems at several European airports extended into a second full day on Sunday, as passengers faced dozens of canceled and delayed flights — and the impact poised to worsen for at least one major airport.

Brussels Airport, seemingly the hardest hit, said it asked airlines to cancel nearly 140 departing flights scheduled for Monday because a U.S.-based software system provider “is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.” The airport said 25 outbound flights were canceled on Saturday and 50 on Sunday.

Starting late Friday, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up check-in and sent airline staffers trying options like handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops. Many other European airports were unaffected.

### Economist warns 5% growth insufficient, calls for ambitious reforms

*2025-09-21 18:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/economist-warns-5-growth-insufficient-calls-for-ambitious-reforms/) · `en`

Despite a recent uptick in economic indicators, a senior economist has cautioned that Sri Lanka’s current growth trajectory is inadequate for a full recovery, calling for a decisive push towards 8-10% expansion in the coming years.

The warning from University of Peradeniya’s Wasantha Athukorala follows data showing the economy grew by 4.9% in the second quarter of 2025, an improvement from the 4.1% growth recorded a year earlier.

Prof. Athukorala acknowledged a recent vote of confidence from the global market, referencing S&P Global Ratings’ upgrade of Sri Lanka’s foreign currency sovereign credit rating. However, he stressed that the ‘CCC+’ rating still signifies high risk and does not qualify the country for easy credit.

“This upgrade reflects a positive start for stability and growth,” he stated, noting it should boost investor confidence and improve access to global capital. “But the current 5% economic growth is not sufficient.”
