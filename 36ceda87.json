    "Manasinghe bagged five scalps for just 19 runs but it was Embuldeniya, who took two wickets, and Madushanka, with three dismissals to his name, that did the early damage, reducing South Africa \u2018A\u2019 to 66 for 5.",
    "Though Matthew Breetzke, with an unbeaten knock of 59, and Dewald Brewis put in some resistance sharing a brief stand of 27 runs for the sixth wicket, the others failed to make any impression.",
    "Manasinghe separated the pair, and from there on took control of things, cleaning off the tail as South Africa \u2018A\u2019 lost the remaining four wickets for the addition of only 38 runs and was bowled out for 131 runs.",
    "No play was possible after the closure of South Africa \u2018A\u2019s innings as a drizzle and bad light forced the umpires to call off the match with 48 overs of play being lost for the day. - MSA",
