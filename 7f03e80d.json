    "The goal of Daraz is to make e-commerce accessible for everyone by offering the best prices and variety to the local communities. This year, staples such as salt and milk powder were among the top-selling products and shoppers enjoyed substantial savings on their purchases reaffirming Daraz\u2019s commitment to helping local communities improve quality of life.",
    "Daraz is committed to helping sellers scale their online businesses and facilitated sales for 30,000 brands and sellers during this year\u2019s 11.11 sale. From offering on boarding workshops to rolling out new co-funded programs that aim at lowering sellers\u2019 cost of doing business, Daraz saw a 140% increase in sellers who made more than Rs. 5,000 in sales within the first 24 hours.",

This year, we doubled down on helping sellers maximise their sales while making online shopping more accessible, affordable and rewarding for shoppers. We are thankful to everyone; shoppers, sellers, brands, creators, partners and the incredible Daraz team, for without them, the success of Daraz 11.11 would not have been possible.\u201d",
