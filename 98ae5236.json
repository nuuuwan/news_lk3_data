    "COLOMBO (News 1st); After years of tangled cords and frustrating mismatches, the European Union has finally ushered in a new era of charging harmony. Starting in 2024, USB-C will become the universal charging standard for a wide range of electronic devices across the bloc, marking a significant victory for consumer convenience and environmental sustainability.",
    "This landmark legislation, passed in October 2022, will see mobile phones, tablets, cameras, headphones, e-readers, and more all equipped with the versatile USB-C port.",
    "This means no more frantic searches for the \"right\" cable in a drawer full of obsolete plugs, no more pleading with friends for a compatible charger, and no more begrudgingly buying another single-use adapter.",
    "While some temporary exemptions exist for certain devices, such as laptops, the EU is committed to expanding the reach of the USB-C standard. By 2026, all laptops sold within the bloc will also be required to adopt the universal port.",
    "One charger to rule them all? The EU is betting it's a win for everyone.",
