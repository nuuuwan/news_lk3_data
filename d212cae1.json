  "original_body_lines": [
    "Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform X has sued a left-leaning pressure group that accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising.",
    "X\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Media Matters for America \u201cmanipulated\u201d data in an attempt to \u201cdestroy\u201d the platform formerly known as Twitter.",
    "Firms including Apple, Disney, IBM and Comcast have paused adverts on X since the watchdog released its analysis.",
    "After Musk threatened the lawsuit, Media Matters called him a bully.",
    "X said in the lawsuit that ads for Comcast, Oracle and IBM had only appeared alongside hateful content for Media Matters, and no other viewer.",
    "Linda Yaccarino, chief executive of\u00a0 X, posted on Monday: \u201cHere\u2019s the truth. Not a single authentic user on X saw IBM\u2019s, Comcast\u2019s, or Oracle\u2019s ads next to the content in Media Matters\u2019 article.\u201d",
    "In the wake of the Media Matters allegations, the European Commission, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount and Lionsgate have also pulled ad dollars from X.",
    "On Saturday,\u00a0 Musk vowed to file a \u201cthermonuclear\u201d lawsuit against Media Matters, and anyone \u201cwho colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company\u201d.",
    "In response, Media Matters president Angelo Carusone said they would win any legal action. \u201cFar from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully who threatens meritless lawsuits in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate,\u201d Carusone said in a statement.",
    "Founded in 2004, Media Matters is known for its criticism of conservative commentators and media outlets. It describes itself as a non-profit \u201cprogressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the US media\u201d.",
    "Last Wednesday, Musk came under fire after he replied to a post sharing a conspiracy theory accusing Jewish communities of pushing hatred against white people, calling it \u201cactual truth\u201d. The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur later denied antisemitism, saying his comments referred not to all Jewish people, but to groups like the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish anti-hate monitor.",
    "Meanwhile, Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Monday that he had opened an investigation into Media Matters \u201cfor potential fraudulent activity\u201d over its allegations about X. His office released a statement calling the liberal group a \u201cradical anti-free speech organization\u201d.",
    "Mr Paxton also vowed to ensure that \u201cthe public has not been deceived by the schemes of radical left-wing organizations who would like nothing more than to limit freedom by reducing participation in the public square\u201d.",
    "Also on Monday the White House announced President Joe Biden would join Threads \u2013 the Meta-owned rival to X. Threads accounts have also been created for the president, first lady, vice-president and second gentleman.",
