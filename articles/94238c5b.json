    "While headlines celebrate the Colombo Stock Exchange\u2019s bullish run, with the All Share Price Index (ASPI) recently rising by 2.6%, the average Sri Lankan is left wondering: How does this actually affect my daily life? The stark reality is that macroeconomic stability often yields a mixed bag for ordinary citizens. Some costs rise, while others see fleeting relief, and financial policies rarely translate into tangible benefits for the working class.",
    "To understand this disconnect, The Island Financial Review spoke with an economic analyst who wished to remain anonymous.",
    "When asked about the stock market rally, the expert noted that while it benefits some, the gains largely bypass the majority.",
    "\u201cMost Sri Lankans don\u2019t own stocks, so the rewards go to big investors, corporations, and the wealthy. For many, daily survival hinges on more pressing concerns like stagnant wages, job security, and access to affordable loans. For the average person and small businesses, slow wage growth and loan accessibility matter far more than a rising stock market. This stark contrast highlights how financial markets and the everyday \u2018main street\u2019 economy often move in opposite directions,\u201d the expert explained.",
    "Despite the Central Bank holding its Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) steady at 7.75%, signaling stable borrowing costs, commercial banks have recently raised their Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) to 8.10%, marking a 9-basis-point jump within just one week.",
    "Explaining this mismatch, the analyst stated, \u201cBanks may be pricing in higher risks or economic uncertainty or simply protecting profit margins. The real-world impact is significant; small businesses and individual borrowers face higher monthly payments and tighter budgets. While the Central Bank sets the wholesale price of money, banks control the retail price. Ordinary borrowers find themselves caught in the middle.\u201d",
    "Referring to food prices that surged by 4.2% year-on-year, straining household budgets, the analyst remarked, \u201cNon-food items, however, fell by 2.8%, offering a bit of relief. Core inflation has crept up to 0.6%, signaling lingering cost pressures. The economy sends mixed signals. While some goods are getting cheaper, essentials like food remain costly, and loans are growing pricier, leaving families with little breathing room. For most, macroeconomic stability doesn\u2019t guarantee a life that meets basic needs. The critical question remains: Are earnings keeping up with expenses? At present, the answer is uncertain.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Central Bank manages the big picture, but banks and external forces operate under their own realities. Until wages rise, food prices drop, and loans become more affordable, ordinary people will continue to feel the squeeze,\u201d the analyst said.",
    "When asked whether the rewards enjoyed by the stakeholders of the financial markets would lift up the middle and lower classes, he replied,\u201d I am not a believer in the \u2018trickledown effect\u2019, and I don\u2019t think such a thing would happen anytime soon.\u201d",
    "First Capital maintains constructive outlook on NDB, sees strong growth potential",
