    "\u201cYour appointment as the 16th and third woman to serve in this capacity in Sri Lanka\u2019s history is seen as a significant step forward for gender representation in our country\u2019s politics and is expected to inspire a new generation of female leaders,\u201d said a congratulatory letter signed by FTZMA Chairman Dhammika Fernando and Hon. Secretary Tyronne Weckasinghe.",
    "We eagerly anticipate close collaboration with you as our new Prime Minister and with the Government to reinforce disciplined and effective work practices in all government institutions, including the BOI, through progressive fiscal policies aimed at attracting increased Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into the country. We have no doubt that you would steer the country as our new PM with several ministerial portfolios leading to gradual and systematic progress for the country in the coming years. We are fully committed to support your Government in achieving these goals at all times.",
    "We look forward to meeting you and working with you and your team to deepen our ties. Please accept our best wishes for your good health and success.",

Representing over 1,500 enterprises, we regularly address common issues in coordination with the BOI and other state agencies. We diligently ensure the well-being of our employees while supporting investors and ensuring smooth operations, fostering substantial foreign direct investments (FDI), creating jobs, and contributing significantly to the nation\u2019s GDP.",
