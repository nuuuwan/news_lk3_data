    "Mar. 24 (AFP) - Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis both slammed their second century of the match as Sri Lanka set up a 511-run target for Bangladesh before pushing the host to the corner in the first Test today.",
    "The visitor was all out for 418 in its second innings at Sylhet, with Mendis making 164 runs to go with his 102 in the first innings and De Silva, who also scored 102 runs in the first innings, adding 108.",
    "Sri Lankan pacers began the victory push immediately, reducing Bangladesh to 47/5 at stumps, with 464 more needed for an unlikely win.",
    "Vishwa Fernando claimed 3-13, while Kasun Rajitha and Lahiru Kumara each claimed a wicket as Mahmudul Hasan (0), Najmul Hossain Shanto (6), Zakir Hasan (19), Shahadat Hossain (0), and Liton Das (0) all departed.",
    "The sorry display from Bangladesh\u2019s batters came when de Silva and Mendis dominated the bowlers for the better part of the day, becoming only the third pair in Test history to score a century in both innings.",
    "The Chappell brothers, Greg and Ian, of Australia achieved the feat against New Zealand in March 1974, before Misbah-ul-Haq and Azhar Ali emulated it against Australia in Abu Dhabi in 2014.",
    "The pair, who shared 202 runs in Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings total of 280 runs, put on 173 runs together this time. Mehidy Hasan Miraz broke their partnership before finishing with 4-74 for Bangladesh.",
    "Resuming on 119/5, the visitor lost nightwatchman Fernando (four) early to Khaled Ahmed before de Silva and Mendis took control.",
    "De Silva brought his second century into the game with a single off Mehidy before he was dropped by Nahid Rana off Shoriful Islam on 101. Mehidy ensured the drop did not hurt the team more, soon ending de Silva\u2019s innings, with Zakir taking the catch at short midwicket.",
    "Mendis put away a full toss of Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto to bring his own hundred off 171.",
    "Mehidy removed Prabath Jayasuriya, who made 25, and Lahiru Kumara off successive deliveries to give Bangladesh some relief."
