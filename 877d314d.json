    "The government is making a shameful attempt to bring in a Constitutional Amendment to extend the term of local authorities for an indefinite period and to reinstate the already dissolved local authorities, the National People's Power (NPP) said.",
    "NPP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that a gazette notification was issued on June 23 as a private member's bill to bring in the amendment.",
    "\u201cAccording to the Local Government Elections Ordinance, the subject minister is empowered to extend the term of a local authority for a period of one year on special circumstances. However, this particular amendment has been proposed to authorize the minister to extend the term for an indefinite period. It also proposes to reinstate a dissolved local authority,\u201d he said.",
    "He said this move was against the Constitution and added that previous court rulings clearly show that people\u2019s mandate can be shortened if required but cannot be extended for any reason.",
    "He said President Ranil Wickremesinghe has postponed the LG polls as its outcome would affect his next Presidential dream and on the other hand he is trying to reinstate local authorities so as to get the support of the SLPP.",
    "Silva said the NPP would take every step to defeat such a move. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
