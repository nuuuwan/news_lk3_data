    "The shift towards renewable energy in Sri Lanka is pivotal amidst growing concerns over energy security, said Professor Asanka Rodrigo of the University of Moratuwa, an expert in Electrical Engineering and a former Director General of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority.",
    "Speaking at the event titled \u2018Energy Landscape of Sri Lanka: Transition Pathways\u2019 at the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) at Wimalasurendra Auditorium in Colombo, on Monday he said; \u2018The country\u2019s historical reliance on imported fossil fuels has surged, prompting urgent measures to bolster indigenous resources like solar and wind power. Curtin Colombo, in collaboration with the IESL, hosted the event.",
    "Professor Rodrigo stressed that integrating these intermittent sources into the national grid poses significant technical challenges, demanding upgrades in grid infrastructure, storage solutions and advanced management technologies.",
    "\u201cThe journey towards a sustainable energy future hinges on robust policy frameworks, strategic investments, and international collaborations to navigate these complexities effectively, he said.",
    "Excerpts from Dr. Rodrigo\u2019s presentation: \u2018Based on the latest data from the Sustainable Energy Authority, Sri Lanka\u2019s primary energy supply comprises 38.1% petroleum and 13.1% coal from imported sources, with indigenous sources contributing 32.0% biomass, 10.5% major hydro, and 6.3% new renewable energy. Historically, somewhere in 1985, Sri Lanka relied on imported fossil fuels for only 20% of its energy needs, with the remaining 80% sourced from indigenous resources like biomass and hydro. However, the significant increase in dependency on imported fossil fuels since then has raised concerns about energy security.",
    "\u2018To address this challenge, expanding renewable energy sources is the most feasible solution. This can be achieved through initiatives, such as, implementing large-scale solar projects, incentivizing rooftop solar installations, investing in wind farms and enhancing biomass energy use. Additionally, improving energy efficiency across industries, residential buildings, and commercial establishments, along with promoting energy-efficient appliances and conducting public awareness campaigns on energy conservation, can significantly reduce overall energy consumption.",
    "\u2018Strengthening the policy and regulatory framework is essential to support renewable energy projects.",
    "This includes investing in research and development to explore advanced renewable energy technologies and storage solutions. Improving grid infrastructure to accommodate a higher proportion of renewable energy sources is also crucial. Moreover, fostering public-private partnerships and leveraging international funding and technical assistance for large-scale renewable energy initiatives will be pivotal in achieving a more resilient and sustainable energy future for Sri Lanka.",
    "\u2018Integrating indigenous resources such as solar and wind energy into Sri Lanka\u2019s power grid presents several technical challenges. This is primarily due to their intermittent nature and the relatively small size of the country\u2019s power system. Solar power generation varies with the time of day, weather conditions, and seasonal changes, while wind energy depends on unpredictable wind patterns. These fluctuations make it challenging to predict and manage power supply consistently.",
    "\u2018Grid stability and reliability are major concerns when integrating these intermittent energy sources. Sri Lanka\u2019s power grid operates at a specific frequency (50 Hz), and sudden changes in power generation can cause frequency fluctuations, potentially destabilizing the grid. Maintaining voltage stability is crucial as variations in power output can impact the safe operation of electrical equipment and overall grid stability. Given the relatively small scale of Sri Lanka\u2019s power system, it is particularly vulnerable to instability from renewable energy fluctuations, necessitating significant upgrades to grid infrastructure.",
    "\u2018To effectively integrate solar and wind power, Sri Lanka needs to modernize its grid infrastructure. This includes implementing advanced management systems, smart grid technologies, and real-time monitoring and control systems. Enhancing the capacity and reliability of transmission and distribution networks is crucial to accommodate variable output from renewable sources and prevent congestion. Energy storage solutions like battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro storage can help mitigate the intermittency of solar and wind power by storing excess energy during peak generation and releasing it during low generation periods.\u2019",
    "IESL President Prof. Ranjith Dissanayake said by hosting this event, Curtin Colombo underscored its strengths and commitment to addressing crucial issues.",
    "He said that the collaboration with IESL highlighted Curtin Colombo as a forward-thinking and engaged knowledge hub, fostering impactful discussions. \u2018This partnership also emphasized Curtin Colombo\u2019s strong ties with professional bodies and industries, particularly in the local engineering and energy sectors.\u2019",
    "The panel discussion focused on the current and future energy needs of Sri Lanka, exploring diverse pathways for energy transition. An introductory presentation provided accessible insights into energy and thermodynamics, laying the foundation for an in-depth exploration of renewable energy options available to Sri Lanka.",
    "Panelists included professors from Curtin University and other institutions, showcasing a high-caliber academic network and international perspectives, which underscored Curtin Colombo\u2019s global connections.",
