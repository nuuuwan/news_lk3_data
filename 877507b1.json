    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka sees a 30 percent dropout rate in its tertiary education sector, Dr T A Piyasiri, former Vice-Chancellor, University of Vocational Technology said.",
    "One reason dropouts were high among those who joined state-owned tertiary education institutes after leaving school, was that they were free, he said.",
    "\u201cThe reasons for the dropouts; The first is that students have found employment \u2013 21.5 percent of students have dropped out for employment. The second reason is economic hardships, and the third is incorrect choice by students,\u201d Piyasiri said at the launch of the World Bank publication \u2018Enhancing Skills in Sri Lanka for Inclusion, Recovery, and Resilience\u2019 on Monday (11).",
    "Around 20 percent of Sri Lankan school graduates go on to further education while one-third of them enroll at training colleges, Chiyo Kanda, Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives, said.",
    "Half of Sri Lanka\u2019s students do not receive a post-secondary education, or tertiary education, including college, university, and vocational courses.",
    "\u201cWhen surveyed students said they have to leave because they found employment. Why is that employment very important? Because the opportunity cost of being out of employment is greater than being in the course,\u201d co-author of the report, Shobana Sosale said.",
    "Sosale recommended tackling high dropout rates by having a more student-centered system which allowed mature students who are employed to attend courses online.",
    "The government is committed to providing professional training in skills and technology to students post-general and advanced level examinations, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha has said. (Colombo/Dec12/2023)"
