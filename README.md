### Sri Lanka slips 15 places in UN gender equality ranking

Sri Lanka has slipped sharply in global gender equality rankings, according to findings presented by UN Women to the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus recently. The country, which ranked 18th out of 115 nations in 2006, has fallen to 130th among 148 countries in 2025.

The study assessed women’s economic empowerment, participation in governance and decision-making, roles in peace and security, and efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. While acknowledging that some of the region’s most influential figures are women, the research highlighted persistent disparities between men and women across these areas.

Chairing the session, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj called for the final report to be shared with the caucus and proposed that, in addition to allocations for the Women and Child Affairs Ministry, each Ministry should set aside funds in the upcoming Budget to support women’s empowerment.

The New Orders Index also increased in August. According to survey respondents, road development and water supply work were the most commonly awarded project types during the month.

In August, both the Employment and Quantity of Purchases indices increased, indicating the optimism for continued growth in the construction work.

ජනාධිපති වැය ශීර්ෂයේ තුන් ගුණයක ඉහළ යාමක්: මෙවර විසර්ජන පනත් කෙටුම්පතේ මුදල් බෙදී ගොස් ඇත්තේ කෙසේ ද?

අයවැය ඉදිරිපත් කිරීමේ පළමු පියවර වන මෙය, තුන්වරක් කියවීමෙන් පසුව පාර්ලිමේන්තුවේ සම්මත වීමට පෙර හඳුන්වන්නේ විසර්ජන පනත් කෙටුම්පත ලෙස යි.

මුදල් අමාත්‍යවරයා වන ජනාධිපති අනුර කුමාර දිසානායක ඒ වන විට විදේශගතව සිටි බැවින් විසර්ජන පනත් කෙටුම්පත පාර්ලිමේන්තුවට ඉදිරිපත් කළේ වැඩබලන මුදල් අමාත්‍යවරයා විසිනි.

### Beyond degrees: Creating future-ready workforce for Sri Lanka

*2025-10-03 01:38:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Beyond-degrees-Creating-future-ready-workforce-for-Sri-Lanka/4-782547) · `en`

The future of Sri Lanka’s economy depends not only on investment and policy but on how well the country prepares its people for the world of work. The Government is pushing forward with significant reforms to revamp the education system, from modernising curricula to expanding vocational training pathways. These initiatives deserve appreciation. They demonstrate a recognition that the nation cannot build a resilient future with outdated methods of teaching and learning.

In an increasingly competitive world, equipping students and employees with modern skills is crucial for both social progress and economic stability. Yet, despite these promising efforts, fundamental questions remain about whether the country is truly preparing its people to be future-ready and whether the billions spent on free education are delivering an adequate return on investment.

### Growing the pool of billion-dollar companies in Sri Lanka

*2025-10-03 01:33:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Growing-the-pool-of-billion-dollar-companies-in-Sri-Lanka/4-782541) · `en`

Today, Sri Lanka has just three listed companies valued at over a billion dollars: John Keells Holdings (JKH), Commercial Bank of Ceylon, and Ceylon Tobacco PLC. This is a sobering statistic for an economy with ambitions of becoming a South Asian hub for trade, services, and investment. A country of 22 million people, strategically positioned astride major maritime routes, and possessing a strong pool of talent in accounting, IT, and law, should be capable of nurturing multiple billion-dollar firms across diverse sectors. The fact that it has not points to deeper structural barriers inhibiting corporate growth.

### Financial institutions at crossroads: Redefining risk management in the age of climate change

*2025-10-03 01:31:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Financial-institutions-at-crossroads-Redefining-risk-management-in-the-age-of-climate-change/4-782540) · `en`

In the end, banks become the ultimate receivers of climate shocks, bearing the financial fallout of environmental catastrophes

The recent flash floods in Uttarakhand, India where over 100 people went missing, are just one among thousands of climate-related disasters in recent years. For banks, the impact is direct washed-out assets, loan defaults, and rising credit risk. This is not tomorrow’s threat; climate risk is already reshaping financial stability today. In the end, banks become the ultimate receivers of climate shocks, bearing the financial fallout of environmental catastrophes. Banking risk management is entering a new era. Traditional frameworks built around credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk are no longer sufficient to address the growing complexities of a changing world.

### Energy diplomacy: How Sri Lanka can bridge trade gap with United States

*2025-10-03 01:25:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Energy-diplomacy-How-Sri-Lanka-can-bridge-trade-gap-with-United-States/4-782539) · `en`

For Sri Lanka, the United States is more than just a trading partner. It is the single most important destination for Sri Lankan exports, particularly apparel, and a market that sustains hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributes significantly to national GDP. Yet, beneath this success story lies a structural imbalance. While Sri Lanka exports billions of dollars’ worth of goods to the United States each year, its imports from America remain comparatively small. This asymmetry leaves Sri Lanka exposed to tariff risks, particularly in the post-Trump era where US trade policy has become increasingly transactional.

### One Nation, One Future: Ending Divisions In Education & Media

*2025-10-02 20:14:37* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/one-nation-one-future-ending-divisions-in-education-media/) · `en`

If Sri Lanka is to truly progress as a developed nation, the first and most powerful change must come not from technology, foreign aid, or new infrastructure, but from the attitudes of her people. The mindset of unity, compassion, and shared destiny is what transforms a country.

If we want to change the attitudes of people and to develop the country, the divisions and disparities in school education should be ended. And also, the media should not divide but unite the people. This is not a task for society alone—it is a responsibility that falls on the state, education authorities, and the media sector.

கடுமையான குற்றங்களுக்காக தண்டிக்கப்பட்டால், எந்தவொரு எதிர்க்கட்சி அரசியல்வாதியையும் பாதுகாக்கவும் ஆதரிக்கவும் ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தி (SJB) தயாராக இல்லை என்று SJB பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் ஹர்ஷனா ராஜகருணா இன்று தெரிவித்தார்.

ரக்பி வீரர் வாசிம் தாஜுதீன் கொலை போன்ற குற்றத்திற்காக எதிர்க்கட்சி அரசியல்வாதி ஒருவர் கைது செய்யப்பட்டால், அவரை ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தி பாதுகாக்குமா என்று ஊடகவியலாளர்கள் எழுப்பிய கேள்விக்கு பதிலளிக்கும் விதமாக பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் ராஜகருணா இந்தக் கருத்தை முன்வைத்தார்.

"மேலும், கொள்கைகளில் ஒற்றுமைகள் இல்லாவிட்டால், எதிர்க்கட்சி அரசியல் கட்சிகளுடன் நாங்கள் அரசியல் இணைவில் ஈடுபட மாட்டோம்," என்று அவர் மேலும் கூறினார்.

### Dialog AI Empowers Sri Lanka’s SMEs to Grow Smarter

*2025-10-02 19:31:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dialog-ai-empowers-sri-lankas-smes-to-grow-smarter/) · `en`

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Sri Lanka’s economy, forming the vast majority of the business sector. Yet many entrepreneurs struggle to access digital tools that truly work for them, especially when most global platforms are built primarily for English speakers. Dialog AI — the country’s first trilingual generative AI platform — is stepping in to bridge this gap, available free for all Dialog customers with no data charges.

What sets Dialog AI apart is its localisation for Sri Lankan users. Unlike global large language models (LLMs), it is built to reflect local context and culture. Its responses in Sinhala and Tamil are sharper, clearer, and more relevant than those of other AI tools, and it even supports informal blends like Singlish and Tanglish. This means entrepreneurs can interact with AI in the way they naturally speak — whether drafting a marketing pitch in Sinhala, clarifying a supplier contract in Tamil, or mixing languages casually in conversation.
