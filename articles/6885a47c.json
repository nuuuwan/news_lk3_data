    "This is in response to the program, \u2018Adopt an Ambulance\u2019 which was initiated by the Board and Management of the 1990 Suwa Seriya Foundation.",
    "The two ambulances were released for service on 12 May 2024 from the Colombo Stock Exchange head office located at the World Trade Centre. The CSE branches are located in Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala, Panadura, Negombo, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Batticaloa, and Ambalantota.",
