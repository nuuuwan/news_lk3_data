### Sri Lanka can cut floor rate, but targeting ‘dysfunctional’ market will lead to trouble

*2024-11-25 11:16:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-should-not-suppress-call-rates-through-omo-if-market-is-so-dysfunctional-189613/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is just emerging from a default after large volumes of money were printed to target a narrow policy rate, in the pursuit of instant growth (potential output) and denying monetary stability to the people.

From 2015 in particular Sri Lanka very narrowly targeted a policy rate despite being a reserve collecting central bank.

Targeting a mid-corridor rate is the same as printing money to maintain a single policy rate. The label is different but the required inflationism is the same.

The same consequences of targeting a mid-corridor rate in 2015 and especially 2018 when the budget deficit was brought down.

If the call money rate is so dysfunctional as claimed in a recent defence of money printing through OMO, it should obviously not be used as the operating target for monetary policy at all.

Since the end of the war the central bank has cut rates around 18 to 20 months after a currency crisis, just as private credit recovered and triggered a currency crisis.

*2024-11-25 01:53:13* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/clyd9w09xe4o) · `si`

### Arugam Bay; hidden currents

*2024-11-25 01:05:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Arugam-Bay-hidden-currents/4-769617) · `en`

There has been growing public concern over the recent weeks, about happenings in Arugam Bay (AB). This analysis adds to the discourse.

Democratic states are obliged to protect all people within its borders, whether citizens or non-citizens. Non-citizens include tourists on short stays, subject to the law of the land they visit.

Informed sources report that Jewish places of prayer have been set up for Israeli tourists in AB. Though few would object to people at prayer, this raises a concern. Why would tourists on short stays want this, when they can pray in their rooms?

A likely answer links two possibilities. Some of these tourists are here to stay longer and have been permitted to do so. And, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the construction or designation of a Jewish place of prayer for Israelis. The stringent regulations governing the establishment of new places of prayer or worship for our own citizens, makes this favour even more puzzling.

AKD, in his President’s address, disproved his critics. However, after the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, it is the economy stupid that is going to loom over Sri Lanka making it AKD’s biggest challenge

Wickremesinghe denies knowledge of the affair, contradicting Karunanayake's claim. The New Democratic Front is considering candidates for the remaining National List seat, with Kanjana Wijesekera being a top choice. The SLFP has also requested a National List member, causing a delay in the final decision.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe could not know the affair sent to Ravi Karunanayake's name to the National List. Former parliamentarian Rajitha Senaratne said that Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee to investigate her action.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the new Democratic Front office in Colombo on Sunday (24).

Two National List seats were available to the new Democratic Front in the parliamentary election. Ravi Karunanayake has taken one of them. None of the leading party members know about the affair he received. Ravi Karunanayake has said that Ranil Wickremesinghe had informed Wickremesinghe in advance regarding the matter.. If Ranil Wickremesinghe is aware of this, why should the committee be set up to investigate his action.

Ranil Wickremesinghe was the ongoing opposition to the issue. No one in the party is holding Ranil Wickremesinghe as a hostage. So can no one can hold him hostage. But Ranil Wickremesinghe can hold the hostage.
