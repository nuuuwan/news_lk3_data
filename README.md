The attack affected people of various nationalities and economic statuses, including children of Helch Powlsen, a Denmark millionaire. The Tamils of Sri Lanka, often overlooked, face ongoing struggles, including social discrimination, economic crises, and political recognition issues. Despite not being directly attacked, their communities have been severely impacted, leading to financial strain and displacement. Individual stories highlight the psychological and economic toll, such as Vadani, widowed with three children, and John, whose wife is psychologically affected by the loss of their daughter, leading to unemployment and financial strain.

Singing Easter Sunday Attax: Still Avating Justice

The survival Sunday attack has taken the lives of many people from many nationalities and many economic status.

Many boys who went to Christian Goddesses, including the children (tourists) of Helch Powlsen, the most famous Denmark millionaire and chief executive officer of Bestseller, were killed.

Many articles have been written on the victims and the survivors and the media has focused on the media, but the Tamils of Sri Lanka have been seen as a forgotten society.

It is not a new issue to be forgotten and excluded by the community for these people living in the mountainous areas of Sri Lanka.

Although they have been brought from India by British rulers to work in the hill country, their lives and current conditions have not yet improved.

The struggle and lack of equality that began as part of slavery in the colonial period continues to date.

### Colonial Legacies: Cultural Imperialism & The Fracturing Of Ethnic Identities

*2024-04-21 10:24:50* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/colonial-legacies-cultural-imperialism-the-fracturing-of-ethnic-identities/) · `en`

Cultural imperialism evolved from the concept of using cultural domination as a means of political and economic control. The idea behind cultural imperialism is that a powerful group, often a colonial power or dominant nation, imposes its cultural values, beliefs, and practices on a less powerful group or nation. This imposition is not just about spreading culture but is often a deliberate strategy to exert influence, control resources, and maintain dominance. It was a tool used to weaken the cultural identity and unity of colonized peoples. By imposing the culture, language, and values of the colonizers, the colonized were often made to feel inferior or backward, which reinforced the power dynamics of colonial rule.

### Is Religion The Opium Of The Masses?

“Myself when young did eagerly frequent, Doctor and Saint and heard great Argument, About it and about, but evermore, Came out by the same Door as in I went”

Perhaps there is no phrase of Karl Marx that is better known or more frequently quoted than his quip about religion being the opium of the masses. So let me quote the passage in full.

“Religious distress is an expression of real distress and a protest against this distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the spirit of a spiritless condition. It is the opium of the masses. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the condition for their real happiness. The demand to give up this illusion is the demand for men to give up a condition which needs illusions”. Marx, Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right.

### Sri Lanka choices recalled in Vietnam debate on monetary and fiscal options to target output

*2024-04-21 07:32:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-choices-recalled-in-vietnam-debate-on-monetary-and-fiscal-options-to-target-output-159511/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Vietnam can grow 6.0 percent in 2024, with ‘policy support’ but there is a debate whether it should be done through fiscal (widening deficits/worsening debt or state spending) or monetary means, a top International Monetary Fund official said.

The IMF projects 6.0 percent growth for Vietnam in 2024 “as it rebounds from a challenging 2023,” Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department told reporters during the Spring Meetings in Washington.

“Now, in the case of Vietnam, I would say that there’s an issue about policy mix, whether you could get more support from the fiscal and rely less on monetary,” Srinivasan said.

“So there is an issue of policy mix which we’re talking, which we’ve been engaging the authorities with.

“I would say that policy support should be more favorable and that should, and along with external demand, help raise growth to 6 percent.”

One of the most enchanting books I have read in recent times has to be “A Moveable Feast” by the celebrated American writer Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). The book eludes  easy categorisation, although it could be broadly considered a memoire of a period of his early life, when he lived in Paris (from 1921 to 1926). Hemingway had kept notes of his Paris days, getting down to writing “A Movable Feast” only in the last years of his life, in 1957 to be exact.

### Remembering an April half a century ago

*2024-04-21 04:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/remembering-an-april-half-a-century-ago/) · `en`

The month of April 1971. Fifty three years ago. Never to be forgotten by the older of us. Ceylon that year was embroiled in anarchy and the country was on the brink of being taken over by insurgents. We were still known as Ceylon then since the name change to Sri Lankan was in 1972.

I need not detail or even refer to most of what happened in 1970 and 71. ‘Kill’ was the operative word; youth to the forefront; rivers turned red with human blood; smoking tyres with bodies inside fouled the air and dread, dread an utter uncertainty prevailed. Names in the forefront on the government side were Srimavo Bandaranaike, PM; Felix Dias Bandaranaike, Minister of Justice; Sepala Attyglle, Army Commander; SA ‘Jungle’ Dissanayake, former IGP brought back as Addl. Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs and Defense. The top person in the JVP was of course Rohana Wijeweera, with Wijesena Vidanage, Somawanse Amarasinghe and a couple of others his next tier leaders.

### Some Thoughts for the New Year

*2024-04-21 02:55:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/some-thoughts-for-the-new-year/) · `en`

Last week was the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Avurudu in Sinhala, Puththandu in Tamil. It marks the end of one harvest season and the beginning of another. Celebrated by Sri Lankans of all shades and stripes, of every class and background, it demonstrates, as does no other event, the multifaceted character of Sri Lankan culture.

As Sri Lanka lurches into a New Year three months after January 1, then, this is the time to reflect on what it is becoming and will become of us over the next 12 months. What shape will the country take by April 13 next year? Will the status quo – political, social, economic – stand, or will there be a rupture in the way things are? Will the present batch of leaders become politically irrelevant? Most crucially, how will the world around Sri Lanka change, and how can, and how should, Sri Lanka adapt itself to that brave new world?

Rupa Jayasena gazed intently on the vista below, as she sat in the front veranda of her home, high up on the hill of Hanthana, overlooking the Peradeniya University’s green campus scattered with trees and bushes in bloom. She could discern within the meticulously landscaped terrain the Peradeniya-Galaha road winding its way to Getambe and beyond. She would sit in the veranda all afternoon with frequent cups of tea and watch the young men and women walking between their residential halls and lecture rooms, clutching books and files. They were in happy groups; or couples absorbed with each other; or hurrying single students.

Cashew nuts are kidney-shaped seeds that adhere to the bottom of the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree, is native to the coastal areas of North-Eastern Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Peru.

In the 16th century, Portuguese explorers introduced cashew trees to other tropical regions such as India, Indonesia, some African countries and Sri Lanka, where they are now grown. The cashew tree was famous for its apple, which is hardly eaten in our country but is a delicacy in some countries. It is eaten ripe, mixed in fruit salads, or pickled.
