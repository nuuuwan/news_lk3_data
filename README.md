Mar. 19 (cricket.com.au) - Cricket Australia has again postponed a bilateral series against Afghanistan, scheduled for August, citing deteriorating human rights for women and girls in the country under Taliban rule.

The Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted a proposal seeking permission to award procurement contracts to import more eggs from India, based on the recommendations of the Standing Procurement Committee.

As such, 42 million more eggs are to be brought into Sri Lanka, as per a Cabinet approval granted in December 2023.

On 18 December last year, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to import eggs from India until 30 April 2024 in a bid to maintain stable prices in the local market and to provide the products at reasonable rates to the consumers.

After receiving the approval, Sri Lanka has thus far imported as many as 18 million eggs from its neighbor and 42 million more eggs are planned to be brought in.

For this purpose, the Department of Animal Production and Health has already called proposed rates from the recommended Indian companies. Accordingly, a proposal tabled by the President to award relevant procurement contracts to import Indian eggs was green-lighted by the Cabinet.

Due to deforestation in urban areas, Western purple-faced langurs also known as purple-faced leaf monkey are forced to use rooftops for travel in search of food and resting places, putting them at risk of encounters with dogs, people, and vehicles which can be fatal for the animals, a primatologist and behavioral ecologist said.

A recent post on social media revealed that three purple-faced langurs near Thalangama Lake were shot at, resulting in two animals succumbing to their injuries

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Smithsonian primatologist and behavioral ecologist Prof. Wolfgang Dittus said that the purple-faced langur is highly arboreal and that they come to the ground only under extreme circumstances when their arboreal pathways have been blocked by the removal of trees.

It is in this backdrop that people in urban settings now perceive Purple-faced langurs as a pest.

### Don’t cry for me Sri Lanka, if wrong people are elected - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-19 04:56:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Dont-cry-for-me-Sri-Lanka-if-wrong-people-are-elected-EDITORIAL/172-279106) · `en`

Elections have been the main focus among frontline political parties these days with the Presidential election scheduled for this year.

According to the Sri Lankan Constitution “the poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.”

Since the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is holding office “only for the unexpired period of the term of office” of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the term in this case is considered to be the term of President Rajapaksa who was sworn in on November 18, 2019. Hence the next Presidential election should be held between September 18 and October 18 this year.

### African debt crisis and lessons for Lanka

In the last two decades since Arrighi wrote his seminal article, Sri Lanka and many African countries have been on the same path of commercial borrowing. The process has resulted in the extraction of more wealth and further exacerbated balance of payment problems, even as the elite in these countries sprawl in luxurious consumption.

Crisis and despair push us to learn rapidly and that is true of debt crisis as well. But whom do we learn from and whom do we work with to find solutions to the crisis?

The IMF team in all their pomp are again visiting Sri Lanka. Their tutelage continues to be the same for us as many other countries in debt distress—austerity, repaying creditors and promoting free markets.

### Module Teaching Hospital Cancer Division Radiation Machine Repair Patients Struggle Against Hospital Administration

*2024-03-19 01:40:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179081) · `ta`

Patients at Batticaloa Teaching Hospital's Cancer Division accuse hospital of negligence due to frequent radiation machine breakdowns, forcing patients from Trincomalee, Ampara, and other areas to wait days for treatment. Hospital administration, led by Dr. Ganesalingam, has addressed this by hiring a technical officer for Jaffna and Batticaloa to ensure machine availability.

🟩

Patients who went to the hospital for treatment at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Cancer Division gathered in front of the hospital on Monday morning (18), accusing the hospital of the hospital.

It is customary for more patients to treat the disease from Trincomalee, Ampara and other parts of the country for the treatment of the hospital.

In this case, the radiation engine is often damaged and the person who is not here is unable to get treatment on the day since it is not here from Jaffna or Colombo.

As a result, the hospital has to go to the hospital in the morning and wait till night and get treated for the night.

Therefore, the machine should have been appointed here as the machine is often damaged and the patients have to wait until the engineer is dark or three days later.

Therefore, the hospital administration focused on this and obtained a solution to this.
