  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says Wickremesinghe prioritises suppression, short-term gains, sale of national resources, and promotion of racism",
    "Accuses Govt. of initiating significant crackdowns employing army and police",
    "Claims sale of profit-making state ventures could limit future opportunities for earning returns",
    "In a press conference held at the Freedom People\u2019s Congress office in Nawala yesterday, MP Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, launched a scathing critique of President Ranil Wickramasinghe, outlining what he described as a damaging four-pronged policy pursued by the former Prime Minister whenever he assumes power.",
    "Godahewa claimed that Wickramasinghe\u2019s policies prioritise the suppression of political opponents, short-term gains at the expense of the economy, the sale of national resources, and the promotion of racism and bigotry.",
    "The parliamentarian highlighted the electoral response to these policies in 2019, when a substantial 6.9 million people voted against the Wickramasinghe-led 2015-2019 Good Governance Government, opting for newcomer Gotabhaya Rajapaksa instead.",
    "\u201cThis rejection extended even to Wickramasinghe\u2019s party members, resulting in his defeat in the 2020 election and his subsequent failure to secure a seat in parliament. However, he has been appointed as the President by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna parliamentarians, allowing him to continue implementing his policies while disregarding the SLPP manifesto,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cUnder Wickramasinghe\u2019s current administration, significant crackdowns employing the army and police forces have been initiated,\u201d he alleged.",
    "Dr. Godahewa also expressed concern over the introduction of acts such as the Anti-Trust Act and Broadcasting Regulatory Act, indicating a potential trend of further suppression in the future.",
    "\u201cThe 2015-2019 period, led by Wickremesinghe, witnessed extensive borrowing, leading to a severe debt crisis for the country, with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa left to deal with the consequences. Unfortunately, President Wickramasinghe has resumed borrowing, exacerbating the already shrinking economy. This has raised concerns about the impact on the provident fund savings of the working class once domestic debt restructuring begins,\u201d he added.",
    "Commenting on the Government\u2019s decision to privatise profit-making ventures such as Sri Lanka Telecom, Godahewa warned that these sales could limit future opportunities for earning returns, perpetuating a capitalist economic system that widens the income gap within society.",
    "Additionally, the Government\u2019s rekindling of racism and bigotry, reminiscent of the previous era, was a matter of concern raised by Dr. Godahewa. \u201cThe period between 2015 and 2019 witnessed numerous racial and religious conflicts, resulting in loss of life. In contrast, under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, such issues were notably absent. The current Government\u2019s approach seems to employ a \u2018divide and rule\u2019 strategy, exacerbating racial and religious tensions,\u201d he said."
