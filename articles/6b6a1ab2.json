  "original_body_lines": [
    "SJB MP S.M. Marikkar points out that current compensation amounts has led to substandard or spoiled food for affected families",
    "Expresses concern that Colombo\u2019s flood mitigation project remains incomplete due to a change in Govt. and lack of funds",
    "Emphasises need for concrete actions, not just discussions, and stressed there is already a master plan for flood mitigation",
    "Urges Govt. to allocate funds and begin work on remaining steps to control floods in Kolonnawa",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar urged the Government yesterday to increase the compensation provided to those affected by disaster situations to reflect current market prices.",
    "Speaking in Parliament, the MP highlighted that despite the rising cost of living, the Government has not increased the compensation amount for citizens in disaster situations. He pointed out that currently, a person is given Rs. 150 per meal, totalling Rs. 450 per day for meals. As a result, affected families are receiving substandard meals or spoiled food.",
    "\u201cI urge the Government to adjust compensation to reflect current market prices,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP reflecting on the past disaster situation noted that the Kolonnawa electorate which he represents suffered severe floods in 2016 despite the rain fall being a mere 180 mm.",
    "However the MP commended the efforts of the Good Governance Government which he was a part of for implementing a flood mitigation program in the area.",
    "\u201cThis is why though it rained 450 mm this time around, the area only experienced a minor flood situation,\u201d he said.",
    "He noted under the plan, the then Government implemented a flood management system and established pump stations and flood gates to combat the disaster situation.",
    "\u201cThis is why the floods are better controlled in the area today,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP noted that however the project was not completed due to a Government change and work has now been halted.",
    "He said he wrote to both the President and the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation in 2022 and 2023 respectively requesting them to allocate funds to complete the project.",
    "Marikkar said however no funds were allocated and he did not receive a response to his request. The MP suggested that with an allocation of Rs. 700 million the work can be completed. \u201cThere remain just three more steps to do to control floods in Kolonnawa,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said that to provide a complete solution, concrete actions must be taken instead of merely holding discussions. He noted there is already a master plan available for flood mitigation, and there is no need to create another one. Marikkar emphasised the importance of reserving funds to build the necessary pump stations and urged the Government to begin work on them promptly to provide relief to the people."
