    "12. Appropriate and expedited reporting on quality failures is needed.",
    "Minister Keheliya said he is awaiting the results of the quality test of the drug in question after a thorough, independent examination by the National Drug Quality Control Laboratory (NDQL).",
    "He said this is the reason he had discussed with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to set up a \u2018Benchmark 4\u2019 laboratory funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) to qualitatively expedite such queries.",
    "Deep concerns were raised in the country about the alleged \u2018substandard drug imports\u2019 after an allergic reaction caused by an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone resulted in the death of a 21-year-old girl who was receiving treatment at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital in July for indigestion issues.",
