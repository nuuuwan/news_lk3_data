Sri Lanka has a long and proud history of supporting multi -faceted, peace and justice in the global arena. Our country continues to support international efforts to resolve conflict and uphold the rights of the oppressed, including our firm support for Palestine in the United Nations.

It is very worrying that Sri Lanka has decided not to sign a joint letter issued by 105 countries, denouncing Israel's ban on entering the country.

The letter, especially in the ongoing Middle East crisis, reiterates the essential role of the United Nations in mediation and humanitarian assistance.. The refusal to join this joint call for justice and peace indicates a significant deviation from our concrete diplomatic traditions.
