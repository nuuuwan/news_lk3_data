What we have witnessed in Sri Lanka is a massive concentration of power and often politicians have resorted to serving themselves or their cronies because concentration of power in one person is a dangerous weapon

The judiciary holds its scales of justice evenly despite various attempts at stripping its powers. The legislature had made veiled threats aimed at the distinguished members of the Judiciary several times. Some learned Justices have been unceremoniously booted out from the office. The Standing Orders have not been properly adopted in compliance with the fundamental rights of the Constitution. A Constituent Assembly could look into all aspects of the Constitution and bring forth a new Constitution which will have the backing from the people of Sri Lanka. That can restore dignity to the people of Sri Lanka

“We want to build on that momentum,” Sabry told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.

“We feel that we want to continue to work with Indians in their investment area, people-to-people contact, tourism, and also connectivity like electricity as well as land and other connectivity areas of sea, air, and other modes of it.”

“I can confirm that external affairs minister of India Dr. Jaishankar is expected to be in Colombo in one of these days in this month.”
