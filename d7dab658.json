    "\u2018Sri Lanka Legume\u2019 tree (Crudia zeylanica) which blocked the construction of the Colombo - Kandy Expressway in the Daraluwa area of Veyangoda, was removed with Cabinet approval, Minister Bandula Gunawardane said today.",
    "He told the weekly Cabinet briefing that Cabinet approval was granted as the Cabinet of Ministers observed that it was a waste of money to protect a tree that is commonly available and said that the removal of the tree is a policy decision of the government.",
    "\u201cI called for a report and got to know that there are 15 \u2018Sri Lanka Legume\u2019 trees which are over 40 years old and 25 trees that are 12 and 15 feet in extent in the project area. We are planning to plant 200 \u2018Sri Lanka Legume\u2019 trees in the area in place of the removed tree,\u201d he said and added that Botanists assured him that any number of \u2018Sri Lanka Legume\u2019 trees can also be grown.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
