    "\u201cThe School Waste Management Programme is an important initiative in our journey towards creating a waste-free future. Educating school children on responsible waste management helps strengthen the segregation and collection of waste and inspire positive behavioural change. In this journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment of ensuring 95% of our plastic packaging is designed for recycling by 2025, taking continuous action to make our plastic packaging recyclable and reusable. We are delighted to have helped organize the Art Competition which not only served as a platform for showcasing the creative skills of emerging artists, but also helped reinforce the importance of taking action towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow. My heartfelt congratulations to all the participants and the winners!\u201d said Bernie Stefan, Managing Director, Nestl\u00e9 Lanka.",
