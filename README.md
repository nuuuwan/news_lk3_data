Hakamada’s case is one of Japan’s longest and most famous legal sagas, and has attracted widespread public interest, with some 500 people lining up for seats in the courtroom in Shizuoka on Thursday.

Based on the detailed historical context provided, I'll summarize the key points about the JVP's evolution and current stance:



1. The JVP began as a patriotic movement in 1987, opposing the Indo-Lanka Accord.



2. In the late 1980s, the JVP engaged in violent activities, leading to thousands of deaths and disappearances during the "88/89 Terrorist Period."



3. After 2001, the JVP shifted towards supporting mainstream politicians, initially backing Chandrika Kumaratunga and later Mahinda Rajapaksa.



4. In 2008, Wimal Weerawansa joined Mahinda Rajapaksa's government, causing internal conflicts within the JVP.



5. In 2011, the party split due to internal conflicts, resulting in the formation of the Frontline Socialist Party.



6. Anura Kumara Dissanayake became the JVP leader in 2014, replacing Somawansa Amarasinghe.



7. In the 2019 presidential election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake ran as an independent candidate under the slogan "Outbreak of Power."



8. The JVP continues to advocate for socialist concepts and nationalism, though their strategies have evolved over time.



9. Currently, the party is involved in protests against the government and supports left-wing ideologies.



10. The JVP maintains anti-imperialist stances and has criticized foreign interventions in Sri Lanka's politics.



This summary highlights the JVP's transformation from a radical armed group to a political party with shifting alliances and evolving ideologies over the years.
