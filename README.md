### BRICS Summit and India’s role

*2024-10-25 10:49:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/brics-summit-and-indias-role-184877/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Ruchita Beri, a senior fellow at the Vivekananda International Foundation, opines that rather than moving away from the SWIFT System and introducing a common currency, BRICS could build a coalition around the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), with India offering the technology to the global south.  It would, she says, be the answer to the contentious issue of a common currency for BRICS.

Participating in a web talk on “BRICS Summit on Kazan: India’s Agenda”, organised by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, South Asia, on October 18, Beri opined that while the anti-West bloc would like to see dedolarization, the focus is more on digital infrastructure and the use of local currencies for trade between BRICS members.

I still stand by my statement published on Janatha Mathaya in 2018. I see a dire need to educate the public on their role in eradicating corruption in politics and transforming the political culture in Sri Lanka just as much as the need to stand against corrupt politicians. The state must implement systems, processes and institutions to support this cause however, the public’s input in this equation is pivotal.

This becomes problematic because we are expecting ‘corrupt politicians’ to also implement systems and processes to prevent corruption.

### Sivaram: The government of President Anura Kumara, who has ordered a re -inquiry into the brutal kidnapping and murder

*2024-10-25 10:18:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197057) · `ta`

Thank you for providing such detailed information about Sivaram, also known as Taraki. This appears to be a comprehensive biography of his life, covering his early years, education, involvement in politics and militancy, transition to journalism, and eventual tragic fate. 



Some key points that stood out:



1. Sivaram was born in 1959 and grew up in a Tamil elite family in the east of Sri Lanka.



2. He initially joined the LTTE but was rejected, then joined PLOTE and received military training in India.



3. He became involved in politics and military strategy teaching within PLOTE.



4. In 1989, he transitioned to journalism, starting as a contributor to The Island magazine under the pseudonym Taraki.



5. His articles sparked controversy and interest due to his deep knowledge of North-Eastern conflicts.



6. He faced threats and intimidation as a journalist, particularly related to his coverage of the Theraputtapaya Balakaya incident.



7. Sivaram was assassinated in 2005 at the age of 46.



It's remarkable how his journey took him from being involved in armed struggle to becoming a prominent journalist covering those very conflicts. His work undoubtedly shed light on important issues affecting Sri Lanka during his time.



Is there anything specific about Sivaram's life or legacy you'd like me to expand upon?

🟩
