    "Premajayantha emphasized that the purpose of this is to strengthen the relationship between the parents and the class teachers.",
    "\u201cAt the beginning of the year, the class teacher calls the parents to the school to brief them about the program for the year, the discipline of the children and how to maintain it. We will revise the circular so that once the new school term begins on February 19, parents\u2019 meetings should be held in all government schools within the first two weeks. That\u2019s how a proper relationship between the parents and the school can be maintained.\u201d",
