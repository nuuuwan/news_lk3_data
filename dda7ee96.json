  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court has rejected a request made by a group of doctors to lift the overseas travel ban imposed on them on charges of being allegedly complicit in a kidney trafficking racket.",
    "Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawela has dismissed the relevant request, which was made through the attorneys representing the accused, after taking it into consideration, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "The overseas travel ban was imposed on them by the court based on a previous request made by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) seeking an order prohibiting six doctors involved in the incident from going overseas as the investigations have revealed that they are capable of flying out of the country.",
    "As per the submissions made by the CCD to the court, the doctors at the private hospital in question had performed nephrectomy on a group of low-income people who were brokered by a man and a woman residing in the Bloumendhal area. The surgically removed kidneys had subsequently been sold to affluent people from Sri Lanka and foreign countries at a rate ranging between Rs. 12 million and Rs. 15 million, the CCD said further."
