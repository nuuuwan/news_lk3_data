    "Claims Govt. and President are scheming to hold Presidential and Parliamentary polls on same day",
    "Notes there is no legal impediment to hold both polls between July 17 and September 4",
    "Stresses that holding both elections on same day will be unfavourable to country",
    "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila says the Government is attempting to hold both the Presidential and Parliamentary elections on the same day.",
    "Speaking at a press conference held at the party headquarters, Gammanpila asserted that the scheme is underway to fulfil the requirements of both the President and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. Nevertheless, he contended that holding both elections on the same day would not be in the best interest of the country.",
    "\u201cThe President is attempting to delay the parliamentary election until after the presidential election in order to prevent the weakening of the presidency\u2019s authority. On the other hand, Basil Rajapaksa is advocating for holding the parliamentary election before the public becomes aware of the presidential election results. This explains why Basil Rajapaksa is urging the President to expedite the parliamentary elections,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe have received information from credible sources indicating that the government is deliberating the possibility of conducting both the presidential and parliamentary elections on the same day to address the requirements of both parties involved,\u201d Gammanpila added.",
    "The PHU leader pointed out that although there is no legal impediment to holding both polls on a date between July 17 and September 4, doing so would nonetheless be disadvantageous for the country.",
    "He noted the likelihood that no single party would secure a parliamentary majority, which would impede the passage of legislation through parliament.",
    "\u201cHence, it is evident that during the initial two and a half years following the election, there will likely be a chaotic period characterised by inaction and power struggles. In the event of political instability amidst an economic crisis, the nation risks descending into a state of irreversible decline from which recovery may be impossible,\u201d Gammanpila said.",
    "\u201cTo get out of this economic crisis, regardless of who becomes the president, it is necessary to establish a stable parliament. This can only be done if the parliamentary election is held after the presidential election,\u201d he opined."
