    "To promote Sri Lanka as premier tourist destination for leisure and sporting events",
    "All proceeds from marathon will be used for ICA\u2019s CSR initiatives including organ donation awareness, supporting orphanages and tree planting",
    "The Indian Cultural Association (ICA) is excited to announce the launch of its first International Half-Marathon, set to officially kick off on 1 September, 2024, from Galle Face Green, Colombo. This highly anticipated event aims to position Sri Lanka as a prime destination for both leisure and sporting events, attracting attention from around the world, with the aim of registering over 1400 athletes from multiple countries. The marathon will allow the ICA to fund their CSR initiatives including self-pledging of organ donation, helping orphanages and planting Na Trees, in local schools, symbolising a green footprint from each of the race participants.",
    "ICA President Captain Anirban Banerjee expressed the association\u2019s commitment to making this event a success: \u201cOur goal with the ICA\u2019s 1st International Half-Marathon is to establish the country as a viable destination for sports tourism and outdoor recreation, while encouraging Sri Lankans to get more involved in physically challenging activities. We were delighted with the response we received from locals as well as foreign participants, most of whom are travelling to our sunny shores for the first time. The team is working tirelessly to ensure that all participants have a great marathon experience while enjoying true Sri Lankan hospitality.\u201d",
    "The marathon route, starting and ending at Galle Face Green, will take participants through some of Colombo\u2019s most picturesque locations, including Marine Drive and Galle Road, offering runners stunning views of the city and coastline. Race Categories include a Half Marathon (21.0975 km), Challengers Run (10 km) and a Family Run (5 km). The event is not just about competition; it\u2019s about promoting health, unity, community support, and sustainable tourism. As this would be an event of generation of funds we foresee a revenue accumulation of $. 5 million and more in the years to come which shall be used for various CSR activities.",
    "Continental Sri Lanka CEO Smita Pandit Chakraborty mentioned, \u201cICA has embarked on a unique program for a half marathon with a social cause for the first time in Sri Lanka. Continental has been part of Sri Lanka/Kalutara for several years. In line with our long tradition in Sri Lanka and our connection with the people and communities, our sponsorship came naturally. The marathon is corresponding with our core values at Continental #PassiontoWin and #ForOneAnother. We encourage all participants and members for the run and also for their engagement in the sustainability initiatives.\u201d",
    "ICA Vice President Jayadratha Das speaking of the prizes added, \u201cWe hope the prize money for the ICA International Half-Marathon will be a motivating factor for more participants to register, as the top three male and female finishers will be awarded substantial prize money and trophies. Our top finishers male and female will receive: 1st Place: Rs. 1,000,000; 2nd Place: Rs. 500,000; 3rd Place: Rs. 200,000 and many consolation prizes. All participants will receive a medal and certificate endorsed by supporting organisations.",
    "Captain Banerjee added, \u201cIn early 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector witnessed a significant influx of Indian tourists, with nearly 200,000 visitors from India. Sri Lanka Tourism has intensified efforts to target the Indian market, aiming to achieve 600,000 Indian tourist arrivals in 2024. The ICA\u2019s Half-Marathon is expected to contribute to these efforts by drawing international attention to Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse attractions and potential as a top-tier destination for sporting and healthcare events. We also aim to support the community by promoting organ donation and encouraging participants and the wider community to consider self-pledging for this vital cause. In addition to this, the event aims to leave a lasting positive green impact by planting Na Trees \u201c.",
    "Das added, \u201cAn event of this magnitude requires the support and commitment of a large number of partners from both the public and private sectors. We are grateful to all the organisations that have come forward to make this marathon a reality, and to the volunteers and police force who will ensure the event takes place smoothly and safely.\u201d",
