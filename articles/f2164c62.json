    "While working in Rome, I happened to have severe back problems. Hence in 1970, I was hospitalized in the Rehabilitation Ward of Guy\u2019s Hospital, London, for two months. Since this Ward catered solely to back problems, it was filled mostly with working-class patients, who had hurt their backs by falling off ladders, lifting heavy weights, etc.",
    "In my first days, being confined to bed, I found that a tubby black nurse was going round to other patients and taking money from them. At first, I suspected some nefarious activity; but I found later that they were betting on horses, with the nurse taking their bets to the bookie outside! The nurse was amused that I knew nothing about horses, not knowing their backs from their front, the odds, etc.",
    "Since I was living in Italy at that time, I chose a horse with a fancy Italian name, despite the nurse\u2019s protests that it was a rank outsider, with no chance at all. My horse won at 36 to 1! My fellow patients were very impressed, thinking that this dark horse (dark fellow) knows everything about horses. So they all came to me for tips on the next day\u2019s races \u2013 despite my protests that I knew nothing about horses. This left me desperately searching the racing sheets for horses with Italian names \u2013 which was my only claim to fame as a punter! I won on the next day; but when I lost for three days in a row, my \u2018followers\u2019 cursed and abandoned me as a fraud \u2013 which I already knew I was!",
    "Not the tubby nurse, however! We became friends: she would tell me what horses to bet on \u2013 and I won, and won. Then we started losing. She came to me and said: \u2018Mr. Arul, you are bringing me bad luck. I won\u2019t even tell you the name of the horse: just give me the money and I will bet for you\u2019. So I would give her money, and she would bring me more and more \u2013 to the envy of my fellow patients. After a time, I realized that I was not getting any fun out of this. I was fast becoming a \u2018kept man\u2019 \u2013 kept by the fat jolly nurse, who kept giving me more and more money! So I just gave up my \u2018betting\u2019.",
    "By this time, I could stand and walk a bit. So I joined one of my fellow patients as a \u2018tea boy\u2019, taking morning-tea to my bed-ridden \u2018mates\u2019 (pronounced \u2018mites\u2019 by my new cockney friends). My companion \u2018tea boy\u2019 became my friend. He was a cockney named \u2018Tim\u2019, a \u2018malingerer\u2019 like me, who remained in the hospital for a long time. Due to my longer stay, I became the resident pundit on all matters, since among the less educated the more educated man is king! Meanwhile, I was becoming very popular as a \u2018tea boy\u2019, while my little knowledge came to be highly regarded. So I was \u2018promoted\u2019 to the head of the table at mealtime.",
    "Since I was not under the British National Health Scheme, I had been given a \u2018room\u2019, because my insurance was paying for it. This happened to be a glass cubicle, appropriately screened off. This had been the nursing-sister\u2019s room, from which she would keep a controlling eye on her nurses. The nursing-sister would consult me on how best she should run the Ward, while the nurses would duck into my room to flop into my chair \u2013 to rest their aching feet. They would then regale me with their stories, ranging from the politics of the Ward to gossip about the other nurses. After one month, I was well versed in the politics and gossip of the Ward.",
    "One day, a nurse asked me whether I could read her palm. Jokingly, I answered, \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2013 to my later regret. I had learned from the gossip that this particular nurse had had a serious scare the previous day. When coming to work by tube while still dark, she found herself alone in a carriage with a big man, who was aggressively exposing himself. Fearing sexual assault, she had run out of the carriage at the next station.",
    "Briefed by this gossip, I hinted darkly that she should be careful about a sexual assault one of these days. The nurse was impressed by the \u2018accuracy\u2019 of my readings \u2013 and my fame as a palmist spread among all the nurses! As for me, I was impaled on my original sin: I could not now refuse other nurses who came to my door. And boy, did they come!",
    "The turning point came, however, when the nursing-sister told me that her prettiest, youngest and brightest nurse was resigning, because she had just found out that she was pregnant. The next day, that same shy, pretty young nurse came blushingly to me to have her palm read. I could not escape now. I had heard earlier from gossip that her husband was a big and jealous man, with a red beard. So I told her that there was a big, jealous man with red hair in her life. Further, looking intently but fraudulently at her palm, I \u2018predicted\u2019 that in about eight months\u2019 time, she would have a joyful event in her life.",
    "She ran off happily to tell the others about my amazingly \u2018accurate\u2019 predictions! I, on the other hand, was left to contemplate my own chicanery! Since I could not admit to lying all this time, I abruptly declared that I would not read palms anymore \u2013 much to the disappointment of those who had missed my wonderful readings!",
    "We had a flutter in our well-ordered cage when a snooty middle class/lower middle-class patient was admitted to our Ward. He talked rudely to the coloured nurses and talked condescendingly down to our working-class patients. He was annoying: delivering unasked, his lofty opinions on every subject. After a couple of days, he challenged everyone to a game of chess, knowing full well that my working-class mates could not play chess. I had to take up the challenge on their behalf.",
    "I was not a great chess player, but I was able to beat him \u2013 much to the joy of my \u2018mates\u2019. His greatest indignity, however, was yet to come. He had been given strong injections and was confined to bed. When two nurses tried to carry him to another bed, he swore at them because they were coloured. One was the tubby black nurse, who without compunction, ceremoniously dumped him on the floor, leaving him wailing loudly and flailing helplessly, begging to be carried again.",
    "I had entered Guy\u2019s Hospital on the promise of the Consultant (Specialist) that he would cure my back pains within two weeks. When he dragged on my \u2018cure\u2019 for two months, I realized that he could not cure me at all. Hence, I insisted on being discharged, against doctors\u2019 advice.",
    "Due to my long stay, I had become the administrative adviser of the nursing-sister-in-charge, the confidante of the nurses, and the friend and leader of my fellow patients. So when the time came to leave, my cockney friend Tim (my fellow \u2018tea boy\u2019) came to me with tears in his eyes, saying \u201cGoodbye Harold, we will really miss you\u201d. I was amazed that they had been calling me \u2018Harold\u201d all this time, without my realizing it, by mispronouncing my name \u2018Arul\u2019. My niece, to whom I had told this story, still calls me \u2018Uncle Harold\u2019 \u2013 even after 50 years!",
