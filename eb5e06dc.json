    "Operating under cover of legal breeding facilities, illegal pet farms take advantage of regulatory gaps to profit from the exploitation of animals, taking no responsibility for the welfare or living conditions of these helpless creatures. These dishonest businesses are causing genetic anomalies, an increase in diseases, and a decline in animal welfare. Although laws are in place to protect animals in Sri Lanka, they do not adequately address the subtleties of the contemporary pet trade",
    "\u201cThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated\u201d Mahatma Gandhi",
    "I come from a family of pet lovers. From my very young days, I remember our home, full of pets and always as an extension of the family. It has therefore been second nature for us to appreciate them and\u00a0 care for them.",
    "Sri Lanka being a predominantly Buddhist country is known to show care for animals, and many families have pets. However, with the increase in wealth and \u201csocial status\u201d of people, and with the surging influence of social media, the country has seen a trend towards owning expensive pedigreed pets. Thus began a demand for pedigreed pets in the country, especially, dogs. A surge in demand invariably calls for an increase in supply, and how that demand- supply gap has been met is what my article is about.",
    "For those who own, or know people who own pedigreed dogs, have you ever pondered about their history, how they were treated before coming into your care, or even how they were born? Have you ever considered their biological parents? These are the questions that led me to research this topic, and through this article I will shed some light to these questions. I hope, whether you own a pet or not, whether you intend to or not, I succeed in giving an insight into the realities behind the life of most pedigreed dogs available for sale in the country. I also hope this article influences you to make the right choice about your pet\u2019s origin.",
    "Many people, including myself, adore dogs and in Sri-Lanka there are four ways to acquire one. You could rescue a street dog, adopt a rescue from one of the many organisations working tirelessly to save and help street dogs, buy a pedigreed dog from a family that has a home-bred litter, or buy a puppy from a dealer with a \u201cpet shop\u2019 or an advertisement online.",
    "The first three options are perfect and should be encouraged. It is the last however, that has a plethora of problems that should make one reconsider and hopefully abstain from using this route to own a pet.",
    "As I said earlier, Sri Lankans especially, in and around major cities and townships, have shown an inclination towards owning pedigreed dogs. It has become a status symbol for many. Unfortunately, the supply of such puppies from loving homes is limited, which has created a huge potential for puppy breeders to step in, to meet this unfulfilled demand. Therein lies the problem. This mismatch in demand and supply is being met through puppy mills and pet farms that today produce the majority of the country's \u201cpurebred\u201d canines. These facilities are operated by unlicensed puppy farmers whose operational practices are at best shady and questionable.",
    "In my quest to understand the puppy mill business in Sri Lanka, I tried to visit and see for myself how these facilities operate. Maybe the reality was actually better than the bad reputation they were known for? Unfortunately, various attempts I made to gain access to these farms even under the guise of being an interested purchaser proved futile. None were ready to talk or permit a visit to their facilities. Answers to my questions were evasive and hostile, at best. If anything, the reluctance of these pet farmers to answer my questions and maybe even take the opportunity to address the negative reputation they have created for themselves, screamed to me - \u201cguilty as charged\u201d. Eventually, I could only manage to visit dealers of these farms running little pet shops to sell off products from the farms. Some were permanent structures, but small shops with appalling conditions for the animals, others, mobile shops operating by the roadside. All these proved heart wrenching for a true animal lover. Little puppies and kittens were housed in tiny cages in the stifling heat, in most cases seemingly sedated to keep them calm till a gullible shopper came and bought them as a pet. Even during these visits, after first treating me with enthusiasm as a prospective customer, the reception quickly turned hostile and evasive as soon as I started questioning the origins of the animals on sale.",
    "Therefore, to get a better understanding of this trade, I spoke to numerous individuals involved in animal rescue. Not surprisingly, none had anything good to say about these puppy farms. Sadly, not a single farm was mentioned as a place you could trust to have adhered to high standards in their operations.",
    "Through these conversations, I learnt that the problems of the puppy farms were numerous and indicate below some reasons not to purchase animals born from these unlicensed farms:",
    "1) The physical conditions of the farms were poor: Bad hygiene, wanting in cleanliness, and overcrowded in cramped spaces",
    "2) Forced sterilisation done in inhumane ways, which no genuine animal lover would want to be part of",
    "3) Lack of proper medical/veterinary support and poor nutrition, that leads to different health problems for the adult dogs as well as the offspring",
    "4) In-breeding of dogs leads to genetic and health issues in the offspring and could cause a new line of dogs that are genetically mutated",
    "6) Terrible conditions at the point of sale, that I witnessed",
    "7) Inhumane killing of unsold pups, and\u00a0 disposition or abandonment of dogs as they aged and were of no monetary benefit to the farmers",
    "8) Dogs are social animals. Puppies are separated from their mothers at too early an age leading to depressed animals that cause excessive aggression, fear, and anxiety. Further, a lack of kindness and love from those in charge who only view the animals as a source of income is a disturbing sight to any animal lover",
    "9) Purchasing an inbred or forcefully bred dog could be dangerous around human beings because of its raised anxiety and distrust towards humans. For the workers too it is unsafe to work in such places due to animal aggressiveness and un-hygienic conditions",
    "10) It was also cited that some of these farms were involved in dog thefts of pedigreed dogs from homes to add to their farms.",
    "The nation is sadly dealing with increasing uncontrolled breeding operations that put the welfare of the animals in danger, despite the laws that are currently in place. As we delve into this matter, it becomes clear that comprehensive legal reforms and stricter enforcement are necessary to stop this growing trend.",
    "Operating under cover of legal breeding facilities, illegal pet farms take advantage of regulatory gaps to profit from the exploitation of animals, taking no responsibility for the welfare or living conditions of these helpless creatures. These dishonest businesses are causing genetic anomalies, an increase in diseases, and a decline in animal welfare. Although laws are in place to protect animals in Sri Lanka, they do not adequately address the subtleties of the contemporary pet trade. The main piece of legislation controlling animal welfare, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907, unfortunately does not contain any specific measures to address the problems caused by illicit pet farms.",
    "Thus, new laws that target these operations specifically are desperately needed; and they must provide precise guidelines for licensing, inspection, and severe penalties for violators. Legislation is important, but it is equally important to have effective enforcement. The inability of relevant authorities to coordinate, acquire adequate resources, or hire trained personnel is impeding their efforts to crack down on illegal pet farms. It is critical to fortify law enforcement and promote cooperation between animal welfare groups and the police. An early response is necessary considering the rise in illicit pet farms in Sri Lanka. The country can make great progress in eliminating this evil industry by strengthening the legal system, improving enforcement practices, and raising public awareness.",
    "It saddens me to state that there are significant disparities between Sri Lanka and other countries. For instance, my recent trip to Scandinavia greatly aided my research on the subject, and the findings I made there were significantly different from those I made here. The international pet trade is a heterogeneous field with widely disparate practices across nations. There are numerous obvious distinctions that need to be made clear, including variations in laws, requirements for animal welfare, and the general philosophy of ethical breeding. Despite having laws in place, Sri Lanka's regulatory framework finds it difficult to adequately handle the complexity of the contemporary pet trade. Due to its inception in 1907, the current Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance has gaps in its enforcement and is not perfect.",
    "Sweden and Norway, where I had the pleasure of visiting husky farms, have a strong legal system and stringent laws pertaining to animal welfare. Clear guidelines for responsible practices are established by the Animal Welfare Act in conjunction with breeder-specific regulations. This extensive legal framework supports a more humane and well-regulated pet business. Though these farms were not primarily for the breeding of puppies, nevertheless they were organisations running for profit purposes. Yet, the farms were an absolute pleasure to visit, especially for an animal lover. The animals were happy, in well-kept enclosures, with exercise and feeding routines and their happiness was instantly obvious. The carers had a visible bond with each of the animals. Conversations with these carers revealed that strict legislation was in place to ensure that these places were run in ways not detrimental to the animals; even in the exercise routines of the animals during each season, the space had to be made available to each. Pet farms in Sweden follow strict guidelines for the welfare of animals. The wellbeing of animals is ensured by placing strong emphasis on ethical breeding methods, suitable housing, and veterinary treatment. The general well-being and disposition of the pets in Sweden are indicative of the stringent adherence to these standards. Each dog is provided with an outdoor space measuring approximately 10 meters in length and width. In addition, each dog receives several hours of outdoor time and a total of two to three daily meals. Comparing this to Sri Lanka, where most dogs are kept in small cages and some struggle to even stand up, it is clear that dogs here are not treated with the same level of care. Only about two meals a day are provided to dogs raised for breeding in Sri Lanka, and the poor quality and lack of nutrients in the meals adversely affect the health and welfare of the dogs. We shouldn't give up hope because the circumstances we are in may be depressing; always there are things we can do to support and protect the welfare of animals in similar circumstances. One approach could be to enhance law enforcement's efforts to locate and shut down illicit pet farms. In addition, we could impose harsher penalties on those who engage in illegal pet farming as a deterrent. A far simpler answer would be to start public awareness campaigns, inform people about the dangers of funding illicit pet farms, stress the value of adopting animals from reliable sources, and advocate for the humane treatment of animals. If you specifically want to address the issue while remaining realistic, you can work with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and animal welfare groups. This would enhance your resources and expertise in addressing the problem. It makes sense to support programs aimed at saving and rehabilitating animals from unlicensed pet farms. We could, with time and assistance, establish and enforce laws regulating the breeding and sale of pets as well as license programs for pet breeders, guaranteeing that they adhere to ethical and care standards. Setting up mechanisms for tracking and reporting illicit pet farming activity would be a crucial component. We must inspire the public to report questionable activities and shield those who come forward with information, while promoting legal pet trade. Fostering and endorsing lawful and moral pet trade procedures would aid in advancing conscientious breeding and sales. Collaborations between governing bodies and companies that sell legal pets should be encouraged to adhere to rules. It is important to raise public awareness of the issue. One way is through international cooperation that entails exchanging best practices and information about the fight against illegal pet farming with neighbouring nations and international organisations. Furthering our understanding of the problem could also involve addressing cross-border issues linked to the illegal pet trade.",
    "In conclusion, I can only hope that we in Sri-Lanka too formulate, and more importantly, implement such laws for the wellbeing of animals. Such legislation, though initially deemed unfriendly by current per farm owners would in the long run work towards building a strong and ethical business that people could patronise without any qualms.",
    "It is time for Sri Lanka to reaffirm its dedication to animal welfare and make sure that no animal is harmed by the exploitation of dishonest people. Let us remember that animals are unable to speak for themselves, and it is up to us to advocate for them. By putting the afore-mentioned tactics into practice and customising them to Sri Lanka's unique situation, it should be possible to lessen and eventually eradicate the issue of illicit pet farms. To fully address this issue, it is imperative that government agencies, law enforcement, communities, and organisations work together in a cooperative manner.",
    "Meanwhile, if you are looking for a pet, adopt one, don\u2019t buy. Keep in mind that mixed breed dogs or our street mongrels are much more versatile in terms of good health and cost of upkeep. If pure- bred is still what you fancy, find pet lovers looking to find homes for litters from their much-loved family pets. Always insist on certificates of pedigreed dogs and get these verified through appropriate authorities.",
    "Finally, I would like to thank everyone who reads this article, it shows you care, and is the first step towards solving any problem.",
    "One approach could be to enhance law enforcement\u2019s efforts to locate and shut down illicit pet farms. In addition, we could impose harsher penalties on those who engage in illegal pet farming as a deterrent. A far simpler answer would be to start public awareness campaigns, inform people about the dangers of funding illicit pet farms, stress the value of adopting animals from reliable sources, and advocate for the humane treatment of animals",
