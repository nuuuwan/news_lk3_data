Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday to retaliate against attacks by Israel and its ally the United States targeting Tehran and groups it supports in the region.

“The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran.

He was referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed armed groups that include Yemen’s Huthi rebels, Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.

Regional tensions have soared since the outbreak in October last year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, drawing in those Iran-aligned groups and others from Iraq and Syria.

Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23.

Dr. Perera:Before I deal with the subject, I want to say a word about the Hon. Prime Minister and his references to my good friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Bandaranaike). My friend the Prime Minister is not here. I hope that he has not had a recurrence of his affliction. Today while he was on the first part of his speech, he reminded me of the father; it was the same technique, the same type of personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I remember the last motion of No Confidence that we debated. I think it was moved just before the dissolution of Parliament, and it was one of the last debates which was attended by my good friend, the late Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake. He spoke in that debate and it was a tirade against my good friend the Leader of the Opposition.

After completing my Ford fellowship at Oxford University in 1991, I joined the Indus River Left Bank Outfall Drainage Project in Sindh, Pakistan, as its Senior Socio-Economist and resident team leader. The project, sponsored by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and several other international donors, aimed at improving irrigated agriculture in Sindh. The Sindh Development Studies Centre (SDSC) of the University of Sindh in Jamshoro (near Hyderabad) oversaw the socio-economic studies of the project.

I arrived at Karachi Airport in late December. Parvez Pathan, my SDSC counterpart, met me at the airport. We discussed my accommodation and security on our drive to Jamshoro, about 220 kilometres from Karachi. He told me a beautifully furnished bungalow awaited me on the university campus. He opined that I should always have a trustworthy person with me for my security. SDSC had found a reliable young man to be my housekeeper, cook, and personal security guard.

Democracy under threat, as Trump sows doubt on election integrity

President Ronald Reagan, “The Great Communicator” was famous for conceptualizing the American Dream, in a loose paraphrasing of the words enshrined in the Statue of Liberty.

Concluding his farewell speech in 1988, Reagan said, “I’ve spoken of the Shining City all my political life….But in my mind, it was a tall, proud city built on rocks, stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and heart to get here. That’s how I saw it, and see it still.

### Sagalassos: Meanwhile in the Mountains

*2024-11-03 01:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sagalassos-meanwhile-in-the-mountains/) · `en`

At the birthday party held in August to celebrate the 100th birthday of Raja de Silva, school friend of my uncle Tissa and former Director General of Archaeology, I was fortunate to meet his daughter Nerina, also an archaeologist. She has been working for some years on a dig in Turkey and, when I expressed interest in that site, she lent me a book produced to accompany an exhibition of artefacts found there.

I did not read all the articles in it, for they were quite technical, including Nerina’s about the adhesives used to piece together broken material, ranging from pottery to statues. But they were fascinating, even though I could only read them cursorily. And they were illuminatingly supported by pictures, the articles being full of them, while the latter part of the book is pictures with detailed accounts of what they portray.

My initial contribution on the above subject was on 8 February 2024 at the time President Joe Biden was expected to be the Democratic Party nominee for the presidency against former President Donald Trump the Republican Party nominee.

A sequel to this subject has become necessary after Biden was compelled/pressurized to drop out of the race on 21 July 2024 after his disastrous performance at the debate with Trump on 27 June 2024 which led to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the succeeding candidate under questionable circumstances. It is misleading to state it was a voluntary decision by Biden.

It is clear from what follows below that it is a SHAM for the Democratic Party now led by Kamala Harris to pretend that the Party is the standard-bearer of DEMOCRACY in the United States. Its leadership which is part of this charade include holier-than-thou persons such as  Obama, Clintons, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer:

Here's a 200-character summary:



Douglas Devananda emphasizes practical action over dreaming. He advocates for Tamil autonomy and federalism, promising to address people's issues if elected. His party aims for 4-5 seats, focusing on welfare and representation rather than armed struggle or fake nationalism.

🟩

The EPDP Secretary General, Douglas Devananda, pointed out that this time will decide the people who are working for the people who are continuously living with the people.

Douglas Devananda, Secretary -General of the EPDP, who visited various parts of Vadamarachchi area on Saturday (02) for election campaigns, said this during a discussion with the people.

I am acting from the welfare of the people. But on that day, our Tamil political ancestors demanded that Samasti be Samadhi and decorated the parliament by gaining electoral victories.

But they do not have the mechanism of achieving the goal of the subject they have put forward. Similarly, the policies of the people in today's political territory that they are on the way of fake nationalism are unstoppable.

I do not ask for 23 seats to decorate parliament like other Tamil political parties. I request you to give me at least 4 to 5 seats
