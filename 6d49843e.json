    "The Ajahn Brahm Society of Sri Lanka is pleased to announce the visit of Ajahn Brahmali to Sri Lanka in March 2024. He will be here from 14 to 24 March and will be fully engaged in conducting meditation retreats, giving Dhamma talks and meeting and conversing with relevant groups.",
    "Similar to the visit of Ajahn Brahmavamso, who was in the country for ten days in late May 2023, the Ajahn Brahm Society is finalising a full program for Ajahn Brahmali, overseen by Ven Mettavihari Thera, with beneficiaries being, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike.",
    "This is Ajahn Brahmali\u2019s fifth visit to the country, the first having been in 2013. Every available minute of his time in Sri Lanka in March next year would be utilised to help us better understand the Dhamma and guide us in proceeding on the Path to end the cycle of samsaric existence. Advice on the practice of meditation will be included in his crowded schedule for bhikkhus, bhikkhunis and lay people",
    "Ajahn Brahmali was born in Norway in 1964. In his early 20s he visited Japan and was introduced to Buddhism and meditation. He was deeply interested and devoted much time to learning more of what the Buddha taught, in quiet reflection and meditation. This was while reading for degrees in Engineering and Finance. On completion of his academic studies, he moved to Britain and resided in the Amaravati and Chithurst Monasteries as an Anagarika (keeper of eight precepts). Meeting Ajahn Brahmavamso and listening to his teaching, he decided to travel to Australia and train in the Bodhinyana Monastery in Serpentine, near Perth, in Western Australia, in 1994. Two years later he was ordained; his preceptor being Ajahn Brahm. In 2015, on completion of twenty rains retreats, he was conferred the title \u2018Maha Thera\u2019 - Great Elder.",
    "Ajahn Brahmali\u2019s reputation as an expert in the Pali language and deep knowledge of the Suttas is internationally recognised. He has authored many essays including two on Dependent Origination and the treatise The Authenticity of Ancient Buddhist Texts, in collaboration with Bhante Sujato. He conducts Pali language classes and explanatory discourses on the Suttas to devotees of Bodhinyana Monastery. He is also a regular teacher at the Dhammaloka Centre in Perth. Added to his intellectual excellence is his practicality. Ajahn Brahmali oversees the building and maintenance projects at both the Bodhinyana Monastery and the Hermit Hill property in Serpentine.",
    "\u00abThus, propitiously and fortunately for us Sri Lankans, Ven Ajahn Brahmali will be here in our land in March 2024; generously willing to guide us to deeper understanding of the Dhamma and enhanced meditation,\u00bb a spokesperson for the organisers said."
