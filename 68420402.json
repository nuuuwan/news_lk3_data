    "This purpose-built savings account, designed to empower Sri Lankan migrant workers and their families, caters to the unique financial needs of those seeking employment overseas, those already working abroad, permanent resident migrants, and their families residing in Sri Lanka.",
    "The standout feature of the NDB Remit Saver is its highly competitive interest rate. Offering an additional 1% interest over the general savings rate for balances surpassing LKR 1,000 (currently standing at an attractive 3.50%), this account provides a lucrative avenue for account holders to witness substantial growth in their savings. Taking a holistic approach to financial well-being, the account includes an exclusive insurance scheme. This covers the family members, spouse and children below 18 of the migrant worker who initiates the Remit Saver savings account. In cases where the account holder is unmarried, parents are also included, ensuring comprehensive protection for the entire family.",

    "With the launch of the NDB Remit Saver, the Bank takes a significant stride in championing the financial well-being of Sri Lankan migrant workers and their families. Additionally, with foreign currency remittances playing a pivotal role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic fabric, the account seeks to enhance the nation\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. By encouraging regular remittances and responsible financial practices, the account not only empowers individuals but also contributes to the overall economic resilience of Sri Lanka.",
