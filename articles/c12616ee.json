    "In a transformative move for rural healthcare, a digital health information system initiated in 2018 is now being rolled out in select clusters, promising to bridge the critical gap between remote villages and urban medical expertise.",
    "Crucially supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), this initiative ensures that no patient is left behind due to geographic location or economic status.",
    "The integrated system creates a unified digital patient record, accessible to authorised clinicians across a connected network of facilities. It seamlessly captures medical histories, manages lab test orders, and automatically stores results. A key innovation is the radiology module, which allows tests performed in large hospitals to be instantly viewed by staff at any smaller hospital the patient visits later, providing a continuous and complete health narrative.",
    "This seamless information flow means a patient in a remote village can receive a diagnosis and treatment plan formulated by top consultants without the need for arduous travel. Doctors at smaller clinics will thus be able to electronically \u2018seek a second opinion,\u2019 ensuring specialised care is delivered in far-flung villages",
    "The benefits are twofold: the system drastically improves healthcare access for underprivileged communities while reducing crippling overcrowding in national hospitals. This leads to a smarter and more equitable utilisation of the country\u2019s entire healthcare infrastructure.",
    "Currently in an active pilot phase in Thambuttegama, the system will next launch in Dambulla, followed by Welimada and Karawanella. The Ministry of Health\u2019s ambitious plan is to eventually connect 15 such clusters, creating one unified network that serves millions of patients, regardless of where they first registered.",
    "Consultants at the Thambuttegama Base Hospital and the digital experts driving this initiative expressed their profound gratitude to the ADB for its pivotal partnership. They acknowledged the Bank\u2019s critical support in this ambitious and \u2018tedious task\u2019- a venture where multilateral banks might typically hesitate to step up \u2013 for boldly supporting the vision of equitable healthcare for all and turning it into a tangible reality.",
    "Despite its transformative potential, the programme\u2019s path to nationwide impact has faced challenges. Initially envisioned for a comprehensive rollout across all nine districts within the project area, the pilot encountered significant funding constraints. This necessitated a strategic shift to a more measured, cluster-based approach rather than the originally planned broad implementation.",
    "Despite a deviation from the initial ambition, the current scaled-down strategy allows for careful system refinement and builds a robust evidence base to guide future expansion. The Ministry of Health and the ADB continue to diligently monitor progress, viewing these initial clusters as a critical proof-of-concept. This phased approach will inform and de-risk the scaling of the model across the country as additional resources are secured, ensuring it becomes a sustainable cornerstone of broader health system reforms.",
    "Asian Development Bank\u2019s Country Director for Sri Lanka, Takafumi Kadono, engages with members of the media during a site visit to the Thambuttegama Base Hospital on September 10. Kadono was at the hospital to review ADB-supported initiatives and addressed questions regarding the Bank\u2019s ongoing development partnership in Sri Lanka.",
    "Health Ministry officials confirmed they plan to accelerate the programme, aligned with the government\u2019s keen interest in implementing holistic health reforms.",
