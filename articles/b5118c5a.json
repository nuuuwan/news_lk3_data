  "original_body_lines": [
    "In response to recent media reports regarding a purported reduction in the price of imported milk powder starting 25 April, the Milk Powder Importers Association has issued a clarification, stating that such information is inaccurate.",
    "Contrary to the reported claims, all milk powder brands had already reduced their prices effective 1 April, in accordance with a request from the Trade Ministry. The move was aimed at providing relief to consumers during the Avurudu season, with the maximum retail price set at Rs. 1,050 for a 400g pack.",
    "The Milk Powder Importers Association emphasises that there have been no additional reductions in prices as of 25 April, contrary to the misinformation circulating in the media.\u00a0 It has been confirmed that several milk powder brands are being sold at prices lower than the stipulated maximum retail price (MRP), with various promotional offers further driving down costs for consumers.",
    "Consumers are assured that milk powder remains available in the market at competitive prices, with a wide range of promotional offers and discounts still in effect since 1 April."
