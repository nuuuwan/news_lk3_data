### Israel and Hezbollah trade heavy fire before pulling back, jolting a region braced for war

*2024-08-25 17:08:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101491/israel-and-hezbollah-trade-heavy-fire-before-pulling-back-jolting-a-region-braced-for-war) · `en`

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across southern Lebanon early Sunday in what it said was a preemptive strike on Hezbollah. The militant group responded that it had launched hundreds of rockets and drones to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders last month.

The heavy exchange of fire does not appear to have ignited a long-feared war, but the situation remains tense. Meanwhile, Egypt on Sunday is hosting high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which diplomats hope will tamp down regional tensions.

The Israeli military said it struck because Hezbollah was planning to launch a heavy barrage of rockets and missiles toward Israel. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had launched an attack on Israeli military positions as an initial response to the killing of Fouad Shukur, one of its founding members, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last month.

The company provided 120 students from the Vidyartha Maha Vidyalaya in Nakkala with school bags, shoes, and exercise books, continuing its support for key stakeholder groups.

CEAT Kelani Holdings, which produces half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyres, sources all its natural rubber from local producers who support around 10,000 cultivating families. Earlier this year, the company also distributed school supplies to students at schools in Matugama, Kuruwita, and Elpitiya.

### Men of note from the minorities

*2024-08-25 01:36:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/men-of-note-from-the-minorities/) · `en`

I was born at the very end of the nineteenth century and in my eightieth year I can look back on the careers of some of the prominent minority leaders about whom I shall say something in this article.

The names that come to mind include the brothers Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Ponnambalam Arunachalam and their kinsmen, Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy and Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy. They came from the same highly educated and successful families of Jaffna.

Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had held the office of Solicitor-General under British rule and often acted as Attorney-General, a post reserved for officers recruited from abroad. He was a polished speaker, though in his old age he was inclined to be somewhat long-winded.

### Meetings with Gandhi and Nehru;Message from Ramgarh to Ceylon

*2024-08-25 01:33:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/meetings-with-gandhi-and-nehrumessage-from-ramgarh-to-ceylon/) · `en`

The Ramgarh Session of the Indian National Congress, the last Session before Freedom was held in March 1940, in a small village, in Bihar Province, “sanctified by the touch of the feet of Gautama, the Buddha”, said the Reception Committee Chairman, Rajendra Prasad, later President of Free India. I attended the Session as a delegate of the Ceylon National Congress and recorded my impressions then.

The little village of Ramgarh is today famous throughout the world. For here gathered the men and women of the new India with her beauty and her chivalry, intent on freeing their motherland from foreign rule. It was a pretty countryside that we passed through on our way, for over a hundred miles to the west of Calcutta. Ramgarh itself is very similar to Diyatalawa, undulating valleys, large plains and mountain streams abounding.

### The Ambani’s and India: A Fairytale Wedding as a Diplomatic Stage

*2024-08-25 01:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-ambanis-and-india-a-fairytale-wedding-as-a-diplomatic-stage/) · `en`

Indian weddings are renown for their grandeur and extravagance, extending far beyond the union of two individuals. They are elaborate affairs that engage entire families and communities, often becoming the talk of the town. From the meticulous selection of auspicious dates to the inevitable family dynamics, these celebrations are a whirlwind of emotions and preparations.

The Ambani wedding was an exceptional example of this tradition, elevated to unprecedented heights. Spanning an astonishing seven months, it was a fairy tale-like spectacle characterized by opulence and grandeur. At its heart, however, was the solemn exchange of vows to be with each other for “Saat Janam” between Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, a testament to their enduring love.

### Elections in Sri Lanka: A Preliminary Audit

*2024-08-25 01:17:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/elections-in-sri-lanka-a-preliminary-audit/) · `en`

Sri Lankans will be voting in September, and they will be voting for the first time since 2020 or 2019 if you consider presidential elections. The economy, more specifically economic recovery, will figure as a top concern. People will be voting for candidates based on their perceptions of how well this government has done and how well they think the Opposition will do if they are given the chance. As of now, economic reforms have polarised opinion. One poll indicates that less than 10 percent – eight, to be exact – believe Sri Lanka is headed the right way. That leaves a staggering 92 percent who disagree or are unsure.

### 2024 Presidential Election Divides Muslim  Political Parties  with Leaders Backing Sajith and Some MPs Supporting Ranil.

*2024-08-25 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84580) · `en`

Nominations have closed for the long awaited 2024 presidential election. 39 candidates are in the fray.It is widely acknowledged  by the press and public that the chief presidential  contenders  are  incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe,leader of the opposition  Sajith Premadasa and JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara  Dissanayake. Two others expected to make a mark are Namal Rajapaksa and Dilith  Jayaweera.

However the icing on the winning candidate’s cake would be the minority vote. In a keenly contested poll that is likely to trifurcate the Sinhala vote in near equal proportion, the minority community vote could very well provide the necessary numbers to clinch victory. In such a situation the voting pattern of the premier  numerical minorities  assumes crucial importance.

### Supreme Court ruling that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s defiant action in postponing Local Government polls in 2023  had violated the fundamental right to equality and the right to vote of citizens,should come as no surprise

*2024-08-25 00:54:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84595) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court ruling this week that President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s defiant action in postponing Local Government polls in 2023, citing a purported lack of funds in the wake of the country’s bankruptcy, had violated the fundamental right to equality and the right to vote of citizens, raises several interesting issues.

In fact, this decision should come as no surprise.  There was little choice but to hold as the Bench did, relying on several precedents which have firmly established the predominant principle that, exercising the right of franchise is an inviolable right of citizens, it is a collective as well as an individual right. The Court found the President (also as Minister of Finance) responsible along with the luckless Elections Commission.

### Virgins and Bullies in Rural Sri Lanka

*2024-08-25 00:52:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/virgins-and-bullies-in-rural-sri-lanka/) · `en`

In 1974, I wandered in the Veyangoda area with Georg (adviser) and Piyasiri (research assistant) to find a suitable village to study what socioeconomic and political factors influenced people to get together for public benefit. On the third day, at a tea kiosk, we met Guneratne (Gune), a farmer, who invited us to his house at Naiwela.

Gune lived in an old house with a tiled roof and a cemented floor. I told him we were looking for a village to study the cooperative behaviour of people and a place to stay for a few months. He proposed we study Naiwela and stay at his house. He worried about Georg, saying, “Suddas (white people) can’t live in a village because they need creature comforts.”

### What the majority want from a new government

*2024-08-25 00:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/what-the-majority-want-from-a-new-government/) · `en`

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.
