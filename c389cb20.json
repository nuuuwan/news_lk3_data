  "original_body_lines": [
    "Persistent heatwaves have brought the temperatures of parts of Europe to over 45 degrees Celcius, causing wildfires and much inconvenience to the local and tourist population.",
    "The reason for the sudden rise in temperature is due to a 'heat dome' that has expanded over the southern half of the European continent, affecting areas such as Greece, eastern Spain, and southern Italy. This weather pattern allows a warm air mass to build up under a high-pressure system, creating dry conditions with high temperatures.",
    "Due to the heatwave, a fire erupted on the northern part of the Greek Island, Corfu, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius across the country.",
    "Images shared on social media portray how the major tourist attraction, Corfu, was being consumed by flames. As the flames proceeded to spread from the centre of the island, many tourists were compelled to leave their hotels.",
    "The Emergency Communications Service of Greece issued evacuation orders late on Sunday night (23) for a number of neighbourhoods in Corfu.",
    "According to a government official, boats in the vicinity had been sent to evacuate inhabitants of the island by sea.",
