  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday approved measures to ensure a consistent supply of waste paper to the Valaichchenai paper mill, which resumed operations in 2020.",
    "The mill, which relies heavily on waste paper as its primary raw material, requires a steady flow of supplies to continue uninterrupted production.",
    "\u201cRecognising the importance of ensuring sufficient raw material, the Government has decided to channel waste paper generated by State institutions directly to the Valaichchenai paper mill,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said on Tuesday.",
    "Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said this includes high-quality white paper and other discarded paper materials from organisations such as the Department of Government Printing, Election Commission, Education Ministry and its subsidiaries, universities, and all Government Ministries and Departments.",
    "\u201cTo facilitate the process, the National Paper Company Ltd., will provide transport services to collect the paper material. Additionally, waste paper from public corporations, statutory boards, and other Government affiliated institutions will be supplied to the mill at a mutually agreed concessional rate, bypassing the need for a tender process,\u201d he explained.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa emphasised that the move is critical to keep the paper mill operating and promoting sustainable practices by recycling waste paper, while maintaining the substantial number of employment opportunities.",
    "The proposal to this effect, submitted by Industries and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunneththi, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."
