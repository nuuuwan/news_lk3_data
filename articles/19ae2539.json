    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Cabinet Spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said there are no security threats to any tourists in the island nation amid an ongoing investigation into a possibility of attack in the Eastern Sri Lankan coastal area of Arugam Bay.",
    "The intelligence information of a possible attack against Jews in an Arugam Bay area was first shared by foreign intelligence agency with the local counterpart and the government swiftly tightened the security to ensure the safety of both locals and foreign tourists.",
    "However, the threat triggered the U.S. Embassy in Colombo to issue travel advisory to its citizens before Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.",
    "However, later, the US Embassy relaxed the travel advisory after Sri Lanka started investigations into the threat with the arrest of six people.",
    "\u201cSo far the security is established and there is no threat to anyone,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman Jayatissa told reporters in the weekly post-cabinet press briefing.",
    "The travel advisories came ahead of the peak tourism season that started this month.",
    "They also came one month after Anura Kumara Dissanayake was elected as the President and formed a new interim government and three weeks before the parliamentary polls.",
    "Sri Lanka largely relies on tourism for its economic recovery after declaring sovereign debt default in April 2022.",
    "The seven countries that issued travel advisories have accounted for 29 percent of the total tourism arrivals in the first nine months of this year, the official government data show.",
    "However, Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry did not see any significant drop in the tourist arrivals amid swift action by the government and US relaxing its own travel advisory. (Colombo/November 26/2024)"
