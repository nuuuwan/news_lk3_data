    "Authorities said at least seven people were killed Saturday when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Georgia\u2019s Sapelo Island, where crowds had gathered for a fall celebration by the island\u2019s tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants.",
    "Eight people were taken to hospitals, at least six of them with critical injuries, and crews from the U.S. Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others were searching the water, according to Natural Resources spokesperson Tyler Jones. The agency operates the dock and ferry boats that transport people between the island and the mainland.",
    "A gangway at the dock collapsed, sending people plunging into the water, Jones said. A team of engineers and construction specialists planned to be on site early Sunday to begin investigating why the walkway failed, he said.",
    "\u201cThere was no collision\u201d with a boat or anything else, Jones said. \u201cThe thing just collapsed. We don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
    "Helicopters and boats with side-scanning sonar were used in the search, according to a Department of Natural Resources statement.",
    "Among the dead was a chaplain for the state agency, Jones said.",
    "There were at least 20 people on the gangway when it collapsed, he said. The gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another dock onshore.",
    "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he and his family were \u201cheartbroken by today\u2019s tragedy on Sapelo Island.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs state and local first responders continue to work this active scene, we ask that all Georgians join us in praying for those lost, for those still in harm\u2019s way, and for their families,\u201d Kemp said on the social platform X.",
    "President Joe Biden said federal officials were ready to provide any assistance needed.",
    "\u201cWhat should have been a joyous celebration of Gullah-Geechee culture and history instead turned into tragedy and devastation,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cJill and I mourn those who lost their lives, and we pray for the injured and anyone still missing. We are also grateful to the first responders at the scene.\u201d",
    "Sapelo Island is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Savannah, reachable from the mainland by boat.",
    "The deadly collapse happened as island residents, family members and tourists gathered for Cultural Day, an annual fall event spotlighting the island\u2019s tiny community of Hogg Hummock, home to a few dozen Black residents. The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded after the Civil War by former slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding.",
    "Hogg Hummock\u2019s slave descendants are extremely close, having been \u201cbonded by family, bonded by history and bonded by struggle,\u201d said Roger Lotson, the only Black member of the McIntosh County Board of Commissioners. His district includes Sapelo Island.",
    "\u201cEveryone is family, and everyone knows each other,\u201d Lotson said. \u201cIn any tragedy, especially like this, they are all one. They\u2019re all united. They all feel the same pain and the same hurt.\u201d",
    "Small communities descended from enslaved island populations in the South\u00a0 known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia\u00a0 are scattered along the coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage, from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing and weaving baskets.",
    "In 1996, Hogg Hummock, also known as Hog Hammock, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, the official list of the United States\u2019 treasured historic sites.",
    "But the community\u2019s population has been shrinking for decades, and some families have sold their land to outsiders who built vacation homes.",
    "Tax increases and zoning changes by the local government in McIntosh County have been met by protests and lawsuits by Hogg Hummock residents and landowners. They have been battling for the past year to undo zoning changes approved by county commissioners in September 2023 that doubled the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock.",
    "Residents say they fear larger homes will lead to tax increases that could force them to sell land their families have held for generations."
