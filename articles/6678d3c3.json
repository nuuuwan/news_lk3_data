    "WIS Accountancy, a leading provider of digital accountancy, bookkeeping, tax, and business advisory services in UK, is expanding operations in both the UK and Sri Lanka. WIS Accountancy is a part of the one-stop finance shop the WIS Group of companies which also comprises WIS Umbrella, WIS Mortgages and Insurance and WIS Wealth.",
    "This year, WIS Accountancy launched a revolutionary mortgage platform called \u2018MortgagX\u2019 in the UK which leverages AI to transform the mortgage journey for customers, advisors, and lenders. This cutting-edge development is predominantly managed offshore in Colombo and India, where its talented team creates tools to make the mortgage process efficient, secure, and user-friendly, redefining the future of mortgages. In a significant development in the UK, the WIS Group has also launched Collective Legal Surrey, a new service venture into the legal sphere, specifically focusing on conveyancing. Having been a household name in Financial Services for 15 years, the company is now integrating conveyancing services with its mortgage offerings through WIS Mortgages. Its strategic partnership with Homey, a state-of-the-art referral platform specializing in conveyancing, ensures seamless and efficient handling of conveyancing services.",
    "To support these initiatives, WIS is establishing an academy for finance, banking, and legal studies in Sri Lanka. This is a unique concept, rarely undertaken by companies, and represents a significant opportunity for Sri Lankans who will be trained from scratch to become professionals. The academy will provide scholarships and promote British qualifications, contributing to the professional growth of our employees and enhancing the overall quality of the workforce in Sri Lanka.",
    "Additionally, the WIS Group is expanding further by partnering with a UK-based bank to outsource its underwriting function to Colombo. This partnership is expected to open up job opportunities for 250 staff in the banking sector, including senior-level roles in credit and bank underwriting.",
    "To keep abreast of staffing requirements for such expansion, the company has announced new opportunities for school leavers, university graduates, and soon-to-be graduates eager to begin their careers in accountancy and finance. Positions such as Management Trainee and Underwriter will be available, allowing candidates to work in the UK financial sector from its Sri Lankan office. Successful candidates will receive scholarship schemes to pursue qualifications like ACCA, CIMA, or CeMAP., along with job opportunities, and will be trained from the ground up to become professionals in the field.",
