    "The battle lines in emerging international politics were further underscored when Russia and China stressed their support for the fiercely and popularly opposed President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela. As is known, Venezuelans in their tens of thousands are out on the streets protesting the perpetuation of Maduro\u2019s rule in a presidential poll result which is strongly and widely disputed.",
    "The Venezuelan strongman, as should be expected, is using the \u2018iron fist\u2019 to put down the current revolt against him but his days could very well be unprecedentedly troubled from now on. This is on account of the fact that besides the protest winning widespread popular support in his country, a considerable number of Latin American governments and other states are seeing the election as not meeting the standards of a \u2018free and fair\u2019 poll.",
    "For instance, the ambassadors of Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama and the Dominican Republic have been asked to leave Venezuela by the latter\u2019s authorities for their \u2018interventionist actions and statements\u2019, while withdrawing their own diplomats from the mentioned countries.",
    "It is to be seen whether the unwavering support of authoritarian states, such as Russia and China, will enable Maduro to ride out the storm conclusively. However, given the big power status of Russia and China, the support thus lent by them to Maduro should be seen as critical and decisive in ensuring his survival for the time being as well as featuring majorly in shaping the inter-state politics of Latin America and adjacent regions.",
    "Considering the predominant influence of China and Russia in the shaping of international politics, the analyst would not be wrong in seeing the current world order as a veritable stage where political authoritarianism is in increasing contention with what is seen as the \u2018Free World\u2019 for global dominance. Venezuela is the most recent theatre where this confrontation is being carried out.",
    "How \u2018Free\u2019 the world\u2019s present major democracies are is a highly controversial question and no debate on the subject is likely to yield a satisfactory consensus easily but there could be little doubt as to what the essential characteristics of authoritarian governance are. For instance, those states where rulers go uncontested and rule in perpetuity, wielding repressive power in the process, are quintessential authoritarian states.",
    "Going by this definition, Russia and China are easily authoritarian states. Besides, they are characterized by the absence of multiparty contestation for power. But by virtue of their predominance in global politics, they shape some of the basic contours of the current international political order.",
    "Ironically though, both China and Russia, emerged on the world stage as workers\u2019 states. For some time both states evinced signs of keeping the interests of working people sharply in focus, but this is no longer the case. Capitalism could be said to be flourishing in both countries and Russia in particular is today quite openly a nucleus of unfettered free enterprise and all the social and political appendages that go along with it.",
    "These comments, though, should not be seen as reflecting negatively on the \u2018ordinary people\u2019 of Russia and China. They are heirs to great civilizations and need to be respected profoundly by the rest of the world on that score. For instance, their genius is unbeatable in the areas of literature and the arts and what they have bequeathed to mankind is of undying importance. Besides, it need hardly be said that both countries are front-runners in the fields of science and technology.",
    "But Russia and China lack substantive democratic space and this is regrettable. Ideally, they should have blossomed into multiparty democracies where their citizenries would have been afforded opportunities to determine their political futures freely and at their discretion.",
    "Instead, what these publics have been saddled with are state classes whose interests are not always in accord with the just aspirations of the people. They are burdened with rulers in whose ears the notion of giving up power is anathema. The on-and-off popular revolts and protests that break out in both countries are the proof of this disconnect between the interests of the ruling class and those of the people.",
    "However, the analyst could be accused of being simplistic in his thinking if he sees the \u2018Free World\u2019 or the major democracies of the West as being perfect foils for Russia, China and other states of a highly authoritarian orientation. This is not the case.",
    "The January 6, 2021 storming of the United States Capitol Building in Washington by savage supporters of defeated presidential candidate Donald Trump, for example, was a shocking reminder that all is not well with \u2018American Democracy\u2019. It drove home the point that the \u2018extreme Right\u2019 is alive and well in the US and that goes for the rest of the major democracies of the West.",
    "What the more progressive oriented sections the world over should be concerned about most in this connection, moreover, is the possibility of the \u2018extreme Right\u2019 returning to power in the US in the form of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. On both the domestic and international fronts, another Donald Trump regime is likely to take the US in a strikingly Rightist direction.",
    "While democratic institutions at home face the possibility of being undermined, a Trump administration would prove an invigorating fillip to Right wing forces abroad. Some Rightist, anti-democratic lobbies even in Small Sri Lanka warmly welcomed the coming to power of Trump on the last occasion he triumphed at the presidential poll. The most jubilant in Sri Lanka were those who championed majoritarian chauvinism and were seeking to repress into silence minority communities and their movements for autonomy.",
    "All this means that US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris has her work cut out. On the domestic front, she would need to take the cue from one-time Democratic presidential front-runner Bernie Sanders and address the concerns of the US working class, while ensuring in general that social welfarism is not reneged on. Besides, women, minorities and other vulnerable groups need to see that a Harris administration offers them a better future.",
    "For Harris, the international arena would prove equally challenging. She would need to \u2018manage\u2019 Russian President Putin who is on record that he is compelled to take Europe back to the Cold War years on account of issues growing out of the Ukraine conflict in particular. She would also need to establish that the US would in no way pursue the double-faced policy of intervening militarily in the South\u2019s war zones, while projecting the US as the number one democracy of the world. In other words, Harris would need to prove that the world is not wrong when it describes the US as being a true representative of the \u2018Free World.\u2019",
