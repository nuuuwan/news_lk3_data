    "As the new Food & Beverage Manager at Hotel Babylon Oberoi I wanted, in 1989, the hotel to make a name in hospitality and catering in Iraq. I was also keen to create and promote a string of international food festivals in Baghdad but encountered several challenges. With my experience ding this many times before, I was well-prepared, motivated, and confident of creating a buzz and present hospitality events and entertainment in Baghdad.",
    "The first obstacle was staffing. We needed enthusiastic Iraqi employees alongside experienced foreign workers. The Iraqi government mandated the recruitment of young men returning to civilian life after eight years of war. During interviews, the impact of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was evident; many hopeful employees looked decades older than their actual ages. Injuries due to various situations faced in the war front which killed around half a million, were clearly visible in their bodies, faces and mental state. I was saddened about these young men, who were forced to experience the horrors of war.",
    "After recruitment, and initial orientations (to civilian life, hotel industry and Oberoi culture and hotel standards), the training we provided was intensive. With the support of expatriate managers and senior supervisors, we conducted both on-the-job and off-the-job training sessions. Once the basics were mastered by the trainees, we introduced new hospitality products and services, setting the stage for our food festivals, events, and entertainment.",
    "We made music and entertainment as an essential part of our hospitality offerings, creating vibrant atmospheres that drew in guests from near and far. At our night club, Githara, we hosted top Western bands who electrified the stage, while renowned Arabic musicians serenaded guests by the poolside, creating a harmonious blend of cultural experiences. The rooftop bar, aptly named Hanging Gardens, came alive with exotic dancers and musicians, providing an enchanting escape under the stars. Meanwhile, the lobby bar echoed with the sophisticated melodies of classical pianists, offering a serene backdrop for evening cocktails.",
    "The entertainment never ceased at the Hotel Babylon Oberoi\u2019s casino, where we curated an array of captivating performances that kept the excitement flowing well into the night. Drawing from my successful tenure as the Director of Food and Beverage at Le Galadari Meridien Hotel, in Colombo I knew that integrating entertainment deeply into our food and beverage operations was key to creating unforgettable guest experiences and optimizing revenues and profits.",
    "Unlike most nightclubs in Baghdad, which operated only three or four nights a week and focused on the weekend crowd, we envisioned something bolder for Githara. By introducing live bands every night, we transformed it into a seven-day hotspot, a gamble that paid off remarkably. This relentless dedication to providing top-notch entertainment set us apart, turning every evening into an occasion worth celebrating.",
    "After re-organizing the coffee shop, restaurants, bars, pastry shop, night club, 24-hour room service, banqueting operation, and the casino at this prestigious venue, we focused on new products. Recognizing Iraqis\u2019 love for barbecue, we launched a daily poolside barbecue featuring popular street food. As an important part of the cradle of civilisation, Baghdad has been home to many cultures and empires. From the Sumerians to the Kurds to the Jews of Baghdad, each have left their own distinct mark on Iraqi cuisine. Baghdad\u2019s rich culinary history, influenced by diverse cultures and empires, inspired our menu.",

    "Kubba (a round patty of ground meat covered in a light dough).",
    "Our varied menu ensured unprecedented popularity. This blend of street food with five-star service by an Olympic-size swimming pool became a hit.",
    "Despite the popularity of the venue, during the summer months we could not continue this new addition at the poolside. During the scorching summer months, with temperatures reaching 120\u00b0F (50\u00b0C), we moved indoors. Even brief trips outside felt like stepping into an oven, as my three-year-old son Marlon aptly described.",
    "I am (extreme left) with Oberoi\u2019s restaurant employees at the Indian Food Festival",
    "Based on popularity, Executive Chef O. P. Kantwal and I chose Morocco as the theme for our first food festival. As I had travelled to Morocco and had an enjoyable time tasting their food and experiencing warm hospitality in Casablanca, I insisted on including my favourite: Moroccan Lamb Stew with Couscous, in the menu. We used suggestions about menus, beverages, decorations, uniforms, and music, from a large group of Moroccan employees at the hotel to make our product authentic.",
    "They said, \u201cChef OP and Mr. Jay, let\u2019s fire up the grill!\u201d In Northern Africa that term can mean many things, from freshly caught fish, to heavily spiced merguez (spicy lamb or beef sausages) , to meshwi, where the word for \u201cfire roasted\u201d is given to a feast of lamb, roasted whole and stuffed with offal and dates. We decided to do all! I agreed with OP, that every evening during the festival, he would carve a whole lamb. Moroccan Food Festival was a great success and it drew customers from outside Baghdad as well.",
    "During the Moroccan food festival, we surveyed our Iraqi customers for future themes for food festivals. Given Oberoi\u2019s Indian roots and our popular Indian Executive Chef, an Indian Food Festival was a natural choice for the next festival. This event surpassed even the Moroccan festival in popularity.",

    "Following the resounding success of the Indian Food Festival, there was a growing demand for a permanent Indian restaurant at Hotel Babylon Oberoi. My only experience working in an Indian restaurant prior to landing in Iraq was as a part-time waiter, at a unique Indian Restaurant in London during my graduate student years. In 1982, Oberoi Hotels\u2019 key competitor \u2013 Taj Group had invested wisely to open the best Indian restaurant in the United Kingdom \u2013 the Bombay Brasserie. It paved the way for Indian and Bombay cuisine in London.",
    "In a life in hospitality one can strengthen the career foundation with diverse experiences at different levels. My waiter experience at the Bombay Brasserie in London became useful when I led the opening of the most exclusive Indian Restaurant in Baghdad in 1989.",
    "We swiftly conceptualized Hotel Babylon Oberoi\u2019s eleventh food and beverage outlet. With assistance from Oberoi\u2019s flagship hotel in New Delhi, we recruited a specialist Indian chef and imported essential equipment, including two large tandoori ovens. While the menu and staff training were promptly finalized, the engineering side lagged, threatening our planned opening date set by the hotel\u2019s owners, the State Organisation for Tourism in Iraq (identified as \u2018Tourism\u2019).",
    "Recognizing the urgency, General Manager and Vice President Madan Misra stepped in. He understood the critical importance of meeting our deadline to maintain our reputation and partnership with the Iraqi government. Misra, known for his decisive leadership, called an emergency meeting with all managers, contractors, and the Engineering Department. After a brief update from me, he took charge, declaring, \u201cWe will open this restaurant within 24 hours. I will not tolerate any delays. I want all of you to work non-stop until the restaurant is open. I will do the same. Understand?\u201d",
    "With Misra\u2019s direct management style, we worked tirelessly through the night. At 12 midnight, he positioned himself in the middle of the restaurant floor, continuously issuing orders. Despite the gruelling hours, Anlil Indian Restaurant opened on schedule the next evening, marking a triumphant debut.",
    "The opening night was a grand affair. Clad in colourful Indian sarees, wives of three senior managers, including my own, volunteered as hosts. The restaurant was packed, and our team excelled in delivering the finest Indian cuisine in Iraq with impeccable five-star service.",
    "Anlil quickly garnered immense popularity and rave reviews from the media. The success of Anlil not only enhanced Oberoi\u2019s reputation but also positioned the brand for further expansion in Iraq, beyond the three five-star hotels we already managed.",
    "\u201cMr. Jayawardena, meet Mr. Abdul Tawwab, the Head of Tourism in Iraq,\u201d Madan Misra introduced me to a distinguished looking gentleman during Anlil\u2019s opening. Tawwab, a senior Baath Party member, influential politician, and a confidante of President Sadam Hussein, dined at the head table with his wife and other VIPs. After that meeting, I encountered him frequently at the hotel, where he enjoyed the fine dining restaurants, gym, and spa. Each visit was anticipated, and Misra, the Resident Manager, and I, ensured a warm welcome and farewell.",
    "One day, Tawwab arrived at the hotel visibly angry and had a long, private conversation with Misra. After Tawwab left, Misra summoned me to a one-on-one meeting. \u201cMr. Jayawardena, close the door and sit down. I must tell you something highly confidential.\u201d Misra\u2019s excitement was palpable. \u201cOberoi and Tourism are very happy with your work. Would you like to take over the food and beverage division of another five-star hotel in Baghdad, in addition to your current responsibilities?\u201d",
    "Seeing this as a promotion, I eagerly accepted. However, Misra kept the hotel\u2019s identity a secret, only revealing that it was a 350-room property with seven food and beverage outlets and a large banquet operation. \u201cKeep this confidential but start the ground work discreetly. Identify chefs, restaurant managers, and bar supervisors who can be transferred with promotions at short notice. If needed, we\u2019ll bring in more managers from India, Egypt, and Sri Lanka when we sign the management contract.\u201d",
    "Misra explained that all expatriate managers at that 350-room hotel, managed by an international company, would be dismissed by Tourism. Shocked by the abruptness, I asked why. Misra revealed, \u201cToday, when Mr. Tawwab entered that hotel, their American General Manager had displayed disrespect. He failed to welcome Mr. Tawwab and remained seated at the coffee shop even after seeing him. Consequently, it was decided by Mr. Tawwab to expel that hotel company from Iraq, pending our readiness to take over the hotel for management!\u201d",
