  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court yesterday stayed a ruling by the Court of Appeal that had invalidated a directive from the Attorney General to the Police to name suspended Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennakoon as a suspect over the 9 May 2022 Galle Face attacks.",
    "The Supreme Court three-judge bench comprising Justices Janak de Silva, Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Sampath Abeykoon made this order following a leave to appeal petition filed by the Attorney General.",
    "The Court also overruled a preliminary objection raised by President\u2019s Counsel Romesh de Silva who appeared for Thennakoon, arguing that the caption relating to the respondents had not been amended as required.",
    "Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Suharshi Herath, appearing for the Attorney General, informed the Court that the Attorney General is constitutionally empowered to issue legal advice to law enforcement agencies when requested, and that such advice was provided in this instance upon the request by Police.",
    "In the appeal, the Attorney General is seeking an order to set aside the Court of Appeal judgment, which annulled his earlier communication instructing the Police to name Thennakoon as a suspect.",
    "The Attorney General had advised that Thennakoon be named a suspect for allegedly abetting the commission of offences punishable under Sections 314, 316, 343 and 300 of the Penal Code."
