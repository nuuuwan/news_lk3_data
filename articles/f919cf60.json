  "original_body_lines": [
    "The passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in India and Kankesanthurai (KKS) near Jaffna in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka resumed yesterday.",
    "The transport service, which was launched earlier in October 2023, was temporarily halted.",
    "The ferry \u2018Sivagangai\u2019 run by a private operator, IndSri Ferry Services, completed its maiden journey between Nagapattinam and KKS in around four hours with around 50 passengers on board. The passengers were welcomed at the KKS Port by the Consul General of India at Jaffna.",
    "This resumption of the ferry service is a testament to the broader effort to enhance maritime connectivity between India and Sri Lanka.",
    "In order to make the service more affordable for passengers, the Government of India has decided to provide financial assistance of over Rs. 25 million per month, for a period of one year, to cover relevant charges and operating costs at Nagapattinam Port.",
    "Similarly, the Government of Sri Lanka has reduced the deviation tax currently charged from passengers leaving Sri Lanka by passenger vessels and ships.",
    "It should be recalled that the Government of India has also extended a grant assistance of $ 63.65 million to the Government of Sri Lanka for refurbishing of the KKS Port, which was earlier envisaged to be undertaken under a Line of Credit. This is in line with India\u2019s commitment to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery and its journey towards progress and prosperity in close partnership with India. The resumption of this service underscores the commitment of both countries to strengthen bilateral relations through improved connectivity, as highlighted in the vision document for economic partnership jointly adopted during the visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in July 2023.",
    "Future plans include the exploration of additional routes and services that will further expand connectivity and economic collaboration."
