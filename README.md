*2024-08-15 22:09:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/199981) · `si`

2036 වසරේ ඔලිම්පික් උළෙලේ සත්කාරකත්වය ලබාගැනීම ඉන්දියාවේ සිහිනය බව ඉන්දීය අග්‍රාමාත්‍ය නරේන්ද්‍ර මෝදි පවසා සිටියේය.

ඉන්දියාවේ 78වැනි නිදහස් දින සැමරුම වෙනුවෙන් නවදිල්ලිහි රතු බල කොටුවේ අද (15) පැවැති උත්සවයේදී හෙතෙම එය හෙළිකළේය.

“2036 ඔලිම්පික් උළෙල පැවැත්වීම ඉන්දියාවේ සිහිනය, අපි ඒ සඳහා සූදානම් වෙමින් සිටිනවා" මෝදි පැවසීය.

හෙතෙම මෙහිදී වැඩිදුරටත් අනාවරණය කර සිටියේ, මහා පරිමාණ ගෝලීය ඉසව් සඳහා සත්කාරකත්වය ලබාදීමේ හැකියාව ඉන්දියාවට ඇති බවයි.

ඒ අනුව විදෙස් මාධ්‍ය වැඩිදුරටත් අනාවරණය කර සිටින්නේ, ඉන්දියාවට 2036 ඔලිම්පික් උළෙලේ සත්කාරක්තවය ලැබුණහොත් සත්කාරක නගරය ලෙසින් අහමදාබාද් නම් කරනු ඇති බවයි.

අහමදාබාද් යනු ඉන්දීය අග්‍රමාත්‍යවරයාගේ දේශපාලනයේ බල කඳවුර ලෙසින් සැලකෙන ගුජරාට් ප්‍රාන්තයේ විශාලම නගරයයි.

ඉන්දියාව මීට පෙර ඉතිහාසයේ කිසිඳු දිනක ඔලිම්පික් උළෙලකට සත්කාරකත්වය ලබාදී නොමැති අතර, ඔවුන් අවසන් වරට බහු ක්‍රීඩා උළෙලකට සත්කාරකත්වය ලබා දී ඇත්තේ 2010 වසරේ දිල්ලිහි පැවති පොදුරාජ්‍ය මණ්ඩලීය ක්‍රීඩා උළෙලටයි.

එමෙන්ම ඔවුන් වසර 42කින් (1982 වසරේදී) ආසියානු ක්‍රීඩා උළෙලකට හෝ සත්කාරකත්වය ලබා දී නොමැත.

### Sri Lanka SOE sale process was slow to avoid reversals

*2024-08-15 17:45:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-soe-sale-process-was-slow-to-avoid-reversals-176926/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state enterprises privatization is slow due to the process that was followed to ensure that the transactions were transparent and there was no risk of being reversed, SOE restructuring unit chief Suresh Shah said.

The 13th Amendment is used as a tool to get votes from minorities during elections.

However, we belong to the United Socialist Party.

We firmly believe that the Tamil community in the North East has the right to self -determination.

Our position may not be supported in some parts of the country, but we think this is fair.

We do not think that the people of the North East are more interested in implementing the current 13 -year -old.

We do not think that giving the Tamils ​​the right to self -determination will divide the country.

For example, the JVP once strongly opposed the 13th Amendment and used violence against it.

But they have changed their position.
