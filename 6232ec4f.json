    "The SLPP leadership\u00a0 persistently seeks Cabinet posts for its key members, but the President\u00a0 remains firm, knowing the SLPP has limited options and lacks public\u00a0 support for such demands",
    "Politics make strange bedfellows. In Sri Lankan politics,\u00a0 it is a reality proven with precision. Nothing is impossible in the\u00a0 pursuit of power. UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, who holds the\u00a0 presidency, was elected to office with the backing of Sri Lanka Podujana\u00a0 Peramuna (SLPP) under surprising circumstances given the history of\u00a0 hostility between the two parties. But in politics, shared interests can\u00a0 create unexpected alliances.",
    "The President was elected to office in the backdrop of\u00a0 political, social, and economic unrest, as the country grappled with\u00a0 snaking fuel queues, power outages, and essential shortages. While\u00a0 challenges persist, signs of an economic recovery are evident, leaving\u00a0 some hopeful for a brighter future.",
    "Be that as it may, as the dust settles, the differences\u00a0 between the parties have surfaced. With the elections pending next year,\u00a0 the focus now shifts to electoral politics, with parties gearing up\u00a0 their electoral machinery. Every party, be it the ruling side or the\u00a0 opposition, is concerned about securing power at elections.",
    "The President, with his party\u2019s sole parliamentary\u00a0 representative Vajira Abeywardena, has governed the country with the\u00a0 SLPP for over a year. Compared with the situation that\u00a0 remained when the President took charge, what the country now\u00a0 witnesses is an improvement of it, although greater challenges lie ahead\u00a0 for proper, sustainable economic recovery. Nevertheless, the\u00a0 accomplishments on the ground are visible. There are no shortage of essentials, though the prices are still way high.",
    "Politically, the achievement has propelled the President to\u00a0 a commanding position over the SLPP. It has allowed him more freedom in\u00a0 decision-making without being beholden to the dictates of the SLPP as\u00a0 such. His position is further bolstered by the SLPP MPs, who have\u00a0 obviously aligned themselves with the UNP rather than their own party.\u00a0 This leaves the SLPP in a politically weakened state.",
    "It does not mean that everything is harmonious within the\u00a0 alliance and the President has a smooth sail. The SLPP leadership\u00a0 persistently seeks Cabinet posts for its key members, but the President\u00a0 remains firm, knowing the SLPP has limited options and lacks public\u00a0 support for such demands. As the SLPP struggles to revive its base that\u00a0 waned due to the dismal performance of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u00a0 government, it finds itself in a precarious position, forcing them to\u00a0 work with the President while eschewing any radical action. Options are\u00a0 limited in the current political context for them.",
    "Daily Mirror learns that discontent brews among the SLPP\u00a0 seniors who feel disillusioned without Cabinet positions. MP S.B.\u00a0 Dissanayake\u2019s casual remark to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardane about\u00a0 warning of political machinations to defeat the government in a crucial\u00a0 parliamentary vote underscores the degree of disillusionment.",
    "However, the President does not seem to be carried away by\u00a0 such veiled threats. He is not ready to entertain the persistent request\u00a0 by the SLPP leadership to offer a few more Cabinet posts to party\u00a0 seniors such as Mr. Dissanayake, S.M. Chandrasena, Johnston Fernando and\u00a0 Rohitha Abeygunawardena.",
    "Despite all, the party cannot pressurize the President\u00a0 beyond a point, particularly regarding matters such as the increase in\u00a0 the size of the Cabinet. Such a move does not enjoy public support.\u00a0 Political apathy prevails among people in general, and that is because\u00a0 of people\u2019s dislike for the parties that governed the country. The\u00a0 traditional political forces including the SLPP have to rethink their\u00a0 political approaches as a result.",
    "The SLPP has now started its re-organizational work in\u00a0 anticipation of elections next year. Probably, the party now goes\u00a0 around the country conducting meetings with its rank and file.\u00a0 Still, it is way below in a position to strike demands from the President. It was a fact proven on numerous occasions.",
    "The SLPP could not stick to its guns on most matters during\u00a0 the past year. For example, it had concerns about the\u00a0 Anti-Corruption Bill, but it reached a consensus with the government at\u00a0 the end after a briefing by the legal luminaries. That is all due to a lack of options.",
    "In the absence of options, the SLPP is now forced to work\u00a0 together with the government, eschewing radical options such as the\u00a0 breakaway from the government to form an alliance with the opposition.\u00a0 \u00a0Political circumstances are not conducive at all for such an option.",
    "In a bid to allay concerns of the SLPP seniors, the President\u2019s team in the government proposed alternate posts for them.\u00a0 Yet, they remain adamant demanding nothing but Cabinet posts. No matter\u00a0 what, they would not quit the government.",
    "It is true that some people are hopeful for a better\u00a0 future. The political landscape remains fluid, though. The future of\u00a0 these parties will ultimately be shaped by the economic performance in\u00a0 the coming months. Public sentiment towards the government\u2019s policies\u00a0 and actions will play a pivotal role in determining which direction the\u00a0 electorate leans in the next election.",
    "As expected in any electoral democracy, the parties will\u00a0 continue to revamp their vote bases. Alliances and nomination of\u00a0 presidential candidates will be determined by the political\u00a0 circumstances at the time concerned.",
    "Meanwhile, an interesting political development is now\u00a0 taking place in view of the Presidential Election. A group of\u00a0 parliamentarians has got together under the leadership of MP Nimal Lanza\u00a0 to work for the candidacy of President Wickremesinghe. The group also\u00a0 commands the support of 40 MPs elected on the SLPP ticket. They are\u00a0 now in the initial stage of opening their political office in\u00a0 Rajagiriya, Colombo to carry out operations. Some MPs of Sri Lanka\u00a0 Freedom Party (SLFP) such as Duminda Dissanayake and Lasantha\u00a0 Alagiyawanna are in the emerging political group.",
    "The SLPP group which is loyal to party\u2019s National Organizer\u00a0 Basil Rajapaksa is perturbed over some of its MPs throwing their weight\u00a0 openly behind the President. They make swipes at the President, even\u00a0 saying the party has no pact signed with him to nominate him as the next\u00a0 presidential candidate. Still, there is little they can do in the\u00a0 current political climate."
