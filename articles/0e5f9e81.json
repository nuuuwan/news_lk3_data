    "In addition to this, in December 2023, onlineaccounting.lk became Asia\u2019s professional education institute award winner at the Asia Awards in India, organised in collaboration with the World Research Congress. This award was received due to the educational impact they had on Sri Lanka as a country.

The event underscored the collaborative effort between ACCA and onlineaccounting.lk in advancing professional education in Sri Lanka.",

Students can also study for ACCA while preparing for their A/Ls, as the flexibility of ACCA lectures at onlineaccounting.lk ensures that their school and A/L studies do not clash.
