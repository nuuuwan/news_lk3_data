  "original_body_lines": [
    "\"We have been talking about this racial and religious differences since the time we understood it. So when will this come to an end? Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera questioned.",
    "Addressing the media yesterday, he said that \"we, as a country are in a critical juncture today. Not only have there been many discussions over these religious issues, but the internet moderators have snowballed this issue purely for to make money\".",
    "\"In all these cases, our name is also attached to those incidents. We saw this issue being discussed in Parliament. Some people who were or weren't in the parliament served as ministers have continually issued statements saying that Gnanasara Thera should be sent to the gallows,\" the prelate said.",
    "\"Our country has a constitution. According to the first article of that constitution, it is clearly stated that it is the responsibility of the state to protect and nurture Buddhism. And other religions should be given the right and the believers to practice as per their own thoughts and wishes within this constitution,\" he said.",
    "Then what is the religious issue that is being spoken about? Currently, there are about 20 to 30 monks in the form of priests. This is more dangerous.",
    "Ministers who just speak do not understand this. They have not read anything about this issue. They don't even know what it means. They used to talk anything as they get the chance to grab the microphones, he charged. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
