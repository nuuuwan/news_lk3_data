    "The Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters\u2019 Union has decided to launch trade union action over several demands including the issues pertaining to promotions.",
    "The union stated that they will launch trade union action if no solutions are received to their grievances before 02.00 p.m. on Friday (14).",
    "The railway station masters claim that there has been a gross injustice by deliberately avoiding the grade of station masters among the grades belonging to the same service category and giving promotions to the other grades every five years.",
    "Furthermore, they mention that despite numerous discussions with relevant authorities regarding the matter, the promises to resolve the issues have not yet been implemented.",
    "The Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters\u2019 Union also expressed that it is regrettable that the authorities provide immediate solutions to the demands of the parties who implement sudden trade union action, rather than seeking solutions through discussions."
