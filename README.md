*2025-09-30 13:32:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113071/chinese-woman-convicted-in-uk-after-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-seizure) · `en`

A Chinese national has been convicted of playing a key role in what is believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world, worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn).

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court, London of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.

Between 2014 and 2017, she led a large-scale scam in China by cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

The Met said the 47-year-old’s guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web.

A total of 61,000 bitcoins were seized from Qian, the Met said.

The police said the probe began in 2018 after they got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets.

Qian had been “evading justice” for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met’s investigation.

Trends such as growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing curbs on visas are pushing US firms to redraw labour strategies, with global capability centres in India emerging as resilient hubs blending global skills with strong domestic leadership.

Madagascar’s president has said he will dissolve his government, following days of youth-led protests over longstanding water and power cuts.

“We acknowledge and apologise if members of the government have not carried out the tasks assigned to them,” Andry Rajoelina said in a televised national address on Monday.

The so-called Gen-Z protests have seen thousands of predominantly young demonstrators take to the streets in cities across Madagascar since Thursday, under the rallying cry: “We want to live, not survive”.
