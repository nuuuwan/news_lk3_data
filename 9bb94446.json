    "World Bank Group statement, June 28 2023-\u00a0The World Bank Group\u2019s Board of Executive Directors today discussed their new country partnership with Sri Lanka which aims to help restore economic and financial sector stability and build a strong foundation for a green, resilient, and inclusive recovery.",
    "This CPF comes at a time when the country is navigating a severe economic crisis that is having devastating impacts on people\u2019s lives and livelihoods and which demands deep reforms to stabilize the economy and protect the poor and vulnerable. Sri Lanka\u2019s poverty rate is estimated to have doubled from 13.1 to 25 percent between 2021 and 2022\u2014an addition of 2.5 million poor people\u2014and is projected to increase by another 2.4 percentage points in 2023.",
    "The CPF, which covers the years 2024-2027, lays out a two-phased approach that starts with a focus on urgent macro-fiscal and structural reforms and support to protect the human capital and most vulnerable population. After the first 18-24 months, and subject to successful implementation of the reform program and international debt relief and financial support, the CPF focus will gradually shift to investments in longer-term development needs that will help promote private sector job creation\u2014particularly for women and youth\u2014and boost resilience to climate and external shocks.",
    "The World Bank Board of Directors also approved $700 million in financing for two operations to help Sri Lanka implement foundational reforms that restore macroeconomic stability and sustainability, mitigate the impact of current and future shocks on the poor and vulnerable, and support an inclusive and private-sector-led recovery and growth path.",
    "The Sri Lanka resilience, stability and economic turnaround (RESET) development policy operation\u00a0($500 million) will support reforms that help improve economic governance, enhance growth and competitiveness, and protect the poor and vulnerable. It will provide budget support in two equal tranches against agreed prior actions.",
    "The Social protection project ($200 million) seeks to support Sri Lanka in providing better-targeted income and livelihood opportunities to the poor and vulnerable and improving the responsiveness of the social protection system.",
