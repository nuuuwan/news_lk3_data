### பிரபாகரன் ’’ஒரு தாயைப் போன்றவர்’’: விஜய்

*2025-09-22 10:35:34* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/பிரபாகரன்-ஒரு-தாயைப்-போன்றவர்-விஜய்/175-365040) · `ta`

விடுதலைப் புலிகள் அமைப்பின் தலைவர் வேலுப்பிள்ளை பிரபாகரன், இலங்கை தமிழ் மக்களுக்கு "ஒரு தாயைப் போன்றவர்" என்று தமிழக வெற்றிக் கழகத்தின் தலைவர் நடிகர் விஜய் தமிழ்நாட்டின் நாகப்பட்டினத்தில் நடந்த தேர்தல் பேரணியில் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

"உலகின் எந்த மூலையில் இருந்தாலும், எங்கள் உறவினர்களான ஈழத் தமிழ் மக்கள், தாய் பாசத்தைக் காட்டிய ஒரு தலைவரை இழந்து தவிக்கின்றனர். எனவே, அவர்களுக்காகப் பேசுவது எங்கள் கடமை."எனவும் அவர் குறிப்பிட்டார்.

நாகப்பட்டினம் போன்ற பெரிய கடற்றொழில் சமூகம் உள்ள பகுதிகளில் இலங்கைத் தமிழர்களின் பிரச்சினை ஓர் உணர்ச்சிகரமான பிரச்சினையாகக் கருதப்படுகிறது.

2008 ஆம் ஆண்டில், இலங்கைத் தமிழர்களின் சார்பாக விஜய் சென்னையில் உண்ணாவிரதப் போராட்டத்தில் ஈடுபட்டார். இருப்பினும், அரசியல் விமர்சகர்கள் இலங்கைத் தமிழர்களை ஆதரிப்பதும், இந்தியாவில் தடைசெய்யப்பட்ட விடுதலைப் புலிகளை ஆதரிப்பதும் ஒன்றல்ல என்று சுட்டிக்காட்டுகின்றனர்.

### Sri Lanka bank interest rates edge up amid ‘ramrod anomaly’ in bills

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s bank interest rates have continued to edge up after a rate cut in May 2025, amid a strong economic recovery made possible by the stability provided by the central bank through past deflationary policy as well as stable government policies.

According to central bank data the weighted average new fixed deposit rate fell to 6.62 percent in May and climbed to 6.85 percent in June and 6.90 percent in July.

However, banks are now mobilizing 12-month deposits at 7.75 percent and above to finance strong credit demand and an economic recovery.

The economic recovery may also have been helped by reduced government capex, which reduced domestic state borrowings and allowed private citizens to deploy resources to the most productive areas, bringing compounded long-term growth rather than bureaucratic spending.

The weighted average new lending rate climbed to 10.56 percent in April from 10.46 percent in March, fell to 10.28 percent in June, a month after the rate cut.

*2025-09-22 05:19:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Public-Rights-Movement-raises-alarm-over-Litro-tender-changes-calls-for-probe/56-782008) · `en`

The National Movement for the Protection of Public Rights has voiced strong concern over recent changes made to Litro Gas Lanka’s tender process for importing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), warning that the move could undermine the profitability of the State-owned enterprise (SOE) and compromise national energy security.

In a letter addressed to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director-General, Movement Convener Charaka Thilakaratne alleged that a key clause in previous tender documents had been removed without proper authorisation. The clause had prohibited Litro from using storage facilities owned by competing suppliers to store imported gas reserves, a safeguard long considered essential to prevent market manipulation in the critical gas sector.

Success will require both Government and citizens to embrace a shared vision — supporting reforms, backing key sectors, and investing in the nation’s future

All Share Price Index growth: 10,119 points or 93% gain post Presidential election

Market PE stands at 9.2, highly undervalued compared to regional peers

To truly understand the story of a nation, one need not look further than the pulse of its stock exchange. It is a living, breathing entity that discounts the future, processes the present, and is invariably haunted by the ghosts of the past. For 16 tumultuous years, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has been the most honest narrator of Sri Lanka’s modern saga—a tale of euphoric triumph, devastating despair and now become the forward barometer of Sri Lanka’s economic rebirth.

In exactly one year since the Presidential elections, the ASPI has gained more than 90%, gaining 10,119 points from 10,966 to 21,085 as of 19 September 2025.

No final decision has been taken on the proposal against Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne. United People's Power District Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said that the final decision will be taken during a meeting with opposition leaders this week.

The actions of Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne are completely contrary to parliamentary principles and the basic aspects of democracy. He does not protect the democracy of Parliament and the rights of the opposition parties. He acts on behalf of the ruling party.

It is doubtful whether the Speaker is unaware of the power and responsibility of his post. Pimal Ratnayake is directing the Speaker.

The Speaker has ignored the no -confidence motion against Deputy Minister of Defense Aruna Jayasekara.

Various parties have urged the Speaker's unilateral action to bring a no -confidence motion against him.

Fallout from a cyberattack that disrupted check-in systems at several European airports extended into a second full day on Sunday, as passengers faced dozens of canceled and delayed flights — and the impact poised to worsen for at least one major airport.

Brussels Airport, seemingly the hardest hit, said it asked airlines to cancel nearly 140 departing flights scheduled for Monday because a U.S.-based software system provider “is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.” The airport said 25 outbound flights were canceled on Saturday and 50 on Sunday.

Starting late Friday, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up check-in and sent airline staffers trying options like handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops. Many other European airports were unaffected.

### Economist warns 5% growth insufficient, calls for ambitious reforms

*2025-09-21 18:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/economist-warns-5-growth-insufficient-calls-for-ambitious-reforms/) · `en`

Despite a recent uptick in economic indicators, a senior economist has cautioned that Sri Lanka’s current growth trajectory is inadequate for a full recovery, calling for a decisive push towards 8-10% expansion in the coming years.

The warning from University of Peradeniya’s Wasantha Athukorala follows data showing the economy grew by 4.9% in the second quarter of 2025, an improvement from the 4.1% growth recorded a year earlier.

Prof. Athukorala acknowledged a recent vote of confidence from the global market, referencing S&P Global Ratings’ upgrade of Sri Lanka’s foreign currency sovereign credit rating. However, he stressed that the ‘CCC+’ rating still signifies high risk and does not qualify the country for easy credit.

“This upgrade reflects a positive start for stability and growth,” he stated, noting it should boost investor confidence and improve access to global capital. “But the current 5% economic growth is not sufficient.”
