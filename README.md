### Sri Lanka’s IMF deal: Turning point, but caution is key

*2024-12-23 01:50:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-IMF-deal-Turning-point-but-caution-is-key/4-770896) · `en`

The IMF deal marks the beginning, not the end, of its journey

While Sri Lanka’s IMF deal offers hope, the risks are real. Political instability could derail reforms, as vested interests resist change. Reform fatigue, too, is a genuine concern—if the public does not see tangible benefits soon, support for the program could waver. Globally, external shocks—rising interest rates, slowing trade, or geopolitical tensions—could further complicate the recovery. The Government must proceed with caution. An IMF deal is not a panacea; it is a foundation on which Sri Lanka must build its recovery. Strong institutions, consistent policies, and effective communication will be critical in navigating these risks

🟩

It has been urged to release the Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankan fishermen.

The issue was investigated at a meeting of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Executive Committee at the Chennai -Artist Stadium yesterday (22) chaired by party leader MK Stalin.

Meanwhile, members of the party at the Executive Committee said that the arrest of Indian fishermen and confiscating their boats would question their livelihood.

The prison sentence imposed on Indian fishermen in the Sri Lankan courts has been pointed out to disrupt the friendship between the two countries.

### 2024-12-22 (Sunday)

### Rumpus about campus qualifications

*2024-12-22 23:52:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rumpus-about-campus-qualifications/4-770884) · `en`

A highly qualified politician without integrity or empathy can cause more harm than an unqualified but ethical leader

Sri Lanka’s Parliament is ablaze with a fiery debate over questionable campus qualifications, with the spotlight now on the JVP/NPP. Since voters placed their trust in the party as champions of honesty, integrity, and anti-corruption, the party now finds itself entangled in a web of controversy. Their rise to power on a platform of transparency has hit a stumbling block, as allegations of fabricated academic credentials leave them scrambling for cover, raising eyebrows and questions about their credibility.

It is important to emphasise that in past governments, such questions and investigations were often curtailed immediately, sometimes with verbal and physical threats. Therefore, citizens must welcome this change. However, the ability to question alone should not be considered a success.

Firstly, a very Merry Christmas to you and yours. This year it must be a very different Christmas for you. You seem to have been a good boy and Santa came early for you. All your Christmases came at once. It is good to see that now you are playing Santa Claus and distributing goodies all around.

### Central Bank, NGO Secretariat and weaponisation of Financial Action Task Force

As FATF has pointed out, blanket and arbitrary measures can drive financial flows underground, thereby undermining the entire purpose of the FATF standards and instead increase terror financing risks

Two entities play a visible and critical role in State attempts to place repressive controls on CSOs; the NGO Secretariat and the CBSL. The third entity that is the driver of these attempts but has largely operated in the shadows is the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The issuance of the 12 December instructions by the NGO Secretariat, indicates the MOD is slowly becoming visible and its role in State attempts to control CSOs/NGOs is being legitimised

### Removing ban on vehicle imports: Is it a prudent plan?

*2024-12-22 23:41:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Removing-ban-on-vehicle-imports-Is-it-a-prudent-plan/4-770881) · `en`

The highest risk is not the decision to import vehicles but linking the tariff income as a source of funding to pay the proposed salary increases, because if dollar outflow is going to be significant destabilising the existing macroeconomic stability, there is no way to contain vehicle imports as such restriction will reduce the targeted tariff income jeopardising the Government plan to provide money for salary increases without increasing taxes

The Government’s plan to lift the ban on vehicle imports is out. But it is not a prudent plan, perhaps it cannot prevail. Sometimes it might create macroeconomic chaos and uncertainty among the vehicle importing entrepreneurs. Any policy that cannot be sustained or justified in view of  strengthening the macroeconomic environment of the country is usually treated as a bad policy.

### Deleted CCTV footage recovered in Hatton bus accident

Police have recovered the CCTV footage alleged to have been deleted from the private bus involved in a tragic accident in the Malliappuwa area on Saturday (21), which claimed the lives of three people including a school student.

The accident occurred at around 10.00 a.m. when a private passenger bus travelling from Hatton to Kandy veered off the road and plunged 20 feet down a concrete embankment. Initial investigations suggest that the driver lost control of the vehicle.

During police interrogations, the bus driver claimed that the bus door had opened, causing him to lose balance and nearly fall out. In an attempt to hold on to the steering wheel, he was unable to regain control, leading to the crash.

Police have discovered that someone had later deleted the CCTV footage recorded during the accident. However, using advanced technology methods, the police successfully recovered the footage, which they say provides critical evidence regarding the incident.
