    "COLOMBO (News 1st): Restoration of power outages across the island has been delayed due to ongoing trade union action launched by employees of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).According to the CEB, around 30,000 power failures have been reported islandwide as a result of the prevailing adverse weather conditions.Strong winds have caused trees to fall onto power lines, resulting in widespread power disruptions.The Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya of the CEB said that the ongoing trade union action has delayed efforts to restore the power supply.Trade union campaigns launched by several CEB unions have now continued for the 32nd consecutive day.The work-to-rule action initiated on September 04 with 25 trade unions, including those affiliated with opposition parties such as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), United National Party (UNP), and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), withdrawing from additional and overtime duties.The unions initiated their protest by presenting 24 demands concerning the restructuring process of the CEB and later withdrew from procurement committee duties as well.Among their key demands are overdue promotions and salary arrears, the inclusion of the Rs. 10,000 temporary allowance into the basic salary that was paid up to December 31, 2023, and a 25% salary increase effective from January 1, 2024, along with arrears.Meanwhile, in an effort to ensure an uninterrupted power supply to the public, all employee leave within the CEB was recently suspended.An Extraordinary Gazette declaring all electricity-related services as essential services remains in effect."
