### රටවල් 3ක් බලාසිටින ආසියානු කුසලානයේ හෙට දවස

*2025-09-17 15:54:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/214678) · `si`

ආසියානු කුසලාන විස්සයි20 ක්‍රිකට් තරගාවලියේ 'B' කාණ්ඩයේ තරග අවසන් කරමින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාව හා ඇෆ්ගනිස්තානය අතර තරගය හෙට (18) අබුඩාබි හිදී පැවැත්වේ.

මෙය 'B' කාණ්ඩයෙන් සුපිරි 4 වටයට සුදුසුකම් ලබන කණ්ඩායම් ද්විත්වය තීරණය කිරීමට පැවැත්වෙන අතිශය තීරණාත්මක තරගයකි.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව මේ දක්වා ක්‍රීඩාකළ තරග දෙකම ජයගෙන ලකුණු 4ක් සමගින් ප්‍රසාද ලකුණු සටහනේ පෙරමුණ හිමිකරගෙන සිටින බැවින්, ඔවුන් දැනටමත් සුපිරි 4 වටය පෙනෙන මානයටම පැමිණ සිටියි.

ඒ අනුව හෙට තරගය ද ජයගතහොත් අපරාජිත කණ්ඩායමක් ලෙසින්ම සුපිරි 4 වටයට යාමට ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට හැකිවේ.

ඒ හැරෙන්න ඇෆ්ගනිස්තානය හමුවේ දරුණු පරාජයක් නොලැබීම ද ඔවුන්ට තරගාවලියේ තවදුරටත් රැඳී සිටීමේ අවස්ථාව ඇත.

'B' කාණ්ඩයෙන් තරග කළ හොංකොං කණ්ඩායම ක්‍රීඩාකළ තරග 3ම පරාජය වූ බැවින් ඔවුන් දැනටමත් තරගාවලියෙන් ඉවතට වී ඇත.

ඇෆ්ගනිස්තනය පළමුවට පන්දුවට පහර දී ලබාදෙන ඉලක්කය ශ්‍රී ලංකාව හඹායාමට නොහැකි වුවත්, එම පරාජය ලකුණු 71කට නොවැඩි විය යුතුය.

නැතහොත් ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ලබාදෙන ඉලක්කය ඇෆ්ගනිස්තානයට පන්දුවාර 11.1කට අඩුවෙන් (පන්දු 53ක් ඉතිරිව තිබියදී) හඹායාමට අවස්ථාවක් ලබානොදිය යුතුය.

Adani opened the first phase of the fully automated terminal in April, making it operational. The second and final phase is underway and expected to be completed by late 2026, three to four months ahead of the February 2027 deadline, said Zafir Hashim, head of transportation at John Keells.

### Reclaiming The Nation We Deserve From The Shackles Of A Hollow Democracy

I often wonder whether our nation’s founders ever paused to reflect before adopting the foundational principles of Democratic, Socialist, and Republic to define the country. A nation’s self-identification shapes not only its domestic policies but also its relationship with its people and its place in the world. Misinterpreting or inconsistently applying these terms risks deep conflict, ideological, institutional, and social, which we have adequately experienced. Before judging the merits of this identity, we must return to the fundamentals of democracy: does it serve some of the people some of the time, or all of the people all of the time?
