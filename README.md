The Election Commission has announced a key measure for the upcoming Parliamentary Election scheduled for November 14, 2024.

Accordingly, voters will have their left hand‚Äôs index finger marked with an appropriate sign to prevent double voting and ensure transparency, the election regulatory body said.

This decision comes in light of concerns about possible confusion during the polling process for the Presidential Election 2024, which took place recently.

Meanwhile, if a voter‚Äôs left index finger is unavailable, the mark will be applied to another finger, as suitable, according to the Election Commission.

Anticipating Kamala Harris winning the US presidency, the original title of my article was The Woman Behind the 47th President of the United States. Most unfortunately and surprisingly to us, Donald Trump won the election. However, defeated Kamala has a couple of achievements to her name. She is the first woman, Black American and South Asian American to be elected Vice President of the US, District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California. And more importantly she is young, healthy, vibrant and next time around may overcome obvious prejudices in the minds of the American voting public and garner the honour of being first woman president of the US. Four years hence?

Senior public officials have often to act as buffers between ministers, other important political actors, and other stakeholders in society.

Victory may have many fathers, but defeat isn‚Äôt always an orphan. Just 24 hours after Donald Trump was declared as the 47th President of the United States, pundits and analysts are at it, trying to deconstruct perhaps one of the most consequential elections in US history and trying to find out what went wrong. The upshot of it is that yet another attempt at breaking the glass ceiling in the world‚Äôs supposed bastion of democracy has failed ‚Äì though, unlike Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris may return to the fight after the next five years are up. Until then, of course, a lot can happen. Not least of which, to the Democrats.

Last Tuesday, one of the most consequential elections in the history of the United States was concluded, with the people deciding, according to the constitution of the nation, to abandon the ideological system of governance defined by that very constitution. The living ideology of democracy, in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, of a ‚Äúgovernment of the people, by the people and for the people‚Äù has been replaced by an authoritarian kleptocracy.

The archaic Constitution of the United States written over two centuries ago will be updated, replaced by a document created by the conservative Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 ‚Äì Mandate for Leadership, to reflect the traditions and ideology of pre-World War II Germany.

Donald Trump did not simply win a second presidential election. He crushed Kamala Harris and the top-down electoral coalition that she was hurriedly assembling to overcome what Democrats rhetorically kept defining as an existential threat to American democracy. The American voters have resoundingly sided with the perpetrator of the threat not only in the contested seven swing states, but also in the popular vote across the country. And they ignored all the warnings dramatized by celebrities, meticulously explained by President Clinton in small voter gatherings in swing states, and soaringly articulated across the land by the Obamas ‚Äì Michelle and Barak, the country‚Äôs most eloquent political couple.

Dr. Deepal Perera, a paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, states that a recent rise in fever cases among children is observed, attributing this to a surge in viral infections as well as an uptick in dengue cases.

He emphasized that parents should closely monitor children‚Äôs symptoms, especially if a fever lasts more than three days, as it may indicate a more serious infection.

According to Dr. Perera, many children are presenting with symptoms of viral fever, such as cough, cold, body aches, and occasional vomiting. He warned that some of these symptoms can mimic those of influenza, making it essential for parents to observe children carefully and seek medical attention if fevers persist. Additionally, he advised obtaining relevant blood tests to identify potential dengue infections.

### MONKS IN CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS

Whether the participation of monks in representative politics is permissible (or proper), has been a matter of periodic discourse in the media.

The ordained ones have themselves chosen to enter the Community referred to collectively as ‚ÄúThe (Maha) Sangha‚Äù They have voluntarily resolved to abandon the lay life and to observe the rules of conduct (more than two hundred), included in the Vinaya Pitaka.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the ‚Äúforest dweller‚Äù (vanavasa) tradition prevails, where the monk lives alone, often in a natural cave, and devotes himself to continuous meditation and solitude, with minimum contact with others. In the commoner monastic tradition, a community of monks live together, with each engaging in his own spiritual practices.

The leader of the Sri Lanka factor Charith said that he should take responsibility for the defeat of the second T20 match with New Zealand.

He said this to the media yesterday (10) after the match.

"I think it's hard to look forward to bowling more than a group. It is a good thing to be limited to any wicket and 108. I see all the batsmen, including I want to take responsibility for the defeat. "

Batting first, New Zealand scored 108 runs for the loss of 19 overs.

In reply, the Sri Lankan team was only 103 runs for the loss of all 19 overs.

Former Minister Manusha Nanayakkara has said that if Ranil Wickremesinghe was president, the third loan of the IMF would have been available.

Speaking at a public meeting held in Galle yesterday, he said that the budget has been postponed and the current government's decision to hold the general election has been postponed indefinitely.

"It is doubtful whether the current government is trying to introduce the new constitution and will try to change this constitution without the opinion of the people."

‚ÄúThe election is increasing day by day. People who are confident, people who are deceived by lies, understand it and slowly change their own ideologies. Many people understand that they are lying.. People understand that the money is not hidden in Uganda and cannot buy fuel for 150 rupees.
