    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Deputy Minister Susil Ranasinghe has reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to conducting thorough and impartial investigations into several unresolved high-profile cases, including the murder of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, the assassination of Lasantha Wickrematunge, and the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.The renewed pledge comes as new revelations emerge in the Wasim Thajudeen case, which was initially misclassified as a car accident in May 2012, but later confirmed to be a premeditated murder following investigations by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).Recent developments have linked Aruna Priyantha Vidanagamage, also known as Meegasare' Kajja, to the murder.\u00a0At the time of the incident, Kajja was reportedly employed at a powerful government ministry.\u00a0Investigators have confirmed that on the day of Thajudeen\u2019s death, Kajja was traveling in a vehicle that followed Thajudeen\u2019s car, as revealed through CCTV footage and mobile tower records.Further evidence surfaced during the investigation into Kajja\u2019s own murder, which occurred on February 19.\u00a0His widow provided a statement to the CID, identifying Kajja in surveillance footage based on his distinctive posture due to spinal issues.The probe is also linked to the arrest of Nirmal Prasanga, alias Backhoe Saman, a key suspect in Kajja\u2019s murder. He was apprehended in Indonesia alongside Kehelbaddara Padme and is currently being interrogated by Sri Lankan authorities.Despite the mounting evidence, no convictions have yet been made in the Thajudeen case."
