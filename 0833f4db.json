  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) says there is no truth to reports in the media that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has submitted a report on proposed electricity tariff reductions.",
    "Issuing a statement, the energy sector regulator clarified that no such reports have been received as of today (Jan. 08).",
    "The PUCSL mentioned that although several media reports claimed that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had handed over a proposal for the electricity tariff revision to obtain the commission\u2019s approval, no such document has been received by the PUCSL to date (Jan. 08).",
    "Nevertheless, on Wednesday (Jan. 03), Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara had stated that the CEB plans to submit the electricity tariff reduction proposal to the PUCSL in the upcoming week.",
    "In December last year, Wijesekara emphasized that electricity tariffs would likely be reduced to earlier rates during the tariff revision scheduled for January 2024, as hydropower was being generated at maximum capacity."
