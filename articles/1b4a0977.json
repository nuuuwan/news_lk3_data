    "Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa may be blamed for many things, but his political resilience is remarkable. His biggest achievement is generally thought to be providing political leadership for defeating the LTTE, but it is something else\u2014frustrating President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga\u2019s efforts to prevent him from running for President in 2005 as the candidate of the SLFP-led UPFA. He made a stunning comeback after his defeat in the 2015 presidential race. His counterattack against the UNP-led Yahapalana government was dubbed Mahinda Sulanga (\u2018Mahinda Wind\u2019). Having regained power, he ruined things for himself big-time. The rest is history.",
    "Mahinda has said, after leaving his Wijerama official residence, that there is the possibility of another Mahinda Sulanga or \u2018some other sulanga\u2019 emerging. His claim has set the cat among the pigeons; the NPP stalwarts and their propagandists have seen red. They are of the view that he has hinted at an anti-government campaign to be launched by his son, Namal. They have gone to the extent of claiming that Namal will never be able to win a presidential election.",
    "Namal has a very long way to go before being forgiven by the people, if at all. But nothing is so certain as the unexpected in politics, especially in this country. Whoever would have thought in 1989, when people celebrated the defeat of the JVP, that the JVP would ever be able to win elections and rule the country? Mahinda may not have thought Maithripala Sirisena would ever be able to beat him in the presidential race in 2015. Many Americans thought Donald Trump cooked his goose by inciting a mob attack on the US Capitol at the end of his first term. But he secured the presidency again. The Rajapaksas\u2019 comeback following their ignominious defeat in 2015 was not something many bargained for. However, the question is not whether Namal will be able to win the presidency but whether the JVP/NPP has any moral right to talk about future presidential elections, for one of its main election promises is to abolish the executive presidency; if it is serious about fulfilling that pledge, it should stop discussing matters pertaining to future presidential elections, say confidently that there will be no presidential election again and knuckle down to writing a new Constitution to achieve that goal.",
    "The JVP has consistently condemned the executive presidency as a wellspring of evil, which has to be eliminated to save democracy. That was one of its main slogans during its second uprising in the late 1980s. It also obtained a pledge from Mahinda Rajapaksa before throwing its weight behind him in the 2005 presidential election and making his elevation to the presidency possible. Castigating him for reneging on that promise, it backed Maithripala Sirisena in the 2015 presidential contest, only to be disappointed once again. In 2024, the JVP-led NPP sought a popular mandate to carry out various promises. In its manifesto, A Thriving Nation: A beautiful life, it promises a new Constitution, and among the other pledges are the scrapping of the executive presidency, limiting official presidential residences to one, and abolishing the pensions and special privileges given to retired presidents and their families. It has done away with perks and privileges of former Presidents but remains silent on its promise to abolish the executive presidency.",
    "The NPP has a supermajority and claims to be able to mobilise the people across the country to ensure the implementation of its election manifesto. So, there is no reason why it cannot honour its pledge to abolish the executive presidency.",
    "Curiously, the Opposition is also not pressuring the government to scrap the executive presidency. Maybe its leaders think they will be able to savour the enormous powers vested in that institution one day if they wait patiently until the incumbent dispensation\u2019s luck runs out. Hope is said to spring eternal.",
