Showcasing Sri Lanka\u2019s vibrant food culture through outstanding culinary offerings creates a harmonious environment where guests feel valued and cared for.",
    "The newfound interest in culinary tourism and trend-setting culinary experiences is also in high demand among discerning travellers. The Blossom team places significant emphasis on segmenting and targeting the right target groups, as well as strategically positioning the hotel. One of the key pillars of the sustainable culinary experience is the local and international culinary infusion with unique presentation. Hence, creating a better HR ecosystem will be the differentiator, and that would enable positioning best among the equals of the competition. Therefore, the management of Blossom will recruit experts in their respective fields to train local youth and integrate them with a well-trained workforce that takes pride in delighting customers and maintaining the highest standards of the Blossom experience.",
    "The 72 guest rooms are across four categories, with high-end amenities that consist of standard rooms and modern rooms, fully equipped with a balcony. Deluxe Rooms, spacious Family Rooms, multi-bed for family rooms, Suite Rooms, and high-end luxury with a private lounge area.",
    "Further, it will create much-needed ambiance with a restaurant that has a seating capacity of 120, AC and non-AC multi-cuisine dining with \u00e0 la carte and buffet options, including a kitchen for live cooking demonstrations. The indoor bar area connected to the restaurant and outdoor seating area overlooking the beautiful countryside, including the surrounding Yala wildlife, serves beer, wine, spirits, cocktails, and snacks. An authentic Chinese restaurant will further enhance the diverse culinary experience. The outdoor recreational area for guests with their families, the pool, includes a Jacuzzi and a baby pool facility with a sun deck area and a pool bar serving casual food and beverages for guests relaxing by the pool. The healing and well-being of the guest will also have the highest priority. The gym, spa, and sauna will have a mind-body wellness program. They will be fully equipped with 4-star standard machines, and the spa and sauna will be facilitated with private therapy rooms, steam boxes, massage chairs, and a common sauna room.",
    "The management of Blossom has made sustainability the central focus of its operations. Hence, they will be adopting technology advancements, which enable the sustainability adoption of every aspect of the guest experience. The energy efficiency will be achieved with the digitisation of the hotel\u2019s physical infrastructure and operational management. Green energy, solar power, waste-based energy generation, and rainwater harvesting will drive the hotel towards net-zero carbon efficiency."
