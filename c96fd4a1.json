The campaign additionally served as a platform for motivation and reward during challenging times. The dealers highlighted that this initiative represented the highest incentive value ever received, within a short period, in the Automotive sector.",
    "Commenting on the promotion, Ajith De Silva \u2013 Cluster Chief Operating Officer, Automotive & Hardware \u2013 Browns Group said, \u201cAs one of the leading automotive companies in Sri Lanka, we continuously prioritise nurturing relationships with our dealers while diligently working to offer them the best incentives at all times.
