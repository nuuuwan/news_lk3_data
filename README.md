### Congratulations and cautionary notes

*2024-09-23 04:35:03* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Congratulations-and-cautionary-notes/4-767003) · `en`

Here’s wishing Anura Kumara Dissanayake heartiest congratulations on behalf of all those bleeding hearts that yearned for systemic change

The ‘too close to call’ Presidential poll has been called and lo, the name of Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) heads all the rest. Case closed, with the pundits who predicted the necessity to appeal to the preferential voting silenced? Perhaps not, for there is cause for proceeding with caution:

In the first flush of a famous victory, AKD and his colleagues may be inclined to interpret their fearless leader’s electoral landslide as incontrovertible proof of his popularity, as much as a mandate to implement the National People’s Power (NPP) manifesto with aplomb and despatch.

But it is best for ‘business as unusual’ to sound a warning note in the bell-like ear of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) stalwart who is now unequivocally Sri Lanka’s tenth Executive President.

All the noise from various parties has now faded, as Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is set to be sworn in as Sri Lanka’s 9th President, marking the change the public has long awaited. Personally, I’m not concerned with what others think; our responsibility remains to work for our children’s future, regardless of who is in power. Both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa allowed rogue elements from Pohottuwa into their ranks, leading to their downfall, while Namal Rajapaksa was a non-factor, as the results clearly showed.

Beneath this diabolic calmness on the surface, the economy is dangerously boiling, heating up gradually every moment without an internally built cooling mechanism and ready for eruption like a volcano

What is the economy which the new President has inherited from the outgoing President? On the surface, it is a more orderly economy compared with the chaos-filled one which Sri Lanka had about two and a half years ago. There are no long queues for essential consumer items like fuel, cooking gas, and basic food items. There are no curse-generating power cuts anymore. Foreign exchange is available to users – both consumers and producers – through banking channels. The foreign exchange black market is virtually non-existent. People are enjoying life travelling locally as well as overseas on holidays or pilgrimages

As per our view, at the upcoming policy meeting, there is an 80% probability for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to maintain rates at the current levels, allowing further strengthening of key economic indicators, say Dimantha Mathew and Anjali Mathews, analysts at First Capital Research.

In their report titled, “The Road ahead: Steering Interest rates in an uncertain economy’. They say, “There is, however, a 20% probability for CBSL to relax the policy rates, with a probability of 15% for a rate cut of 25bps and a lower level of 5% for 50bps rate cut in order to further reduce rates and government security yields to accelerate economic growth.

“Further, there is an 80% probability to keep SRR unchanged; while considering the improved liquidity levels in the system, we consider a 20% probability for a SRR hike of 100bps.”

*2024-09-22 21:00:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84762) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s ninth presidential election will be held  on Saturday the 21st of September. More than 17 million (17,140, 354)  Sri Lankans are registered as eligible voters. Nominally thirty-eight candidates are in the ring but only three are regarded as  te leading contenders. The hectic election campaigns ended on Sep 18 but election fever is high.  A large voter turn out is expected on election day.

It is indeed an irony that there is so much of enthusiasm  over the election of the executive president  despite the criticism directed against the executive presidential system in past  years. The executive presidency is blamed extensively on the one hand while the country gets involved in  presidential poll excitement on the other.
