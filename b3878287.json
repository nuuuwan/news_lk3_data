    "The French Development Agency\u2019s (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement also known as AFD) Regional Directorate is strengthening its base in Sri Lanka.",
    "This is in line with the commemoration of 75 years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and France. It also marks the enduring partnership between AFD Group and its Sri Lankan partners, which began in 2005 when supporting the post-tsunami reconstruction.",
    "AFD, which finances the public sector, NGOs, research and training, committed EUR 89 million to essential infrastructure impacted by the tsunami. AFD collaborated with key entities such as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), and the Road Development Authority (RDA). It has also collaborated on projects co-financed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB).",
    "In 2008, Proparco, which is the private sector financing arm of AFD Group, initiated its first partnership with a EUR 5 million credit line with LOLC. Expertise France, dedicated to providing technical assistance, designing and implementing projects that reinforce public policies over the long term, commenced its first project in Sri Lanka in 2023 with a EUR 5 million allocation from European Funds. Today, the entire AFD Group stands present and engaged in Sri Lanka.",
    "The AFD Group\u2019s portfolio now boasts over 30 projects, reflecting a commitment of EUR 708 million in loans, grants, and technical assistance dedicated to supporting Sri Lanka towards its sustainable development goals. The journey of AFD Group since 2005 has been captured in the form of a photo exhibition, curated to illustrate the various projects in which Sri Lanka and France have joined hands. It highlights the diversity of sectors and areas of intervention across the country and the strong relationships fostered through the years.",
    "In his speech at the event marking the now complete presence of AFD Group in Sri Lanka Ambassador of France Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pactet said: \u201cThe establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and France took place on 27 October 1948. Since early October of this year, the Embassy of France has launched a series of actions and events to mark the longevity of this strong relationship. Also for nearly 20 years, the French Development Agency has played a key role in consolidating relations between Sri Lanka and France. France is the fourth largest international public creditor in Sri Lanka with many development projects implemented by AFD and financed through concessional loans for the benefit of the Sri Lankan people. France is proud to have, on a bilateral basis, provided this support to Sri Lanka when it needed it.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe visit of the President of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to France in June 2023 and the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, to Sri Lanka in July 2023, illustrated the common interests of France and Sri Lanka and their common objectives, in particular those related to the agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals such as the preservation of the planet and improving social equality,\u201d he added.",
    "In his remarks, AFD Group in Sri Lanka Head Yazid Bensa\u00efd said: \u201cWe are proud to welcome Expertise France, a valuable addition made possible thanks to the support of the European Union Delegation in Sri Lanka. With Expertise France, AFD, and Proparco, France now provides a complete approach to sustainable development through AFD Group.\u201d",
    "\u201cLooking ahead, our objective is that the presence of all AFD Group entities is an asset for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery and the preservation of its territory. We aim indeed to focus on sustainable management and natural resources development, the transition to a low-carbon economy, improving people\u2019s access to essential services, and supporting the private sector\u2019s transition to a greener and more sustainable recovery,\u201d Bensa\u00efd added.",
    "Ministry of Finance Department of External Resources Additional Director General Visakha Amarasekara, along with over 30 officials and representatives from the private sector also attended the event and AFD Group photo exhibition.",
    "AFD Group contributes to the implementation of France\u2019s policies for sustainable development and international solidarity. The Group includes Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), which finances the public sector, NGOs, research and training; its subsidiary Proparco, which is dedicated to the private sector; and Expertise France, a technical cooperation agency. The Group finances, supports and accelerates the transitions needed for a fairer, more resilient world.",
    "\u201cWith our partners, we are building shared solutions with and for the people in more than 150 countries, as well as in 11 French Overseas Departments and Territories. As part of the commitment of France and the French people to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, our teams are at work on 4,200 projects in the field. Our objective is to reconcile economic development with the preservation of common goods, from peace, the climate and biodiversity to health, education and gender equality. Towards a world in common.\u201d"
