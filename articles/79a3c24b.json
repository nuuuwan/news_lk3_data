    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s upcoming bills on public-private partnerships (PPPs), state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and public asset management should be consistent with the Public Financial Management (PFM) law, the IMF said in its latest report.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF-backed Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), enacted in 2024, marks a significant reform aimed at strengthening fiscal discipline, transparency, and accountability in the management of public funds.",
    "\u201cThe Public Financial Management (PFM) reform agenda remains key to maintain fiscal discipline and curb risks,\u201d the IMF said in its latest report released along with the approval of the fourth review of the programme.",
    "\u201cAuthorities will adopt the implementing regulations of the PFM Act by end-December 2025,\u201d it said.",
    "\u201cUpcoming bills on public-private partnerships (PPPs), state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public asset management should be consistent with the PFM Act and best practices.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe new strategy on Sri Lankan Airlines should aim at restoring operational viability and resolving legacy debts. Stronger efforts are needed to ensure annual publication of audited financial statements of 52 major SOEs by end-June.\u201d",
    "The PFMA replaced the outdated financial regulations and introduced modern frameworks for budgeting, expenditure control, debt management, and reporting.",
    "It mandates medium-term fiscal planning, sets clear rules on the approval and execution of budgets, and emphasizes results-based spending. The PFMA enhances oversight by empowering Parliament and the Auditor General, while requiring ministries and agencies to adhere to performance benchmarks and submit timely, accurate financial data.",
    "The legislation was a key structural benchmark under Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF\u2019s bailout program, intended to reduce waste, prevent arrears accumulation, and restore public trust in state financial management following years of misgovernance and fiscal mismanagement. (Colombo/July 10/2025)"
