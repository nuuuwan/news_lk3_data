My mother was my first and the last teacher. If she’s looking down from heaven, I suspect she’s quietly pleased with how I’ve navigated this world. She taught me to revere Dr. Samuel Johnson, not just as an erudite Englishman and lexicographer, but as a philosopher who warned, “Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.” She also introduced me to Mrs. Malaprop, that delightfully misguided character from 18th-century theatre, who mangled words with misplaced confidence.

Thanks to my beloved mother, I developed an early aversion to linguistic misuse. Whether in Sinhala or English, the wrong word in the wrong place grates on my ears like a surgical blade drawn across bone and in Sri Lanka, where both languages are wielded by the “educated,” the misuse is rampant.

It was Marie Antoinette who, when the French rioted for bread, asked why not give them cake? It did not work for Marie but President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) seems a firm believer in her bag of tricks. She believed cake will work in place of bread despite the price, but does AKD?

Many of us in the Tamil Country were willing to forget that one of the JVP’s five lessons in 1971 was that we Tamils are intrinsicallly chauvinistic and a fifth column for India as Indian aircraft and helicopters straffed JVP positions in 1971.
