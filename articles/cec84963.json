    "Commenting on the prestigious award, Prematillake said: \u201cThe CPM Management Leadership Excellence Awards highlight the importance of strong, sustainable and visionary leadership in shaping the future of Sri Lanka\u2019s industries. I am deeply honoured by this recognition and remain committed to empowering our teams to drive innovation and sustainability, delivering solutions that not only support our organisation but also help address broader societal challenges. Hayleys Fentons provides the ideal platform to achieve this vision as a market leader guided by robust governance, a portfolio of eco-friendly solutions and a strong commitment to sustainable business practices.\u201d",
    "Prematillake spearheaded a remarkable transformation at Hayleys Fentons, steering the company from a Rs. 600 million loss and a negative equity of Rs. 1.4 billion in 2019 to achieving over Rs. 3 billion in profit and building an equity base exceeding Rs. 5 billion. Under his leadership, the company rose to rank among the top five performers within the Hayleys Group. Navigating through three major crises, the Easter attacks in 2019, the global pandemic in 2020, and Sri Lanka\u2019s economic turbulence in 2022, he implemented agile strategies that streamlined operations, enhanced cash flow, strengthened talent development, and ensured sustained profitability through strong financial stewardship and adaptability.",
    "Guided by Prematillake\u2019s sustainability-first vision, Hayleys Fentons has become a vanguard of renewable energy in Sri Lanka. Hayleys Solar, the company\u2019s flagship energy venture, now leads the market and is on track to become the first local company to achieve over 500 MW in installed capacity by the end of 2025, focusing on utility-scale solar and innovative solar solutions that enhance land productivity and sustainable agriculture. He has also led the company\u2019s successful bid for Sri Lanka\u2019s largest wind power plant, expanded regional operations and advanced battery storage and circular energy solutions through strategic partnerships and inclusive financing models.",
    "Addressing the journey ahead for Hayleys Fentons and its workforce, Prematillake stated: \u201cThe evolution of Hayleys Fentons from an EPC contractor to be the largest investor in renewable energy in Sri Lanka marks a defining milestone in our journey. This achievement has been made possible through the steadfast encouragement of the Chairman of Hayleys PLC, the Board of Directors, and the unwavering commitment of our people who have brought this vision to life.\u201d"
