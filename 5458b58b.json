    "LOS ANGELES (AFP): Immigration advocates sued the US Government last week arguing that conditioning asylum requests on the use of an app violates migrants\u2019 human rights, according to the legal action filed in federal court.",
    "The suit, the latest legal challenge to the Biden administration\u2019s immigration agenda, takes aim at the CBP (Customs and Border Protection) One app, which it says makes it impossible for many to seek asylum in the United States.",
    "\u201cCBP One essentially creates an electronic waitlist that restricts access to the US asylum process to a limited number of privileged migrants,\u201d notes the legal brief.",
    "It was filed in federal court in California on Thursday by the immigration organisations Al Otro Lado and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, along with 10 migrants who claim the application blocked their attempt to seek asylum.",
    "US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration launched CBP One in January as it wound down immigration rules enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "Migrants must use CBP One to schedule an appointment at a port of entry into the United States. But accessing the app requires a smartphone, internet access and electricity \u2013 all hard to access for migrants on long and dangerous journeys fleeing their home countries.",
    "Between January and June an estimated 170,000 people scheduled appointments through the app, authorities have said.",
    "Along with the difficulties in accessing it, the organisations behind the lawsuit also said in a statement that the app\u2019s discriminatory facial recognition technology has prevented many Black and darker-skinned immigrants from obtaining an appointment.",
    "The legal document states that by forcing migrants who have not made an appointment through the app to turn back at the border, the US Government is putting them in greater danger.",
    "\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s new turnback policy is just the latest manifestation of the US Government\u2019s multi-year effort to block access to asylum at the southern border,\u201d said Center for Gender and Refugee Studies Litigation Director Melissa Crow, representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
    "\u201cBy gatekeeping asylum behind an inaccessible smartphone app, the turnback policy violates our laws, makes a mockery of our asylum system, and leaves the most marginalised refugees behind,\u201d she added.",
    "The lawsuit is the latest legal challenge to Biden\u2019s immigration policies, which have focused on developing legal migration programs and alternatives in an attempt to lower illegal crossings.",
    "Last month the US Supreme Court upheld the federal Government\u2019s right to decide which undocumented migrants should be targeted for deportation, after the states of Texas and Louisiana challenged that policy."
