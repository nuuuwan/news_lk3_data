    "Singer Suzie Croner, who is now a popular figure in the entertainment scene, in her hometown of Zurich, in Switzerland, was in contact with The Island to elaborate on her plans when she travels to Australia later this month for \u2018Country Night\u2019 to be held in Melbourne on 26th October.",
    "Referring to last week\u2019s article \u2018More excitement for Sri Lankans in Melbourne\u2019, Suzi said that it\u2019s certainly going to be a happening scene on 26th October.",
    "\u201cI wasn\u2019t 100 percent fit when I last performed in Australia, and that was in October 2023.",
    "\u201cI fell sick and had a bad throat, but I still sang, and, jokingly, she added: \u201cPerhaps I would have sounded like those roosters crowing in the morning cock-a-doodle-doo!\u201d",
    "\u201cI was in bed for 11 days, but I did perform as I couldn\u2019t disappoint the crowd; the show had to go on.",
    "\u201cThis time, however, I\u2019m raring to go and I\u2019m going to give country music lovers something extra special and I want to see all my Sri Lankan friends, living in Melbourne, at The Grand On Princess on Saturday, 26th October.",
    "\u201cI guarantee it\u2019s going to be a show full of excitement\u2026and memories.",
    "\u201cI would also be performing to my own music and that would give me the freedom to do things my own way, to keep the crowd entertained.\u201d",
