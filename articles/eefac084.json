  "original_body_lines": [
    "Hurricane Milton churned across Florida on Thursday after plowing into the state as a Category 3 storm, bringing misery to a coast still ravaged by Helene, pounding cities with winds of over 100 mph (160 kph) after producing a barrage of tornadoes, but sparing Tampa a direct hit.",
    "The storm tracked to the south in the final hours and made landfall Wednesday night in Siesta Key near Sarasota, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Tampa. The situation in the Tampa area was still a major emergency as St. Petersburg recorded over 16 inches (41 centimeters) of rain, prompting the National Weather Service to warn of flash flooding there as well as other parts of western and central Florida.",
    "Tropicana Field, the home of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team in St. Petersburg, appeared badly damaged. The fabric that serves as the domed stadium\u2019s roof was ripped to shreds by the fierce winds. It was not immediately clear if there was damage inside. Multiple cranes were also toppled in the storm, the weather service said.",
    "St. Petersburg residents also could no longer get water from their household taps because a water main break led the city to shut down service.",
    "The storm knocked out power across a large section of Florida, with more than 3 million homes and businesses without power as of early Thursday, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports.",
    "Before Milton even made landfall, tornadoes were touching down across the state. The Spanish Lakes Country Club near Fort Pierce, on Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast, was hit particularly hard, with homes destroyed and some residents killed.",
    "\u201cWe have lost some life,\u201d St. Lucie County Sheriff Keith Pearson told WPBF News, though he wouldn\u2019t say how many people were killed.",
    "About 125 homes were destroyed before the hurricane came ashore, many of them mobile homes in communities for senior citizens, said Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.",
    "About 90 minutes after making landfall, Milton was downgraded to a Category 2 storm. By early Thursday, the hurricane was a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of about 85 mph (135 kph) as it moved offshore and was about 35 miles (55 kilometers) east of Orlando.",
    "Heavy rains were also likely to cause flooding inland along rivers and lakes as Milton traverses the Florida Peninsula as a hurricane, eventually to emerge in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday. It is expected to impact the heavily populated Orlando area.",
    "The storm slammed into a region still reeling two weeks after Hurricane Helene flooded streets and homes in western Florida and left at least 230 people dead across the South. In many places along the coast, municipalities raced to collect and dispose of debris before Milton\u2019s winds and storm surge could toss it around and compound any damage.",
    "Officials had issued dire warnings to flee or face grim odds of survival.",
    "\u201cThis is it, folks,\u201d said Cathie Perkins, emergency management director in Pinellas County, which sits on the peninsula that forms Tampa Bay. \u201cThose of you who were punched during Hurricane Helene, this is going to be a knockout. You need to get out, and you need to get out now.\u201d",
    "By late afternoon, some officials said the time had passed for such efforts, suggesting that people who stayed behind hunker down instead. By the evening, some counties announced they had suspended emergency services.",
    "Jackie Curnick said she wrestled with her decision to stay aat home in Sarasota, just north of where the storm made landfall. But with a 2-year-old son and a baby girl due Oct. 29, Curnick and her husband thought it was for the best.",
    "Curnick said they started packing Monday to evacuate, but they couldn\u2019t find any available hotel rooms, and the few they came by were too expensive.",
    "She said there were too many unanswered questions if they got in the car and left: Where to sleep, if they\u2019d be able to fill up their gas tank, and if they could even find a safe route out of the state.",
    "\u201cThe thing is it\u2019s so difficult to evacuate in a peninsula,\u201d she said. \u201cIn most other states, you can go in any direction to get out. In Florida there are only so many roads that take you north or south.\u201d",
    "At a news conference in Tallahassee, Gov. Ron DeSantis described deployment of a wide range of resources, including 9,000 National Guard members from Florida and other states; over 50,000 utility workers from as far as California; and highway patrol cars with sirens to escort gasoline tankers to replenish supplies so people could fill up their tanks before evacuating.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, there will be fatalities. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way around that,\u201d DeSantis said.",
    "Heavy rain and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida starting Wednesday morning, with conditions deteriorating throughout the day. Six to 12 inches (15 to 31 centimeters) of rain, with up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) in some places, was expected well inland, bringing the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
    "One twister touched down Wednesday morning in the lightly populated Everglades and crossed Interstate 75. Another apparent tornado touched down in Fort Myers, snapping tree limbs and tearing a gas station\u2019s canopy to shreds.",
    "Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders across 15 Florida counties with a total population of about 7.2 million people. Officials warned that anyone staying behind must fend for themselves, because first responders were not expected to risk their lives attempting rescues at the height of the storm.",
    "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch told residents to expect long power outages and the possible shutdown of the sewer system.",
    "In Charlotte Harbor, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Tampa, clouds swirled and winds gusted as Josh Parks packed his Kia sedan with clothes and other belongings. Two weeks ago, Helene\u2019s surge brought about 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water to the neighborhood, and its streets remain filled with waterlogged furniture, torn-out drywall and other debris.",
    "Parks, an auto technician, planned to flee to his daughter\u2019s home inland and said his roommate already left.",
    "By early afternoon, airlines had canceled about 1,900 flights. SeaWorld was closed all day Wednesday, and Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando shut down in the afternoon.",
    "More than 60% of gas stations in Tampa and St. Petersburg were out of gas Wednesday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. DeSantis said the state\u2019s overall supply was fine, and highway patrol officers were escorting tanker trucks to replenish the supply.",
    "In the Tampa Bay area\u2019s Gulfport, Christian Burke and his mother stayed put in their three-story concrete home overlooking the bay. Burke said his father designed this home with a Category 5 in mind \u2014 and now they\u2019re going to test it.",
    "As a passing police vehicle blared encouragement to evacuate, Burke acknowledged staying isn\u2019t a good idea and said he\u2019s \u201cnot laughing at this storm one bit.\u201d"
