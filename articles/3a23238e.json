    "Sri Lanka's digital revolution is in full swing, with mobile phone penetration exceeding 150% and internet usage skyrocketing to 52%. However, the nation's marketers are lagging behind, with a meager 21% of marketing budgets allocated to digital channels, according to State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath.",
    "Speaking at the Chartered Institute of Marketing's (CIM) CXO conference in Colombo, Herath delivered a stark call to action, urging marketers to embrace the digital wave or risk being swept away. \"Our people are getting digitally savvy,\" he declared, highlighting the growing adoption of social media and e-commerce across Sri Lanka. \"But are we there digitally as marketers?\"",
    "Herath's data paints a clear picture: Sri Lanka's marketing landscape remains heavily skewed towards traditional channels, with a staggering 79% of budgets still devoted to print, television, and outdoor advertising. This gap, he warned, is hindering Sri Lankan businesses from reaching their full potential in the global marketplace.",
    "\"The world has gone digital,\" Herath emphasized. \"Digital marketing is no longer just a fad; it's the new reality. We need to make a paradigm shift, and we need to do it now.\"",
    "The Minister's call to action comes amidst a broader vision for Sri Lanka's digital transformation. He outlined the government's ambitious DIGIECON 2030 plan, which aims to propel the island nation's digital economy to $15 billion by 2030, up from $4.3 billion in 2023.",
    "DIGIECON 2030 rests on six key pillars, including nationwide broadband access, a skilled digital workforce, secure digital government services, robust cybersecurity measures, support for small businesses and digital payments, and data-driven agriculture and tourism.",
    "However, realizing this ambitious vision requires a skilled workforce equipped to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape. Here, Herath turned to CIM, urging the institute to collaborate with the ICT industry to equip Sri Lankan youth with the necessary digital marketing skills.",
    "\"Digital has permeated every facet of marketing,\" he stated, \"demanding a level of diversification in skills unlike anything the profession has seen before.\" He pointed out that many marketers still lack the expertise to keep pace with the latest digital trends and tools, hindering their ability to effectively reach and engage consumers in the online space.",
    "Sri Lanka's digital future is bright, but it hinges on a critical shift in mindset and strategy. As Minister Herath aptly noted, \"Vision without action is just a dream.\" It is now up to Sri Lankan marketers to translate their vision into reality, embracing the digital wave and propelling the nation's businesses to the forefront of the global marketplace."
