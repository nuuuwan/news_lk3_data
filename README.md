🟩

It is wrong to think that if he wins the presidential election, you can win every election in the next election. Former parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne said that this is not to choose the leadership faculty of whom to send parliament after the election results were released.

He further stated at a press conference held at the United People's Power Office in Colombo on Friday (11).

Most of the people are in the position that if they win the presidential election, the general election and the provincial council election can be won. This is a completely wrong position. The party that seizes the most seats in Parliament will rule. The majority of the parliament should be implemented to implement the budget.

We hope that such a government can be formed by the United People's Alliance. In democratic countries, the president is elected from a party and a prime minister's party. This is often taken in the United States. Some parties tell the party to vote. Not talking about optional.
