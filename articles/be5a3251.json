    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Presidential candidates Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa led in voting preferences for August 2024, though with small declines for both, with a rise in support observed for President Ranil Wickremesinghe from March through August, according to an independent study, which also found that no candidate is likely to poll close to 50 percent.",
    "The Institute for Health Policy (IHP)\u2019s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) MRP provisional estimates of presidential",
    "election voting intent for August 2024 show Dissanayake and Premadasa led in voting preferences of all adults ahead of the September election.",
    "The IHP said in a statement on Wednesday September 11 that none of the four major party presidential candidates had support of a majority of the adult voters. Dissanayake led with 36 percent of all adults, followed by Premadasa with 32 percent, President Wickremesinghe with 28 percent and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)\u2019s Namal Rajapaksa with 3 percent. Estimates are associated with margins of error of 3\u20137 percent.",
    "Support for Ranil Wickremesinghe has been rising from March through August 2024, while there have been small declines in support for Dissanayake, Premadasa, and the SLPP during the same period, the institute said.",
    "IHP Executive Director Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya was quoted as saying on the narrow race: \u201cOur August polling indicates a tightening race in which no candidate will get close to half the vote on the first count. While this indicates that no candidate has succeeded in exciting a majority of voters, it also means that it is increasingly likely that the 2024 election will be the first",
    "presidential poll decided on a count of second and third preferences. We urge civil society and the Elections Commission to intensify efforts to educate voters about using their preferences to ensure that every vote counts.\u201d",
    "Analysis of the MRP model estimates for August reveal differences in the support base for each candidate. Support for Dissanayake was strongest among the youth, with a majority (53 percent) supporting him, and among Sinhala voters (42 percent). The most affluent third of voters (38 percent) supported both Dissanayake and Wickremesinghe. In contrast,",
    "Premadasa led among the poorest third of voters (40percent). More than half of Sri Lankan Tamils (55 percent) and Estate/ Indian Tamils (53 percent) supported Premadasa, while two-thirds of Muslims (71 percent) backed him. Wickremesinghe\u2019s support increased with age, reaching 43 percent among those aged 60 years and older.",
    "Dissanayake led in all provinces except the Northern and Eastern, where he trailed in third place behind Premadasa and Wickremesinghe, the statement said. Both Dissanayake and Wickremesinghe drew a large part of their support from former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s 2019 voters, with only one in eight of these voters backing Premadasa.",
    "According to the institute, further analysis of voting intent based on public opinion about the Aragalaya shows that adults with favourable views of the Aragalaya were more likely to support Dissanayake than those with an unfavourable view (37 percent versus 27 percent) in August. In contrast, President Wickremesinghe and Namal Rajapaksa did better amongst those with a negative view of the Aragalaya, whilst Premadasa did equally well in both groups.",
    "A comparable but weaker relationship was seen in relation to voters\u2019 views about whether the rich-poor gap in the country is a good or bad thing. Dissanayake did 3 points better in those who thought the gap was bad versus those who thought it was good, whilst Wickremesinghe did 4 points worse.",
    "\u201cOur polling indicates that overwhelming majorities of Sri Lankans have a favourable view of the Aragalaya and think that the poor-rich gap has been increasing in Sri Lanka and that this is bad. But it\u2019s surprising that none of the leading candidates have been able to effectively tap into these sentiments with a winning message,\u201d Dr Rannan-Eliya was quoted as saying.",
    "\u201cThese estimates use the IHP SLOTS Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) model (01/2024 revision). This update is for all adults and uses data from 19,721 interviews conducted from 1 October 2021 to 2 September 2024, including 1,153 interviews during August 2024. One hundred bootstraps were run to capture model uncertainty, with margins of error assessed at 1\u20137% for August. IHP has expanded its interview numbers in the weeks leading to the Presidential Election to provide better estimates,\u201d the institute said.",
    "\u201cIHP\u2019s SLOTS MRP methodology first estimates the relationship between a wide variety of characteristics about respondents and their opinions \u2013 in this case, \u2018If there was a Presidential Election today, who would you vote for?\u2019\u2013 in a multilevel statistical model that also smooths month to month changes. It then uses a large data file calibrated to the national population to predict voting intent in each month since October 2021, based on what the multilevel model indicates about their probability of voting for various parties (\u2018post-stratification\u2019) at each point in time. The multilevel model was estimated 100 times to reflect underlying uncertainties in the model and to obtain margins of error. The voting intent results for previous months have changed in this update as more data were collected after the last release and these changes are within the margin of error.\u201d (Colombo/Sep12/2024)"
