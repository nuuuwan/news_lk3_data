    "Postmaster General Ruwan Sathkumara says that steps have been taken to introduce fingerprint machines for marking attendance at the Colombo Central Mail Exchange.\u00a0He says the machines have been installed across all departments, and future overtime calculations will be based on data recorded through the system.Fingerprint machines have already been set up in all administrative offices, while arrangements are underway to extend the system to all provincial offices and post offices nationwide.The initiative follows recommendations made in the Auditor General\u2019s audit reports.However, several postal trade unions recently launched a strike opposing the installation of fingerprint machines at the Central Mail Exchange and citing other related concerns."
