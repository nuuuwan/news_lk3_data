    "From right: Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody, Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku, CPC Chairman Janaka Rajakaruna, and Managing Director Dr. Mayura Neththikumarage",
    "Phase one of expanding bunkering capacity begins operations at Colombo Port South Jetty",
    "Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody says Govt. addressing longstanding bottlenecks",
    "The Energy Ministry yesterday said that it has expanded bunkering capacity at the Colombo Port South Jetty with the launch of new pipelines and fuelling facilities. The initiative, a joint project of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd., (PSTL), marks the first phase of a plan to upgrade petroleum storage, distribution, and bunkering operations.",
    "The lack of adequate pipelines and berths had restricted the ship fuel supply at the Port. To address the bottleneck, PSTL developed new pipelines and a bunkering facility at the Colombo Port South Jetty, allowing the CPC to commence operations through a private company for the first time.",
    "PSTL operates the Common User Facility, which manages the CPC\u2019s storage and distribution network, including the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela installations, bulk depots across the island, and port bunkering operations.",
    "Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody speaking at the launch said: \u201cUntil now, bunkering at Colombo Port was limited to the State-controlled Jaya Container Terminal, which also handled petroleum unloading. That dual use caused delays and restrictions. With the new bunkering infrastructure now in place, we have been able to deliver the first fuel supply more efficiently. This is an important step in improving bunkering and in positioning Colombo Port as a maritime hub for the region.\u201d",
    "He added that the CPC, PSTL, the Ports Authority, and the Civil Aviation Ministry would coordinate on implementation, calling the program significant for development and national targets.",
    "Also attending the event were Ports and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku, CPC Chairman Janaka Rajakaruna, CPC Managing Director Dr. Mayura Neththikumarage, and senior officials of both the CPC and PSTL."
