ECONOMYNEXT – Five Malaysian Universities have arrived in Sri Lanka to promote their courses and target the island nation’s students for degrees and other higher education qualifications.

Sri Lanka is in the top 10 countries with the highest applications to study in Malaysia, based on the latest data from Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS), a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLBG) under the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.

After an unprecedented economic and foreign exchange crisis in 2022, Sri Lanka has been considering becoming a regional hub for education in order to cut foreign exchange outflow of the country as more students go abroad for higher education.

Sri Lanka banned dollar payments in mid-2022 to contain the dollar outflows from the country after it faced a severe shortage of forex following the rupee being floated in March 2022.

Sri Lanka has been spending around $3 billion for those who spend for education from foreign countries.

Produced by Newton Cinema of India and presented by Mani Ratnam’s Madras Talkies, this multilingual film starring Malayali, Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala cast has already won several foreign accolades. Under the existing fascist persecuting laws on art in Sri Lanka, this work was not censored like one of the Vithanage’s earlier films Purahanda Kaluwara (Death on a Full Moon Day, 1997) only because of these international tributes. Indeed, this is a fascinating, absorbing and tendentious film that makes the connoisseur rethink about his own opinions. It marks a qualitative perfection in the director’s evolution as a filmmaker. It also stimulates fellow artists to become more conscious towards the global socio-political reality.
