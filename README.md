எதிர்வரும் பண்டிகை காலத்தில் பெரிய வெங்காயத்தின் விலையை குறைக்கும் வகையில் கட்டுப்பாட்டு விலையை நிர்ணயிக்க நடவடிக்கை எடுப்பட்டுள்ளது.

பண்டிகை காலத்தில் மக்களுக்கு அத்தியாவசிய பொருட்களை வழங்குவது தொடர்பில் அத்தியாவசிய பொருட்கள்  இறக்குமதியாளர்களுக்கும் வர்த்தக அமைச்சருக்கும் இடையில் கலந்துரையாடல் ஒன்று  நேற்று வியாழக்கிழமை (14) நடைபெற்றது.

### தேர்தல்களை பிற்போடக்கூடாது - நாடாளுமன்ற தேர்தலையே முதலில் நடத்தவேண்டும் - பசில்

*2024-03-15 10:09:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178772) · `ta`

தற்போது ஆட்சியி;ல் உள்ளது ஸ்ரீலங்கா பொதுஜனபெரமுன அரசாங்கம் என தெரிவிக்கப்படுகின்ற போதிலும் அரசாங்கம் உண்மையில் பொதுஜனபெரமுனவின் கீழ் செயற்படுகின்றதா எனவும் அவர் கேள்வி எழுப்பியுள்ளார்.

ஒருசில அமைச்சர்களே ஸ்ரீலங்கா பொதுஜனபெரமுனவின் அலுவலகத்திற்கு   செல்கின்றனர் முன்னர் ஸ்ரீலங்க பொதுஜனபெரமுனவின் காணப்பட்ட கெஹெலிய ரம்புக்வெல தற்போது அமைச்சர் பதவியை வகிக்கவில்லை எனவும் பசில் ராஜபக்ச தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

வேறு எந்த தேர்தலிற்கு முன்பாகவும் நாடாளுமன்ற தேர்தலை நடத்தவேண்டும் என பசில்ராஜபக்ச வேண்டுகோள் விடுத்துள்ளார்.

ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலிற்கு பின்னர் நாடாளுமன்ற தேர்தலை நடத்தினால் அதுமக்களின் உண்மையான விருப்பத்தை வெளிப்படுத்தாது ஒரு வாக்கினால் ஒருவர் ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் வெற்றிபெற்றால் அவரது கட்சியே அதிகாரத்தை கைப்பற்றும் என பசில்ராஜபக்ச தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

### President hints at vehicle import resumption; importers warn of possible cost increase

*2024-03-15 07:08:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/President-hints-at-vehicle-import-resumption-importers-warn-of-possible-cost-increase/108-278885) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday hinted at a possible gradual resumption of private vehicle imports starting next year. However, local vehicle importers have warned that this development may not necessarily translate into positive news for buyers.

While the relaxation could breathe new life into the stagnant motor sector, importers have expressed concerns that duty structures for imported vehicles may see a significant increase.

In January, the government revised the duty structure, resulting in a significant rise in vehicle import costs. Despite the potential allowance for vehicle imports, importers caution that substantial restrictions may remain, implying it is too early to celebrate the statement made by the President.

The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka’s survey indicates that local market prices are poised to climb alongside the resumption of imports.

The US government is seeking more information on the revised plans for the expedition, which is scheduled to go ahead in May, Kent Porter, an assistant US attorney, told a federal judge in Virginia on Wednesday

*2024-03-15 06:10:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Questions-to-those-questioning-Sri-Lanka-s-IMF-program/4-759512) · `en`

There has been a lot of criticism about Sri Lanka’s 17th IMF program from people of various backgrounds. They have made all kinds of accusations against the IMF program and criticised it. I agree that the IMF program is not the perfect solution. But the question is, what is the alternative? I am yet to see anyone who has offered a sensible alternative to the IMF.

Sri Lanka’s debt is a staggering 128% of GDP and half of it is external debt which is in foreign currency. Sri Lanka could not have repaid its debt if it had not defaulted. The debt has to be restructured. The bilateral creditors and the international sovereign bondholders may not have agreed to restructure Sri Lanka’s debt without the IMF. People may point out that Argentina restructured parts of its external debt in 2005 and 2010 without an IMF program. But these are exceptions and nearly a decade later in 2018, Argentina was back again on an IMF program.

### Appointment of a tax ombudsman: The time is apt

*2024-03-15 06:05:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Appointment-of-a-tax-ombudsman-The-time-is-apt/4-759511) · `en`

Due to the current economic environment, it is understood that tax revenue collection should be enhanced to increase the Tax to GDP ratio. However, the Government should take precaution to ensure this endeavour to enhance tax revenue does not lead to harassment or unfairness to the taxpayer.

There are many knowledgeable tax officers who understand both sides of the fence and act professionally by respecting the Rule of Law and the Taxpayer Rights. However, due to heightened pressure from the Ministry of Finance and Parliamentary Committees one could lose track of respecting the rights of the other party. What is the recourse available to a taxpayer if tax officers transgress the Rule of Law to exercise their power without respecting the legal rights of the taxpayer?

### CCC urges collaborative approach to address parate suspension concerns

*2024-03-15 06:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/CCC-urges-collaborative-approach-to-address-parate-suspension-concerns/108-278884) · `en`

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) yesterday expressed “deep concerns” about the government’s move to suspend parate execution, and called for a collaborative solution to address this growing issue.

The CCC stated that while it understands that certain businesses, essentially in the SME sector need to be supported in the current economic climate, providing that support in the form of curtailing credit recovery measures is not necessarily the best method of supporting these industries.

“The Chamber is concerned about the potential impact on the overall financial market as a result of the cancellation of the parate execution law,” it said in a statement to the media.

### What does it mean to revive planning?

We cannot generate a more critical concept of planning until we take seriously the conflict of interests and ideologies that will inevitably shape any possible recovery for Sri Lanka today

Despite claims of a ‘free market’, the leverage that these actors have over much of the global supply chain means that large swathes of the market are in fact held under a kind of private dictatorship. Accordingly, the question is not whether to plan. Instead, we must ask whether we prefer a form of planning that works in a democratic way with an explicit understanding of the public good, versus one that does not

### Revitalising Sri Lanka through Social Solidarity Economy

By embracing the principles of the SSE, the nation can chart a course towards a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future

As Sri Lanka grapples with a severe economic crisis, the need for a transformative economic model has never been more apparent. Decades of neoliberal policies since 1977 have left the nation facing rising inequality and vulnerability to global economic shifts. Previous experiments with socialist policies encountered challenges, stifling innovation and individual entrepreneurship. It’s time for a paradigm shift, and the Social Solidarity Economy (SSE) emerges as a beacon of hope for a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future.

### Wages of sin latest addition to never ending fiascos at CBSL

*2024-03-15 05:45:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Wages-of-sin-latest-addition-to-never-ending-fiascos-at-CBSL/4-759507) · `en`

It is difficult to find another instance in the history of central banking where the head of that bank with conscienceless audacity abused the constitutional independence of that institution to raise unilaterally the wages of his staff to such a height, between 36 and 79%, and made them an un-imitable elite of officers to be envied by the rest of the community of public servants. This is one of many and multiplying horror stories one hears almost daily from paradise Sri Lanka.

At a time when millions of hard-working heads of ordinary families and parents are found skipping meals or eating smaller portions to feed their children, when 30% of five-year-old children are found malnourished, and when the danger of starvation is knocking at the doors of the poorest, the unconscionable act of munificence by the big chief Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe (NW) fits into the proverbial robbery of Peter to pay Paul. The Central Bank’s notoriety continues unabated.

It was reported that the Commissioner General Sepalika Chandrasekara has said that about 1,000 companies have been issued notice by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to pay up their tax arrears amounting to more than Rs. 160 billion in six months or face seizure of bank accounts and property.

I would like to know from the Commissioner how feasible it is to execute the above decision, if the company resorts to or is faced with any one or more of the following situations:

1. If the bank balance of the company is very low/nil and not substantial enough to recover the tax arrears, or if the money is totally withdrawn before the account is blocked.

2. If the company has taken a huge overdraft and thereby already indebted to the bank

3. If the property has been already mortgaged requiring parate execution

4. If the company deliberately goes into bankruptcy and declares so before seizure by IRD

### Ogilvy Sri Lanka and Women in Need unveil ‘Masterpiece of Abuse’ art installation

Ground-breaking initiative uses local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women to mark International Women’s Day

In a poignant tribute, Ogilvy Sri Lanka, in partnership with Women in Need (WIN), revealed ‘Masterpiece of Abuse’, an art installation, designed to raise awareness and support for survivors of abuse on International Women’s Day.

Crafted from local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women, this forsaken art serves as a powerful symbol of the harsh realities faced by women. It stands in stark contrast to the celebratory and empowering messages that often dominate media platforms exclusively on Women’s Day.

The installation captures the essence of the pervasive issue of abuse experienced by women across the island. By depicting the harsh realities of survivors, it seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked struggles that persist, urging society to confront this pressing issue head-on.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement yesterday expressed its deep concern over the increasing number of vacancies in the Superior Courts, which has now reached a critical point that significantly hampers the functionality and the integrity of the justice system.

The statement issued by BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne PC and Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi also said the following.

The recent retirement of a judge of the Supreme Court has further exacerbated the situation by creating an additional vacancy in the Supreme Court. This comes at a time when there is already an ongoing impasse between the Constitutional Council and the Executive over the appointment to fill an existing vacancy within the same court. The delay in resolving these appointments is not only undermining the efficiency of our appellate courts but also eroding public confidence in the legal system›s ability to deliver timely justice.

We are in an era where we have to make a struggle to live, study, find food, retain jobs and stand up for what’s right. For this we must ensure that our loved ones engaged in the struggle to live and prosper emerge as victors.

But there can be people out there who dedicate some time from their lives to defeat evil. There are citizens of this country who would want to defeat this ‘unelected’ regime; where its present president came to power not through the vote of the citizens, but from support inside the parliament. There are citizens in this nation who’d want to change this regime and install a new one after an election. And those who contribute to that change might not even stand in public with the winners, but prefer to play watchdog because ‘power’ has the potential to corrupt lawmakers.

### Gaza famine: Food aid before the slaughter

Displaced Palestinians gather to collect food donated by a charity before an iftar meal, the breaking of the fast, on the first day of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan in Rafah. AFP

Just as the people sentenced to death are fed their best meal before they are executed, the Gaza Strip’s people, in the midst of a deadly famine, are being fed meals sent by the United States before they are slaughtered by Israel. Whatever is sent is not the best. But taste is not an option when survival is at stake.

The United States is completing a pier in the seas off the Gaza coast to send much-denied food aid. Its genocide-committing ally, Israel, also says it is trying to “flood” Gaza with aid, unable to withstand mounting international pressure, including some harsh criticism from its hardcore allies. Among them is the European Union, which stands by Israel and stomachs its war crimes with a high tolerance bar that is not seen in its human rights witch hunt against countries like Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka may consider hangwomen if execution starts: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka may consider hangwomen for executioner posts for the first time in its history if capital punishment is resumed in future instead of current hangmen who have no work at all, State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne said.

Sri Lanka hired two hangmen in July 2019 for executions in the country that has never seen penalty in 44 years. The hangmen, who are near their 40 years with a basic monthly salary of Rs. 24,250 ($80), have yet to be trained for execution because Sri Lanka has not seen any.

“I don’t see any reason why a woman can’t be in that position. But since it’s not in the practice, that question has not come to us. But, one day if we start this execution and it comes to the ministry, we would consider it as long as the woman is fit and even we do consider they are fit,” Jayaratne told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Thursday (14).

### Sri Lanka look to bounce back in second ODI

Mar. 14 - Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will clash in the second One Day International (ODI) at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, tomorrow.

The visitors would aim to square the series 1-1 after losing the opener by six wickets on Wednesday at the same venue.

Bangladesh chased down their target of 256 runs successfully in the first ODI with Skipper Najmul Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them home.

It remains to be seen if the series goes into the decider as Sri Lanka will be determined to bounce back.

Defending a subpar target of 256, Sri Lanka did well to reduce Bangladesh to 23 for three but then a pair of partnerships - first between Shanto and Mahmudullah and then Shanto and Mushfiqur - took the game away from the visitors.

They were assisted by the fact that their bowlers had earlier done extremely well to reel the Lankans in after a fast start and eventually bowl them out inside 49 overs.
