    "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stated that his country is willing to share its scientific and technical skills with Sri Lanka.",
    "President Raisi praised the two nations\u2019 cordial and expanding relations during a meeting with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on Sunday in Tehran.",
    "Speaking of Iran\u2019s \u201cremarkable progress\u201d in the fields of technology and science despite Western sanctions, Raisi expressed that Iran was prepared to share its capabilities \u201cwith friendly nations, such as Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "He emphasized Sri Lanka\u2019s immense development potential, adding that global states may flourish and expand without \u201ccolonial and self-interested foreign interference.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Minister lauded Iran for making significant progress in several domains despite international sanctions, touching on the \u201cconstructive activities\u201d of Iranian companies in the country, and further pointing out that Colombo is excited to work on the promotion of financial, technological, and medical cooperation with Tehran.",
    "Sabry called his country the entrance to East Asia in a meeting with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday, stating, \u201cI invite Iranian companies to pay attention to Sri Lanka,\u201d explaining that Asia will account for two-thirds of future growth.\u00a0 Sabry also encouraged Iranian enterprises to invest in the country.",
    "In July, a report published by writer Giancarlo Elia Valori for Modern Diplomacy detailed the means by which Iran has thrived despite sanctions through various strategies and mechanisms of State intervention and non-intervention.",
    "The Iranian government has actively sought to ease the effects of sanctions on its knowledge-based industries through the implementation of various innovative financial mechanisms. For instance, in 2018, the National Innovation Fund underwent major changes, evolving from a quasi-banking institution to a financial regulator with the aim of facilitating the transfer of crucial funds to knowledge-based companies.",
    "Valori says that Iranian policies have evolved in three distinct stages: the first, spanning from 1990-2000, mainly focused on the development of higher education and an increase in the number of academic works; the second, from 2000-2010, focused on support for emerging technologies; and the present one is characterized by a shift towards science, technology, and innovation."
