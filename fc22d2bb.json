    "The Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara urges the students sitting for the upcoming\u00a02023 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination to pay heed to a minor change made in the timetable.",
    "Commenting further regarding the matter, Mr. Jayasundara explained that the Department of Examinations had to make a few changes to the A/L examination timetable since the Korean Language was added as a new subject.",
    "Therefore, all exam applicants are advised not to use the previous exam timetable, he said, pointing out that some websites may display this schedule incorrectly.",
    "He also said that the amended timetable is indicated in the examination admission card provided to the applicants, for their convenience.",
    "\u201cSo there is no need to go to any other source of information. There is a separate section on your admission paper. In that section, the date and time slots for each subject, the subject number and the medium [of instruction] have been mentioned. That is enough. You don\u2019t need to search for anything else about the timetable\u201d, he added.",
    "Meanwhile, the Exams Commissioner General assured that a special program is being implemented to arrange alternative examination centres for the candidates sitting for the exam in disaster-prone areas, while giving priority to Anuradhapura, Kekirawa, Polonnaruwa, Passara, Ampara, Batticaloa and Hasalaka.",
    "He further informed the students to seek assistance by contacting the nearest Zonal Education Office or the Disaster Management Units to reach the examination centres if they are experiencing any difficulties in arriving on time due to the prevailing inclement weather."
