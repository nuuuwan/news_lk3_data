### Car bomb kills 10 in Pakistan after militants trigger shootout with troops

A powerful car bomb killed 10 people in Pakistan after exploding outside the paramilitary security forces’ headquarters.

Before detonating their vehicle in the southwestern city of Quetta, six attackers who were inside the car stepped outside and engaged troops in an intense shootout, police said.

People living in the area said the blast was so powerful it was heard from miles away.

Dozens were also wounded and taken to hospital after ambulances rushed to the site in front of the Frontier Constabulary.

No group immediately claimed responsibility, though suspicion will fall on separatist groups that often target civilians and security forces in insurgency-plagued Balochistan, where Quetta is the provincial capital.

Provincial health minister Bakhat Kakar said there were fears the number of people killed could rise.

Local television channels and CCTV footage from the site of the explosion shows a car stopping in front of the gate of the paramilitary compound.

A Chinese national has been convicted of playing a key role in what is believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world, worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn).

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court, London of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.

Between 2014 and 2017, she led a large-scale scam in China by cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

The Met said the 47-year-old’s guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web.

A total of 61,000 bitcoins were seized from Qian, the Met said.

The police said the probe began in 2018 after they got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets.

Qian had been “evading justice” for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met’s investigation.

Trends such as growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing curbs on visas are pushing US firms to redraw labour strategies, with global capability centres in India emerging as resilient hubs blending global skills with strong domestic leadership.

COLOMBO (News 1st); Quoting the timeless words of the Buddha, once echoed by former Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene at the 1951 San Francisco Peace Conference, Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba hailed Sri Lanka’s role in shaping Japan’s post-war future.

He noted that Jayewardene’s call for compassion—“Hatred ceases not by hatred, but by love”—paved the way for Japan’s reintegration into the global community and laid the foundation for its prosperity today.

Prime Minister Ishiba emphasized that Japan and Sri Lanka, as long-standing friends and democracies in Asia, share fundamental values and a vision for mutual growth.

He expressed his commitment to deepening cooperation under the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” framework and further strengthening the Comprehensive Partnership between the two nations.
