### New chapter for Sri Lanka: We cannot give something out of nothing

*2024-12-02 01:59:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-chapter-for-Sri-Lanka-We-cannot-give-something-out-of-nothing/4-769957) · `en`

The railways, historically designed for goods transport, must be reimagined to meet modern needs economically

The nation spoke and a new Government was elected. Now it’s time to unite and work collectively to pull ourselves out of the economic crisis we face. But in doing this, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. While rooting out corruption is critical, it is not the sole solution to achieving prosperity. To truly transform the country, we must prioritise efficiency and overhaul the sluggish State mechanism, reorganising the way in which it runs.

Let’s take Sri Lanka Railways for example. Each year, the State pumps approximately Rs. 57 billion into the railway system in 2024, while its annual revenue from ticket sales is only a mere Rs. 12 billion. A staggering Rs. 45 billion was lost to the State due to inefficiency.

The Central Bank forecasts the headline inflation to remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, but expects it to turn positive thereafter and gradually align with the targeted level of 5% over the medium term, aided by appropriate policy measures.

Attributing larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices to the current negative headline inflation, the Central Bank, however, is keeping its eye on upside and downside risks to inflation projections in the near to medium term.

The Bank says possible upward pressures on the headline inflation could stem from six factors; namely:

Possible upward pressures on global food and energy prices amidst geopolitical uncertainty

Possible sticky global inflation due to the policy changes in the USA And in relation to downside risks to inflation projections, the Bank cites two key reasons among others, namely.

Amid these transformative efforts, a thought-provoking question emerged on social media recently: Should Sri Lanka retain the traditional eight-hour workday or explore a shorter six-hour workday? This debate touches on broader concerns about labour productivity and its critical role in driving economic growth.

Labour productivity is a fundamental driver of economic progress, directly influencing GDP growth and national prosperity. According to the Solow Growth Model of Economics, long-term economic growth is fuelled by labour growth, capital accumulation, and technological advancements.

### Child’s guide to Central Bank’s new monetary policy instrument: Overnight Policy Rate

*2024-12-02 00:15:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Child-s-guide-to-Central-Bank-s-new-monetary-policy-instrument-Overnight-Policy-Rate/4-769937) · `en`

When the policy rate of the Central Bank is reduced, the banks immediately cut the deposit rates meaning that they are downward flexible

Since REPO bids should be below OPR and Reverse-REPO bids should be above OPR, they are synonymous with SDFR and SLFR, respectively. Since they should be around OPR, the earlier announced SDFR and SLFR become irrelevant. Also, commercial banks should fix their call rates around OPR. That is how call rates are manipulated by the Central Bank through rules and OPR practices

Recent Presidential and Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka reveal a clear and growing trend: a significant portion of the electorate now comprises “floating voters.” These voters are characterised by their willingness to change political loyalties frequently, driven by a quest for the most suitable solutions to the nation’s issues. Unlike a party’s core supporters, their allegiance is not fixed, and they are open to shifting their vote based on the performance and vision of the political parties at any given time.

The manifesto of the NPP should essentially be the basis for preparing the strategic plan, as it is the document that formed a social contract between the NPP and the people of the country at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections

A publicly available, regularly monitored and updated strategic plan, where achieved outcomes or reasons for not meeting outcomes are truthfully told to the public, will change the mirage mentality to one of reality. Stating the truth however is paramount to make this happen as politically convenient untruths will be of no benefit to the people and the country and the strategic planning exercise will be a waste of time
