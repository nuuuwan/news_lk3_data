    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) has confirmed that all recent political appointments made by the Government were submitted to the ECSL for approval, in line with directives for appointments and transfers during the pre-election period.",
    "ECSL Chairperson R.M.L. Ratnayake emphasised that the commission oversees all appointments during this sensitive time. \u201cNo appointments can be made without the approval of the ECSL. Any appointment is only confirmed after ECSL approval,\u201d Ratnayake said, assuring that the Commission is aware of each appointment.",
    "The clarification comes in response to concerns raised on social media regarding the Government\u2019s continued appointments despite the election period. According to Ratnayake, the ECSL\u2019s guidelines permit appointments to essential positions even during this time.",
    "He also clarified that non-political appointments to key positions can be made based on service necessity, ensuring that crucial roles are filled without compromising the integrity of the pre-election process."
