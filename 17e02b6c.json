    "The first six months of the year marked improvements to Sri Lanka\u2019s macro-economic landscape with inflation continuing to decrease and the IMF bailout followed by the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) announcement.",
    "During the 1H2023, the Bank recorded significant improvement in the core banking performance and posted an overall income of LKR 11,729Mn, which is an increase of 58% over the comparative period.",
    "The increase in the Bank\u2019s revenue is mainly attributed to the increase in the Net Interest Income (NII) which increased by 24% to LKR 3,118Mn resulting from improved yields from the loan portfolio and treasury assets. The Treasury recorded significant contributions in the areas of GSEC Capital Gains and FX profitability. The Bank does not hold any International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), and the Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDB\u2019s) held by the Bank have matured and are awaiting settlement. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) increased by 82 bps due to the timely repricing of the asset book along with prudent management of interest expenses.",
    "Net Fee and Commission Income increased by 18% aided by credit cards, remittances, and increased activity from the trade business. The Bank\u2019s Total Operating Income before impairments was LKR 4,029Mn., an increase of 13%. In comparison to the comparative period the Bank\u2019s impairments charge reduced to LKR 726Mn as a result of stringent recovery measures.
