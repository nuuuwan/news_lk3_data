    "Emphasises making Ministry and agencies more accessible and transparent to public",
    "Announces plans to launch awareness programs about services offered by ministries",
    "Industries and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunnetti has criticised the mismanagement of funds and State-owned enterprises under his ministry, pledging to reform the system to better serve the public.",
    "Speaking at a public gathering over the weekend, the Minister revealed that although Rs. 1,000 million was allocated in last year\u2019s budget for a fund to provide loans to businesses and entrepreneurs, only Rs. 71 million has been disbursed so far.\u201cMany people in this country struggle to access loans. How many businesses have opened, only to close in recent times? Others cannot even afford raw materials,\u201d Handunnetti said. He added that while agencies exist to offer training, guidance, and technical support for entrepreneurs, these benefits have been monopolised by a select few. \u201cThese institutions have been treated as private property,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister stressed the need to make the ministry and its agencies more accessible. \u201cThese institutions must be open to the public and serve the people. We must become employees of the people,\u201d he said, announcing plans to launch awareness programmes to educate the public on the services offered by the ministry. He also called on the media to help highlight both the ministry\u2019s services and its shortcomings.",
    "Handunnetti also criticised the state of several State-owned enterprises under his purview, including National Paper Company Ltd., Salusala, and Laksala, which he said exist only in name. He noted that Lanka Leyland, despite having the authority to manufacture many items, has not produced anything of significance. \u201cSri Lanka has many assets, yet we are not utilising them,\u201d he lamented. \u201cIt is simply tragic,\u201d he added.",
    "He also addressed reports of misconduct by former ministers, accusing them of treating their positions as opportunities for personal gain. \u201cMinistries have been used as treasure troves for luxurious living, rather than for fostering industrialisation and entrepreneurship,\u201d he said.",
    "Handunnetti urged his team to rebuild public trust and take on the responsibility of driving industrial and entrepreneurial growth. \u201cThe people have done their duty. Now the task of carrying this forward is with us. We must uphold this trust,\u201d he noted."
