The team consisted of Aruna Darshana, Hunger Lakshan Kodikara, Dinukka Deshan, and Kalinga Kumarake.

### Matheesha Pathirana becomes most expensive player in LPL history

Young Sri Lankan fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana became the most expensive player ever in a Lanka Premier League (LPL) auction Tuesday when he was grabbed by Colombo Strikers for a record $120,000.

The 21-year-old – who has an unorthodox slinging delivery style – broke the $92,000 mark set by Dilshan Madushanka in last year’s edition of the T20 tournament.

Colombo Strikers bought Pathirana after matching Galle Marvels’ bid with their Right To Match option.

In an interesting turn of events, the Dambulla franchise began the bidding at USD 70,000 after Matheesha Pahitrana entered the bidding at his base price of USD 50,000.

However, Galle Marvels raised the stakes and took it to USD 100,000 straightaway. To avoid retention from Colombo Srikers, Galle even increased their own bid to USD 120,000 but their effort went in vain.

ECONOMYNEXT – The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has all political parties to support the continuity of SOE reform and maintain reform momentum, building on the economic stability achieved.

“The Chamber stresses that it is vital to prioritise and implement the reforms related to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), energy, and fiscal management, to ensure that the country does not revert to a crisis,” it said in a statement.

“It is crucial that all political parties focus on Sri Lanka’s long-term sustainability and avoid leveraging the reform process for short term election gains.”

With elections coming up in Sri Lanka, the World Bank is concerned that reform fatigue could set in, leading to potential policy reversal, particularly with regard to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a World Bank official said.
