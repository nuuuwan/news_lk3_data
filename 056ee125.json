  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital, Director and Specialist Dr. Ratnasiri Hevage emphasised that safeguarding Sri Lanka\u2019s renowned free health sector, known for its excellence in healthcare, is not solely the Government\u2019s responsibility.",
    "In a recent discussion during the \u20181O1 Katha\u2019 program produced by the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD), he highlighted the importance of involvement from healthcare staff, the public, and the media in preserving the sector\u2019s integrity.",
    "Dr. Hevage addressed concerns about drug quality, assuring the public that there are no inferior drugs in circulation. He emphasised that the Ministry of Health strictly imports drugs that are duly registered in their respective countries and authorised by the Drug Regulatory Authority.",
    "Dr. Hevage urged Sri Lankans not to spread unnecessary fear regarding medications, highlighting the Ministry\u2019s commitment to importing medicines only from registered sources, even during emergency purchases. He also clarified that medicines are not produced separately for the Government and the private sector.",
    "Speaking about drug allergies, Dr. Hevage stated that complications or allergies arising from Western medicine are not uncommon. However, Sri Lanka has well-established effective methods to manage such incidents for many years. He encouraged patients to cooperate and report any drug-related incidents promptly through the Pharmacovigilance page on the Drug Regulatory Authority\u2019s website to ensure immediate action.",
    "Dr. Hevage stressed the importance of open communication between patients and doctors. Providing accurate information about allergies and medications being taken is crucial for proper medical care. Failure to do so may lead to serious risks, as he shared an unfortunate example of a friend\u2019s father who passed away due to an overdose caused by incorrect information provided to the doctor.",
    "The Director urged patients to strictly adhere to medical advice, especially regarding prescribed dosages, to avoid any complications or risks. He cautioned against creating unnecessary fear around drugs and medical care and emphasised the need for collective efforts to protect the country\u2019s outstanding health system.",
    "Highlighting Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation alongside Costa Rica as countries with exemplary health systems, Dr. Hevage called for collective efforts from the Government, media, healthcare workers, patients, and the public to uphold and preserve the free health sector.",
    "Dr. Hevage emphasised that health administrators should not compromise the sector\u2019s excellence for short-term gains and should uphold their responsible role in maintaining its high standards."
