*2025-09-14 13:01:47* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/உலக-செய்திகள்/நேட்டோ-நாடுகளுக்கு-ட்ரம்ப்-இறுதி-எச்சரிக்கை/50-364549) · `ta`

ரஷ்யாவிடம் இருந்து எண்ணெய் வாங்குவதை நேட்டோ நாடுகள் உடனடியாக நிறுத்திக் கொள்ள வேண்டும் என்று அமெரிக்க ஜனாதிபதி டொனால்ட் ட்ரம்ப் இறுதி எச்சரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ளார்.

உக்ரைன் மீதான ரஷ்யாவின் போரை முடிவுக்குக் கொண்டு வர டொனால்ட் ட்ரம்ப் பல்வேறு முயற்சிகளை மேற்கொண்டு வருகிறார். ரஷ்யாவுக்கு எதிராக பல்வேறு பொருளாதார தடைகளை விதித்த அவர், ரஷ்யாவுடன் வலிமையான வர்த்தக உறவில் இருக்கும் நாடுகளுக்கு எதிராகவும் வரி விதிப்பு உள்ளிட்ட நடவடிக்கைகளை மேற்கொண்டார். மேலும், ரஷ்ய ஜனாதிபதி விளாடிமிர் புதினை நேரில் சந்தித்தும் பேச்சுவார்த்தை நடத்தினார்.

இவை எதுவும் போதிய பலன் தரவில்லை. உக்ரைன் குறித்த அமைதிப் பேச்சுவார்த்தையை நிறுத்திவிட்டதாக சமீபத்தில் ரஷ்யா அறிவித்தது. தொடர்ந்து அது உக்ரைனுக்கு எதிராக ராணுவ நடவடிக்கைகளை எடுத்து வருகிறது.

இந்தியா, சீனா உள்ளிட்ட நாடுகள் ரஷ்யாவிடம் இருந்து அதிக அளவில் கச்சா எண்ணெய் வாங்குவதே போர் தொடர்வதற்குக் காரணம் என கூறி அவற்றுக்கு எதிராக அழுத்தம் கொடுத்து வந்த ட்ரம்ப், தற்போது தனது நட்பு நாடுகளான நேட்டோ நாடுகளுக்கும் அழுத்தம் கொடுக்கத் தொடங்கி உள்ளார்.
