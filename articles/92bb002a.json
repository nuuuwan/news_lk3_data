    "After two years of economic contraction, the country is now striving for accelerated growth. With the recent conclusion of debt restructuring and the Presidential Elections, and the forthcoming General Election, it is imperative to lay the groundwork for a decade of sustainable, inclusive growth starting in 2025. The summit will explore the right policies to be implemented in achieving an export-led investment model, focusing on leveraging Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic location, its access to rapidly growing regional markets, and the necessary domestic reforms to unlock key export sectors. Breakout sessions will focus on tourism, agriculture and value-added manufacturing.",

The insights and understandings gained from the summit will equip participants to actively engage in and contribute to vital conversations about Sri Lanka\u2019s future, and we encourage all stakeholders to participate."
