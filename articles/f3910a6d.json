    "The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) hosted a panel discussion \u2018Sri Lanka as a Destination: From Antiquity to Modernity\u2019 as part of its outreach activities to promote \u2018Cultural Diplomacy\u2019 in Koggala on Saturday (13 January).",
    "Held with the Indian Ocean as the backdrop at the Long Beach Hotel, Koggala, this interactive discussion was organised as part of \u2018Rhythms of Paradise\u2019 \u2013 the cultural spectacle of \u2018Galle Concerto 2024\u2019, with the aim of promoting the southern coastline of Sri Lanka as a tourist destination, and in celebration of Sri Lanka\u2019s timeless cultural and natural heritage.

    "Opening the session on \u2018Sri Lanka as a Destination: From Antiquity to Modernity\u2019, LKI Executive Director Ambassador Aryasinha said the event underscored the pivotal role of \u2018cultural diplomacy\u2019 in positioning Sri Lanka globally and heightened the importance of acknowledging cultural diversity and leveraging it to promote tourism in Sri Lanka. He said it was a potent force which transcends borders and fosters mutual understanding, in a world which is marked by interconnectedness and interdependence. He recalled the writings of Ambassador Dr. Vernon. L.B. Mendis where it was observed, \u201cFew countries in the world could claim to have been so well-known throughout its history as Sri Lanka. From earliest times to modern times, it has enjoyed an international reputation and been admired.\u201d Within the historical frame outlined \u2013 from antiquity to modernity, he said the discussion sought to capture the vibrancy and resilience on the one hand, and the unease and restlessness on the other, as Sri Lanka today seeks to carve out a modern day narrative on Sri Lanka \u2013 increasingly written by Sri Lankan writers, many living in the diaspora, which presents both a challenge, as well as an opportunity.",
    "University of Colombo Emeritus Professor of Pali and Buddhist Studies Professor Asanga Tilakaratne, who participated in the discussion virtually under the theme \u2018Journey Through Antiquity\u2019, painted a vivid picture of ancient Serendib from the Roman times, and how the island nation emerged as a significant entity in the annals of world history. He highlighted writings on relations with India, South East Asia and East Asia in which Sri Lanka was the destination \u2013 commencing with the Ramayana, through the arrival of Prince Vijaya, the introduction of Buddhism through Arahant Mahinda and Sanghamitta Theri with the Sri Maha Bodhi sapling. Referring to the fifth century relations with East Asia particularly with China, he noted Fa Hsien being the first known Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, the Polonnaruva period which saw Hindu influence on the island\u2019s culture, art, architecture, while relations particularly with what is today Myanmar and Thailand, was a significant factor starting from around the 11th century continuing till the 15th century.",
    "Renowned Sri Lankan author and novelist Ameena Hussein, who also participated in the discussion virtually, highlighted the documented history of the island by Arab travellers and took the audience on a historical journey with her discourse centred on her recent book \u2018Visitors from the Arab World: Ibn Battuta in Sri Lanka\u2019. She expounded upon his role, emphasising the pivotal contribution he made to the historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, thereby underscoring his enduring impact on the island\u2019s historical narrative.",
    "Professor Shihan de Silva Jayasuriya commenced the discussion with an exploration of \u2018Untold Stories: Colonial Travellers and Minority Groups.\u2019 With a focus on ancient Ceylon during the Colonial era, she illuminated how Sri Lanka assimilated cultural elements influenced by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial powers, shaping its distinctive identity. Furthermore, she delved into the impact of political, administrative, and legal reforms introduced by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, shaping the fabric of Sri Lankan governance.",
    "Additionally, she highlighted the contributions of diverse ethnic minorities, including the Malay community, Indian Tamils, and the Sri Lankan-Afro community, which have enriched the cultural tapestry of Sri Lanka. This insightful discourse not only shed light on the historical dynamics of the colonial influence on Sri Lanka but also underscored the resilience and adaptability of the local culture in embracing and incorporating these external influences.",
    "University of London King\u2019s College Professor of Global Literature Professor Ruvani Ranasinha speaking on the theme \u2018Sri Lanka as a Destination: Modern Day Framings,\u2019 explored how Sri Lanka is portrayed in contemporary literature. She shed light on various modern authors\u2019 perspectives which focused on themes such as the ethno-political crisis and representations of community, citizenship, minorities, national identity, and gendered social relations in Sri Lanka. Alongside some narrow problematic accounts, she said there was also increasingly a more nuanced portrayal mainly by Sri Lankan diaspora writers of Sri Lanka\u2019s rich ethnic and cultural diversity which included shared experiences of Sri Lanka as a nation, which not only sought to engage Sri Lanka\u2019s recent past as a national experience to be worked through, but also to imagine community in diverse ways and aesthetic forms.",
    "The presentations of this session which was sponsored by SLT-Mobitel was followed by a dynamic exchange of ideas between the panellists and the audience which included tourists visiting Sri Lanka, scholars and university students. In his closing remarks, Ambassador Aryasinha emphasised the importance for a broader and deeper appreciation of Sri Lanka\u2019s multifaceted identity, and the imperative of actively shaping Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural narrative in the global arena in positioning Sri Lanka on the global map, in order to promote tourism.The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) hosted a panel discussion \u2018Sri Lanka as a Destination: From Antiquity to Modernity\u2019 as part of its outreach activities to promote \u2018Cultural Diplomacy\u2019 in Koggala on Saturday (13 January).",
