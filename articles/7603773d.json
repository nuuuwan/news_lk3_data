    "According to the directive of the Committee on Ways and Means, manufacturing and distribution of liquor by four companies who had defaulted tax, namely W.M. Mendis & Company, Finland Distilleries, Synergy Distilleries and Randeigala Distilleries, have been banned as their excise licenses expired on September 30 last year and the Excise Department has not renewed them. However W.M. Mendis & Company, Finland Distilleries, Synergy Distilleries and Randenigala Distilleries who have agreed to pay default taxes have actually paid the first installments on November 4 2023. The four companies remitted a total of Rs 906,176,439.51 while there is an outstanding amount of Rs 332,715, 868.31",

    "The Committee has raised concerns on liquor companies such as Globe Blenders, Wayamba Spirit Stores and Kalutara Cooperatives Distilleries who have evaded paying taxes by terminating their businesses.",
    "\u201cNeither the Ministry of Finance nor the Excise Department has taken action to seize the bottles of liquor with fake security tax stamps until the committee directed the Commissioner General of Exercise to begin raids to seize liquor bottles with\u00a0 the fake sticker."
