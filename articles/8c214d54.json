    "There seems to be no end in sight to the ongoing probe into the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pledged to make a revelation about the carnage before its sixth anniversary, which fell last April, but that promise went unfulfilled. Subsequently, Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala made a statement in Parliament and that left the public none the wiser. It was a classic case of the proverbial mountains in labour delivering a mouse. He claimed that TMVP\u2008leader and former State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan had prior knowledge of the terror attacks while in prison. Why has he been singled out? In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in 2019, the then Minister Harin Fernando said his father, an ordinary citizen, had received information about the impending terror strikes. Many police and intelligence officers were also privy to a warning about the attacks.",
    "Sadly, one can argue\u2014with due respect to the victims and the campaigners for justice\u2014that the ongoing probe into the Easter Sunday tragedy has come to resemble a \u2018mega teledrama\u2019 with new episodes added to it endlessly. The Channel 04 programme on the Easter Sunday attacks is a case in point; it is full of sensational, unsubstantiated claims.",
    "Meanwhile, the National Police Commission has terminated former Head of State Intelligence Service SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena following a disciplinary inquiry. The government can rest assured that the media will keep this issue going for two weeks or so. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI), which investigated the Easter Sunday attacks, has recommended that the Attorney General consider instituting criminal proceedings against Jayawardena under any suitable provision in the Penal Code. There are other high-ranking police officers the PCoI has not recommended legal action against though they also failed to prevent the Easter Sunday carnage despite receiving actionable intelligence.",
    "The government has, in its wisdom, brought former SSP Shani Abeysekera, a prominent member of the ruling NPP\u2019s Retired Police Collective (RPC), out of retirement and appointed him as the Director of the CID. It has also elevated retired SDIG Ravi Seneviratne, the Head of the RPC of the NPP, to the position of Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security. Both of them were in charge of the CID at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks. The police are not short of capable men and women of integrity who can probe the Easter Sunday attacks impartially and efficiently. Why did the government pull Seneviratne and Abeysekera out of retirement and appoint them to high posts?",
    "Minister and Leader of the House Bimal Rathnayake told Parliament during a recent debate on the Easter Sunday attacks that Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith had, on behalf of the Catholic community, requested that Seneviratne and Abeysekera be brought in to handle the probe into the Easter Sunday carnage. But Spokesman for the Archdiocese of Colombo Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando yesterday told the media that the Archbishop of Colombo had made no such request. He said Cardinal Ranjith had only requested that the probe be entrusted to the investigators sidelined by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government. Fr. Fernando insisted that the Archbishop of Colombo had not mentioned any names. Did the government use the prelate\u2019s request and make the aforementioned appointments to advance a hidden political agenda?",
    "Indika Anuruddha Herath, who was a UPFA MP at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks, has revealed that even the police personnel providing security to him had been warned of the Easter Sunday terror attacks, but they had been ordered by their superiors not to inform him of the threat. Claiming that his family were in a church in Negombo at the time of the terrorist attack in Katuwapitiya, he has said that if he and other MPs had been warned of the impending attacks, they would definitely have alerted the church leaders and precautions could have been taken to prevent the carnage. Who ordered the police personnel to withhold the warning about the terror strikes from the MPs? Investigators should find an answer to this vital question.",
