    "The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will ensure that what happened to former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa would not happen to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage said today.",
    "He said Gotabaya Rajapaksa invited opposition leader Sajith Premadasa to take up the challenge but he did not have the guts to do so.",
    "He said it was only Ranil Wickremesinghe who had come forward and taken up the challenge at the difficult time and added that he had created a country where everyone can live freely.",
    "\"We as the SLPP, will provide our assistance to take forward this development programme. We will not allow what happened to Gotabaya Rajapaksa to happen to Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is not a political issue. This is an issue involving the peoples' lives. We can do politics during election time,' he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
