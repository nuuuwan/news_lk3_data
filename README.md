### Pearl ship accident: Singapore shipping company refuses to pay a billion US $ 1 billion

*2025-09-23 10:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225816) · `ta`

The X-Bruss Feeders Shipping Company, headquartered in Singapore, has refused to pay a billion US $ 1 billion compensation by the Sri Lankan court for the environmental impact of the MV X-Press Pearl, which was submerged in the Colombo port of Sri Lanka in 2021.

In an interview, X-Brussy CEO, Schmuel Yoscovits, said that the compensation would have a negative impact on global shipping.

He also noted that the payment of such a huge amount of money would cause a "dangerous precedent" for such incidents in the future.

MV X-Brussy Pearl, registered in Singapore, set fire to the sea near the Colombo port in May 2021.

The fire caused by nitric acid leaks, which lasted about two weeks. The ship then sank into the Sri Lankan waters. The accident led to the worst maritime environmental pollution in Sri Lanka's history.

The denial is expected to further increase the legal and diplomatic issues between the Sri Lankan government and the shipping company.

### Air India crash aftermath handled ‘irresponsibly’, says court

The highest court in India has strongly criticised the country’s aviation authorities for their handling of the aftermath of the Air India plane crash that killed 261 people in June.

Leaving only one survivor, the flight bound for Gatwick airport from Ahmedabad crashed shortly after taking off, killing 242 passengers on board and 19 others on the ground.

The court said it was “irresponsible” for the aviation authority to suggest, through leaks to the media, that pilot error had caused the disaster.

It called on Indian prime minister Narendra Modi for the government’s response before it rules on a case filed by activists demanding an independent investigation.

The court said the way the aviation body released its preliminary report in to the Boeing Dreamliner’s crash was “selective and piecemeal”.

The preliminary report, published by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off.

### Sri Lanka’s national inflation rises to 1.5-pct in August

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s national-wide inflation price inflation rises to 1.5 percent in 12-months to August July 2025, rising from 0.7 percent in July, with food prices rising 2.9 percent over the year, data from the state statistics office showed.

The  National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) fell 0.5 percent over the month of August.

The National Consumer Price Index, an alternative to the widely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index, fell 0.5 percent over the month of August to 207.2 points.

The central bank has missed its 5 percent inflation target, which is sometimes seen as deflation when 12-month data is taken into account, but prices have moved up marginally since 2022.

Critics have pointed out that under cover of the 5 percent inflation target the central bank triggered back-to-back currency crises since the end of a 30-year war in 2012, 2015/16, 2018 and 2020/20 collapsing the rupee from 113 to 360 to the US dollar.

The New Zealand government said on Tuesday it was introducing two new pathways for migrants to gain residency as part of their efforts to boost the country’s economy.

Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis said in the statement that skilled and experienced migrants play an important role in plugging workforce gaps, and in turn help businesses to grow.

“Businesses told us it was too hard for some migrants to gain residence, even when they had crucial skills and significant experience that was not available in the existing workforce. We’re fixing it,” she said.

The new pathways are for skilled workers and tradespeople and technicians, and require them to have relevant experience both overseas and in New Zealand and to meet salary thresholds, the statement said.

### ICC charges Rodrigo Duterte with crimes against humanity

Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has been charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The 80-year-old is accused of being criminally responsible for dozens of murders that allegedly took place as part of his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.

The ICC’s charge sheet, which includes several redactions, dates from July but was only made public on Monday.

ICC deputy prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang said Duterte was an “indirect co-perpetrator” in the killings, which the court alleges were carried out by others, including police.

The first count laid against Mr Duterte concerns his alleged involvement in the killings of 19 people in Davao City between 2013 and 2016 while he was mayor there.

The other two charges relate to times when he was serving as president of the Philippines, between 2016 and 2022, and launched his so-called war on drugs.
