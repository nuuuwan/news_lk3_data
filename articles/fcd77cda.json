    "Jan. 22 (ICC) - The ICC Team of the Year recognises 11 outstanding individuals who have impressed throughout 2023, be it with the bat, the ball or their all-round exploits.",
    "We take a look at who made the cut for their work in women\u2019s T20I cricket in the calendar year just gone.",
    "The veteran Sri Lankan started the year with a Player of the Match performance in Cape Town in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup, smashing 68 off 50 balls to help Sri Lanka beat South Africa by three runs. The big upset win set the tone for a remarkable year for Sri Lanka women and Athapaththu was at the forefront of it all.",
    "She finished with 470 runs in the year, scoring at a quicker-than-usual strike-rate of 130.91. With 15 sixes in the year, she also hit a personal high in Women's T20Is.",
    "In the second half of the year, Athapaththu hit a purple patch, recording an unbeaten 80 in 47 balls in Colombo to help Sri Lanka pull back a win in the three-match series against New Zealand. Athapaththu\u2019s assault blew the White Ferns attack away as Sri Lanka went on to chase 141 with all 10 wickets to spare. She then went on to play a pivotal role in Sri Lanka\u2019s series triumph over England in England.",
    "Making 410 runs at an average of 41 and a strike rate of 120.58, Beth Mooney was a key performer for the all-conquering Australians who claimed another T20 World Cup trophy.",
    "Only Hayley Matthews made more runs than Laura Wolvaardt\u2019s 586 runs at 45, and the South African star enjoyed the stage of a home T20 World Cup.",
    "A unanimous selection in the Team of the Year, Matthews was the most-prolific run scorer in women\u2019s T20Is (700 at 63.63, strike rate 132) in 2023, while also claiming 19 wickets at an economy of 6.84.",
    "Making 364 runs at 45.50 and a strike rate close to 136, Nat Sciver-Brunt continued to match her reputation as one of the best players in the world, only dismissed twice under 10 across the year in the T20I format.",
    "It was another strong year for one of the game\u2019s brightest talents, making 365 runs with bat in hand alongside 12 wickets in 11 bowling efforts with her leg-spin.",
    "Despite a lean run at the start of the year, Perry ended 2023 on a high, putting together scores of 51*, 34, 70 and 40 in the bilaterals against England and West Indies.",
    "Player of the Tournament of the T20 World Cup in 2023, Gardner provided both highlight moments and a dependable consistency as Australia powered to more silverware.",
    "Deepti Sharma proved difficult to get away for almost every opponent in 2023, going at less than a run a ball across almost 60 overs for India. The off-spinner claimed 21 wickets in 17 outings, including four three-wicket hauls early in the year.",
    "The top-ranked women's T20I bowler finished the Women's T20 World Cup with 11 wickets, more than anyone at the tournament. Ecclestone\u2019s sensational showing in the tournament saw her go past 800 rating points, becoming just the second bowler to do so in the MRF Tyres ICC Women's T20I Bowling rankings.",
    "So crucial with the new ball, Megan Schutt again stepped up for Australia when needed, taking 21 wickets at 15.57 at a rate of just 6.81 runs per over."
