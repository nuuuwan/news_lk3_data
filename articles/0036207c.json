    "The government has apparently shifted from a hasty plan to implement its educational reforms to a broader dialogue thereon, amidst resistance from various quarters. Parliament debated the proposed reforms on Thursday. Complaining that the government had only made a powerpoint presentation of the educational reforms, the Opposition called for a white paper, but the government stood its ground, claiming that information it had released about them was sufficient.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, taking part in Thursday\u2019s debate, stressed the need to ensure that all students completed 13 years of schooling, and urged teachers and others to monitor students\u2019 school attendance closely and take remedial measures, where necessary. He lamented that schooling had become a gruelling experience for students due to transport issues, distances they had to travel, and their overreliance on private tuition, which deprived them of childhood freedom and joy. He must have struck a responsive chord with the public. He discussed a wide range of issues and policies related to school education. The focus of this comment however is on the fate of the underprivileged schools facing the prospect of permanent closure.",
    "President Dissanayake said 98 state-run schools had been without any new admissions. Pointing out that about 15% schools had fewer than 50 students each, and about two-thirds of schools had fewer than 100 students each, he said a strategy to overcome the problem might necessitate permanent closure of some of those seats of learning. According to teachers\u2019 trade unions and organisations dedicated to protecting universal free education, most of these low-enrolment schools are situated in rural areas.",
    "Interestingly, spas, liquor shops, bookies and junk food outlets have proliferated in rural areas and become profitable ventures. But schools are closing down for want of new admissions in those parts of the country. This situation is usually attributed to several factors including the development of the transport sector, which has enhanced students\u2019 mobility and lessened their dependence on rural schools which are in a state of neglect.",
    "The government\u2019s plan to continue with its predecessors\u2019 policy of closing down low-enrolment schools, and provide the affected students with transport to urban and semi-urban schools may sound logical. There has also been a proposal to cluster those schools. However, a strategy to handle this sensitive issue should be based on a thorough study to ascertain the actual causative factors, and, most of all, poor students must not be denied easy access to school so as to prevent them dropping out. Most students currently in the underprivileged schools earmarked for closure may not travel to urban and semi-urban schools even if they are provided with transport free of charge.",
    "Pragmatism and economic compulsions may make the government\u2019s decision to close down the low-enrolment schools look rational and sensible, but such a strategy will be antithetical to the JVP\u2019s ideological position on education and rural development. Most of the underprivileged schools have been left to wither on the vine under successive governments, which paid lip service to rural development. The JVP has been critical of a glaring urban bias in the allocation of state resources for vital sectors and blamed it for rural poverty and backwardness. One may recall that it coined a pithy slogan to drive this point home in the late 1980s\u2014Kolombata Kiri, Gamata Kekiri (\u2018Milk for Colombo and Melon for the Village\u2019). So, the question is whether the JVP-led government will be able to reconcile its decision to close down the rural schools with its pledge to allocate more funds for rural development. During Thursday\u2019s parliamentary debate on the proposed education reforms, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said the government was without a proper strategy to develop rural schools.",
    "Prudence demands that the JVP-ed NPP government refrain from plunging head first into closing down the low-enrolment schools, and instead make a serious effort to explore ways and means of making them attractive to more students who cannot attend urban schools for reasons other than transport issues. Otherwise, there might be an increase in the school dropout rate in the rural sector. On Thursday, President Dissanayake informed Parliament that the school dropout figures had risen from 16,673 in 2019 to 20,759 in 2022, before plateauing at 20,755 in 2024. Everything possible must be done to bring these figures down in the shortest possible time. A steep school dropout rate is far more than a mere statistic; it is a symptom of systemic social issues.",
