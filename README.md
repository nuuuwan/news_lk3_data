### SLFP faction led by ex-President Maithripala relocates operations

*2024-05-27 11:19:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99460/slfp-faction-led-by-ex-president-maithripala-relocates-operations) · `en`

In light of the current political situation, the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to carry out the future activities of the party from a new location instead of the party headquarters.

Reportedly, this new location in Colombo will replace the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Colombo 10, for future political activities.

The party’s internal sources said that ongoing internal conflicts and court orders have made it impractical to convene constituency and district organizers of the party at a permanent location.

Therefore, the faction led by former President Sirisena has deemed it more appropriate to operate from a different location. The new political center will serve as a venue to convene district and constituency organizers from across the island to discuss upcoming political matters, as per sources.

Residents of the area said flocks of migratory birds live and breed freely during this season in Anawilundawa Ramsar bird sanctuary, which is a tourist attraction.

They were of the opinion that chemical waste dumped haphazardly from a factory in the area resulted in the death of birds and fish in this manner.

Meanwhile, Range Forest Conservator W.L. Upananda said he referred specimens of the dead fish and birds to the Peradeniya Special Veterinary Unit for laboratory tests to determine the cause of death. He said the results of the laboratory tests were yet to be received.

However, officials of the Aqua Culture Development Authority said watercourses had been contaminated due to neglect of clearing algae, resulting in the death of fish and birds.

Alarmed by the government’s move to increase the minimum daily wage without additional revenue streams and with no industry consultation, Sri Lanka’s tea smallholders, which account for over 75 percent of the tea production, expressed the grave concerns on the sustainability of the Ceylon tea industry.

Speaking to Mirror Business, Medium Scale Tea Estate Owners Association Founding General Secretary Ushan Samarasinghe warned that small and medium estate owners in particular are hit by the wage increase.

“The government needs to do their homework first; they need to show us new markets, so we can earn this additional revenue to pay our employees.  Otherwise, they will be forced to move into other crops. Already a large number of tea estate owners have moved to other crops, this will only accelerate this trend,” he said.

The trending theme in Sri Lanka in the recent past are the probable alliances and crossovers between political parties/politicians targeting the Presidential elections 2024. Whilst there can be merit to this approach of influencing a Sri Lankan voter, what many forget is that this type of ‘consumer behaviour’ will not be the reality this year. For instance, a research insight shows that when voting happens in Sri Lanka, the floating vote is around forty percent. Some speculate that the floating percentage can be higher given the low confidence the public has towards politicians. Let’s accept the fact that environmental conditions together with poor decision making by politicians made Sri Lanka become a bankrupt state. The IMF clearly stipulates that the Governance Diagnostic Assessment report reveals severe Governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across functions contributed to the financial collapse of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka’s last official census was taken in 2012. According to that census, Sri Lanka’s majority ethnic community the Sinhalese comprises 74.9 % of the island nation’s population.  Numerically, the second largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Tamils who are 11.1% of the population. The third largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Muslims or Moors who comprise 9.3% of the population. The fourth largest ethnic group is the Tamils of  Indian origin known as “Malaiyagath Thamizhar” (Hill Country Tamils) who are 4.1%.

The three numerical minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Indian Tamils together are 25.5% of the population. These three ethnic groups form the majority in some Sri Lankan districts. In other districts they are a substantive segment of the population. Since the people of all districts vote together in the Presidential elections, the entire island is transformed into a “single” constituency with a 74.9% Sinhala majority and 25.5 % non – Sinhala minorities.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe welcomed to the Ceylon Workers’ Congress May Day rally at Kotagala

In the 2015 elections, Wickremesinghe topped the list of Colombo  district  candidates with over 500,000 preference votes. Yet Ranil too  was buried in the 2020 avalanche of defeat. Ranil whose detractors used  to ridicule him in the past as “Mr.Bean” and ‘serial loser” was  virtually written off. It was said that Ranil Wickremesinghe’s political  career had ended

The Aragalaya had been launched with the demand “Gota go home” or “Go Home Gota”. This objective was realised in July 2022. Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned from abroad as President. Ranil took over as acting president on  July 14, 2022

Sri Lanka’s  United National Party (UNP) suffered a humiliating electoral defeat in the 2020 Parliamentary elections. Electoral debacles were nothing new to the UNP which is  referred to by some as the grand old party.

### Human Rights Watch alleges crackdown over civil war anniversary

*2024-05-27 00:47:32* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Human-Rights-Watch-alleges-crackdown-over-civil-war-anniversary/56-762179) · `en`

Cites UN report calling for international prosecutions for enforced disappearances

Sri Lankan authorities have threatened and detained Tamils commemorating those who died or went missing in the country’s civil war, Human Rights Watch said last week.

On 17 May the United Nations human rights office issued a report calling for international prosecutions and other accountability measures to address the thousands of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances in the war, which ended on 18 May 18, 2009.

“The Sri Lankan Government is in denial about atrocities its forces committed during the civil war, so it tries to silence victims and their communities instead of providing truth, justice, and reparations,” said Human Rights Watch Asia Director Elaine Pearson. “It’s clear that more international action is needed to bring relief to victims and prevent a recurrence of abuses.”

### 15 years after end of war, victims and survivors still await justice and accountability: ICJ

*2024-05-27 00:43:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/15-years-after-end-of-war-victims-and-survivors-still-await-justice-and-accountability-ICJ/56-762178) · `en`

As Sri Lanka marked 15 years since the end of a decades-long armed conflict on 18 May, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) deplored the near total impunity that has prevailed, and lack of victim-centred justice and accountability for war time atrocities.

The ICJ calls on the responsible authorities to reverse course and take measures that will provide real access to justice for the conflict’s numerous victims and survivors and bring those responsible for crimes under international law to account.

The bleak picture is reinforced by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in a report released on 17 May, titled Accountability for Enforced Disappearances in Sri Lanka. The report notes the near total impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of widespread enforced disappearances over four decades and a systematic failure to account for the fate and whereabouts of victims.

### Why Sri Lanka needs to ditch post-dated cheques

*2024-05-27 00:26:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-Sri-Lanka-needs-to-ditch-post-dated-cheques/4-762177) · `en`

A post-dated cheque represents a future promise to pay, not a completed transaction

A post-dated cheque is a regular cheque with a future date written on it. This means the cheque writer instructs the bank not to pay the cheque until that future date arrives.

Purpose: People use them to ensure the recipient waits to deposit the cheque. There are a couple of reasons for this:

The writer doesn’t have enough funds currently but expects to by the future date.

The cheque is for a prepayment, like paying for a service before it’s completed.

Validity: The rules around post-dated cheques can vary depending on the country. In some places, like the US and UK, banks can process them even before the written date. In other places, like India and Australia, the bank has to wait until the date on the cheque.

Legality: Post-dated cheques are generally legal and considered negotiable instruments.

### China and Russia together: A new world order?

The vision of Putin and Xi Jinping is not about creating a new empire challenging the American version. But they want to be taken seriously

China is more ambitious about countering American power through trade. This is where Xi Jinping is walking a fine line between Russia and Western Europe (the European Union)

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state visit to China is more than a show of friendship and unity in adversity. It shows ambition on both sides to create a new multi-polar world order challenging the unipolar status enjoyed by the United States since the dismemberment of the former USSR, ending decades of bipolar politics, the Cold War and détente.

### Tourist arrivals to cross 100,000 mark in May

Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka are likely to surpass the 100,000 mark, while falling behind the target of 120,934 -131,112 arrivals in May.

Provisional data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority showed tourist arrivals recording a moderate growth reaching 79,431 in the first three weeks of the month (from 1st of May to 21st of May) when compared to 83,309 arrivals recorded in May last year.

The daily arrival average is about 3,782, a drop from the 5,000 level experienced in the previous months.

From April, till the summer season, the influx of tourists remains low, as it is an off-peak period. However, the visa fiasco might have also contributed to the drop in the month according to authorities.

India became by far the largest tourist traffic generator for the month, accounting for 26 percent of the total arrivals. Ranking second is the Maldives, contributing to 11 percent of the arrivals.

### Presidential pardons -for whose benefit? - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-27 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Presidential-pardons-for-whose-benefit-EDITORIAL/172-283379) · `en`

The large-scale pardoning of prisoners by Lankan Presidents for the commission of minor crimes has become customary during particular festivals, for example the day marking the country’s independence, Vesak and Christmas.

Often these pardons have been granted to persons who were among those taken in for commission of petty criminal activity.

The Task Force on Judicial and Legal Causes for Prison Overcrowding and Prison Reforms reveals that nearly 52 percent of the prison population consists of persons unconvicted of any crime.

While the total prison capacity in the country in 2022 stood at 11,291 inmates, the report added the number of imprisoned reached 26,176 individuals by the end of 2022. The number comprised 16,727 suspects and 9,449 convicts.

To make matters worse, during these trying times, the state spends around Rs. 8.3 billion to look after the prisoners.

Given these circumstances, many of our people hardly ever opposed the freeing of prisoners by the head of state.

### Resilience and revival amidst revered rituals: A post-Vesak pondering

We have just witnessed a colourful Vesak amid heavy showers. Amidst the economic woes, enthusiastic devotees resorted to various rituals with reverence. Sri Lankans have begun to show their serenity, synergy, and solidarity, in steadily moving through a turbulence. Today’s column reflects our resilience and revival, with inherited prospects and pitfalls.

“Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and test of our civilisation,” said Mahatma Gandhi. In fact, it is our duty to ensure that beauty of unity in diversity. It is encouraging to see people from all walks of life coming forward with rare unity despite typical blame games of opportunistic politicians. Vesak as a festival of light was a reassurance of “Apekema” (the “SriLankanness”) dispelling the darkness of chaos and confusion. The starting point of such a rich experience is the inner serenity or stillness.
