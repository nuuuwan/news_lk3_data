### French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigns after less than a month

France’s new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned on Monday (Oct 6), barely 14 hours after appointing his new Cabinet, after allies and foes alike threatened to topple his government, driving French stocks and the euro sharply lower.

His swift resignation was unexpected and unprecedented, and marked another major deepening of France’s political crisis.

The far-right National Rally immediately urged President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election.

After weeks of consultations with political parties across the board, Lecornu, a close ally of Macron, had appointed his ministers on Sunday and they had been set to hold their first meeting on Monday afternoon.

But the new Cabinet line-up had angered opponents and allies alike, who either found it too right-wing or not sufficiently so, raising questions on how long it could last, at a time when France is already mired deep in political crisis, with no group holding a majority in a fragmented parliament.
