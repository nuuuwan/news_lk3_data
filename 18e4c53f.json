    "Some of the boys were burnt or hacked to death, Major General Dick Olum from the Ugandan army told the media.",
    "Others at the school, mostly girls, have been abducted by the group, he added.",
    "Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them.",

    "The deadly episode follows last week\u2019s attack by suspected ADF fighters in a village in the DRC near to the Ugandan border. Over 100 villagers fled to Uganda but have since returned.",
    "The attack on the school, located less than two kilometres (1.25 miles) from the DRC border, is the first such attack on a Ugandan school in 25 years.",
    "In June 1998, 80 students were burnt to death in their dormitories in an ADF attack on Kichwamba Technical Institute near the border of DRC. More than 100 students were abducted.",
    "The ADF was created in eastern Uganda in the 1990s and took up arms against long-serving President, Yoweri Museveni, alleging government persecution of Muslims.",
