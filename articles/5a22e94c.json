    "Markspen Group celebrated its 14th anniversary, reflecting on a journey of innovation and growth that began in 2011. A key highlight of its recent success is the remarkable performance of the DOMA Single Elevator Automatic Rice Mill Machines, introduced by Markspen Holdings in late 2023.",
    "Within a short period, over 1,800 units have been sold and installed across the country. Speaking at the anniversary event, Markspen Group Head of Sales and Operations Amalka Menikkadawara shared that the strong market response reflects the trust and satisfaction of Sri Lankan farmers, who now benefit from efficient, easy-to-use technology that saves both time and labour. The DOMA machine, which can be operated by a single person, completes the process of cleaning and milling rice in three steps, removing dirt, stones, and sand, with an innovative feature allowing rice to be added from the bottom of the machine.",
    "Markspen Group began its journey in 2011 as a barcode label printing business under the name Markspen Labels Ltd. Since then, it has grown into a leading business group with operations in labelling, agro-machinery, logistics, and organic retail. Markspen Labels continues to serve various industries by providing modern equipment and software, including barcode printers, POS terminals, data readers, barcode labels, ribbons, scanners, and related accessories. Under the concept of Smart Agriculture, its subsidiary Markspen Holdings Ltd. now imports and distributes a wide range of advanced agro-machinery, including several models of automatic paddy threshing machines such as the DOMA CTP 20, along with paddy drying machines, rice packing machines, black seed removal machines, and coconut oil extraction machines. These innovative solutions are designed to support farmers across Sri Lanka by increasing productivity through reliable and accessible technology.",
    "Its steady growth reflects the visionary leadership of Chairman G. G. A. D. Galanga, Directors S. K. Jayamali and D. P. Galanga, and General Manager D. D. A. Gunasekera. Under their guidance, the Group has reached several key milestones: the launch of the DOMA brand in 2013 signalled its entry into innovative agricultural machinery; expanded into international markets in 2016 and formed a strategic partnership in 2024 with The Smarter Choice (TSC) as the authorised distributor of their barcode printers in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.",
    "Addressing the gathering at the anniversary celebration, Chairman G. G. A. D. Galanga said, \u201cWe are truly grateful for the trust placed in Markspen Group over the past 14 years. We are committed to empowering Sri Lankan entrepreneurs through innovation and smart technology, and it is rewarding to see our efforts making a real difference.\u201d",
    "Markspen Group has earned a strong reputation for its commitment to quality, reliability, and customer trust.
