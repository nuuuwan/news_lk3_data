  "original_body_lines": [
    "Authorities in India enforced security restrictions in two main districts in the remote Ladakh region on Thursday (Sep 25), a day after four people were killed and dozens injured when police clashed with hundreds of protesters demanding greater autonomy from the Indian government for the Himalayan territory.",
    "Officials banned assembly of more than five people in Ladakh\u2019s Leh and Kargil districts following the violent clashes Wednesday. Hundreds of police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled streets Thursday while shops and businesses remained shut due to the restrictions.",
    "Wednesday\u2019s clashes erupted after protesters threw stones at officers trying to stop them from marching in the high-altitude town of Leh. Others set ablaze police and paramilitary vehicles and the local office of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and some other government buildings, police said.",
    "Police fired bullets and tear gas and swung batons at demonstrators, killing four people and injuring dozens more, police and residents said.",
    "Nestled between India, Pakistan and China, Ladakh was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir after New Delhi removed the disputed region\u2019s statehood and semiautonomy in 2019. While Kashmir has largely been silenced through a crackdown on dissent and a slew of new laws, demands for political rights in Ladakh have intensified in recent years.",
    "The protests are part of a larger movement in the federally governed region seeking statehood and constitutional provisions from the Indian government to gain autonomy over land and agriculture decisions.",
    "The protests Wednesday were sparked by a local group\u2019s call for a strike after two residents collapsed while participating in a hunger strike with more than a dozen residents who were making statehood demands.",
    "India\u2019s Home Ministry said in a statement late Wednesday that police fired in \u201cself-defence\u201d and blamed the violence on \u201cprovocative speeches\u201d by a top climate activist, Sonam Wangchuk, who had led the hunger strike since Sep 10. Wangchuk called off the strike after the clashes.",
    "Wednesday\u2019s violence was the worst in the Ladakh region in decades and signalled residents\u2019 growing frustration with Indian authorities. Residents initially welcomed New Delhi\u2019s 2019 changes, but their joy soon gave way to fears of land grabs, a loss of trade and damage to the fragile ecosystem of the region\u2019s high-altitude deserts.",
    "Ladakh representatives have held several unsuccessful rounds of talks with Indian officials. Another meeting is scheduled for Oct 6.",
    "Ladakh\u2019s sparsely populated villages have faced territorial disputes and suffered from the effects of climate change, including floods, landslides and droughts.",
    "The rugged region\u2019s thousands of glaciers have receded at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people. Pollution contributing to the melting has worsened due to the region\u2019s militarisation, which has intensified since 2020 in a deadly military standoff between India and China."
