Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



"Excise licenses granted under rules. Gov't earns 3.1Bn in 9 months. Fees increased & new amendments implemented Feb 2024. Annual permit fee: 1Mn. Liquor licenses auctioned, 25% fund for relaxation measures. Court case on license issuance due to public complaints."

ЁЯЯй

In a statement issued by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's office, all the licenses are granted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Department of Excise.

The announcement also stated that the total income earned by the government in the nine months through the prosecuting Uri Mangal will be over 3.1 billion rupees.

After independence, the government did not charge money to grant the excise license until 2022. By then, the tendency to lose direct taxes in the country was shown. At the time, the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Ways told the government to take appropriate action to get rid of the country's rigorous economic bankruptcy. Accordingly, as an alternative to the immediate direct tax loss, it was decided to increase the government's revenue, collect money and grant the excise license.

### TongaтАЩs prime minister quits moments ahead of no-confidence motion in parliament

TongaтАЩs Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned in parliament on Monday ahead of a planned no-confidence vote in his leadership, capping a period of fraught relations between his government and TongaтАЩs king.

Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.

His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between TongaтАЩs monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010.

### Remittance inflows face twin declines: month-on-month and year-on-year

This means that remittance inflows have declined by US$ 57 million month-on-month, and by US$ 7 million year-on-year in spite of the fact that more migrant workers are supposedly remitting their money to Sri Lanka.

However, there is an encouraging ray of hope for the domestic economy as earnings from tourism have amounted to US dollars 272.9 mn in November 2024, compared to US dollars 185.6 mn in October 2024 and US dollars 205.3 mn in November 2023.

Another metric that adds to this optimism is during the year up to 06th December 2024, the Sri Lanka rupee has appreciated against the US dollar by 11.5 per cent.

I read a long rant about the online submission of taxes posted on X, formerly Twitter, on the last day for submitting income-tax returns.

But the most important sentences were: тАЬNow I understand that this is the first time they are doing this online and it is bound to be bumpy. Woe be it if they go back to paper.тАЭ

I too had spent many hours, standing in line to get my PIN, staring at the screen waiting for the system to respond, etc. I had gone through the same torturous process but strangely I experienced no rage. Was it simply because I was double my friendтАЩs age?

Hence, any loan being granted is a measure to take that stress out of him. That requires a banker to extend a supportive hand to the borrower. If he does not do so, the prospective borrowers will be driven to the informal money lenders who will supply the needed funds more conveniently but at rates and under conditions that will not help them to sustain their businesses
