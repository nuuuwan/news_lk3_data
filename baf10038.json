    "Melbourne, Australia, is where most Sri Lankans reside, and it was only natural that Sri Lankans, at this end, were concerned when they heard about the magnitude-4.6 tremor that hit Melbourne.",
    "However, not many Sri Lankans, in Melbourne, experienced it and life goes on, as usual, especially where the entertainment scene is concerned.",
    "who reports on all the showbiz happenings, in Melbourne, did experience a little \u2018shake, rattle and roll.\u2019",
    "Says Trevine: \u201cWoke up in shock, in the middle of the night, with the house shaking and rumbling. Anne and I were perplexed at first, then realized it could have been an earthquake. It sure was. We felt the earth, move, under our feet\u20264.6 on the Richter scale, apparently.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, gosh I did. I went to bed around 10.30 pm and woke up to it, around 1.30 am. My bedroom windows were rattling and it was noisy. I thought someone had broken in. It was for a few seconds. I woke up, went out of the room and then realised it was an earthquake!",
    "\u201cI was at home, after a band rehearsal, and the cats were asleep on the couch as I was watching TV. They woke up, looked at me, then went back to sleep. It was a small happening. The last earthquake was much bigger where I was, and both cats hid under the bed for about an hour.\u201d (Andrea was referring to the major magnitude-5.9 earthquake that rocked Melbourne, in September 2021.)",
    "who is seen and heard regularly, keeping the Sri Lankans, especially in Melbourne, entertained, says he didn\u2019t experience anything.",
