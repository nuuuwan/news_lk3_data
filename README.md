In contrast to the Presidential Election 2024, where TISL recorded 33 complaints about the misuse of State funds and 48 complaints concerning State vehicles, the General Election period saw only three complaints about the misuse of State funds and one regarding State vehicles. Importantly, no complaints were received about the misuse of State power or positions during this election.

TISL monitored the recently concluded General Election with a special emphasis on the misuse of public resources. A team of 200 Election Observers was deployed across all districts. Overall, TISL received 1,092 complaints, the majority of which (889) pertained to the illegal display of posters, cut-outs, banners, and other unauthorised materials in public spaces.

### Poverty of CBSL‚Äôs monetary policies: Part 1

The economic consequences of the CBSL losing control over interest rates cannot be overstated

What is notable is not only that the CBSL continues to adhere to its flawed notion of money printing despite the evident logical issues in its interpretation, but also that it persists in its commitment to the quantity theory of money (QTM)‚Äîor at least its own variant of this theory. This is in spite of the numerous and growing criticisms from researchers in central banks across the world, including those considered to be at the forefront of research in monetary policy, such as the US and the UK

The CBSL does not appear to be fully committed to setting and targeting money market interest rates, which requires it to allow the quantity of cash to be determined by the market. In fact, as the IMF observes, the CBSL seems to be permitting the market, rather than policy, to set money market rates, while managing liquidity to prevent instability in these rates

There are, it is said jocularly in circles where wit is observational of everyone else but oneself, three types of people: those who make things happen, those who watch while it is happening, and those who wonder: ‚Äòwhat happened?‚Äô

What happened was that the threefold cord which is not quickly broken snapped suddenly after ever-increasing tension over the years.

Sales for the existing Private Label Manufacturing Division were also supported by the ongoing recovery in demand from its key brand partners across the US and Europe.
