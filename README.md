Sri Lanka is set to hold a Presidential Election in September this year, followed closely by a General Election. However, the country continues to grapple with widespread allegations of malfunction, corruption, fraud, nepotism, and the pervasive influence of party politics across nearly every facet of society.

Over the last 70 years since independence, our governing political parties and coalitions have introduced policies under the guise of Capitalism, Socialism, and Liberalism. They have also advocated local and foreign policies based on Americanisation, Europeanisation, Neutralisation (non-aligned), Globalisation, “Chineseisation” and more recently possible “Indianisation.” All political parties and their coalitions came to power insisting that there was “no other way” to develop the nation other than through the emulation and absorption of one of these political cultures and their policies for economic, social, and political development.

### To All Presidential Candidates: Harnessing The Ocean: A Strategic Economic Plan For Sri Lanka

*2024-08-12 20:56:12* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/to-all-presidential-candidates-harnessing-the-ocean-a-strategic-economic-plan-for-sri-lanka/) · `en`

As the race for the presidency intensifies, it is disheartening to see some candidates failing to present concrete economic plans. Instead, they resort to empty rhetoric, hoping to win over voters with hollow promises. However, politics is not a game of words; it requires well-thought-out strategies. Among the most critical elements that any serious economic plan must include is the ocean—an invaluable resource that has long been overlooked.

Sri Lanka is often described as a nation sitting on a treasure chest, surrounded by the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean. This includes a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a significant confidential shelf landmass rich in valuable graphite. Yet, despite the wealth of resources it offers, there has been no comprehensive plan to unlock its true potential. The ocean is not just a body of water; it is a reservoir of economic opportunities that could propel our nation to new heights.

### The Psychology Of Money: A Book Review

*2024-08-12 20:47:24* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-psychology-of-money-a-book-review/) · `en`

In the modern world, money is considered as a key to unlocking various barriers to success in someone’s lifetime. As a result, many of us put tremendous effort into learning about various techniques to earn money as fast as possible.  On this journey, have you ever thought about the role of psychology when dealing with money? In his world-best-selling book, titled “The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness” published by Harriman House, Mogan Housel has provided some interesting insights into this arena. In this, he primarily argues that doing well with money has little to do with technical knowledge and a lot to do with our behaviour, which is guided by our thoughts.

In my opinion, this book will assist readers in finding answers to some fundamental questions related to our daily financial life.

If we are to thrive, as a nation, in this dynamic landscape, we must adopt a mindset that is not fearful of change

As we prepare to vote in the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka, let us recognise some hard truths. Sri Lanka has very little to show after 76 years of independence. Selfish, sleazy, sly, corrupt and unaccountable leaders and their Governments have, through their policies, actions, and inactions, over the past several years, led the country into various political and economic crises ranging from ethnic conflicts including a 30-year-long civil war, insurrections, constitutional uprisings, race-based riots, ‘Easter bombings’ to economic collapse, social discord and bankruptcy. Bribery and corruption pervade every nook and corner of the system. It has been the scourge of our society particularly in the past half century
