BBC: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war against Hamas amid international condemnation of an air strike that killed scores of Palestinians in Rafah on Sunday.

At least 45 people were killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, while hundreds more were treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds.

Mr Netanyahu said the strike was a “tragic mishap” but added: “I don’t intend to end the war before every goal has been achieved.”

He said it was vital that Israel took “every precaution possible” to protect civilians, and insisted that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) were using their “best efforts not to harm those uninvolved” in the conflict.

The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday, at Algeria’s request, to discuss the Rafah strike.

In a statement on Monday, UN secretary general António Guterres said the strike had “killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict”.

Spain, Ireland and Norway have formally recognised a Palestinian state, in what they say is an attempt to refocus attention on efforts to find a political solution to the war in the Middle East.

They hope by acting together they will encourage other European countries to follow suit, in a diplomatic push that could help secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The symbolic decision has provoked a furious row with Israel’s government which has accused all three countries of rewarding terrorism.

Israel has withdrawn its ambassadors from Ireland, Norway and Spain and formally reprimanded their envoys in Tel Aviv. All three were summoned to Israel’s foreign ministry last week to be shown footage of the 7 October attacks in front of the media.

The Minister also stated that legal arrangements are being made for the project, which is to be implemented in parallel with the "Karusaru" program.

The Minister said this at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Center on Tuesday 28th.

Some accuse people that they have no peace of mind to celebrate festivals. But the government, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has created an environment where Vesak and Poson are celebrated only to celebrate the festival.. So I would say that those who make the accusations compare the current status last year. The peace of mind that people have lost have been restored.

This country is not the country to begging. This is not a country that people have to suffer. This is not a country that people want to starve, this is a gem with all natural resources, such as a gem and people die without food. There are homeless people. We will build a country where everyone can live together.

Recently, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara took to X, formally known as Twitter, to announce the conclusion of intense negotiation between the Government and Adani Group. Under this, the country will purchase power from wind plants built by the latter at 8.26 US cents a kilowatt hour for 20 years, to be paid in LKR on the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment. “On the current exchange rate considered as, 1 USD = Rs 300, the cost of energy will be Rs 24.78 per kWh.

India’s Adani group has proposed to invest about $ 740 million in the country to set up two wind power projects with a cumulative generation capacity of 484 MW. The tariff is by far the best the country has seen, as is evident from the given table.

### Tea and lack of empathy

For years, even before our country received independence, it was the income from the tea industry which formed the backbone of our country’s economy. Even after independence, it was the income from tea that provided the main export earnings that kept the economic wheels of the country turning.

Even today tea provides the third highest portion of the Lankan economy behind the earnings of expatriate workers and the textile trade.

Sri Lanka’s tea export earnings crossed US $ 1 billion for the first time in history in 2008. Sri Lanka is the first country to achieve this feat.

During the financial year 2022 to 2023, according to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, export earnings from tea made up 12% of merchandise exports, an increase of 3.57 % year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to US$ 111.12 Mn in December 2023 compared to December 2022.

This is despite a drop in production in 2022 because of the industry being hit by a fertiliser shortage caused by an ill-advised agrochemical ban.

### From three-wheeler drivers to beach boys: Sri Lanka’s workforce transformation

To end the intergenerational degradation of the country’s youth, the government should create 250,000 university and vocational training opportunities. Else, we are doomed as a nation

For a country that takes pride in its free education system, Sri Lanka has done a miserable job in putting its human capital to productive work.

That is the story since the independence, but let’s leave the first three decades defined by quasi-socialist policies and skyrocketing fertility growths, which created enormous pressure on the state. But the story has not changed much since the economy was liberalized, and population growth is well under control- fertility growth now is barely at replacement level or less.

One might observe a few concerted areas where the bulk of jobs were made available for the Sri Lankan youth during the last four decades.

### Corporate head office – creator or destroyer of value in a conglomerate

The corporate centre of a conglomerate can be value accretive or value destructive to the conglomerate

The best parent companies are those which create more value than any other rival if they owned the same business. Such businesses are deemed to have parenting advantage. In the same way that business strategy gives rise to competitive advantage, it is the corporate level strategy of a conglomerate which gives life to the parenting advantage of a constituent subsidiary. A business will enjoy a parenting advantage only if a parenting opportunity exists. When a corporate parent identifies such opportunities and addresses them with actions which give a positive net present value it will improve the value of the business and, subject to the idiosyncrasies of the market, improve the market value of the parent’s share too

Former Cabinet Minister, Nuwara Eliya district Parliamentarian and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) leader Arumugan Thondaman would have celebrated his 60th birthday on 29 May, if he were alive today. Thondaman passed away due to a cardiac arrest four days before his 56th birthday four years ago on 26 May 2020. He was serving as a Minister in the cabinet of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the time of his death. This week’s “Political Pulse” – with the aid of my previous writings – focuses on Arumugan Thondaman to denote his 60th birth anniversary.

Let me begin with two points about his name and pet name. Thondaman’s first name Arumugan is spelled with an N at the end. However it is frequently misspelled by the media as Arumugam with an M instead of N. I too have been guilty of this error at times. I remember his illustrious grandfather Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman gently admonishing me once “He is Arumugan not Arumugam”.

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has roots that stretch back decades, to a time when the geopolitical landscape of Europe was dramatically shifting. In the aftermath of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union disintegrated, new alliances and understandings were formed. Among these was an untold agreement between Russia and NATO, which plays a crucial role in understanding the current crisis.

As the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain was lifted, the world witnessed a remarkable transformation. The Soviet Union’s collapse left the United States as the sole superpower, with the promise of a new era of peace and cooperation. However, this period of optimism was underpinned by delicate negotiations and promises, many of which were not formally documented but were significant in shaping international relations.
