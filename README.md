ECONOMYNEXT тАУ She was ridiculed when she started to express her mind against social injustice to the public like a Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna activists while teaching as a lecturer at Open University of Sri Lanka, but Harini Nireka Amarasuriya never had an idea that she will end up as the island nationтАЩs Prime Minister.

An old girl of Bishops College, Colombo, Amarasuriya was outspoken against social injustice when she was young. She believes it came from her father.

Her first job as a social health officer, who dealt with sidelined women in early 1990s including AIDS patients and the war-affected, also helped her to connect any layers in the country тАУ from professionals to uneducated people, from the rich to poor, and from elitists to the underprivileged people.

### Restraint on economy and full-steam on governance тАУ AKDтАЩs implicit strategy?

*2024-09-25 04:45:20* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Restraint-on-economy-and-full-steam-on-governance-AKD-s-implicit-strategy/4-767104) ┬╖ `en`

What will be the strategy of the new President who soon will be going into a Parliamentary election? My reading is that the implicit strategy of AKD is to practice restraint on economic issues and go full steam on governance. This is evident from the way the campaign progressed with convergence on the economic front between candidates, but with AKD managing to rise above others with his convincing battle cry to restore trust in politicians and politics.

If that indeed is the strategy, it will be a win-win for all concerned.

Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of the 42% who voted for AKD, there is the 58% who did not. AKD won first-past-the-post, but the electoral result is clearly a mandate for consultation and compromise to take the concerns of at least some of the other 58%.

The economy and the political culture were the main issues in the campaign, but the NPP manifesto was short on details on each.

### Middle class angst of Karl Marx

*2024-09-25 04:40:37* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Middle-class-angst-of-Karl-Marx/4-767103) ┬╖ `en`

Karl Marx made some prophetic and positive observations about capitalism

The collapse of the Soviet Union, ChinaтАЩs adoption of market driven policy, North KoreaтАЩs boorish behaviour and the history of brutal, totalitarian regimes that claimed to be тАЬMarxistтАЭ have contributed to the erroneous notion that Karl Marx was an authoritarian thinker.

Some of my granddaughters have asked me who this Karl Marx was. I told them that Karl Marx was an Enlightenment age humanist and a philosopher who perceived the possibility of a utopian post capitalist society in which people could lead rich, fulfilling lives.

I also explained that Karl Marx said some very positive stuff about тАШCapitalismтАЩ and that distinguished economists such as Kenneth Arrow regard his work as a revolutionary historical project.

Hence this brief essay. If its order and reasoning is a little convoluted, I request the indulgence of the reader for some allowance towards the muddled memory of a weary pilgrim.

There is no doubt that Ariyanethran's attempt to contest the election has created a political awareness and mobilization among the Tamil people due to the self -interest of the Tamil National Uprising.

He contested the invitation of the general structure and contested this presidential election without any precedent for a short period of time and was working to mobilize the Tamil people as a youth, like a youth, without any boredom, hesitation or exhaustion.
