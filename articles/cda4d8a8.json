    "To enable female waitresses to work night shifts, the regulations issued under the Shop and Office of 1954 will be revised.",
    "The restriction created operational problems, and to keep with changing work practices around the world, rules have to be changed, Minister Jayatissa said.",
    "When there are tight regulations, companies may avoid hiring women, and hire men instead, leading to less employment opportunities for women, analysts say.",
    "Sri Lanka has high female unemployment due to a number of reasons.",
