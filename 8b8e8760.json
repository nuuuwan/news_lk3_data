  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s politicians and economists have given contradictory \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 style orders to Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank in the run up to the worst currency crises created by the agency, according to revelations made in parliament.",
    "On March 23, 2020, then Secretary to the President, an economist and former central banker, had written to Central Bank Governor W D Lakshman, opposition legislator Harsha de Silva told parliament.",
    "The letter had ordered the central bank \u201cto take immediate steps to stabilize the exchange rate around 185 to the US dollar,\u201d de Silva said in a debate over new International Monetary fund backed central bank law, which has a bewildering set of contradictory goals and objectives and weak or no accountability, according to critics.",
    "\u201cWho says? The secretary says, saying the President said. The President had decided to keep the exchange at 185. How can he take the decision to manage the exchange rate?\u201d",
    "The letter had also ordered the central bank to \u2018issue above-mentioned directions as His Excellency directed me to follow up,\u201d de Silva revealed.",
    "There was another letter, where 10 directions had been given, de Silva said.",
    "Orders were given to release 250 million US dollars to bring the rupee back to 185 to the US dollar from 202.",
    "But the letter also ordered interest rates to be kept at 4.2 percent and some other interest rates at some other fixes.",
    "It is not clear whether Rajapaksa did it on his own initiative or whether macro-economists who advised the then administration suggested that the interest rate be fixed.",
    "In order to maintain a fixed exchange rate, the dollar sales has to suck up liquidity and short term rates have to rise.",
    "In countries like Sri Lanka, the currency collapses because dollar interventions are offset by money printing through various liquidity tools (open market operations) to maintain a policy rate especially when domestic credit is growing.",
    "The fixed policy rate of a reserve collecting central bank violates the so-called impossible trinity of monetary policy objectives (also described as ISLM-BOP), a problem that has created external instability under \u2018data driven flexible inflation targeting\u2019 in the second year of an IMF program in Sri Lanka as domestic credit recovers amid low inflation.",
    "The fixed policy rate was invented in the 1920s by the Federal Reserve which led to the Great Depression and the emergence of balance of payments deficits in other central banks which adopted it, critics say.",
    "The fixed policy rate led to exchange controls, rationing, price controls and balance of payments crises (and default in extreme cases) in peacetime, problems that were mostly limited to war time before 1920.",
    "Before the emergence of Keynesianism or \u2018Cambridge economics\u2019, the interests of politicians and classical economists converged to maintain a strong exchange rate in relation to specie or another stable money, as they do in successful East Asian countries to this day.",
    "The US Treasury (and the IMF) strongly discouraged fixed exchange rates, wrongly believing that the policy makes a country an export powerhouse at the expense of the US trade deficit.",
    "The US frequently labels countries that deploy deflationary open market operations to exchange rates stable; they are currency manipulators.",
    "In East Asian countries with stable exchange rates, the interest of the politicians and the central bankers \u2013 who have rejected Anglophone macro-economics promoted by the IMF \u2013 also still coincide as they did in classical Britain the 19th century when there were no BOP deficits and inflation was not permanent.",
    "A few years ago in Sri Lanka, the IMF taught the country\u2019s central bank, which only had a stability mandate under its old law, how to calculate a potential output, which was then used by macroeconomists to print money.",
    "Vietnam is the latest country in East Asia to defy the IMF and the US Treasury and operate stable exchange rates based on classical principles instead of targeting inflation using mindless econometrics (data driven monetary policy) ignoring the BOP and currency depreciation, critics say.",
    "Vietnam started to hike rates from October 222, with inflation only at 2.79 percent by September, as BOP troubles emerged from open market operations.",
    "State Bank of Vietnam Governor Nguyen Thi Hong went to parliament to explain the need to stabilize the exchange rate.",
    "\u201cNow the Central Bank has to raise interest rates to control the exchange rate,\u201d Governor Thi Hong told delegates of the National Assembly in October 2022.",
    "\u201cBecause if interest rates are kept stable, it will not be able to contribute to stabilizing the foreign exchange market. (V\u00ec n\u1ebfu nh\u01b0 m\u00e0 \u1ed5n \u0111\u1ecbnh l\u00e3i su\u1ea5t th\u00ec kh\u00f4ng th\u1ec3 n\u00e0o g\u00f3p ph\u1ea7n \u1ed5n \u0111\u1ecbnh th\u1ecb tr\u01b0\u1eddng ngo\u1ea1i h\u1ed1i)",
    "\u201cBut stabilizing the foreign exchange market is very important for foreign investors\u2019 confidence in Vietnam. (\u1ed4n \u0111\u1ecbnh th\u1ecb tr\u01b0\u1eddng ngo\u1ea1i h\u1ed1i th\u00ec r\u1ea5t quan tr\u1ecdng \u0111\u1ed1i v\u1edbi ni\u1ec1m tin c\u1ee7a c\u00e1c nh\u00e0 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 n\u01b0\u1edbc ngo\u00e0i v\u00e0o VN.)",
    "\u201cHigh lending rates may be unfavorable for businesses, but ensuring long-term macroeconomic stability is essential for them to recover and thrive,\u201d Governor Thi Hong said.",
    "Vietnam has explained to the US earlier that it was not manipulating the currency by keeping the Vietnam Dong strong but was simply using it as a stabilization tool.",
    "By October 2022, Vietnam had lost a quarter of her foreign reserves, by keeping policy rates low because inflation is low, and the country with exports of 300 billion US dollars was facing fuel ques like Sri Lanka.",
    "Reserves had fallen after three months of imports, and the exchange rate had hit around 24,800 dong to the US dollar and EVN (Vietnam\u2019s equivalent of the CEB) was running losses.",
    "Politicians were reluctant to hike prices as Governo Thi Hong focused on stabilizing the exchange rate, hiking rates and slamming credit controls.",
    "Vietnam has now reigned in the exchange rate back to 23,500 to the US dollar, while neighboring Laos with an IMF style flexible exchange rate is in shambles.",
    "The country\u2019s biggest public sector losses are in energy utilities due to the \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019.",
    "Vietnam has strongly resisted IMF pressure to adopt formal flexible inflation targeting and also resisted setting up a standing liquidity facility and operates a wide policy corridor managed with two-way auctions.",
    "Intra-day liquidity is provided at 1 percent higher than the corridor to discourage bank overtrading. In Sri Lanka intra-day liquidity is free.",
    "An exchange rate, especially if mandated by laws, is a simple and transparent rule (external anchor) that keeps in check macro-economists obsessed with using open market operations to cut rates.",
    "Defaulting countries like Ghana also use a flexible exchange rate with an inflation target higher than Sri Lanka where macro-economists can blow the balance of payments apart even more easily.",
    "In countries without balance of payments crises which do not keep going to the IMF, like Hong Kong or Singapore, there is no policy rate. Vietnam has a wide corridor allowing rates to adjust to forex interventions. The ceiling rate is jettisoned when BOP pressure emerges for a few months in row.",
    "Vietnam rejects IMF-backed Sri Lanka-style policy in bid for monetary stability",
    "Vietnam foreign reserves plunge US$15.6bn in 3Q as exports soar",
    "Legislator Kabir Hashim warned Sri Lanka to observe what successful countries are doing, instead of following the strategies of countries like Pakistan and Nigeria.",
    "\u201cPlease look at the regimes used in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and leading Middle Eastern countries,\u201d Hashim said.",
    "\u201cLearn from other countries that have done this right. Learn the right lessons.\u201d",
    "Defaulting countries like Ghana also use a flexible exchange rate with an inflation target higher than Sri Lanka.",
    "Before the Bank of England was nationalized and Cambridge economists started to mislead the public about the ability of central banks to cut rates, bust currencies and boost economic growth or exports, parliaments by law required the agency to have a fixed exchange rate and lawmakers had to approve a devaluation or float through the Bank Restrictions Act.",
    "In the 19th century classical economists like David Ricardo, got themselves elected to parliament to reinstate the fixed exchange rate to specie eventually making the Sterling the pre-eminent global currency. (Colombo/July23/2023 \u2013 paragraph 2 date corrected to March 23, 2020)"
