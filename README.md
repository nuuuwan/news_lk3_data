### Sri LankaтАЩs ill-fated LRT тАУ following a train of thought  from policy derailment to being back on the right track

GOSL decided to terminate the project with no alternative solution to the traffic congestion issue being proposed

On 27 December, the railway community in Sri Lanka as well as national-minded islanders commemorate the day on which the inaugural Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) train ran between Colombo Fort and Ambepussa (34 miles on the main line) in 1864.

A day before that, the same demographic remembers with grief and sorrow the cataclysmic effect of the Indian Ocean tsunami which devastated a 1,500 passenger train at Peraliya on 26 December 2004, taking a toll of over 1,000 lives in a disaster that saw an estimated 30,000 deaths.

To the credit of Sri Lanka Railways, the destroyed locomotive тАУ a Class M2a EMD-G12 (тАШManitobaтАЩ), imported under the Colombo Plan in 1956 тАУ was fully restored a few years later, and makes its regular run on тАШD-DayтАЩ annually, heading Train No. 8051 (#51).

### Red baby elephants, Ranil as godfather and dangerous external liaisons

Sri Lankans have been politically scammed as never before. With AKD and the NPP, thereтАЩs been generational, gender and governance change, no structural reform (let alone тАШsystem-changeтАЩ), and most crucially no change of economic policy paradigm and corporate/superrich bias. In an inversion of their mandate, thereтАЩs stark continuity in the economic policy framework that caused Sri LankaтАЩs debt crisis and perpetuates mass economic austerity.

As presidential candidate Anura emphasised improvement of human resources, upgrading of human capital, as his economic keystone, but his presidential policies have placed the keystone in the opposite direction, and his macroeconomic commitments are and cannot but be ruinous to human resources/human capital.

### Speakers of Sri Lanka: тАЬHonourableтАЭ guardians of ParliamentтАЩs sovereignty

*2024-12-27 02:47:14* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Speakers-of-Sri-Lanka-Honourable-guardians-of-Parliament-s-sovereignty/4-771038) ┬╖ `en`

SeasonтАЩs greetings to all readers! Let me begin the second part of this article on the speakers of Sri Lanka with a reference to former Speaker Asoka Ranwala. A source who is usually well-informed about matters concerning the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) got in touch with me a few days ago. He said that ex-Speaker Ranwala had indeed acquired a doctoral degree from Japan.

According to this JVP/NPP тАЬpartisanтАЭ source, Asoka Ranwala has indeed acquired a PhD from a Japanese institution of higher learning and is therefore entitled to the prefix тАЬDrтАЭ. Apparently Ranwala, a longstanding activist of the JVP, had тАЬescapedтАЭ from Sri Lanka when the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime had cracked down hard on the JVP in the 1989-90 period. Ranwala had made his way to Japan and resided there for several years, stated this source.

### Is тАЬ the Writing on the WallтАЭ for  the Thirteenth  Constitutional Amendment?

*2024-12-27 01:11:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=85250) ┬╖ `en`

тАЬ The  Writing on the WallтАЩis a figurative expression derived from the story of Daniel in the old testament of the Bible. Chapter five of the book of Daniel relates how the then monarch of the Babylonian empire  Belshazzar and his cronies were feasting and drinking in the night when a hand appeared miraculously and wrote some letters on the wall.

The terrified King and his acolytes were unable to read and understand what had been written. He sent  for Daniel renowned for his knowledge and wisdom. Daniel informed   Belshazzar that God has numbered the kingтАЩs days and that his kingdom would be given away. DanielтАЩs interpretation of the writing on the wall comes true.  Belshazzar is killed that night and his kingdom is taken over by Darius.

ECONOMYNEXT  тАУ Sri Lanka ceremonially welcomed the two millionth tourist to arrive in the country on December 26, who arrived on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight a government statement said.

He was greeted by Deputy Minister of Tourism Ruwan Ranasinghe, along with the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Buddhika Hewawasam.

Sri Lanka welcomed 2.3 million tourists in 2018, but the numbers fell from then on due to Easter Sunday bombings, the Covid pandemic and in 2022 due to a currency crisis coming from central bank rate cuts enforced with printed money.

As of December 26, 195,127 tourists have arrived in December alone.

Authorities expect 256,389 tourist to land in the country by the year end which will take the total for the year to 2.061 million.

Sri Lanka originally project arrivals of 2.3 million, but the shift to website operated by VFS Global, IVS-GBS, despite protests from the tourist industry against scrapping an easy-to-use existing system, led to a crisis in the sector.

### Bangladesh to re-investigate 2009 mutiny massacre, role of тАШforeignтАЩ backers

*2024-12-26 16:38:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104510/bangladesh-to-re-investigate-2009-mutiny-massacre-role-of-foreign-backers) ┬╖ `en`

Bangladesh on Thursday ordered a commission to investigate a failed 2009 army mutiny and subsequent crackdown, including the role of alleged тАЬforeignтАЭ backers, the inquiry chief said.

The violent mutiny sent shock waves through the South Asian nation and ended with the army crushing the mutineers, with scores arrested and sentenced to death.

A previous official investigation into the mutiny which left scores dead blamed years of pent-up anger among ordinary soldiers, who felt their appeals for pay rises and better treatment were ignored.

But that probe was carried out during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister by a revolution in August, when she fled to old ally India.

Since her fall, families of soldiers killed in the violence have been campaigning to reopen the investigation.

They have repeatedly accused Hasina -- then newly elected -- of orchestrating a plan to weaken the military to bolster her own power in a country prone to coups.
