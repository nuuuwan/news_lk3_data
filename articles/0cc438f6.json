    "The preferential vote or manape, as it is popularly known, has become a hot topic again. Some Opposition politicians have accused the JVP/NPP of asking its supporters not to mark preferences for its candidates in the upcoming parliamentary election. The NPP has denied their allegation as a propaganda lie aimed at misleading the public; it has however admitted that, as a matter of principle, it does not encourage its supporters to mark preferences and its candidates never clash over manape. The veracity of its claim is borne out by the fact that the JVP/NPP is free from internecine manape battles, which plague other political parties, especially in the run-up to parliamentary elections. The preferential vote usually leads to intraparty poster wars, and even violence in some cases.",
    "Naturally, manape has become the bugbear of civil society activists on a mission to root out election malpractices and violence; they consider it the mother of all intraparty disputes, which spill over onto streets. Curiously, they and political party leaders see eye to eye on this score. While the civil society groups campaigning for free and fair elections are driven by a genuine desire to ensure Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic wellbeing and restore public faith in the electoral process, politicians are opposing  manape with an ulterior motive.",
    "The preferential vote mechanism was introduced, under the Proportional Representation system, to enable electors to ensure that their favourite candidates benefit from their votes in an electoral contest. They can mark three preferences, after voting for a political party, and thereby indicate the candidates who, they think, should represent them. If the preferential vote is eliminated, electors will be left with no alternative but to vote for political parties, and in such an eventuality, the party chiefs will have  carte blanche to handpick the candidates in their good books for the parliamentary seats allocated to their outfits at the expense of the popular candidates. In other words, the party leaders will be able to nominate their kith and kin and make them MPs with the votes polled by popular candidates, the way they make National List appointments.",
    "Even at present, party bosses can appoint as MPs their favourites leaving out the deserving candidates unless voters mark preferences on their ballot papers religiously. They can canvass for preferential votes for the candidates of their choice on the sly, and, in fact, they do so. In such a situation, the candidates representing minor parties in a coalition are at a disadvantage, for the leaders of the largest constituents can secretly help their party members in the fray obtain preferential votes and enter Parliament. One may recall that the Rajapaksas employed that method successfully to enable their favourites to top preferential vote lists in the 2020 parliamentary election.",
    "Thus, it may be seen that unless voters mark preferences in the upcoming general election, the beneficiaries will be the candidates representing the largest constituents of coalitions. In the case of the JVP-led NPP, unless those who vote for it mark preferences, the non-JVP candidates could be at a disadvantage as the JVP may be able to ensure that its own candidates enter Parliament. The same goes for the candidates fielded by the Samagi Jana Sandayana on the SJB ticket.",
    "Given how crafty political party chiefs manipulate the electoral process to the benefit of their favoured ones at present, how bad the situation will be if the preferential vote mechanism is done away is not difficult to imagine.",
    "Intraparty disputes and violent incidents during election campaigns should be blamed on political leaders who cannot control their candidates and not the preferential vote. The solution is for the political parties affected by manape battles to find leaders who are capable of enforcing discipline among party members and candidates.",
