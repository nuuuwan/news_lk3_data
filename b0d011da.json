  "original_body_lines": [
    "Economic conditions and challenges prevailing last year have moderated somewhat, given the steadfast approach by policy makers and regulatory authorities towards economic recovery. We appreciate their efforts, and our results bear testimony to the progress made. Nevertheless, the road ahead remains challenging. A meaningful government budget, continued success of the IMF program, general price stability and regained momentum in tourism, remittances and exports will be key in shaping the country\u2019s short- to medium- term economic revival, a Cargills Bank press release said.",
    "The release adds: \u2018Cargills Bank\u2019s results for the nine months ended 30 September 2023 reflected continuing QoQ improvement in profitability. Profit after tax at Rs. 432 Mn was higher by Rs. 324 Mn than in the corresponding period of 2022. We are pleased the Bank has been able to maintain this momentum of profitability growth, and are confident the results of 2023 will reflect the strong commitment of the Bank\u2019s team, successful execution of its strategy, a continued rigorous focus on market trends and its adaptability to a volatile environment.",
    "\u2018Net interest income grew 15% or Rs. 353 Mn in the nine months compared with the corresponding period of 2022. The Bank directed its resources towards higher yielding assets, hedging interest rate risk and prudently managing deposits. In addition, close monitoring of the Bank\u2019s lending portfolio and timely solutions offered to financially stressed customers helped maintain a healthy NIM to date.",
    "\u2018Net fee and commission income of Rs. 590 Mn for the nine months was lower than the Rs. 641 Mn in the previous year. The decrease of 6% related largely to lower trade volumes and reduced net income from card related services. Additionally, capital gains realized on derecognition of financial assets, and higher foreign exchange income boosted other income streams by Rs. 265 Mn, to Rs. 391 Mn in the nine months.",
    "\u2018Total operating expenses increased 25% from Rs. 1.7 Bn last year to Rs. 2.1 Bn. Personnel expenses increased 15% largely due to adjustments to salary and welfare benefits considering increased costs of living and market conditions. Other operating expenses grew 44% mainly from the impact of the Social Security Contribution Levy which was effective from October 2022, the increased cost of utilities and the cost of repair and maintenance of IT assets, particularly where denominated in foreign currencies.",
    "\u2018Impairment charges totaling Rs. 607 Mn reflected a reduction of 50% in the first nine months of 2023 evidencing a focused and proactive management of delinquencies and commendable overall team efforts in this direction. The Bank\u2019s Stage 3 Loans (net of Stage 3 Impairment) to Total Loans Ratio stood at 6.64% while Stage 3 Provision Cover was 52.74% at 30th September 2023. Additional impairment overlays considered necessary have been incorporated after a careful scrutiny of the status of borrowers.",
    "\u2018VAT on Financial Services and income tax expenses increased substantially mainly due to growth in profits and the increased corporate income tax rate effective 1 October 2022.",
    "\u2018The Bank maintains Capital Adequacy and Liquid Assets Ratios well above the minimum requirements prescribed by the Central Bank. The total Capital Adequacy Ratio was 20.43% while the Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio stood at 37.72%.",
    "\u2018Total assets of the Bank at 30 September stood at Rs. 64.7 Bn, an increase of 20% or Rs. 11 Bn in the first nine months of the year. Financial Assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income grew by 92% to reach Rs. 19.6 Bn. Positive gains were reflected in Other Comprehensive Income. The loan book registered moderate growth, from Rs. 36.0 Bn to Rs. 36.8 Bn, given conditions prevailing. In this regard, the Bank exercised care in maintaining the quality of its lending in a high interest rate environment, where interest payments threatened borrowers\u2019 viability. A shift in strategy commenced in the latter part of the period, to rebuild momentum in lending.",
    "\u2018Deposits to customers grew 20% from Rs. 37.8 Bn at the end of 2022 to Rs. 44.9 Bn at the reporting date amidst continued reductions in market interest rates. The Bank will judiciously balance interest expenditure and income, as substantial reductions in interest rates and the time lag in repricing loans have a direct impact on NIMs.",
    "\u2018In October 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed Cargills Bank\u2019s National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A(lka)\u2019; Negative Outlook.",
    "\u2018Ms Ruvini Fernando, who has served as a Director since 1 August 2018, resigned from the Bank\u2019s Board on 27 October 2023 due to personal circumstances. Mr Arjuna Herath has been appointed to the Bank\u2019s Board effective 1 November 2023.",
    "\u2018The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has approved the listing of the Bank\u2019s shares on the CSE. Steps are being taken to duly offer to the public 62.5 Mn shares of the Bank at Rs. 8.oo per share through an Initial Public Offering.\u2019",
