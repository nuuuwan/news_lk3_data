BoC as the largest local commercial bank of the country, it is vital to carefully manage the banking activities to support economic recovery and revival at large. Hence, in next couple of years the Bank\u2019s key focus will be strengthening its Balance Sheet instead of short-term profitability. Similarly, the Bank has adopted the same strongly during last few years too.",
