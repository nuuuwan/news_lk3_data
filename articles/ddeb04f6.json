    "Sri Lanka, which is struggling to put its worst-ever economic crisis behind it, finds itself in another dilemma. It had to ban vehicle imports to rebuild its foreign currency reserves. That method proved effective in the short run. But the adoption of extreme measures, such as import restrictions or bans, to tackle a foreign exchange crisis only provide short-term relief; they are unsustainable and need to be tapered off for the long-term economic health of the country. Vehicles were not imported for nearly two years, and a significant amount of much-needed forex could be saved, but the ban on vehicle imports took its toll on the government\u2019s tax revenue, which has to be increased to resolve the rupee crisis.",
    "Government revenue is expected to reach 15% of GDP in 2025, according to media reports, but this figure is considered relatively low . The government is under IMF pressure to increase its revenue significantly. It must do everything in its power to do so because gone are the days when money could be printed according to the whims and fancies of politicians in power. Direct and indirect taxes are already beyond tolerance levels for many. Further increases therein are bound to spark protests which might even spill over onto the streets. So, the only way the government apparently could think of increasing its revenue was to allow vehicle imports to resume so as to rake in taxes. The Customs revenue has increased as expected, but vehicle imports have led to another problem which was not unexpected.",
    "The ban on vehicle imports was lifted in February 2025, and since then as many as 18,000 vehicles have been imported at a cost of USD 742 million, we are told. The forex limit the government has imposed on vehicle imports for the current year is USD 1 billion. The Customs has earned Rs. 220 billion by way of import duty on vehicles. A sharp increase in imports following the lifting of a ban is something to be expected owing to what is termed pent-up demand. However, at this rate, expenditure on vehicle imports could exceed USD 1 billion in a month or two.",
    "It is highly unlikely that the government will allow the amount of forex spent on vehicle imports to exceed USD 1 billion on any grounds. The country should be able to pay for essential imports and service debt. One may recall that in 2022, there were hundreds of thousands of vehicles waiting in long fuel queues as the country lacked dollars to pay for petroleum imports. Nobody wants to face a similar situation again.",
    "The government\u2019s catch-22 is to manage vehicle imports in such a way that state revenue will not decrease, and it will be possible to keep the country\u2019s forex reserves above the safe threshold. This is a balancing act of the highest order that has to be performed successfully to steer the economy out of both rupee and forex crises. The situation is far too complex for the government to cut the Gordian knot; imposing a ban on vehicle imports again is one of the least desirable options, according to experts, for such a course of action will adversely impact the vehicle market again, and government revenue will drop steeply, making it even more difficult to meet the IMF-prescribed revenue targets.",
    "Since decreasing interest rates have led to an increase in vehicle imports, some economists are of the view that serious thought should be given to adjusting them. The depreciation of the rupee may also bring the demand for vehicle imports down, they have pointed out. But the appreciation of major foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, against the rupee will adversely affect all imports, causing increases in the prices of essentials. Taxes on vehicle imports are also very high, and it may not be possible to increase them further to curtail the growing demand. The challenge before the government is to find a way out, with the help of all other stakeholders.",
