    "All the sub-indices, except for employment, remained above the neutral threshold in August. The expansion in new orders and production was mainly driven by the manufacturing of the food & beverages sector. Further, the stock of purchases expanded during the month in line with the new orders and production. However, employment decreased on a month-on-month basis in August. Meanwhile, suppliers\u2019 delivery time continued to lengthen during the month, the report notes.",
    "Expectations for manufacturing activities over the next three months remain positive, primarily due to the optimistic outlook on year-end seasonal demand, in spite of the election uncertainties.",
    "PMI \u2013 Services as reflected by the Business Activity Index, recorded an index value of 65.2 in August 2024. This indicates a slower expansion in services activities compared to the previous month. The expansion in business activities was driven by the improvements observed across most sectors. Accordingly, business activities in the other personal services grew mainly due to improvements in entertainment and recreational activities. Further, business activities in the wholesale and retail trade, transportation services and financial services also indicated considerable growth during the month. However, business activities in the telecommunication, real estate and IT programming consultancy related activities remained at the same level as in the previous month, while activities in all other sectors recorded improvements.",
