    "The postal strike entered the fifth day on Friday, with the protesting workers launching a satyagraha. They have warned that they will intensify their trade union action further unless the government softens its stand and negotiates with them. At the time of going to press, there were no signs of the government agreeing to negotiations with the strikers. Instead, it warned that unless they returned to work immediately, their posts would be deemed vacant, and they would not be paid for the current month.",
    "Ordinary people are not well-disposed towards state workers, and therefore the stringent measures the government has threatened to adopt in a bid to end the postal strike may go down well with the public, but they are draconian and unacceptable. The government should give negotiations a chance and make a serious effort to end the strike in a democratic manner. After all, that is what the JVP, the main constituent of the ruling NPP, urged the previous government to do, while it was in the Opposition.",
    "There is no gainsaying that the Postal Department should be given a radical shake-up, but this task is best accomplished in a conciliatory manner. Most trade unions backed the NPP to the hilt in the last three elections, expecting their problems to be sorted out through negotiations.",
    "Two main contentious issues that have stood in the way of resolving the postal dispute are related to overtime and the use of a biometric attendance tracking system. These problems have cropped up because the incumbent administration, like its predecessors, is implementing new systems in an ad hoc manner. Electronic attendance recording is not compulsory for some categories of workers, especially in the health sector, which is under Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, who refuses to negotiate with the protesting postal workers until they give up their trade union struggle. The attendance marking rule should not be implemented selectively; it should apply to all state employees equally.",
    "Why the government does not bring in a new law to make it mandatory for all state workers to mark attendance electronically is the question. The issues related to state workers\u2019 overtime should be tackled in a similar manner. MP for Jaffna Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna has recently revealed in Parliament how some health workers claim overtime fraudulently by inflating their work hours. Problems related to state workers\u2019 overtime and attendance are far too complex to be addressed with piecemeal remedies. The need for a holistic approach to solving them cannot be overstated. These issues would not have arisen if there had been national policies and laws to address them.",
    "What the NPP government\u2019s refusal to negotiate with the postal strikers signifies is that once politicians are ensconced in power, their love for workers and trade unions flies out of the window. The JVP organised numerous strikes and gained political mileage while it was in the Opposition. A few years ago, it threw its weight behind post workers during a strike, and its trade union leaders went so far as to sit among the strikers. Videos of JVP trade union leaders pledging solidarity with strikers at that time are doing the rounds in the digital space. The JVP is trying to eliminate the very strike culture it promoted much to the detriment of the economy. Ironically, in trying to do so, the JVP-led NPP has chosen to adopt the same draconian methods as the J. R. Jayewardene government.",
    "Meanwhile, the postal strike has affected a large number of individuals and businesses. Parcels and letters have piled up in the Central Mail Exchange, and on Friday what the strikers described as a government move to clear and deliver parcels arbitrarily ran into stiff resistance. All parcels must undergo thorough checks before being released and/or delivered. Otherwise, a situation similar to the one where 323 red-flagged freight containers were released from the Colombo Port during an unusual delay in cargo clearance in January 2025, could arise.",
    "Banned goods, including narcotics, find their way into the country through parcel post. Hence the need for all precautions to be taken so that nobody will be able to fish in troubled waters.",
