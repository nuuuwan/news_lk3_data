    "Says President\u2019s five-fold process to build new nation in 60 months failed to yield results before",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Dr. Nalaka Godahewa yesterday accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of re-enacting the same \u2018five-fold process to build a new nation in 60 months\u2019 plan which was initially introduced by him in 2015, despite its obvious failure to yield results.",
    "Furthermore, Godahewa emphasised that the proposals presented by the President in Parliament, regarding the strengthening of provincial councils, held an underlying motive focused on upcoming elections rather than a sincere commitment to the cause.",
    "The MP drew parallels between Wickremesinghe\u2019s \u2018Regaining Sri Lanka\u2019 program of 2002 which could not be fully implemented due to political changes in the country, to his\u00a0 \u2018five-fold manifesto to build the country in 60 months\u2019 manifesto put forward for the 2015 parliamentary election.",
    "\u201cThis manifesto contained the same concepts of the \u2018Regaining Sri Lanka Program.\u00a0 It had many grand promises. For instance, it was proclaimed that by 2023, Sri Lanka would become a debt-free nation by significantly reducing borrowing. From 2015 to 2019, not a single promise was fulfilled,\u201d he noted.",
    "\u201cThe country\u2019s resources were sold, leading to a massive debt trap. Amid a five-year period of rapid growth in the Asian region, Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth rate declined year after year. Ultimately, after 60 months, all that remained was a failed country, its credit rating downgraded by international agencies, rendering it unable to secure foreign loans,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP said a careful analysis of his 2023 budget announcement reveals the President\u2019s intent to reintroduce the same economic development plan outlined in the \u2018five-fold policy statement to build the country in 60 months\u2019.",
    "\u201cUpon reviewing the targets set forth in the budget, it is apparent that we are significantly behind the projected goals after six months. We find ourselves 23% short of the expected revenue,\u201d he noted.",
    "Highlighting the many economic struggles of the country\u2019s industries and the people, Godahewa said President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s economic management has proven futile once again.",
    "\u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe excels at peddling dreams. He is a dream merchant, and many individuals buy into his visions. However, when morning arrives, these visions remain mere dreams. His offerings extend beyond economic aspirations to encompass various other realms. For instance, he expounded upon numerous notions about bolstering provincial councils in parliament yesterday. While certain aspects may appear appealing, a thorough analysis unveils underlying dangers,\u201d he noted."
