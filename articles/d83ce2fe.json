    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has restored a 20-dollar double entry visa for South Asian visitors and a 20 dollar double entry visa for other countries, according to the online visa website after the new administration restored an earlier e-visa system, complying with a court order.",
    "Sri Lanka started charging 75 dollars for single entry visa after a deal with VFS Global and IVS-GBS, and 18.5 dollar fee for the private consortium and an another initial undisclosed fee of 5 dollars.",
    "The tourist visa was later cut down to 50 dollars but with a single entry.",
    "The double entry allows tourists coming to Sri Lanka to come twice within a six month period or use the country as a hub to visit other countries leveraging the island\u2019s geographical position.",
    "Unlike in countries like Vietnam which heavily market Indo-China tours, however Sri Lanka\u2019s travel agents do not make use of the facility much, analysts say.",
    "Sri Lanka courts ordered the old system to be restored after legislators of the opposition parties Samagi Jana Balawegaya and ITAK, went to court saying the VFS Global deal was awarded without tender.",
    "Courts also ordered the arrest of the Controller General of Immigration to be arrested for not complying with the order.",
    "Newly appointed Minister Vijitha Herath restored the system within twenty four hours of his appointment.",
    "An immediate forensic audit of IVS-VFS Global deal has been ordered and legal action will be taken, Minister Herath said. (Colombo/Sept27/2024)"
