    "Pakistan cricketer Hasan Ali was at his entertaining best during the rain-interrupted second day of the 2nd Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.",
    "As the teams waited for the persistent rain to cease, Ali was seen running around the field and performing slides on the covers which had accumulated water. His teammates in the dressing room were cheering him on with shouts of ooohhhsss and aaahhhhs as the seamer continued his antics in the rain.",
    "This is not the first time that Ali has become viral in this series. In the First Test, Ali was seen running into the middle serving as a water boy for Pakistan.",
    "He then had to run back to the pavilion to help play resume on time, but that was not before the 29-year-old lost his cap but then somehow managed to grab it before running off the field.",
    "Meanwhile, in the match, Pakistan took a 12-run lead over Sri Lanka with eight first-innings wickets left after only 10 overs were bowled on Tuesday."
