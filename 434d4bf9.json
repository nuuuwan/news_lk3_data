    "After Chinese Research Survey Vessel Shi Yan 6 completed its survey off the coast of Sri Lanka and reached Singapore on December 2, Beijing asked permission from Colombo and Male to allow another Research Survey Vessel to dock at their ports and conduct a deep water exploration of South Indian Ocean from January 5 till late May 2024.",
    "While India has already raised objections with both Sri Lanka and Maldives and asked them not to allow the Chinese vessel to conduct exploration of the Indian Ocean for future military operations, the vessel Xiang Yang Hong 03 is currently off the coast of Xiamen in the South China Sea and will travel via Malacca to these countries after securing permission.",
    "Made in 2016, Xiang Yang Hong 03 is a 4813-ton vessel equipped with the latest survey and surveillance equipment and is registered at the port of Xiamen.",
    "The previous survey vessel, Shi Yan 6, which was allowed permission by the Ranil Wickremesinghe government despite India\u2019s strong objections exited the Malacca Straits on November 20- after conducting an exploration of the Sri Lankan EEZ and South Indian Ocean. The ship was also seen 500 nautical miles off Chennai before it entered Colombo port on October 25, 2023.",
    "The Indian concerns over Chinese ballistic missile trackers and Research Surveillance Ships being allowed by Sri Lanka and now with a pro-China government in Maldives are over Beijing using these vessels to spy on India in the name of marine exploration.",

    "With the PLA Navy rapidly acquiring maritime assets including three aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and guided missile destroyers, China is expanding its footprint all over the Indian Ocean with a string of naval bases from Cambodia to Djibouti on the mouth of the Red Sea. China has already acquired/invested in ports in Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, and in UAE with an eye towards future naval operations.",
    "In the name of marine exploration, Beijing is actually mapping the Indian Ocean bed from the ninety-degree ridge south of Andamans and Nicobar Islands to the deep South Indian Ocean. Detailed ocean bed maps are prepared for future submarine operations all the way up to the coast of Africa.",
    "With the PLA already operating off the coast of Africa and the Gulf of Aden in the name of anti-piracy operations, it is only a matter of time before Chinese carrier strike forces will be patrolling in international waters of the Indian Ocean.",
