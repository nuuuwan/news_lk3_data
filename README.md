### Dynasties of Deceit: The PhilippinesтАЩ Curse

*2024-12-22 02:52:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dynasties-of-deceit-the-philippines-curse/) ┬╖ `en`

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, crafted in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution, was supposed to mark the dawn of a new democratic era. The ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., after decades of corruption, repression, and dynastic rule, was a victory for the Filipino people, or so they were told. Yet, the Constitution, supposedly a tool for dismantling the oppressive old order, contains a glaring, unimplemented clause: Article II, Section 26, which bans political dynasties. Nearly four decades later, this promise remains a cruel joke, the prohibition nothing more than a symbol of a nation shackled by its own feudal past. Political dynasties thrive unabated, and the Philippines remains trapped in a cycle of oligarchy, where power is passed down like a family heirloom, not earned through democratic means.

### Ronnie de MelтАЩs George Keyt Paintings

I first met Ronnie de Mel (1925-2024) less than six months before his passing. At the time, he was 98 years old and confined to a wheelchair, yet his memory and sharp intellect were as formidable as ever. The purpose of our initial meeting was to interview him for information about another former politician with whom he had worked somewhat closely in the legislature. De Mel hailed from a different eraтАФthree or perhaps four generations before mine. Despite the age gap, his critical thinking and incisive responses often made more sense than those of many of his successors. In his most recent book Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha commented de Mel was тАЬтАжintellectually head and shoulders above all subsequent Finance MinistersтАЭ. It is no exaggeration to say that de Mel was one of the architects of Sri LankaтАЩs Open Economy, introduced in 1977. As Minister of Finance, he successfully balanced 11 consecutive budgets and was a trusted confidante of President J.R. Jayewardene.

### Sri Pada тАУ certainties, myths, memories

Sri Pada, aka AdamтАЩs Peak and Samanala Kanda, is the fifth tallest peak in Sri LankaтАЩs Hill Country at 2,243 m or 7, 359 ft. The mountain rises from its foothills grown commercially with tea, and soars as a conical shaped single rock whose peak now has been flattened to accommodate viewing areas and buildings, including a temple where the monks in charge live. It is under the religious purview of the Saman Devale in Ratnapura. Needless to mention is the fact that its fame is due to the footprint at the very summit, gold painted.

I need now to recount my sailing adventures, or shall we say, misadventures. Although I had never sailed before, I did not think twice before I shoved off on my own. On my first effort, with the wind at my back, I unfurled my sails in goose-wing style and was soon hurtling along at a whistling pace. I cannot describe the exhilaration of being one with the water and the wind, with the wind at my back and the gurgle of water in my wake. After about two hours, I reached the other side of the lake near Trevignano, just as the sun was setting.

MahindaтАЩs victory (in 2005) marked an inflection point. He did not abrogate the ceasefire agreement he had inherited, and even engaged in a round of negotiations with the LTTE. At the same time, he allowed the Sri Lankan military a freer rein.

In 2006, the JVP, then in MahindaтАЩs alliance, filed a case in the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of an earlier merger of the Tamil-dominated North and East, effected in 1987.

Its economy is recovering after receiving an International Monetary Fund rescue package and imposing austerity reforms aimed at repairing the governmentтАЩs ruined finances.

Satya is simulated as a man with good qualities in the fantasy world of the future. He is interested in bringing direct changes in this world and is making efforts. In contrast, the character of Kalki punishes people who are ignorant in mankind. He allows corrupt political leaders to rule. At this moment, Kalki assures him that he will raise the status of corrupt politician Waman Rao (Kishore) to 'Central Samrat'.. He is helping him in many ways. Is Satya winning in the end?Or is Kalki win?The story of the film.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka has allowed the import of buses, special purpose vehicles like cranes and gully bowsers and small motorized vehicles like go karts with penalties if importers carry large unsold stocks for over three months.

Sri LankaтАЩs central bank has cut rates to 8.00 percent and also started a тАШsingle policy rateтАЩ ahead of opening vehicle imports.

Analysts had warned that it could lead to a credit shock being accommodated by the central bank with negative consequences on the exchange rate, which is in any case under an inconsistent policy.
