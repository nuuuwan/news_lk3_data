ЁЯЯй

Former President of the Sri Lanka Lawyers Association, Saliya Peiris, said that the President should be cautious about the dangers of a majority.

It is evident that the National People's Power is in a state of winning a two -thirds majority on the basis of the election results so far.

This is the first time that if a two -thirds majority is a two -thirds majority under the proportional representation if the national people's power is received by a two -thirds.

In 2010, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government approached two -thirds, and in 2020, the Sri Lanka PA was approaching two -thirds.

The success of Chandrika Kumaratunga in 1994 can only be a success with this victory.

The President can be the leader of uniting various communities in Sri Lanka as the national people's power has had significant success in the North East.

The president will soon eliminate his promise to eliminate this election success.
