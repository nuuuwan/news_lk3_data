    "After completing my Ford fellowship at Oxford University in 1991, I joined the Indus River Left Bank Outfall Drainage Project in Sindh, Pakistan, as its Senior Socio-Economist and resident team leader. The project, sponsored by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and several other international donors, aimed at improving irrigated agriculture in Sindh. The Sindh Development Studies Centre (SDSC) of the University of Sindh in Jamshoro (near Hyderabad) oversaw the socio-economic studies of the project.",
    "I arrived at Karachi Airport in late December. Parvez Pathan, my SDSC counterpart, met me at the airport. We discussed my accommodation and security on our drive to Jamshoro, about 220 kilometres from Karachi. He told me a beautifully furnished bungalow awaited me on the university campus. He opined that I should always have a trustworthy person with me for my security. SDSC had found a reliable young man to be my housekeeper, cook, and personal security guard.",
    "It was a hot day, and the parched and dusty vast landscape looked like the moon\u2019s surface. White sand dunes spread miles to the horizon on both sides of the highway. Occasionally, I saw small empty huts. The temperature was about 50 degrees centigrade. We drove through a desert on a melting tarred road. Sometimes, the van could not move fast without switching off its air conditioner. I thought that I might not survive in such harsh weather. I was not prepared to live in a desert. I missed Sri Lanka, where I see trees, water, blue sky, and greenery wherever I go. Thinking I would live five years in Jamshoro made me sick and sad. The journey to Jamshoro seemed never-ending.",
    "The mirage ahead of us on the road suddenly transformed into an oasis with trees, houses, gardens, and kachcha (dirt) roads radiating from the highway. Parvez told me that we were in Jamshoro. He took me to the SDSC, where the Director and his staff were waiting for us. From the air-conditioned van, I walked to the scorching dusty veranda of the SDSC. I immediately entered the main building, which was ice cold as all air conditioners were at full speed. The Director and the staff were polite, genuinely warm, and welcoming, instantly making me feel at home. We chattered over lunch, which consisted of parathas, fried chicken, onion rings, and a tomato salad. The Director said he and his staff were happy to welcome me as a South Asian friend and brother. After lunch, Parvez took me to my bungalow in the university park.",
    "After two days, I visited several water courses about 100 kilometres north of Jamshoro. Travelling in rural Sindh is a fascinating experience. However, it is always intertwined with the high risk of being kidnapped for ransom. In the early 1990s, a foreigner\u2019s \u2018head value\u2019 was Pakistani Rs. 10 million. I heard a Chinese engineer had paid Rs. 8 million to his captors to return to freedom. When a victim is nabbed, dacoits (robbers) take him to the Indus Riverbank and keep him in a cave. A widespread rumour was dacoits do not capture a victim after 2 pm. It takes about 4-6 hours to reach the riverbank from the main trunk road and dacoits like to complete the task of kidnapping before sunset. They were backed by some powerful politicians and rich Zamindars (feudal landlords) who bribed the Police when a dacoit was arrested to get him released. Dacoits are ruthless and do not hesitate to behead a victim when ransom money is not delivered.",
    "In some remote villages, one comes across old British bungalows built in the 19th century for irrigation administration. Most are now abandoned, but a few still serve travellers and visitors. At a bungalow, a guest gets a large cot with a dirty bedspread and a pillow as hard as a stone. The bungalow keeper and the chokidar (guard) arrange guest beds in the foyer or compound. A visitor lies down and rests before engaging in any conversation. The bungalow keeper invariably serves Murry beer and local whiskey with fried chicken or karai (mutton cubes cooked in oil with onions) before the main meal is served.",
    "Usually, guests bring beef and mutton in cool boxes. In the evenings, hot bread, unlimited onion rings, and large portions of fried meat keep a group talking for hours under the clear sky with bright and giant stars. Long spells of silence are a part of a conversation. After a few hours of eating and drinking, the dialogue moves to the past. Locals lament how badly the British treated them and, after independence, how the Punjab-led Pakistan State has usurped their assets, especially the water and land.",
    "Once, I visited a feudal mansion with Memon, an SDSC colleague, on the border between Sindh and Baluchistan. It was in a remote village and was accessible only by a four-wheel-drive jeep. A large mango orchard surrounded the mansion. Memon\u2019s father was a senior official at the Customs in Karachi and was known as \u2018Chief.\u2019 A kachcha (clay) parapet surrounded the mansion with one entrance. The Chief ordered his servants to organize a dabaar (audience) in the evening. They arranged two head chairs with armrests for the Chief and his guest. Two rows of chairs were placed in front of the two head chairs. The Chief and I occupied the two head chairs.",
    "Memon, his relatives, and visitors occupied the chairs according to their family\u2019s status. Once seated, no one started a conversation; instead, each acknowledged the others\u2019 presence by nodding. After about 10 minutes, the Chief welcomed me to his \u2018humble\u2019 abode. He said he was responsible for my comfort, security, and happiness in the evening. Household helpers brought several bottles of Johnny Walker Blue label whisky to the dabaar. Large chunks of mutton were grilled on spikes on an open fire just behind us. The Chief and I opened the dabaar by hugging each other. In the dabaar, the Chief\u2019s valet sat next to him on the floor. He had a large knife in his belt and did not allow anyone to get too close to the Chief.",
    "A few hours later, the Police Chief of the area and his assistants arrived to chat with the Chief. A sub-inspector wanted to improve his English and talked to me with difficulty. He told me he knew me. \u201cI handled your security file,\u201d he said. Then, he revealed that he had obtained a copy of my CV from my computer with my secretary\u2019s help while I was in Karachi. \u201cWhat else do you know about me,\u201d I asked him jokingly. The officer was too drunk to think. I told Memon what had happened, and he dismissed it as a joke. But when I showed my displeasure, Memon told the Police Officer that he was only a guest and should be careful about what he says. The officer apologized and said he would visit me for a friendly chat in Jamshoro.",
    "When the Police officers and other visitors left the dabaar at midnight, four private armed guards emerged from nowhere. Each carried a machine gun and was dressed like a combat soldier. They checked the mansion\u2019s interior, closed the entrance, and took position outside the wall. Memon told me armed private guards are necessary to protect life and property in rural Sindh.",
    "The following day, I woke up to the noise of screeching parrots. The rising sun revealed a woven tapestry of beautiful clouds, and a gentle breeze brushed over the corn fields surrounding the mansion. Mustard fields at a corner gave the impression that we were in a hilly area. I went for a walk with Memon. Strong sunlight enveloped the mustard gardens, reflecting light from millions of mustard flowers. Hundreds of pheasants and wild pigeons busied around looking for worms and insects.",
    "When I returned to the bungalow, I saw more than 50 men and women behind the kitchen waiting for their roti and subji (cooked vegetables). It was wage workers\u2019 breakfast. An older woman (Memon\u2019s grandmother) supervised the making and distributing chapati and subji. She joked with them and occasionally inquired about their children.",
    "The Chief gave me two large boxes of mangoes and promised to send more. Memon and I travelled in his luxury jeep to SDSC, and my land cruiser followed it. The Chief was critical about constructing concrete irrigation canals to convey irrigation water from the river to the fields. He said  kachcha (unpaved or unlined) natural canals suit the area. Due to the clay soil, the Indus River and its tributaries frequently change their paths. I pointed out that soil salinity and water logging were two critical challenges that Sinhdh farmers encountered. Kachcha canals formed shallow water pools in tributaries and watercourses, causing water logging. The concrete lining of watercourses would improve the speed of water conveyance, minimizing salinity and water logging.",
    "On our field trips, Zamindars and Haris grieved about their lost grandeur and regional wealth. They lamented about the loss of great heroes and the failure of the new generation to look after their unique culture, which was fast disappearing. Some Zamindars and Haris served us lunch in the field, and workers sang songs before returning to work. Most folk songs they sang focused on the purity and bravery of women who stood up to powerful men. The story of King Omar falling in love with Marvi (shepherd girl) at a public well where the girl offered the king water to drink was famous. Some people had printouts of the paintings that depicted the king and the girl at the well.",
    "were afraid of land reforms. As a result, they initially needed clarification about our fieldwork. They enthusiastically participated in discussions when they learned about our mission. Many of them needed to know how much land they owned. They had, however, a good idea about the boundaries of their property. They usually cultivated about half of the land in the Rabi (winter) season using rain and irrigation water; about one-fourth of the land during Kharif (summer) using only irrigation water. Often, crops failed, especially in Kharif, because of inadequate irrigation water supplies. On such occasions, tenants were burdened by the bulk of losses and were pushed into poverty and misery.",
    "The relationship between a Zamindar and his Haris was cordial. A Zamindar selected Haris, prioritizing relatives and friends, honest and hard workers, and those with oxen and extra family labour. Haris consider Zamindars as their \u2018father and mother\u2019 (patrons) and depend on them for subsistence and protection. On average, a Hari gets 35% of the gross yield as his share. Soon after the harvesting season, hundreds of enormous camel carts with gunny bags full of wheat, mustard seeds, and rice can be seen on rural roads. At the same time, businesspersons from towns bring steel cabinets, agricultural utensils, and clothes to farmers\u2019 doorsteps.",
    "During the fish spawning season, Pallas (local salmon or Shrine) swim upstream of the mighty Indus River. But they can only swim up to the Kotri Barrage (dam) at Jamshoro, about 125km upstream from the sea. There is no fish ladder at the barrage. Thousands of fish get trapped at the barrage, and fishermen catch them in hundreds. Fish sellers clean Pallas on the road, and a kilogram of salt was rubbed inside each fish and then wrapped in several old newspapers. Intercity truck drivers bought the fish in bulk. They transported them to Punjab and North-Western Frontier Provinces with a lucrative profit margin.",
    "In April, the news of the arrival of the annual World Bank mission excited the SDSC staff. The staff got busy writing project reports, printing them, organizing field visits, and arranging meetings with high-level government officials in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. My presence at SDSC generated some sense of relief among the staff. They expected me to write most of the reports and their executive summaries for the mission, which I gladly did.",
    "The lunch and dinner menus at Jamshoro guesthouses, where most mission members stayed, changed overnight from chapati, lentil curry, and fried chicken to soups, boiled vegetables, steak, egg salads, and fried fish. The Bangladeshi cook at the main guesthouse collected money in advance from visitors for food and often tried to cheat them. Once, he returned from the grocery shop and complained that he had lost his wallet and all his money. The mission members gave him more money and helped him to overcome his anguish.",
    "The final mission sessions were held in Islamabad and Lahore. Such meetings were often a disaster for the SDSC. Mission members criticized incomplete project reports, poor work progress, and rampant corruption at the project level. In 1994, the mission requested the change of the Director of SDSC. The State government agreed. The SDSC staff were happy because the new Director was a popular university professor. The ex-director thought I had masterminded the change and threatened that Sindh would not be a safe place for me anymore. He told the mission that local staff could do socio-economic surveys and social studies without any help from \u201coutsiders\u201d. The mission did not agree and extended my appointment by one more year.",
    "Soon after the 1994 annual meeting, I went to Karachi to meet the State Secretary for Irrigation. Two SDSC colleagues joined me. We arrived at the Secretariat, and my two colleagues took the Jeep to collect their air tickets from a travel agent. My meeting with the secretary continued for two hours. I waited in his office for the Land Cruiser to return. Purbhan, my driver, returned to the Secretariat without the vehicle. His head was bleeding, and he looked severely shaken.",
    "Purbhan had taken my two colleagues to the travel agent. He waited for them on the roadside while listening to a cricket match commentary on the radio. He forgot to lock the jeep doors. Two young men got into the vehicle from the front two doors; one pointed a handgun at Purbhan and told him to drive. After driving several kilometres, one of them hit him on the head with the gun butt, gave him twenty rupees, pushed him out of the vehicle, and drove away. The Police never found the Land Cruiser. Usually, robbers take stolen vehicles to Baluchistan. They repaint them with a different colour and change the chassis and engine numbers. Robbers hand over such stolen vehicles to politicians for a year or two to avoid police investigations.",
    "My Land Cruiser had comprehensive insurance coverage from a leading bank in Karachi. When I reported the loss of the Land Cruiser to the bank, the clerk at the front desk told me that it had never been insured with the bank and that the insurance certificate I held was a fake document. Only then did I find out that the accountant had pocketed the money and given me a bogus insurance certificate. The World Bank blamed me for losing the Land Cruiser and not verifying the authenticity of the insurance certificate.",
    "Parvez and I continued our field research in remote villages despite the threat of being kidnapped. We stayed at Zamindars\u2019 houses during fieldwork. The houses were big and fenced with dry, thorny bushes to keep animals away. Large, open verandahs provided shade from the nasty sun and protection from fast-blowing dry winds that stirred fine dust. Lying on large wooden beds and cots with cotton mattresses, adults leisurely sipped hot tea or water. There was no hurry to do anything; things had to wait for a suitable time \u2013 it could be today, tonight, tomorrow or never!",
