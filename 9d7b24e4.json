    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament approved a 3 percent increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) from January 1, and to reduce exemptions on the tax as the island nation is struggling to meet the revenue target agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return to a $3 billion deal.",
    "The VAT (Amendment) Bill, which will see an increase of VAT to 18 percent from the current 15 percent as well as reducing a raft of goods from the exemption list, was passed with a majority of 45 votes. 100 legislators voted in favour, against 55 in the 225-member parliament.",
    "The new bill was passed a day ahead of the IMF\u2019s scheduled Board meeting to approve Sri Lanka\u2019s $330 million second tranche of the $3 billion loan.",
    "State tax revenue of the first nine months of 2023 rose 51%, compared to the same period last year but the revenue target agreed with the IMF has not been accomplished. The new tax proposals are expected to boost the revenue to meet the IMF targets, Finance Ministry officials have said.",
    "The VAT Bill debate was to be held on Sunday (10), but was postponed to Monday due to lack of quorum in the parliament.",
    "The opposition opposed the move to debate the VAT on Monday as the parliament was to debate other budget proposals including irrigation. However, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena called for a vote in which the ruling party had the majority to have the debate on Monday with a majority of 57 votes.",
    "The new VAT amendment will see people paying the tax on 97 out of the 138 goods that were previously exempted.",
    "Medicines, equipment used by disabled persons, rice flour, wheat flour, vegetables, fruits, liquid milk, and the 1990 ambulance service will not be subjected to VAT. (Colombo/Dec 11/2023)"
