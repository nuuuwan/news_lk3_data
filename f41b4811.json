    "The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has reportedly decided to disband its women\u2019s front.",
    "Reports indicate that the resolution to dissolve the front was made during a recent gathering of the party\u2019s central committee, led by party Chairman and former President Maithripala Sirisena. According to sources, the choice was prompted by internal conflicts within the front and various other issues.",
    "Sources indicated that the decision was also driven by concerns that former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga might seek to gain control over the party with the backing of the women\u2019s front."
