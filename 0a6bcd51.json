    "The Opposition parties in Parliament appear deeply divided over their participation in the all-party meeting, chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, scheduled to take place today at the President\u2019s Secretariat.",
    "The meeting was called by the President with the intention of discussing the Government\u2019s National Reconciliation Program and the way forward upon his return from the recent diplomatic visit to India.",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday confirmed the main Opposition party would attend the meeting with the President.",
    "\u201cWe will attend the meeting on behalf of the country\u2019s people,\u201d Premadasa said. However, the Opposition leader said the parties aligned with the Government should first reach a consensus on matters relating to reconciliation. \u201cThe 134 MPs are expressing varying views,\u201d he noted.",
    "While Premadasa conveyed the party\u2019s willingness to attend the meeting, he also emphasised that they would not hesitate to walk out if they perceive it as yet another political ploy without any tangible benefits for the country.",
    "The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan also confirmed the party\u2019s attendance at the meeting.",
    "The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will also be participating in the meeting. Sharing his thoughts on the matter, SLFP General Secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara expressed that the all-party meeting should have been conducted much earlier. \u201cIt took one year since his appointment for the President to call for this meeting,\u201d Jayasekara lamented. \u201cWe have been advocating for the full implementation of the 13A since 2015. However, we believe that the devolution of police and land powers should be approached cautiously and implemented gradually,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will give the meeting a miss. NPP Executive Council member Ramalingam Chandrasekar addressing a press conference in Jaffna yesterday said the party will not attend the meeting.",
    "\u201cIf the Government truly cares for reconciliation why did it block the Black July commemoration event in Colombo?\u201d he asked. He urged Tamil parties to carefully reflect on the Government\u2019s actions and raise pertinent questions regarding them. \u201cIt is yet another trick,\u201d he said.",
    "Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF) leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam yesterday slammed the decision by other Tamil parties to attend the all-party meeting.",
    "Addressing the media Ponnambalam said it was not appropriate, especially considering that during a previous meeting, the President had promised to implement 13A sans police powers.",
    "He said his party will not be part of the meeting. \u201c13A is not a solution for the Tamil people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is merely attempting to deceive the world by pretending to address the issues faced by the Tamil people,\u201d Ponnambalam alleged.",
    "The National Freedom Front (NFF) Mohammed Muzammil holding a press conference said the people have not given a mandate to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the people have no intention to see 13A to be implemented in full. \u201cTheir concern is the economy now, not reconciliation,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDevolution cannot lead to reconciliation. It must come from the hearts of the people,\u201d he added."
