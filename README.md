Sri Lanka presidential election draws international attention. Tamil candidate impacts regional politics. Eelam Tamil Rights Alliance organizes press conference in Tamil Nadu. Opposition and ruling parties seek support from Tamil Nadu activists. Tamil Nadu government urged to address Tamil candidate's election manifesto. Organizations demand referendum among Tamil people in Sri Lanka. New Delhi's role in resolving Tamil-Sinhala conflict questioned.

🟩

This week's presidential election in Sri Lanka has attracted international attention due to the central importance of the country in Sri Lanka.

Although the Sri Lankan election has been seen as a mere spare candidate in the south of Atti, the Tamil general candidate has already begun to have an impact on regional politics.

The tooth has been forced to focus on the Eelam Tamil telephone issue once again.The main point of this is that the Tamil General Candidate affair has been echoed in the Tamil Nadu Press House in Tamil Nadu.

At the meeting, which was organized by the Eelam Tamil Rights Alliance, the meeting was a meeting to introduce and announce that the Tamil people in Sri Lanka had fielded a candidate in Sri Lanka.

The creation of the Tamil general structure in Sri Lanka is trying to portray some Jaffna researchers and fat analysts as an election issue, while the Tamil General Framework in Chennai is seen as a turning point in recent Tamil history.
