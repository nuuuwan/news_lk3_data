### Britain to roll out red carpet, royal fanfare for Trump visit

*2025-09-16 11:23:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112560/britain-to-roll-out-red-carpet-royal-fanfare-for-trump-visit) · `en`

United States President Donald Trump will arrive in Britain on Tuesday (Sep 16) for a three-day trip.

An elaborate show of pomp and pageantry awaits the American leader during his historic second state visit, as the United Kingdom spares no effort to charm its most unpredictable transatlantic guest.

The last time Trump visited the storied Windsor Castle was for tea with the late Queen Elizabeth II, during his first term in office in 2019.

This time, he will be hosted to a state banquet by King Charles III at the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his country estate.

It is unusual for non-royals to receive the full ceremony of a second state visit, rendering Trump’s invitation a striking exception.

Analysts said Starmer is hoping the display of royal flattery for the US president – Trump has long expressed a fascination with the royal family – will help keep UK-US ties on a friendly footing.
