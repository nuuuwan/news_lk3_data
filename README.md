### Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly tops Elon Musk as world’s richest person

*2025-09-11 08:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112384/oracle-co-founder-larry-ellison-briefly-tops-elon-musk-as-worlds-richest-person) · `en`

Elon Musk briefly lost his title as the world’s richest person to Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle and an ally of US President Donald Trump.

Ellison’s wealth surged to $393bn (£290bn) on Wednesday morning, surpassing Musk’s $385bn (£284bn), according to the Forbes billionaire list.

The jump came after shares in Oracle, which make up a significant part of Ellison’s fortune, soared more than 40%, boosted by the database software company’s surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals.

But the firm’s share price had shed some of those gains by the end of the day, putting Musk back on top.

Before briefly losing it to Ellison, Musk had held the title of world’s richest person for nearly one year.

He could receive a pay package worth over $1tn (£740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed.

### Sri Lanka banks reduce Treasury bill holdings as private credit picks up

*2025-09-11 08:01:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-banks-reduce-treasury-bill-holdings-as-private-credit-picks-up-240106/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s banks have reduced their purchases of Treasury bills contracting their holdings absolutely since over recent months, official data shows, as private credit picked up.

Bank holdings of bills peaked in February 2025 at 2,825 billion rupees and has fallen to around 2,737 by July 2025, data published by the central bank show, indicating an absolute reduction of 88 billion rupees.

Sri Lanka’s bill auctions have failed to be fully subscribed in recent weeks at the cut off rates offered by the debt office, with no takers last week for additional bills offered on tap.

Sri Lanka’s bill yields have remained fixed in recent weeks, which analysts have dubbed the ‘ramrod rate anomaly’ in the past. In the past the ‘ramrod rate anomaly’ has been enforced through printing money.

However, banks are still buying bonds which are offered at higher rates.

Of course, no lover of a land like no other in their right mind would gainsay what Vijitha Herath told the watching world in the aftermath of the blood moon

The blood moon of the night of 7 September brought with it a panoply of portents for Sri Lanka. A lunar eclipse lasting almost one and a half hours, its visibility was marred to some degree by intermittent scudding clouds. Very few islanders however, usually superstitious to the nth, paid heed to prophecies of doom and gloom; opting instead to interpret the celestial show as favourable for once.

In the wake of the night-time heavenly spectacle came Sri Lanka’s showing at the 60th United Nations Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva. Led by the redoubtable Vijitha Herath fronting the island’s case as its foreign minister, the once embattled nation state had many eyes squinting at the fine print of the text.

Sri Lankans are trapped in a triangular matrix of three Big Lies:

(I) ‘The Aragalaya was mainly for system-change’. If true, almost a million people who flooded Colombo on July 9th 2022 morning couldn’t have shrunk to about 15,000 by nightfall after they’d successfully evicted Gotabaya. The numbers never reassembled but returned only to explore and picnic outside occupied/liberated buildings. The Aragalaya was specific and concrete, mainly about limited and legitimate ‘regime-change’, not ‘system-change’: sending Gota home, just as in the Philippines in 1986 it was about deposing Marcos.

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to reshape every sector it touches. Yet history reminds us that new technologies are often met with caution and fear as to how they will alter the ways we live, work, and communicate, and by extension, how they impact livelihoods, relationships, quality of life and even our sense of purpose.

And with AI, this sense of caution is certainly warranted. The implications for economies and societies are profound, yet unpredictable. Will it widen the gap between nations, or help close it? What we know from past revolutions is that first movers that are able to effectively navigate emerging risks associated with new technologies gain disproportionate advantages—potentially compressing decades of progress into just a few years.

Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday expressed distress over the unfolding violence in Kathmandu, condemning the unrest and urging a return to peace and stability in Nepal.

In a statement, he said he condemns all kinds of killings, including those of the youth that has occurred in Nepal, adding that the burning of a former prime minister’s home and the killing of his wife was a “deeply tragic situation.” He extended his condolences to the victims’ families.

Wickremesinghe noted that assaults on government officials, including the foreign minister, reflected a worsening crisis, stressing that women’s rights had been gravely violated and that such events had damaged Nepal’s standing abroad. He criticised police shootings as an “unacceptable course of action,” saying the unrest should never have been allowed to escalate.

### Nepal protests ‘hijacked’, Gen Z claims, as army patrols streets

*2025-09-11 05:31:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Nepal-protests-hijacked-Gen-Z-claims-as-army-patrols-streets/56-781493) · `en`

Nepal’s army has deployed patrols on the streets of the capital Kathmandu, as the Himalayan nation reels from its worst unrest in decades.

Protests against corruption spiralled into arson and violence on Tuesday. The prime minister quit as politicians’ homes were vandalised, and Government buildings and parliament torched. 30 people died and more than 1,000 were injured over two days of violence.

“Gen Z” groups spearheading the protests distanced themselves from the destruction, saying they had been “hijacked” by “opportunists”.

On Wednesday, Kathmandu’s airport reopened and the capital was relatively quiet as most residents obeyed a curfew, but smoke still rose from burning buildings.

The military, which is trying to control a spiralling situation, has invited the Gen Z protesters to engage in peace talks. Student leaders are consolidating a fresh list of demands, one of their representatives told the BBC.

### Trump lobbies EU for 100% tariffs on China and India

*2025-09-11 05:31:30* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Trump-lobbies-EU-for-100-tariffs-on-China-and-India/56-781492) · `en`

Donald Trump has called on the European Union (EU) to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% to force Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials on Tuesday discussing options to increase economic pressure on Russia, a source familiar with the discussions has told the BBC.

Trump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on “day one” of becoming president, is struggling to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv, and Russia’s strikes on Ukraine have intensified.

Separately, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he plans to talk to Putin on a call this week or early next week.

China and India are major buyers of Russian oil, which helps to keep the country’s economy and war machine afloat.

Last month, the US imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, which included a 25% penalty for its transactions with Russia.

Changing the political culture in the country is not a revenge on anyone.. It can be referred to as a feature of it. Some of the powers also live their privileges. That political culture has now been put to an end.

We are well aware of the political culture in the country. Everything has been captured. We have now reduced the official home, vehicle license, salary for ministers and salary fuel allowance for MPs.

Some privileges are lost by the Retired President's Rights Act. This is a change in political culture and not revenge.
