    "Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education Dr. Harini Amarasuriya citing a 2024 survey, highlighted that 20,000 students left school with no trace, 80,000 were chronically absent, and of the 300,000 children admitted annually, only 40,000 or 13.3% enter government universities while 150,000 or 50% exit into vocational or private education, leaving the futures of many unaccounted for.",
    "She further noted that the current system fails to adequately prepare students\u2014especially girls\u2014for employment, despite their academic strengths, with female workforce participation lagging 50% behind males. Dr. Amarasuriya stressed the need to move beyond exam-centric selection and embrace more holistic evaluation methods. She said that the reforms will begin next year with Grade 1 and Grade 6, marking the start of a transformative journey in Sri Lanka\u2019s education system. She also said they propose to move away from exam-centric selection toward more holistic and flexible evaluation systems, and the reforms will begin in Grade 1 and Grade 6 starting next year. This article focuses exclusively on the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, given its central role in shaping forthcoming educational reforms. While recent policy discourse\u2014particularly as articulated by the Prime Minister\u2014emphasises a shift away from exam-centric selection toward more holistic and flexible evaluation systems, I argue that this framing overlooks the deeper, structural issue at hand. The core problem is not the format of the examination itself, but the entrenched socioeconomic inequalities that manifest starkly across rural and urban school settings. Rural and estate schools continue to suffer from a lack of essential facilities, placing their students at a significant disadvantage and undermining the promise of equitable access to educational opportunity.",
    "Primary education in Sri Lanka marks the foundational phase of formal learning, spanning Grades 1 to 5 and typically enrolling children between the ages of 5 and 10. This stage, made compulsory since 1999, emphasises holistic child development through activity-based and student-centered pedagogies that nurture cognitive, social, and emotional growth. The curriculum integrates core subjects such as language, mathematics, science, and environmental studies, aiming to build essential literacy and numeracy skills while fostering curiosity and creativity. Along with the Year 5 examination, during this period, there are two more public examinations, namely, G.C.E. (O/L) examination (at the end of Grade 11), and G.C.E. (A/L) examination (at the end of Grade 13), which are compulsory stages in the academic journey of a student. These examinations attract the excessive attention of students, parents, and schools. Combined with parental pressure to ensure that their children perform well, each of these examinations has placed students under intense stress. Candidates who successfully complete these examinations become eligible for placement in state universities aligned with their chosen field of study.",
    "Further, now, as an incentive to successful candidates a bursary of Rs. 750 per month per student is given to economically disadvantaged but academically gifted students (communicated to me by Professor Sarath Ananda). In the 2024 examination there were 323900 candidates sitting for the examination and only 51244 had above the cut off marks, which is around 15%. This limited eligibility criterion of getting passing marks results in a significant barrier, excluding numerous qualified students from underprivileged backgrounds.",
    "The Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, focus of this paper is a nationally administered, highly competitive test introduced by educational reformer Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara in 1947 (Christopher William Wijekoon Kannangara. Born on October 13, 1884, in the village of Randombe near Ambalangoda, he is widely celebrated as the Father of Free Education in Sri Lanka). Conducted annually by the Department of Examinations under the Ministry of Education, the exam serves dual purposes: identifying academically gifted students in rural, less developed areas for placement in prestigious national schools and awarding financial scholarships to support their continued education and enabling social mobility for children from economically disadvantaged or geographically marginalized communities. Over the years, this assessment has become a central component of Sri Lanka\u2019s education system, significantly influencing the academic paths of thousands of students annually.",
    "Kannangara\u2019s concept was innovative in prioritising merit over wealth or location as the basis for quality education. His reforms aimed to remove socio-economic barriers, allowing disadvantaged students with strong academic abilities to access elite national schools through a scholarship exam. These schools offered better resources and opportunities, making the exam a key tool for expanding educational access across different social groups.",
    "Its launch coincided with the establishment of Madhya Maha Vidyalayas, or Central Colleges, which were strategically situated in semi-urban and rural regions. These schools were more than just administrative expansions; they embodied Kannangara\u2019s philosophy of equity and decentralisation. By placing high-quality institutions in areas often neglected by colonial education planning, Central Colleges created a new axis of academic excellence outside urban, Colombo based hubs in rural centres. The Grade Five Scholarship Examination served as the bridge connecting promising students to these institutions, weaving together policy, infrastructure, and individual aspiration.",
    "In practice, the exam\u2019s early years saw thousands of children\u2014many from farming families, coastal communities, and remote villages\u2014catapulted into the nation\u2019s academic mainstream. For many, it was the first and only chance to transcend inherited limitations. The psychological value of the exam, too, should not be underestimated; it instilled belief in the idea that talent could triumph over circumstance. Over time, it became deeply embedded in the national consciousness, not just as an assessment, but as a rite of passage and a symbol of upward mobility.",
    "While later decades saw the exam evolve in form and consequence\u2014often criticized for its competitiveness and pressure\u2014it remains a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s educational ethos. Its origins, rooted in the transformative aspirations of Kannangara and his allies like A. Ratnayake, reflect a time when education was seen not just as a service but as a social equalser. Today, revisiting that founding vision offers both inspiration and critique, urging policymakers to ask whether the exam still serves its original purpose, and how it might be reimagined to meet the changing needs of an unequal world.",
    "At the inception of the Central College programme in Sri Lanka, spearheaded by Dr. Kannangara, 54 Central Colleges were established between 1943 and 1947. These schools were strategically placed across electorates to decentralise access to quality education and serve as the backbone of Kannangara\u2019s free education reform. The very first Central College established under Dr. Kannangara\u2019s free education initiative was Akuramboda Central College, located in the Matale District, which is now called Weera Keppetipola Central College. It was founded in 1943, marking the beginning of a transformative era in Sri Lankan education. These institutions, including well-known schools like Horana Taxila, Polonnaruwa Royal, and the C. W. W. Kannangara Central College in Matugama, was designed to decentralize educational opportunity and provide quality schooling beyond the urban centres. Together, they served as the backbone of the Central College system, laying the foundation for widespread access to education and becoming pivotal in advancing social mobility and regional equity throughout Sri Lanka.",
    "A. Ratnayake (Ratnayake Wasala Mudiyanselage Abeyratne Ratnayaka) was crucial in developing the Grade Five Scholarship Examination during its early years. As a senior administrator working closely with Dr. Kannangara, he helped implement the vision of free and equitable education in Sri Lanka by establishing and expanding Central Colleges. Ratnayake designed systems to identify talented students from rural areas, making the scholarship exam a pathway to school admissions and financial aid. He promoted merit-based selection to maintain the credibility of the process. Though less celebrated than Kannangara, Ratnayake\u2019s administrative leadership ensured the scholarship program became a lasting fixture in Sri Lankan education reform.",
    "Although no comprehensive public record exists of all notable individuals who have benefited from the Grade Five Scholarship Examination, numerous prominent Sri Lankans have credited it with shaping their educational trajectories. Historically, the examination has functioned as a critical gateway\u2014enabling students from rural or economically marginalized communities to enter elite schools, thereby unlocking pathways to higher education and professional advancement.",
    "The Grade Five Scholarship Examination, originally created for rural students, is now a major national competition, administered by the Department of Examinations to 9- and 10-year-olds in their final primary year, it is offered in both Sinhala and Tamil throughout the country. High performers of this examination gain access to elite schools, like Royal College and Ananda College and financial bursaries, offering many families a pathway to upward mobility.",
    "The 1981- Education White Paper, the 1988 \u2013 Kingsley Report, the 1993 \u2013 School Development Bill, the 1997 \u2013 Jayathilaka Committee Report, the 1999 \u2013 School Review Proposal (plan to close 3000 schools), the 2005- Tara Harold Report, the 2007 University Status Review Commission etc. were all proposals that have been widely debated but, have not been implemented. However, in each of the above cases, no matter how much public protest the reforms were subject to, there was a specific official document presented that could be discussed.",
    "The exam has now become highly competitive, prompting debates about the stress it places on children and its shift from a student milestone to a parental pursuit. Increased tuition and rote learning have distorted its purpose, raising questions about its effectiveness in measuring ability. Only about 10% of candidates receive scholarships or school transfers annually, showing its limited impact.",
    "Additionally, disparities in primary education\u2014such as differences in resource allocation, availability of qualified teachers, and infrastructure\u2014have impacted the intended equity of the exam. Students from under-resourced schools may encounter disadvantages, regardless of their aptitude. As a result, there have been proposals for reform, such as making the exam voluntary and increasing quotas for admissions to popular schools. Some view the exam as encouraging perseverance and discipline, while others believe it increases stress and maintains socioeconomic differences.",
    "Currently, the Grade Five Scholarship Examination is at the centre of debates on educational equity and reform in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister has proposed replacing it with a modular evaluation system to reduce pressure on students and parents. As the nation seeks a more inclusive and effective education system, the exam\u2019s future remains uncertain, though its impact as both an opportunity and a point of controversy is well established.",
    "The current implementation of the examination deviates from the original goals and principles of the programme, as evidenced by candidate performance in the 2023\u201324 cycle, which is analysed in the following section. Data for this section were obtained from Year Five examination reports from the Department of Education. (See Graph 1)",
    "The 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination data from Sri Lanka (above graph) reveals a stark correlation between socioeconomic status and academic performance, underscoring the persistent inequities embedded within the education system. Socioeconomic status emerges as a strong predictor of performance, as evidenced by the disproportionate representation of upper-income students in the highest score bands. In the 91\u2013100 and 81\u201390-mark ranges of Paper II, upper-income students\u2014particularly females\u2014consistently outnumber their lower-income counterparts, suggesting that access to resources, parental education, and enriched learning environments significantly influence outcomes. Conversely, lower-income students are heavily concentrated in the 41\u201360-mark range, with a steep drop-off in representation beyond the 70-mark threshold.",
    "This disparity is especially pronounced among lower-income males, who are underrepresented in scholarship-qualifying bands and face compounded disadvantages due to both economic constraints and gendered patterns of academic disengagement. The cumulative frequency data further illustrates that most of the lower-income students fall below the competitive cutoff, raising urgent questions about the fairness of a system that rewards privilege while overlooking structural barriers. These findings call for a recalibration of scholarship criteria and targeted interventions to ensure that merit is not narrowly defined by socioeconomic advantage.",
    "In 2024, the performance of candidates in the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination shows mixed results compared to previous years. \u200b While 77.96% of candidates obtained marks 70 or above, slightly higher than 77.75% in 2023, this is still lower than the 82.97% in 2022 and 86.83% in 2020. \u200b The percentage of candidates obtaining marks 100 or above dropped to 37.70% in 2024, which is lower than 45.06% in 2023, 47.81% in 2022, and significantly lower than 66.11% in 2020. However, there was an improvement in the percentage of candidates meeting the cut-off, with 16.05% qualifying in 2024 compared to 15.22% in 2023 and 14.64% in 2022. \u200b The mean marks in 2024 were 107.25, showing a decline from 111.74 in 2023 and 115.11 in 2022, while the standard deviation of marks was 30.88, indicating slightly less variability compared to 34.98 in 2023 and 32.17 in 2022. \u200b Overall, while there is a slight improvement in the percentage of candidates meeting the cut-off, the performance in terms of higher marks and mean marks has declined compared to previous years.
