    "In 2022, the country faced a rice shortage and had to import 800,000 metric tons of rice and the government had to spend about USD 300 million. However, in 2023, the country was able to produce its entire rice requirement. For 2024, the national rice requirement is 4.1 million metric tons, and the total rice production in 2023 was 4.5 million metric tons, Amaraweera said.",
    "\u201cOur goal is to double rice cultivation over the next five cropping seasons. To achieve this, we are introducing a technical package for paddy cultivation,\u201d said the minister.",
    "He added that in order to increase the productivity of paddy cultivation, special programs will be implemented to boost rice yield across 100,000 hectares in various areas. Recent years have seen an increase in crop damage due to climatic effects, he pointed out.",

    "Currently, the government charges Rs.150 per liter of imported coconut oil. As the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, I will propose a reduction of this amount to the Cabinet. The Coconut Development Authority states that the country\u2019s annual coconut oil requirement is 25,868 metric tons, and currently, there are 51,457 metric tons of coconut oil available.",
    "Furthermore, the increase in fertilizer prices has impacted other crops, including paddy.",

The government will distribute fertilizer free of charge to farmers for paddy cultivation for the upcoming two seasons.",
    "Additionally, we have arranged fertilizer subsidies used in tea cultivation. Government-owned fertilizer companies are producing tea fertilizer and offering it at a 50% discount compared to market prices. The expenditure on this fertilizer subsidy amounts to Rs.12 billion\u201d, said Minister Amaraweera."
