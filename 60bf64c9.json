    "The allocated 5 billion rupees granted for fertilizer purchases through farmer bank accounts has been exhausted, leaving approximately half of the cultivated paddy lands lacking access to crucial nutrients.",
    "The department said that the allocated funds have been released to 583,372 farmers, approximately 50% of those who planted paddy in the Maha season.",
    "However, with an estimated cost of 11 billion rupees to support 1 million farmers cultivating the Maha season, the current funds fall significantly short.",
    "To address this gap, the department has requested an additional 2 billion rupees from the treasury.",
    "Reports from some areas indicate that farmers are facing delays in receiving the subsidy, creating anxiety and uncertainty about securing essential fertilizers for their crops.",
