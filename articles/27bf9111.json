  "original_body_lines": [
    "Both houses of Indian parliament were suspended temporarily on Thursday within minutes of opening as opposition lawmakers disrupted proceedings for the third day this week seeking a discussion on allegations against the Adani Group.",
    "U.S. authorities have accused Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani and managing director of Adani Green, Vneet S. Jaain, of being part of a scheme to pay bribes of $265 million to secure Indian solar power supply contracts, and misleading U.S. investors during fund raises there.",
    "\u201cWe want a discussion on this in parliament. It is going to be the third day that we are demanding a reply from the prime minister\u201d on the Adani issue, Manickam Tagore, a lawmaker from the main opposition Congress party, which has been leading the protests against the business group, told news agency ANI.",
    "Many of India\u2019s opposition parties accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of favouring Adani and blocking investigations against him in India, accusations both have denied.",
    "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has been a vocal critic of Adani, said Gautam Adani, 62, should be arrested.",
    "While the government has not made any comment on the indictment, Modi\u2019s BJP has said it had no reason to defend Adani, adding that the party was not against industrialists and considered them partners in nation-building efforts.",
    "\u201cLet him defend himself,\u201d BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said on Tuesday, adding that the law would take its course."
