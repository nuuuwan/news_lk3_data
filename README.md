### EY Sri Lanka sets out guidelines  for SVAT phaseout

*2025-09-08 02:37:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/EY-Sri-Lanka-sets-out-guidelines-for-SVAT-phaseout/34-781330) · `en`

With the Government abolishing Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) from 1 October 2025, EY Sri Lanka has issued guidelines on how businesses can manage the transition and comply with strict timelines.

The firm has outlined the forms, deadlines, and reporting requirements that Registered Identified Suppliers (RIS) and Registered Identified Purchasers (RIP) must follow to complete the transition.

Sri Lankan businesses face a significant change in their tax compliance obligations with the withdrawal of the SVAT system from 1 October. The end of the SVAT will remove the upfront VAT suspension mechanism that exporters and other registered parties relied on to manage cash flow.

All supplies and purchases after 30 September will be subject to the standard VAT system, requiring companies to manage refunds through the regular process. EY Sri Lanka has issued detailed guidance for RISs and RIPs, stressing that strict adherence to deadlines is needed to avoid compliance risks.

### Is India a ‘tariff king’? Not really

*2025-09-08 01:58:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Is-India-a-tariff-king-Not-really/4-781320) · `en`

Indian PM Narendra Modi (left) and US President Donald Trump

It goes without saying that the tariff war initiated by the US is in violation of its commitments under the WTO agreements. But then, the WTO itself has been moribund for a while. It is also worth noting that tariffs cannot be the same for all countries. It is a truism that low-income developing countries will have higher tariffs (for reasons mentioned above) compared to G7 countries

There is a widespread but fallacious perception that India’s tariffs are inordinately high. There are subjective factors when it comes to a country like liveability, public courtesy, or even how foreigners are welcomed. But tariffs are quantifiable and there should really be no place for subjectivity. So, let us consider the facts in the case.

I was delighted to be there when the book titled “Essentials of Modern Marketing” was launched recently. The key role played by Denzil Indrajith Perera, one of my MBA “learning partners”, in this regard, was indeed commendable. As a “non-marketer”, I enjoyed reading it and as a case-writer I saw the richness in it. Today’s column is an exploration of such essentials.

The “‘Essentials of Modern Marketing (EOMM)” is a flagship marketing series by the “Knight of Marketing”, Prof. Philip Kotler. The Sri Lankan edition of it was officially launched in cooperation with Kotler Impact Inc. and Deyo Consultancy and Advisory, recently. As one solid step in Kotler’s series of country specific editions, 22 Sri Lankan cases have been included in this valued volume. According to Denzil who represents Kotler Impact in Sri Lanka and Maldives, this is a sure showcasing of 22 local brands in the global arena with needed recognition.

### Taxes for life: Shaping our collective future through education

*2025-09-08 01:41:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Taxes-for-life-Shaping-our-collective-future-through-education/4-781317) · `en`

The solution is clear, simple, and revolutionary: integrate age-appropriate tax education into our school curricula

magine they would still ring so true centuries later. At first glance, the line may seem like a clever remark. But it holds a deeper truth: taxes much like death are a universal part of life. Inevitable, often misunderstood, and sometimes dreaded, taxes quietly power the engines of society. They fund the roads we drive on, the hospitals we depend on, the schools that shape our future, and the safety nets that protect the most vulnerable.

What makes digital influencers particularly effective is their ability to forge genuine connections with their followers

In the dynamic world of marketing, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the way brands communicate with their audiences.

### Spare a thought for the coloniser

Ahmed Abu Amsha and the children’s music group Gaza Birds Singing – Reuters

I wonder: what inhuman power compels one to walk, or crawl, or locomote in any way whatsoever, towards gunfire so that another life may not end while they live? Surely, this must be the animalistic behaviour Barrack is referring to, through which the bravery of “the region” still shines forth

“Do you think this is fun for us,” asked Tom Barrack, the US special envoy for Syria, addressing a group of Lebanese journalists after a meeting with President Joseph Aoun in Beirut on 26 August. Speaking what appears to be the only language he knows—that of finance—and referring to his deputy Morgan Ortagus, he further added, “Do you think this is economically beneficial for Morgan and I to be here putting up with this insanity?”

### Dayan Jayatilleka: The strategist Sri Lanka discarded

*2025-09-08 01:27:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Dayan-Jayatilleka-The-strategist-Sri-Lanka-discarded/4-781314) · `en`

Dayan Jayatilleka today remains one of Sri Lanka’s sharpest political minds

Sri Lanka’s only victory at Geneva was delivered by Dayan Jayatilleka. Six weeks later, he was removed under foreign pressure. Since then, Sri Lanka has never won again. The West tried to choke Sri Lanka with false accusations of war crimes. Dayan stopped them. He showed that sovereignty could be defended with clarity, courage, and coalition. And then he was betrayed

He gave Sri Lanka its only victory at Geneva. Six weeks later he was thrown aside. A nation that trashes its finest minds does not deserve victory — and that is why we keep losing.

For decades, Sri Lanka has stumbled through Geneva, battered by hostile resolutions and accusations of war crimes. The UN Human Rights Council became a courtroom, and Sri Lanka its permanent defendant.

The fact that the facts of the atrocities committed by the fellow man against humanity in Sri Lanka have been revealed and waiting for justice to be established, and the land and long -awaitedness of the atrocities have begun to dissolve today without the pain of waiting.. The human wreath, which is now being said to be landlord, has begun to shake the conscience of the world.

The story of the famous sheep land begins with the assassination of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy. Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, who wrote the GCE Advanced Level Examination at the Chundukkuli Ladies' College, Jaffna on September 7, 1996, and his mother Rajamma Kumaraswamy, the younger brother Kumaraswamy Pranavan and the neighbor Chidambaram Kripamoorthy were killed by the army.

### 'We will give Kala Vewa back to the elephants' plan three days successfully initiated

*2025-09-07 20:49:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/224480) · `ta`

The 'Kala Vewa' will be reinstated to the elephants, organized by the 'Clean Sri Lanka' project, which has been successfully implemented in the flood areas of the Kala Wawa National Forest Park for the past three days.

Wild elephants have lost their pastures as they spread occupied plants in most ponds in the North Central Province. Wild elephants prefer the young grasses that are high in protein. It is estimated that about four hundred wild elephants live in the Kala Veva region. Wild elephants enter the villages because of inadequate food for these wild elephants. This has increased human-elephant conflicts in the area. In the past few months, many have died of wild elephants attacks. Paddy training is widely carried out in the area and soy, corn, fruits and vegetables are cultivated.

### Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba decides to step down

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to resign to avoid a split within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the broadcaster NHK is reporting.

The announcement on Sunday comes weeks after Ishiba denied reports he planned to step down over a historic defeat his LDP-led coalition suffered in a July election, saying he wanted to make sure the tariff deal struck with the United States was appropriately implemented.

Since assuming his role last October, Ishiba has seen electoral losses wipe out his party’s majority in both houses of parliament, with a bruising electoral defeat in October leaving it with a minority in the more powerful lower house.

The defeats have made it more difficult for Ishiba’s coalition to implement its policy objectives.

Amid the country’s growing political instability, the prime minister has faced calls to resign from mostly right-wing opponents within his party, who urged him to take responsibility for the results of July’s vote.

Democracy is often hailed as a system of government where the rule of law prevails over the rule of individuals. One of its most defining features is the principle that no one is above the law – not even the highest executive authority.

In recent decades, several democratic countries  have demonstrated this commitment by arresting or prosecuting former heads of state for crimes ranging from corruption to abuse of power. These cases, while politically charged, underscore the resilience of democratic institutions and the importance of legal accountability.
