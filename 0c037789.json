    "Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Limited (CCBSL) and Uber Eats announced a unique partnership titled \u2018Ride for Recycling\u2019 to address responsible disposal of plastic waste, by enabling courier partners to collect PET plastic directly from households and restaurants in Colombo. Honouring World Environment Day and its theme in 2023 \u2018Solutions to Plastic Pollution\u2019, this one-of-a-kind partnership signifies a much-needed initiative as two prominent corporate entities unite to spearhead responsible waste disposal measures in the country.",
    "Leveraging their growing delivery network in the Western Province, Uber Eats, will enable a streamlined collection of PET bottles directly from both households and restaurants in Colombo, effectively mobilizing a vast network of delivery partners (courier partners) to contribute to the solution. This approach helps address household-waste segregation, which is critical for effective waste management in Sri Lanka.",
    "By integrating delivery partners into the collection system, households are encouraged to actively participate in separating their PET plastic waste for recycling, thus promoting responsible waste management practices at the source. This marks the first time a delivery partner will be collecting PET plastics directly from households for recycling, demonstrating the innovative nature of this partnership.",
    "As part of this initiative, CCBSL and Uber Eats will promote environmental responsibility by encouraging the public and restaurant partners to actively participate in combating plastic pollution and foster positive change for the environment. Members of the public are urged to collect PET plastic items frequently used in their households, such as soft drink bottles, water bottles, juice containers, handwashing and dishwashing liquid bottles and other plastic bottles labeled with the plastic identification code \u20181\u2019. These items can be handed over to Uber Eats Courier Partners when they arrive at their doorstep to deliver the order. Restaurant partners are also encouraged to collect PET bottles and hand them to Uber Eats Courier Partners during order pickups.",
