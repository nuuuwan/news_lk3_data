    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will allow private vehicle imports from February 01, 2025, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told parliament.",
    "The decision has been made after discussions with the central bank after assessing the impact on foreign exchange he said.",
    "\u201cDo not have any fears that we will face another foreign currency crises because of car imports,\u201d President Dissanayake said.",
    "\u201cWe have estimated the outflow of dollar for car imports. But to turn the economy around we decided we have to open imports.",
    "Passenger buses and special purpose vehicles have been allowed from December 14, he said.",
    "Sri Lanka PAYE tax thresholds to be raised, minimum Rs150,000: President",
    "Sri Lanka banned over 3,000 imports as money printing to cut rates started in 2020, but the country lost all its reserves and eventually defaulted.",
    "Foreign exchange reserves would not be used for imports, unless liquidity is injected by the central bank to suppress rates, analysts have pointed out.",
    "Unless rates are cut with inflationary open market operations (earlier it both direct and open market operations), no country can suffer forex shortages as decision to get credit or spend on one good will automatically crowd out another.",
    "It is not Sri Lanka\u2019s vehicle imports but open market operations that will threaten exchange rate",
    "However if money is printed to suppress rates, to give re-finance loans or inflationary open market operations are deployed to create money, forex shortages and reserve losses would take place, analysts have warned.",
    "Generating swaps would also create money, suppress rate, drive credit, putting pressure on the exchange rate, leading to bought reserve losses. (Colombo/Dec18/2024)"
