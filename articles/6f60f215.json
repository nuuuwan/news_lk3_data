    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A high-level seminar hosted by Sparkinbox, a capacity-building and networking think tank, brought together Sri Lankan exporters, trade representatives, and policy experts to examine the implications of the European Union\u2019s evolving trade and sustainability regulations.",
    "Keynote speaker Markus L\u00f6ning, former German Human Rights Commissioner and Founder of L\u00f6ning Human Rights & Responsible Business, outlined the challenges and opportunities facing Sri Lanka in strengthening its trade relationship with the EU.",
    "The EU\u2019s strategy of \u201cde risking, not decoupling\u201d from China has placed supply chain diversification at the heart of its trade and security policy. This shift creates opportunities for Sri Lanka to position itself as a reliable partner, particularly in textiles and apparel, rubber, fisheries, agriculture, and IT services.",
    "The EU\u2019s GSP+ trade scheme remains a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s export competitiveness, granting zero-duty access to around 65% of tariff lines. With \u20ac2.6 billion in exports to the EU in 2023, half of which benefited from GSP+ preferences, a favourable outlook for its continuation beyond 2027 provides confidence for exporters.",
    "At the same time, new EU legislation will redefine market access requirements.",
    "The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) already cascades obligations down to suppliers, requiring risk management systems, grievance mechanisms, and preventive measures.",
    "From 2027, the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) will expand these obligations to all large companies, including non-EU firms.",
    "The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), effective 2025/26, bans products linked to recent deforestation, directly impacting Sri Lankan rubber and palm oil exports, while the EU Forced Labour Regulation (EUFLR), effective December 2027, will ban goods produced wholly or partly with forced labour across all sectors.",
    "For Sri Lankan exporters, this means moving beyond standalone certifications to embed them into comprehensive due diligence systems. Agriculture, fisheries, and smallholder supply chains face higher compliance risks, while IT and business services offer growth potential if aligned with due diligence requirements.",
    "SMEs, in particular, will need government and industry support to adapt to these demanding standards.",
    "To remain competitive, exporters must build compliance packages, enhance labour and HR practices, and establish traceability systems, especially in high-risk sectors.",
    "Compliance should not be seen solely as a regulatory burden but as a strategic advantage to secure long-term contracts and stronger partnerships with EU buyers.",
    "Meanwhile, government institutions and chambers must play a proactive role in providing standardized tools, sector-wide monitoring mechanisms, and sustained engagement with the EU to safeguard GSP+ and ensure long-term export growth.",
    "The high level seminar brought together Sri Lankan exporters, trade representatives, policy experts, and business leaders to examine the latest developments in EU trade policy, sustainability regulations, and compliance requirements. Delivering the keynote address, Mr. Markus L\u00f6ning former Human Rights Commissioner of the German Federal Government and Founder & Managing Director of L\u00f6ning Human Rights & Responsible Business outlined the EU\u2019s geopolitical and trade strategy, the role of GSP+ preferences for Sri Lanka, the implications of emerging EU sustainability legislation for exporters, and the opportunities for Sri Lanka to position itself as a trusted partner in global supply chains.",
    "The European Union is currently pursuing a strategy of \u201cde-risking, not decoupling,\u201d aimed at reducing excessive dependence on China while maintaining trade relations. At the heart of this approach lies the diversification of supply chains, which has become a central pillar of EU trade, industrial, and security policy. This shift creates significant opportunities for Asian partners, and Sri Lanka is well positioned to present itself as a reliable alternative production base. In particular, the country has strong potential in textiles and apparel, rubber and tyres, fisheries and agricultural exports, as well as IT and business services sectors that align closely with EU market demand and diversification priorities.",
    "Sri Lanka continues to benefit from the EU\u2019s GSP+ scheme, which grants zero-duty access to around 65 percent of tariff lines, providing a critical competitive advantage in the European market. In 2023, the country exported approximately \u20ac2.6 billion worth of goods to the EU, with \u20ac1.3 billion of these exports falling under GSP+ preferences. The key product categories making use of this scheme include apparel, rubber-based products, food items, and fisheries products. Importantly, following a monitoring mission conducted by the EU in May 2025, the outlook for the continuation of GSP+ beyond 2027 was described as favourable, reinforcing the scheme\u2019s role as a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s export strategy to Europe.",
    "The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) applies directly to large German companies, but its obligations inevitably cascade down through their global supply chains, affecting suppliers in countries such as Sri Lanka. Under this legislation, companies are required to establish comprehensive risk management systems, conduct regular analyses of their operations and suppliers, and implement both preventive and remedial measures to address identified risks. In addition, businesses must provide accessible grievance mechanisms for affected parties and comply with mandatory annual reporting on due diligence activities. For Sri Lankan exporters, this means that while they are not directly regulated by the law, they will be expected by German buyers to demonstrate compliance with these standards in order to maintain trade relationships.",
    "From 2027, the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) will expand mandatory due diligence obligations to cover not only all large EU-based companies but also non EU companies generating more than \u20ac450 million in turnover within the European market. This directive requires firms to undertake comprehensive human rights and environmental risk assessments across their own operations, subsidiaries, and value chains, as well as to implement appropriate preventive and remedial measures. For Sri Lankan exporters, compliance will mean preparing due diligence fact sheets, maintaining detailed risk assessments, and providing verifiable evidence that their business practices align with international human rights and environmental standards. In practice, this will make systematic documentation and proactive transparency essential for sustaining access to the EU market.",
    "The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), coming into effect between 2025 and 2026, introduces a strict ban on placing products linked to recent deforestation on the European market. The regulation directly affects several commodities, and for Sri Lanka this has particular relevance to exports of rubber and palm oil derivatives. Under the new requirements, exporters will need to provide detailed geolocation data and establish reliable traceability systems to demonstrate that their products are not sourced from land cleared through deforestation. This places an added responsibility on Sri Lankan producers and exporters to adopt transparent supply chain monitoring practices if they are to maintain and expand their market access in Europe.",
    "The EU Forced Labour Regulation (EUFLR), which will come into force in December 2027, will ban the placing of products on the European market that are made wholly or partly with forced labour. Unlike other regulations that target specific sectors, the EUFLR applies universally across all industries and countries, making it highly relevant for Sri Lankan exporters. To comply, companies must be able to demonstrate fair recruitment practices, provide written employment contracts, maintain accurate wage and identification records, and ensure that subcontractors also adhere to these standards.",
    "Compliance will therefore require exporters to strengthen their labour management systems and supply chain oversight, as failure to do so could result in products being denied access to the EU market.",
    "For Sri Lankan exporters, the evolving EU regulatory framework means moving beyond reliance on certifications such as ISO, SA8000, or Fair Trade, and embedding them into broader, comprehensive due diligence systems. High-risk sectors, particularly agriculture, fisheries, and smallholder-driven supply chains, will face greater scrutiny",
    "and therefore require stronger compliance mechanisms. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may struggle with the resource demands of meeting these requirements, making collective solutions supported by chambers of commerce, industry associations, and government initiatives vital to ensure competitiveness.",
    "At the same time, sectors such as IT and business services, though not subject to tariffs, are also covered by due diligence obligations. With proper compliance measures in place, these areas offer strong potential for growth and diversification of Sri Lanka\u2019s export portfolio to the EU.",
    "For exporters, the priority is to develop comprehensive supply chain compliance packages that include clear policies, risk assessments, grievance mechanisms, and robust reporting practices. Building effective traceability systems is particularly critical in agriculture and rubber supply chains, where compliance risks are highest.",
    "Exporters should also strengthen human resources and labour management practices to provide verifiable assurance of freedom from forced labour. Beyond meeting regulatory demands, these steps can be leveraged as a competitive advantage to secure long-term contracts, negotiate better terms with EU buyers, and position Sri Lankan businesses as trusted partners.",
    "For government institutions and business chambers, the focus should be on enabling exporters especially SMEs through standardized documentation tools, training programs, and collective initiatives that reduce the compliance burden.",
    "Sector-wide monitoring mechanisms can help ensure consistent standards across industries, while proactive engagement with the EU is essential to maintain Sri Lanka\u2019s GSP+ status and safeguard its long-term export competitiveness.",
    "The seminar underscored that compliance with EU trade and sustainability regulations is no longer optional but a fundamental requirement for market access. For Sri Lanka, the continuation of GSP+ preferences, coupled with the EU\u2019s diversification strategy, presents both a challenge and an opportunity.",
    "Exporters must adapt quickly by embedding due diligence, transparency, and sustainability into their operations, while policymakers and chambers must play a proactive role in enabling this transition.",
    "By aligning with EU human rights, labour, and environmental standards, Sri Lankan businesses can not only safeguard their existing market share but also position themselves as trusted long term partners for European companies seeking resilient and responsible supply chains.",
    "Sparkinbox is a capacity-building and networking think tank that works with state institutions, local and international businesses, NGOs, civic organisations, and youth groups to strengthen their ability to create lasting impact.",
    "It designs and delivers training programs, workshops, and strategic advisory services that equip organisations to plan effectively, communicate with purpose, and respond to emerging challenges.",
    "Beyond building capacity, Sparkinbox serves as a bridge to global knowledge, connecting local actors with insights and practices from diverse disciplines.
