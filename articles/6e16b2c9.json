    "Nimal Gunewardena, the visionary founder of Sri Lanka\u2019s pioneering Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) and Public Relations (PR) agency, announced his exit from the Agency he founded in 1993, now rebranded as NGage Strategic Alliance (formerly Bates Strategic Alliance). In a strategic move to ensure continuity and growth, Gunewardena has transferred his equity in the business to the current CEO, Sheron Jayasundara, entrusting her with the mantle to carry forward the agency\u2019s distinguished legacy for the benefit of its talented team and valued clients.",
    "The Agency created history when it became affiliated to the global advertising network Bates in its inception year and followed up with several other pioneering moves. Since its inception, NGage Strategic Alliance has been at the forefront of IMC and PR in Sri Lanka, being the first ad agency to introduce PR and an international PR network, Rowland Communications Worldwide, to Sri Lanka. Following this came its BTL affiliation with the 141 Worldwide network and a media affiliation with Mediaedge, a WPP media specialist.",
