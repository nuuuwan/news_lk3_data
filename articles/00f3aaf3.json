    "Daraz Sri Lanka, in partnership with the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) under the Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Ministry, has launched a new capacity-building program to strengthen institutional support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across the country. This initiative represents the next phase of the Daraz Connect program, which was introduced earlier this year to help entrepreneurs access the digital economy.",
    "While the original Daraz Connect initiative focused on enabling rural and underserved entrepreneurs to set up online storefronts and participate in e-commerce, the new capacity-building program shifts focus to the public sector officers who work directly with these entrepreneurs. By equipping NEDA personnel with an in-depth understanding of e-commerce trends, challenges, and opportunities, the program aims to create a stronger foundation for MSME enablement across Sri Lanka.",
    "The first session was held in Matara and brought together NEDA officers from various districts for a comprehensive day of training. Facilitated by Daraz experts, the training covered key areas such as onboarding new sellers to e-commerce platforms, optimising digital storefronts, using customer insights, managing fulfilment and logistics, and navigating digital payment systems.",
    "The program also introduced officers to the various tools and services available through Daraz\u2019s seller ecosystem. By providing this first-hand understanding of platform mechanics, the training ensures that officers are better positioned to offer practical, relevant guidance to the entrepreneurs they support.",
    "One of the core goals of this initiative is to build long-term institutional capacity that extends beyond individual workshops. The officers who participate in the training will be able to apply what they have learned in their ongoing engagements with entrepreneurs, whether during consultations, training sessions, or community outreach programs. As a result, the impact of the program is expected to scale organically over time as more MSMEs receive informed support from NEDA representatives in their respective regions.",
    "To ensure sustained knowledge development, Daraz and the NEDA will continue this initiative through a series of monthly workshops and webinars. These ongoing sessions will allow for continued upskilling, practical refreshers, and timely updates on emerging trends in the digital economy, helping officers remain aligned with the evolving needs of MSMEs.",
    "This partnership between Daraz and the NEDA reflects a shared commitment to fostering inclusive economic development through technology and innovation. By focusing not only on entrepreneurs but also on the institutions that support them, the program takes a holistic approach to capacity building in Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy. It also reinforces the importance of cross-sector collaboration in enabling long-term, sustainable growth for the MSME sector.",
    "Through this continued collaboration, both organisations aim to ensure that Sri Lanka\u2019s transition to a digitally enabled economy is inclusive, resilient, and anchored in strong institutional knowledge."
