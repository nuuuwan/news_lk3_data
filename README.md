Sri Lanka's milk consumption has slightly increased post-crisis, but overall, it's less than before. Economic recovery has seen over a million families return to the market, but the dairy industry needs at least two years to reach pre-crisis levels.

🟩

Following the economic crisis, a senior industry representative said the use of Sri Lanka's monthly milk, which has been reduced by almost half of the price rise, has seen a slight increase.

Consumption of 7,000 metric tonnes of milk powder in the last three years has declined to 3,000 metric tonnes in the last three years due to the rise in US dollar prices, milk prices in the world market and government tax hikes.

However, with the slightest improvement of economic conditions, more than one million families have returned to the market, although the overall consumption is less than the previous level, said Ravi Jayawardena, CEO of the Maliban Group.

He shared his views while addressing a group debate by the Kabital Alliance Limited, which examines the current trends of Sri Lankan consumer spending and the post -crisis view.

According to Jayawardena, the domestic dairy industry will take at least two years to return to Kovit's previous consumption.
