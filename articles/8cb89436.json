  "original_body_lines": [
    "Activist and \u2018Api Sri Lanka\u2019 National Organisation Convenor Priyantha Herath yesterday filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking a ruling that the decision to hold Parliamentary elections on 14 November is unconstitutional.",
    "The respondents named in the petition include the Attorney General, the President\u2019s Secretary, the Election Commission Chairman, and other relevant members representing the President.",
    "The petitioner argues that, according to Section 10 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the nomination period was set from 4 to 11 October. He maintained that the law stipulates that polling dates should be fixed within a period of no less than five weeks and no more than seven weeks from the date nominations are accepted. The petitioner notes that therefore the five-week period from 11 October would conclude on 15 November, while the seven-week period would end on 29 November. He maintained that therefore, holding the elections on 14 November would fall outside the legally mandated time frame.",
    "Accordingly the petitioner contends that the President\u2019s decision to hold the election on 14 November undermines the sovereignty of the people and violates the Constitution.",
    "Additionally, the petition requests the Supreme Court to issue corrective orders regarding this alleged infringement."
