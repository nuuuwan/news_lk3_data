    "It is stated that this is due to a lack of quorum, the failure to gazette the names of elected members, and ongoing court orders.",
    "In addition, due to issues regarding female representation, the Wanathawilluwa Pradeshiya Sabha has still not been able to form a council.",
    "Reports indicate that 50% of the full members have not attended the chambers, resulting in a lack of quorum, and that some members are deliberately avoiding attendance.",
