    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. Charitha Herath yesterday criticised the all-party meeting convened by President Ranil Wickremesinghe for 26 July, dismissing it as a mere political gimmick in anticipation of the Presidential election.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The all-party meeting is scheduled to take place on July 26 at 5.30 pm at the President\u2019s Secretariat. The Government has said its primary objective is to inform party leaders about the National Reconciliation Program, which is to be implemented by the government.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However, speaking at a press conference held at the FPC party headquarters, Herath warned the opposition parties against being deceived by the President's all-party meeting gesture.",
    "\u201cPrior to gimmicky all-party meetings, let us be clear about the Government's opinion on the 13A. Ranil's stance differs from Dinesh's, and Sagara presents yet another distinct view. There is no consensus among them,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cRanil, holding merely one seat in the Government, is agreeable to 13A, while Dinesh is not. The Pohottuwa, which holds around 90 seats, is also not agreeable to it. Therefore, before convening an all-party meeting, the Government must reach a unified consensus and make an official announcement,\u201d he noted.",
    "The MP also questioned who granted President Ranil Wickremesinghe the authority to make agreements with India. \u201cWho authorised a succeeding president to transfer the country's ports to other countries?\u201d he asked.",
    "The MP firmly asserted that the President's actions are nothing more than a calculated tactic to gain favour ahead of the next poll, warning the opposition not to be deceived by this cunning ploy.",
    "Expressing his personal opinion on 13A, Herath emphasised that politicians should be willing to support it if its empowerment can pave the way for an agreement between the diverse communities within the country.",
    "However, Herath pointed out that the party has not yet made a decision regarding attending the meeting called by the President."
