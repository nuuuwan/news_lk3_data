    "Call me a hopeless nerd or even a worthless pedant, but one of my favourite relaxations is to go book-hunting in the city\u2019s \u2018second-hand bookshops\u2019 (or as they are known overseas, \u2018used bookstores\u2019). Of late, I have had less occasion to indulge myself in this innocuous pleasure, both because it is becoming harder to find a book that hadn\u2019t attracted my attention before and because there is no more space in my reading room to keep any new acquisitions. And also because, I suppose, I know intuitively that the likelihood of a new book making an impact on me or the world around me now is vanishingly small, since the years have inexorably caught up with me too. Not to forget, there are also quite a few books in my room that are still crying out for my serious attention.",
    "But when I recently found the time and courage to visit my favourite hide-out, namely the Senanayake Book Shop on Galle Road in Wellawatte, I realised that times have indeed changed. It has been gradually folding up for some time, being \u2018more closed than usual\u2019 (to rephrase the title of a book that is well known to many of us). It is now closed for good \u2013 I was told by a street vendor selling his wares on the pavement in front. That message really drove home hard. It was as though a third parent has passed away. I heard from the shopkeeper next-door that the owners had donated the remaining books to a public library and sold the premises.",
    "Within Colombo itself, there are the hide-outs on (former) McCallum Road, Bookland on Marine Drive and the one in the Narahenpita Economic Centre. Kandy too has its few hide-outs. Whenever I travel overseas and spend more than a few days in a city, I make it a point to find out the city\u2019s used bookstore hide-outs. I used to take pride in my knowledge about these hide-outs in cities such as London, Liverpool, Toronto, Trivandrum and Melbourne \u2013 which even the locals didn\u2019t know! I used to say that I can find used bookstores better than an alcoholic can find taverns.",
    "But of late, all these have been folding up gradually. Melbourne has probably only one general used bookstore, the City Basement Bookstore on Flinders Street, and even that is not open as usual. Toronto\u2019s list, which used to be more impressive than those of any other city I had visited, is now all but evaporated. The few remaining serve only specialised, expensive collectors\u2019 items. There is hardly any that can serve a non-specialist reader such as me, like the Senanayake Book Shop which was, quite simply, one of the best in the world.",
    "Second-hand bookshops served two very important purposes in my life as a reader. The first is that it gave me access to good books at an affordable price. For instance, at Senanayake Book Shop an average book would cost less than Rs 500 \u2013 a price for which there are no items in most restaurant menus that we visit. Of course, there are the very expensive collectors\u2019 items, but I have always been careful to steer clear of them. The second purpose is that when a person who had been an avid, erudite reader passes away, the family generally has no use for the deceased person\u2019s significant book collection; the whole collection either ends up in a library as a special collection or is bought by a second-hand bookseller for a pittance. Soon afterwards, we would be spending hours in the bookshop devouring over the newly acquired collection therein, enjoying and admiring it and maybe buying a few off it.",
    "This second purpose is very important even to those readers for whom money is no matter, because such book collections, which had been painstakingly put together by the deceased person over decades and after visiting several countries, are truly priceless. No bookstore selling new books, not even online ones, can possibly compete with this. Book collections of that sort have a high proportion of quality reading and rare gems \u2013 bookstores selling new books have books across the whole spectrum of quality, with most new books as a rule being worthless.",
    "But is all this of any consequence? In this digital age, when e-books and e-newspapers are replacing the printed word globally and rapidly, can a nerd like me have a good reason to lament? Or, is my kind simply on its way out and just-as-well too?",
    "I think books play an important role in our learning that e-books cannot. Everyone talks about the ephemeral, intangible and unromantic nature of reading an e-book. But that is not the point (although that too is a good point for romantics like me).",
    "A book is a mini-journey of discovery \u2013 and it is this journey, not the discovery, that helps us to learn. When we take a book in our hands and start reading it or look for some information in it, we must necessarily go through its contents page, chapters and the layout inside the chapter in order to find what we are looking for. In so doing, we are experiencing something very important, imperceptibly. We are gradually building our mind map: the complex relationships between different quanta of information and how they are arranged in the universe of knowledge. Learning is not merely remembering information \u2013 it is being able to relate different quanta of information to each other, determining the significance of one quantum in the light of another and in the bigger scheme.",
    "When we ask an erudite professor an unusual or novel question and the professor answers it dextrously, you will find that the secret of that dexterity is usually the professor\u2019s ability to locate the question in the correct place in the universe of knowledge \u2013 which is represented in a miniature form inside the professor\u2019s brain, as a mind map.",
    "An e-book experience does not give us quite the same journey, especially if we located the information that we are looking for by using its search engine (which is akin to locating it in a printed book by using its index).",
    "What is more, sometimes the journey turns up unexpected surprises: we may be looking for Fact A but may stumble upon Fact B, which suddenly captures out attention and we spend the rest of the evening reading \u2013 leaving for another day the discovery of Fact A. Those serendipitously acquired collections of knowledge come quite handy \u2013 in vivas, interviews, cocktail circles and solving unusual problems needing out-of-the-box solutions. They are often the foundation of what is known as adaptive expertise (in contrast routine expertise). Or to put more simply, such lateral mini-journies promote lateral thinking.",
    "As books go out of use, as second-hand bookstores go out of business, as the reading habit becomes harder to sustain, as information acquisition becomes more crucial to success than knowledge development, as the average attention span reduces in one generation from 20 seconds to 8 seconds (and continues to reduce), what will become of human learning? Am I just mourning the demise of second-hand bookshops, or is this something more serious for humanity? I think you know the answer, which has been rendered even more frightening with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence and open-access chatbots \u2013 which have made redundant not only knowledge development but even thinking in itself.",
    "But for now, let me mourn the demise of my favourite \u2018used bookstore\u2019. Thank you, Senanayake Book Shop!",
