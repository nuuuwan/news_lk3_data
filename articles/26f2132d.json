    "Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) - A group of MPs from both the ruling party and the opposition have urged the speaker and government officials to provide vehicle permits at lower prices if the previously issued duty-free licenses cannot be granted before the upcoming presidential election.",
    "Sources said that the MPs plan to address this issue in the House Committee of Parliament in the near future.",
    "Several MPs from both political factions have highlighted to parliamentary leaders the significant challenge posed by the lack of vehicles for conducting political activities during the forthcoming elections. They have emphasized that several newly elected MPs do not possess any vehicles.",
    "In the past, every MP was granted a duty-free vehicle license, allowing them to purchase a vehicle valued at nearly 20 million rupees. However, due to the country's economic conditions, the issuance of these licenses were halted approximately nine years ago, with the last issuance occurring in 2015. Despite ongoing requests from MPs for duty-free vehicle licenses, the government has refrained from making a decision on this matter, considering the nation's economic circumstances."
