  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Countries tend to tinker with existing monetary systems instead of looking for better institutional arrangements because central bankers drive the agenda and block other solutions, a top economists explained at forum on sound money in Sri Lanka.",
    "In the US, the Federal Reserve now employs around 500 economists, which was bigger than the number of individuals involved in monetary research in the top 50 universities, Lawrence White, a global expert on money, banking and monetary history has said.",
    "Most economists will not go against central bankers, who are in position of influence.",
    "\u201cAnd they also have a gatekeeping function. Which is, they\u2019re involved in the editorship or the editorial boards, of many of the leading journals of the field,\u201d White, who is also a visiting lecturer at the Swiss National Bank told a seminar organized by Sri Lanka\u2019s Bastiat Society.",
    "\u201cSo, for an economist to take a position that is critical of the Central Bank is to endanger his own future job prospects, his chances of getting published in one of the leading journals.\u201d",
    "White wrote a paper, The Federal Reserve System\u2019s Influence on Research in Monetary Economics detailing how the agency influences thinking on monetary policy.",
    "\u201cI was providing some numbers to back up the idea which had already been expressed by Milton Friedman,\u201d White said.",
    "White\u2019s paper cites Friedman being published for having commented that \u201csince the Federal Reserve Board and its district banks hire a large number of economists in the field of money, the central bank has a sort of oligopoly on monetary opinion.\u201d",
    "In Sri Lanka Keynesian gatekeepers are also active in think tanks, blocking reform, perpetuating monetary instability through anchor conflicting regimes and making sure that macro-economists have the power to depreciate currencies and impose regressive inflation taxes on the poor.",
    "The Fed triggered the Great Depression, ended the gold standard by busting the Bretton Woods system, triggered the Great Recession.",
    "Most recently a massive commodity bubble and inflation spike which has worsened global hunger, is now referred to in Western media as the \u2018cost of living crisis\u2019, giving unaccountable central banks a free pass. Hardest hit are countries with \u2018flexible exchange rates\u2019 which have collapsed.",
    "Due to the status quo bias, a country with a bad central bank and chronic depreciation, is doomed to go to the IMF again and again, and all policy errors would end up as currency depreciation, critics say.",
    "The central bank\u2019s influence would ensure that no real monetary reform happens.",
    "\u201cAnd it imparts a kind of status quo bias where people will do research on helping the Central Bank choose its operating targets and procedures and technical problems like that,\u201d White explained.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s very little research on the question of what are the alternative institutions and how would and how would other systems work compared to the central banking system we\u2019ve got. \u201d",
    "Lawrence comments came as Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament is set to enact a new monetary law which will give \u2018independence\u2019 to a few individuals to print money for macro-economic policy, run a dual anchor regime without accountability.",
    "Critics say the law legalizes the very policy errors that led to serial currency crises and eventual sovereign default.",
    "The law seeks to legalize flexible inflation targeting, where attempts are made to target a domestic anchor (inflation target) without floating exchange rate, leading to currency crises as soon as inflation falls after the effects of the previous currency collapse wears off.",
    "It also legalizes printing money for growth or targeting a \u2018potential output\u2019. The legal wording is \u2018shall\u2019.",
    "Printing money for growth was outlawed by then Central Bank Governor A S Jayewardene who removed growth objectives from the central bank and made it committed to provide stability.",
    "Though money was printed for growth after the end of a civil war there was no legal sanction in the current law, people who helped outlaw money printing for growth has pointed out.",
    "RELATED Sri Lanka has a corrupted inflation targeting, output gap targeting not in line with monetary law: Wijewardena",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank was originally supposed to engage in \u201cthe promotion and maintenance of a high level of production, employment and real income in Ceylon\u201d and the \u201cencouragement and promotion of the full development of the productive resources of Ceylon\u201d.",
    "Jayawardene also fine-tuned open market operations, which was then used for deflationary policy, and the central bank at one time issued its own securities, East Asian style to build reserves after selling down its Treasury bill taken to create instability in the past.",
    "Promotion of growth has now come back as output gap targeting, despite the country being driven into external default by printing money to target a potential output in the past several years.",
    "In past decade, inflationary open market operations were widely used to print money to target potential output, generate excess liquidity in money markets, trigger balance of payments deficits and foreign borrowing, and then output shocks as brakes were hit, critics say.",
    "Though there is now wide public knowledge in Sri Lanka a pegged central bank taking in Treasury bills, there is less knowledge about how macro-economists will still print money to suppress rates through open market operations.",
    "Knowledge about operational framework, or the activities of the domestic operations department (the issue department in classical days) are a closed book for the public or legislators, allowing macro-economists to print money at will and then impose exchange and import controls.",
    "Before 1920 and the birth of \u2018macro-economic policy\u2019 central banks only printed money to fund deficits during wars.  But now economic destruction in peacetime, like in Sri Lanka and Latin America, is mostly carried out by open market operations.",
    "In 1950, an unknown economist writing in The Banker Magazine warned that open market operations would be used to print money, though the bank\u2019s founder, John Exter had put several safeguards to limit large scale central bank credit.",
    "\u201cSo long as open market purchases of Government securities are allowed (as, of course, they must be), it is very difficult to prevent these becoming an indirect means of making central bank credit\u201d available, the analyst pointed out prophetically. (Colombo/July20/2023)"
