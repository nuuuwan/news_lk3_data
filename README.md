### Why Sri Lanka needs stability, not diplomatic disruption, in London

*2024-11-04 01:04:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-Sri-Lanka-needs-stability-not-diplomatic-disruption-in-London/4-768764) · `en`

London remains a critical hub for the financial and political community, and our High Commissioner—whose qualifications and experience are well suited to such a complex diplomatic post—has already been instrumental in strengthening Sri Lanka’s connections in this influential market. Removing him now would be short-sighted, not only disrupting essential progress but signalling uncertainty and inconsistency in our diplomatic priorities

As a Sri Lankan business leader with years invested in establishing our company’s presence in the UK, I’ve witnessed firsthand the critical role a steady diplomatic presence plays in navigating Sri Lanka’s international standing—especially in a place as significant as London. Recent news of the potential removal of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the UK after only one year is deeply concerning. This move risks undermining the very stability and reputation our country has struggled to regain following years of economic and political upheaval.

Insight capsules – box articles in other cases – have been added to elaborate on specific topics.

The thread-bound book in hard cover will ensure that the readers could use it for many years without running into the problem of offensive disentangled dog-eared pages which readers encounter in paperback books. But it has come in a hefty price of Rs. 4,500 (equivalent to about $ 15) which may make it only a reference book in libraries and not by many ordinary individual users.

Moldovans were voting on Sunday in a presidential election that has been overshadowed by meddling allegations and could see Moscow claw back influence in the country at a time when it is trying to draw closer to the European Union.

Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu, who has accelerated the nation’s push to leave Moscow’s orbit and join the EU, faces Alexandr Stoianoglo, an ex-prosecutor general backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party.

The fortunes of Sandu, who set Moldova on the long path of EU accession talks in June, will be closely followed in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state hoping to join, re-elected a ruling party seen as increasingly pro-Russian.

Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).

Moldova’s future has been thrown into the political and diplomatic spotlight as the war in neighbouring Ukraine rages to the east.

*2024-11-03 13:47:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197788) · `ta`

Children protest cost of living Nigeria face death penalty court case controversy

🟩

Shocking reports have revealed that 29 children who were involved in the struggle against the increase in livelihoods in Nigeria could be sentenced to death.

The Nigerian government has imposed several allegations, including treason allegations against 76 people who were protesting against the cost of living.

The public is engaged in a series of protests in Nigeria due to frustration over the increase in cost of living.

The death penalty came into effect in Nigeria in 1976, but no one has been convicted since 1996.

Nigeria's Child Rights Act has not been allowed to investigate children and produce a court, a lawyer said.

Therefore, it is wrong to bring the boys to the court.
