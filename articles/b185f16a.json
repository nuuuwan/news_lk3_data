    "On September 29, the world marks the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste, highlighting one of humanity\u2019s pressing paradoxes. As the global population nears 8.5 billion by 2030, we still waste 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually \u2013 enough to feed three billion people. Sri Lanka is no exception. This crisis calls for urgent action, and increasingly, young people are emerging as catalysts for change.",
    "The traditional \u201ctake-make-use-discard\u201d model has proved unsustainable. A shift toward circular approaches \u2013 refuse, regenerate, reuse, and redesign \u2013 is gaining global momentum. At the heart of this transformation lies a simple truth: when young people embrace circular principles, they can reshape communities and inspire wider system change.",
    "Across the world, schools and universities are showing how education can drive sustainability. In Denmark, the Green School Flag program involves over 1,400 schools in projects that have measurably cut waste. Brazil\u2019s Sustainable Schools Program establishes schools as central hubs for sustainability and to support local economies.. In Asia-Pacific, Japan\u2019s education system embeds Mottainai \u2013 a philosophy of respect for resources \u2013 into its curriculum. Singapore\u2019s Food Waste Prevention Programme combines lessons with practical campaigns, with over 80% of participating households reporting reduced waste. Universities like Arizona State, Stanford, and Wageningen have created \u201cliving labs,\u201d where students design and test circular solutions, some achieving near zero-waste campuses.",
    "Closer to home, Sri Lanka offers a strong example of how traditional wisdom can be harmonized with modern education. The island\u2019s cultural values of resource sharing and waste minimization \u2013 embodied in practices such as dana (giving) \u2013 form a natural foundation for circular education. Youth-led initiatives like the Robin Hood Army and Soup Bowl show how young people can tackle food waste while supporting vulnerable communities. At the same time, international partnerships are making a difference- the European Union\u2019s Global Gateway strategy joins efforts with the Government of Sri Lanka through the \u201cCircular Economy in the Food Sector Project (2024\u20132027),\u201d to deliver training for educators and school-based activities in Colombo, Galle, and Nuwara Eliya, enabling students to develop hands-on solutions to food waste and resource recovery.",
    "Complementing these efforts, FAO\u2019s Do Good: Save Food materials \u2013 available in Tamil, Sinhala, and many other languages \u2013 provide children, teachers, and families with simple, practical ways to reduce food waste in daily life. By making these practices accessible and actionable, the resources empower communities to contribute meaningfully to the global movement to save food and protect the planet.",
    "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recognizes education\u2019s critical role in building circular food systems through partnerships with educational programs worldwide. FAO\u2019s work demonstrates that circular economy approaches not only cut waste but also reduce the need for new resources to be extracted at great financial and environmental cost. FAO\u2019s Technical Platform on the Measurement and Reduction of Food Loss and Waste showcases successful models from every continent. For instance, in Kenya, the School Food and Nutrition Framework incorporates food security lessons teaching students about entire food value chains. In Peru, educational partnerships connect schools with indigenous communities to learn traditional sustainable agriculture practices embodying circular principles.",
    "The evidence is clear: empowering young people to lead in circular food systems generates ripple effects across communities, policies, and markets. Students are not only learners but active innovators, influencing household behaviors, shaping local practices, and inspiring systemic change.",
    "To scale this impact, action is needed on multiple fronts. Policymakers must create environments that encourage student leadership. Educators require resources for experiential learning. The private sector should expand opportunities for youth-led entrepreneurship and innovation. International organizations, including UN agencies, must continue fostering knowledge exchange and technical support.",
    "The International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste reminds us that solutions are not only technical but also cultural and educational. For these solutions to succeed, they must be widely adopted by society. By nurturing students as champions of circular food systems, we equip them with the mindset and skills needed for a sustainable, equitable, and resilient future.",
    "Our future is being shaped in classrooms today. Let us ensure it is one where food is valued, waste is minimized, and every young person\u2019s voice is recognized as a driver of global change.",
