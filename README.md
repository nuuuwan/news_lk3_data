Police have arrested the owner of a fishing boat in connection with the recent seizure of more than 700 kilograms of heroin and crystal methamphetamine (ICE) in Seenimodara, Tangalle.

The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) said the drugs, discovered in three lorries in the area, had been smuggled into the country by sea. Investigations revealed that the narcotics were brought in aboard a toll boat before being transferred to a smaller fishing vessel for transport.

The arrest was made during a raid linked to the wider probe into the drug trafficking operation.

Authorities confirmed that further investigations are underway into the network responsible for the smuggling.
