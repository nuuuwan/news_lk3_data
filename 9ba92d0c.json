    "The government has allocated Rs. 900 million for the development of cultivation activities and a certain amount has been allocated for Sojan cultivation as well, Minister Amaraweera said..",

    "\"In the Western Province, there are many paddy lands that have not been cultivated but can be cultivated. Many people have not cultivated the paddy fields on both sides of the main roads, maybe to be filled and used for construction purposes. But, according to a decision taken by the Cabinet, from now on we will not allow the filing of paddy fields except for essential purposes,\" he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
