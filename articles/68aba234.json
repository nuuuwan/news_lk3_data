    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organizer and MP Namala Rajapaksa has warned that legal action will be taken against for making false statements to the media, particularly if such remarks undermine judicial proceedings.Speaking on October 1, Rajapaksa said that while the Police Media Spokesperson is authorized to brief the media, no individual should misuse media platforms to spread misinformation.\u201cIf anyone attempts to make false statements to the media in a way that prejudices judicial processes, we will take legal action,\u201d Rajapaksa asserted.His comments come nearly four weeks after Rajapaksa issued a letter of demand to Deputy Minister of Public Security Sunil Watagala, following remarks made on September 6 regarding alleged SLPP links with Sampath Manamperi, who is currently in detention.Watagala later responded by sending his own letter of demand seeking Rs. 2 billion in damages from Rajapaksa.When asked about the current status of the legal dispute, Deputy Minister Watagala told reporters:\u201cI\u2019ve sent my response and now I\u2019m waiting for the case to proceed. I was expecting something today, but nothing came through,\u201d he said.Commenting on renewed discussions surrounding the Thajudeen murder case, Watagala added:\u201cSome politicians are suddenly making noise about this case. Investigations will determine whether there\u2019s any link between the murder and those individuals. I have full confidence in the investigative process.\u201d"
