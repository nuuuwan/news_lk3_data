    "Lanka Sathosa Ltd was called before the Committee on Public Enterprises recently under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament (Prof.) Ranjith Bandara.",
    "Here, attention was drawn towards the fact that a concrete plan for 2021-24 was in place but it was not approved by the Ministry, the Communications Department of Parliament said.",
    "Thus, the Committee Chair informed the officials to prepare a comprehensive plan up until 2028 and report on its activities within 2 months. He further instructed to prepare an action plan.",
    "Attention was also directed towards internal audit queries not being done properly. It was discussed that although there are 21 internal auditor staff, only 3 audit queries have been submitted for the year 2021 and none for the year 2022.",
    "Moreover, attention was drawn to the auditor\u2019s difficulty in obtaining information regarding the company\u2019s accounts. Accordingly, the Auditor General also informed that the Internal Audit Department should be notified in this regard through an internal circular.",

    "Furthermore, the officials explained about the loss due to the delay in receiving money even though the goods are imported based on the policy decisions taken by the government.",
    "The COPE Chair emphasized the need to prepare a business model suitable for Sathosa. The Auditor General also pointed out the internal administrative weaknesses as well as the need to establish this institution under a business model that can make decisions independently without external interference.",
