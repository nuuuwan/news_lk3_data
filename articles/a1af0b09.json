    "Leader of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance, Gampaha District Parliamentary candidate, Entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera states that the current government lacks a progressive vision and simply continues the policies of previous administrations.",
    "Addressing a public rally held in Ratnapura, Jayaweera said: \u201cRanil Wickremesinghe, who is undoubtedly a skilled and seasoned politician, now suggests to send experienced people for leadership. But his vast experience comes with consequences.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s a politician so adept that he\u2019s managed to erode the foundations of major political parties\u2014those built by Mr. Senanayake, Mr. Bandaranaike, and Wijeweera. Today, he seems pleased with what he\u2019s accomplished, almost as if he\u2019s reveling in it.\u201d",
    "\u201cNow, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe sits comfortably in his armchair, because \u2018the boy\u2019 is diligently following through on his unfinished work. But we have our own political path to follow, one we won\u2019t abandon out of fear. This isn\u2019t just opposition politics\u2014it\u2019s a reminder to Anura Kumara and everyone else that our purpose is bigger than that\u201d, he added."
