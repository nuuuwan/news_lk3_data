  "original_body_lines": [
    "As the country attempts to limp back to normalcy from the worst ever economic crisis, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) will once again engage professionals, including young business leaders, at the 44th National Conference of Chartered Accountants to play a critical role in helping weather the storm and seize new opportunities to help revive the country.",
    "With Sri Lanka at a crossroad right now, mired in its worst ever economic crisis and dealing with an unfathomable social catastrophe that has also caused a significant brain drain, it is important to think beyond the crisis and face it with courage. The crisis has prompted us to look at opportunities to realise the potential of the country that can be unlocked if the correct strategies are put in place. Therefore, CA Sri Lanka, which has continuously inculcated thought leadership among the professional community, will utilise this year\u2019s National Conference to inspire young leaders to envision these opportunities and encourage them to be part of the recovery strategy, especially by embarking on entrepreneurship and embracing new technology.",
    "The theme of this year\u2019s conference, \u2018Beyond the Perfect Storm: Seize the Opportunity,\u2019 was unveiled at a special press conference organised by CA Sri Lanka, which was graced by CA Sri Lanka President Sanjaya Bandara, CA Sri Lanka Vice President Heshana Kuruppu, National Conference Committee Chairperson Anoji de Silva, Technical Committee Chairman Anura Perera, and CA Sri Lanka acting Chief Executive Officer Prasanna Liyanage.",
    "The 44th National Conference of Chartered Accountants will be held from 3 to 5 October, at the Monarch Imperial, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte, and the event is expected to attract over 2,000 delegates, including business leaders and c-suite executives.",
    "Addressing the press conference, Bandara said that Sri Lanka is at a critical juncture today and needs bold, ambitious strategies and a strong commitment from all stakeholders to realise its full potential. \u201cWhile policymakers have a critical role in giving leadership to our nation and putting in place effective policies to strengthen the systems and ensure economic stability, as professionals in both the private and public sectors, we must continuously focus on good governance, transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct to support our country so that we, as citizens, can enjoy the true dividends of a stable economy,\u201d he said.",
    "Bandara noted that this year\u2019s conference will help everyone look to the future and the opportunities that come with it. \u201cAt the end of the day, it is crucial that we envisage the future and alter our course decisively in order to stop a repeat of the worst catastrophe our country has ever experienced and is now experiencing,\u201d he added.",
    "Elaborating on the importance of the National Conference, de Silva said that the conference, which has a history of over four decades, holds immense importance not just for Chartered Accountants but for the professional community due to the insightful and inspiring content it offers to the delegates year after year.",
    "\u201cThe conference serves as an important catalyst for professional growth, enabling participants to expand their knowledge, build valuable connections, and inspire out-of-the box thinking in our continuing quest to help our members and non-accountants to be better at what they do so that they can transform and continue to contribute effectively to the success of the nation.\u201d",
    "Explaining the rationale of this year\u2019s theme, Perera said that conference will have considerable focus on digitalization and AI which will help improve governance and accountability, a sine qua non if we are to attract investor confidence and prevent recurrence of similar crises in the future. The second focus area will be Blue and Green economy. The Technical Committee recognised certain crucial areas and opportunities under these two pillars for consideration at this time, both in the context of the perfect storm Sri Lanka is currently experiencing and the storms in the broader global environment."
