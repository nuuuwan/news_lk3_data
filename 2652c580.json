    "He said the JVP does not have the knowledge and skills to deal with the international community.",
    "Addressing an SLPP meeting in Minuwangoda, he said JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was harping about a 75-year curse as if they had not been involved in governance in the country.",
    "\"Anura Kumara held a Cabinet portfolio in the Chandrika Bandaranaike government. They were given ministerial positions for five years. But, they gave up halfway through.
