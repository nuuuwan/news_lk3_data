They may still feel trapped in the same plight, and unless that perception is acknowledged, addressed, and their aspirations realised, the resurgence of dissent is not merely possible but inevitable

It is now 15 years since the end of a brutal 30-year conflict. Yet, we remain trapped in a cycle of grief, division, and mistrust. This cannot continue. If we do, we will head down a path to ruin.

A rare and golden opportunity stands before us now. The recently concluded general elections have sent a powerful message: our communities are ready to rise above the shackles of communal politics and chart a new course toward unity and hope.

Addressing the matter now has profound significance in view of the ‘Maaveerar Naal’ (Great Heroes Day) that fell on 27 November, and comments made by a newly appointed independent MP representing the Jaffna District. Both are related.

Today, we commemorate the fifth anniversary of my eternally cherished wife Dr Malwattage Josephine Sarojini Perera (nee Peeris) leaving this mortal world. It has been five years of intense desolation and loneliness for all of us in the family, as well as our friends since she left this planet Earth. However, the memories of her life remain vivid; her ever-present spirit is so much with us, and her heritage is eternally enduring. She was ever so beautiful in her physical profile as much as from deep within the interior of her human form. She was not merely a remarkable individual, but a dazzling beacon of compassion, an embodiment of love, and an eternal source of inspiration for those fortunate enough to cross paths with her.

### All quiet on home front – hence peek overseas

Things seem to be moving well in our beloved country and this is a great change from how things were before September and in the past years.  We could only wring our hands in consternation and cry out “When will our lives improve? When will Sri Lanka rise to be the country, we older ones knew?” We witnessed wanton extravagance in government spending; corruption all across the political and bureaucratic boards, and the poor getting poorer and more destitute.

Of course there is still criticism, which is as it should be. The NPP is far from a magic wand. Time is needed to show improvement in the general well-being of the people. What we need to have now is patience and faith in the new set of leaders we have elected to power.
