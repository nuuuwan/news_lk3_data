    "Oceanic Manta Ray (Mobula birostris) landed at a local fishery harbour",
    "Manta and devil rays are among the ocean\u2019s most graceful and captivating creatures. With their wide, wing-like fins and majestic movements, they glide effortlessly through tropical and subtropical waters, capturing the hearts of divers and ocean lovers around the world. But these iconic animals are increasingly under threat\u2014targeted by global fisheries and caught unintentionally as bycatch.",
    "Sri Lanka is one of the world\u2019s hotspots for manta and devil ray landings, where these species are caught in large numbers, especially by tuna gillnet fisheries. These rays belong to the Mobulidae family (subclass Elasmobranchii), and six of the world\u2019s nine species are found in Sri Lankan waters: the Oceanic Manta Ray (Mobula birostris), Spinetail Devil Ray (Mobula mobular), Sicklefin Devil Ray (Mobula tarapacana), Bentfin Devil Ray (Mobula thurstoni), Shorthorned Pygmy Devil Ray (Mobula kuhlii), and Longhorned Pygmy Devil Ray (Mobula eregoodoo). All are filter feeders, using their large mouths and gill plates to sieve plankton and small fish from the water.",
    "These species, particularly the Oceanic Manta Ray\u2014which can reach an impressive 7 meters across\u2014are highly vulnerable to overfishing. They grow slowly, mature late, produce a single pup every few years, and live long lives. In fact, their reproductive rates are slower than those of leopards or dolphins. This makes them especially prone to population declines. According to the IUCN Red List, all mobulid species in Sri Lankan waters are considered Endangered.",
    "In Sri Lanka, mantas and devil rays are mostly caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries targeting skipjack and yellowfin tuna. Although not highly valued for their fresh meat, these rays are retained for two main reasons: local dried fish consumption and the lucrative trade in dried gill plates. These gill plates, used in traditional Chinese medicine\u2014despite lacking scientific evidence of any health benefits\u2014fetch high prices in Southeast Asian markets. Sri Lanka has been identified as a key exporter in the international gill plate trade, with its fishing fleets ranked among the top three globally for annual manta and devil ray catches.",
    "At local fish landing sites, manta and devil rays are offloaded from multi-day boats, weighed, and typically processed on-site. Their gill plates are carefully extracted, often dried nearby or sent to specialised drying centres. The remaining meat is usually dried and sold for local consumption. But with fishing rates far exceeding the species\u2019 natural reproductive rates, their populations are in steep decline.",
    "This alarming trend calls for urgent conservation action. Stronger enforcement of existing international protections\u2014such as those under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals), and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission\u2014is crucial to ensure the survival of these extraordinary animals and maintenance of our national marine biodiversity.",
