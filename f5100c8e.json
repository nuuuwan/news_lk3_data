    "The main opposition has voiced concerns about the imminent transfer of the burdens arising from corruption, fraud, financial misappropriations, and flawed politics of the Rajapaksas onto the general public, effective January 1 next year.",
    "During a press conference at the Opposition Leader\u2019s Office in Colombo on Thursday, SJB MP Mayantha Dissanayake asserted that the recently passed Budget in Parliament would mark the final budget of the current government. Dissanayake emphasized that people could not endure another year under what they described as an oppressive regime.",
    "\u201cThe implementation of an 18 percent VAT starting January 1 will lead to price hikes across all commodities, imposing unbearable taxation and triggering unprecedented consequences. This tax will significantly burden those who are still struggling to cover their basic expenses,\u201d said Dissanayake.",
    "Dissanayake accused the President of neglecting the national economy and the crisis-stricken populace, alleging that instead of aiding them, the President is aiding the Rajapaksas to safety. The SJB MP pointed to a Supreme Court verdict that highlighted those responsible for the country\u2019s economic downturn, accusing the President of shielding them due to a desire to cling to power.",
    "\u201cThe President\u2019s government is dancing to the tune of the International Monetary Fund, and this crisis cannot be rectified without an election,\u201d Dissanayake affirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the people to realize that a democratic election is the only path to change their circumstances. The nation requires a government devoid of corrupt politicians to ensure transparency.\u201d",
