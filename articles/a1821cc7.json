    "Former Speaker and National Movement for Social Justice Chairperson Karu Jayasuriya has called on all relevant parties to resolve the dispute in connection to the appointment of an Acting Inspector General of Police.",
    "In a statement, Jayasuriya said it is vital that the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary work in harmony to ensure a free and fair Presidential Election.",
    "\u201cThe Constitutional Council chaired by the Speaker too has a national role and we have conveyed options available to the President to resolve this issue. We have also observed that despite the enforcement of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, a vacancy still remains in the Constitutional Council,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayasuriya noted that the failure to appoint a new member to the vacancy is deeply affecting the performance of the Council in carrying out its duties.",
    "\u201cIf the full cadre of 10 members were properly constituted earlier, embarrassing situations would not have arisen,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayasuriya urged relevant authorities to fully implement the recently enacted laws regarding election campaigning, bribery, and corruption, emphasising that it is the will of the people."
