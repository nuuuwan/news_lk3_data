    "Litro Gas ceremonially commissioned its state-of-the-art refurbished and upgraded storage and bottling facility at Mabima, Sapugaskande last week. The ceremony was presided over by the Chief of Staff & National Security Advisor to the President, Sagala Rathnayaka. Recognized as one of the largest in the region, the Mabima facility reinforces Litro Gas\u2019s commitment to operational excellence and national energy security.",
    "Commissioned in 1984 during Colombo Water & Gas Company, the Mabima Filling Plant has been completely refurbished after 40 years to meet international operation and safety standards, enhancing efficiency. The refurbishment and upgrading of the Mabima facility, which cost a little over Rs. 1 billion, will ensure bottling and distribution efficiency for another 10 to 15 years for the country. Mabima will play a vital role alongside the Kerawalapitiya plant, reducing dependency on the Kerawalapitiya filling plant, which was commissioned in 2014.",
    "Muditha Pieris, Chairman/CEO of Litro Gas, stated, \u201cJust as much as it was important to deliver an LPG cylinder that was extremely safe, it was important to safeguard the supply & distribution of LPG to our customers without any interruption. During my tenure from 2015 to 2019, over two million households were converted to LPG from firewood, significantly increasing domestic LPG usage in the country. With the market share being increased from about 73% to 85%, it is important to ensure an uninterrupted supply of LPG to the community. This upgrade allows Litro Gas to manage a seamless LPG delivery process across the country, ensuring uninterrupted supply to its customers. It is noteworthy that the cost of Refurbishing & Upgrading was done without any financial support or loan from an external party but with only the organization\u2019s finances.\u201d",
