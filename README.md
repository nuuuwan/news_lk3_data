Russia may use its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile to attack тАЬdecision-making centresтАЭ in Kyiv in response to UkraineтАЩs firing of Western missiles at Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Russia has not so far struck Ukrainian government ministries, parliament or the presidentтАЩs office in the course of the 33-month war.

Kyiv is heavily protected by air defences, but Putin says the Oreshnik, which Russia fired for the first time at a Ukrainian city last week, is incapable of being intercepted - a claim greeted with scepticism by Western experts.

тАЬOf course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range Western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on November 21,тАЭ Putin told leaders of a security alliance of ex-Soviet countries at a summit in Kazakhstan.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka is planning to call bids to develop two 500 Megawatt wind plants offshore of Mannar and Puttalam after feasibility studies are concluded in 2027, Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman Tilak Siyambalapitiya said.

The CEB has to make detailed environmental studies, sea floor, and logistics before calling for bids, Siyambalapitiya told a forum organized by Sri LankaтАЩs Export Development Board.

The Mannar site is substantially superior in energy yield compared to Puttalam he said.

It will be about 100 kilometers off shore, but wind turbines could be planted on the sea floor.

Power will be brought to the shore by cables with no offshore grid substation and connected to the grid.

The Puttalam site was about 10 kilometres off shore but wind was not as good as Mannar.

Transmission cost was also higher requiring new lines as existing capacity was full.

A third location that could be developed later was Hambantota which was less attractive.
