### I OPPOSE THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MINISTER OF PLANNING AND THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE

*2024-10-14 11:52:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/i-oppose-the-prime-minister-the-minister-of-planning-and-the-minister-of-agriculture/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Falling leaves, an autobiographical memoir of LC Arulpragasam)

I had no place to go, because I was wedded to the agriculture sector – by my own choosing. Therefore, I was lucky to find a berth as Head of the Agriculture Sector in the Department of National Planning. But I had to pay a career-price for doing this, because it involved my working under a non-civil servant and under someone whom I outranked in the Civil List – which was simply not done in those days.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake , though not securing a 50%+1 vote, won the recently concluded presidential election and has become the ninth executive president of the country. In this election as in the previous one, the vote of the Tamil people went to the unsuccessful candidates.

AKD did not win in any of the Tamils dominated districts. There are many comments and criticisms on this issue in especially the social media. These commentators often do not have deep understanding of politics and express knee jerk reactions towards this sensitive issue.

### The 1956 election landslide and SWRD Bandaranaike’s tenure (1956 — 1959)

*2024-10-14 11:46:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-1956-election-landslide-and-swrd-bandaranaikes-tenure-1956-1959/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar, memoirs of  Bradman Weerakoon)

My acquaintance with S W R D Bandaranaike was only through the press reports of his election campaign. That was before he came to the prime minister’s office in the Fort (now housing the foreign ministry at Republic Square), on an April morning, after the swearing in of his Cabinet at Queen’s House. His eloquence as a speaker, especially his Independence Day speech in 1948, was deeply imprinted in my mind.

Throughout a gruelling campaign he had shown extraordinary skills of perseverance in the face of severe odds, and the ability to persuade large masses of ordinary people to believe in his cause. I wondered how he would be to work with after I had experienced the rather easy going style of Sir John. There was also the serious business to be faced of how soon he would be able to make his election slogan of `Sinhala Only’ as the official language in 24 hours come true?

### Obama joins Kamala’s campaign trail, boostig her chances

Trump secretly sent Putin coveted Covid testing machines at height of shortage – Bob Woodward

George Washington’s farewell address delivered at Mount Vernon at the end of his second term in 1796, when he was 64-year-old, “stands today as a timeless warning about the forces that threaten American democracy”.

No president ever wanted to be the president of the United States as passionately as Washington. He deemed the pinnacle of his achievement to be the winning of independence from England and paving the way to the Federal Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he sat as its presiding officer till 1787. He most reluctantly accepted the presidency in 1789, and again in 1793. But in 1796, he was firm in his refusal, as he considered the presidency to be just an epilogue to his career, not his greatest achievement.

### Gaza as a moral compass – and a strategic blunder

*2024-10-14 11:44:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/gaza-as-a-moral-compass-and-a-strategic-blunder/) · `en`

The government of Sri Lankan president Anura Kumara Dissanayake has pledged solidarity with Gaza and Palestine. In this the National People’s Power (NPP) party differs little from other political outfits in the country, which have all expressed their support for the rights of Palestinians and the idea of Palestinian statehood. Even the previous administration, of Ranil Wickremesinghe, reiterated its commitment to a two-state solution, though its relations with Israel were controversial at best and problematic at worst.

### The Wrath of a Nation

*2024-10-14 11:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-wrath-of-a-nation/) · `en`

The wrath of a nation can be a fearful thing. In 2022 we saw its evolution and culmination in our own “Aragalaya“, which sent the then president, a so called “battle hardened” war veteran and “warrior-statesman”, first in to exile and then to precipitate retirement.

We saw it again, just a couple of weeks ago, in the election of Sri Lanka’s ninth executive president, a villager from deeply rural Tambuttegama, the son of a surveyor’s assistant. That he was the first student from Tambuttegama Central College to gain university entrance, is another factor which attests to the absence of privilege and personal resources. His election is also an extension of the “Aragalaya”, and a logical evolution of that movement, but without the drama and histrionics and, instead, that energy, that anger, legitimately channeled in to a quiet civic purpose.

In his autobiography An Asian Prime Minister’s Story, Sir John relates how he thought of the idea of a Colombo Powers Conference and makes this comment:–

In the last presidential election, Gajanayake pointed out that Abeysekera had joined a group of retired police officers who actively campaigned for the national People's Power (NPP) of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s construction sector non-performing loans which peaked at 17.1 percent after a currency collapse, has eased to 14.1 percent despite a contraction in credit, according to the central bank data in a Financial Stability Review.

Construction investment credit is usually one of the big beneficiaries when central banks print money to target inflation or growth and collapse as soon as a ‘stabilization crisis’ starts as inflation ceases to accelerate.

Central banks typically ‘cut rates’ by printing money through open market operations, buying back government bonds from banks, allowing them to give loans without deposits.  The exercise tends to worsen loan to deposit ratios.

In the last crisis however some foreign banks, sharply curtailed all credit, including interbank lending due higher risk perceptions including on government debt, where an actual default or induced artificial default from debt restructuring was feared.

The United States said on Sunday it will send U.S. troops to Israel along with an advanced U.S. anti-missile system, in a highly unusual deployment meant to bolster the country’s air defenses following missile attacks by Iran.

U.S. President Joe Biden said the move was meant “to defend Israel,” which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1.

The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on Iran’s energy infrastructure.

Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder described the deployment as part of “the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months” to support Israel and defend U.S. personnel from attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed groups.

For the first time in recent history, the newly appointed Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Priyantha Weerasooriya has announced a transparent selection process for Sri Lanka Police officers applying for foreign training courses and workshops.

In an official communique last week, Weerasooriya called for applications from police officers for foreign training programs to be held soon.

Moving away from the traditional method where officers were handpicked by the IGP or nominated by senior officers, Weerasooriya has introduced a mandatory interview process to select officers based on merit and qualifications.

The previous system had long been criticised for favouring officers close to the police top brass, sidelining others who might have been more deserving. Officers have often complained about the lack of clear criteria in the selection process, which undermined fairness and opportunities for growth within the force.

The people must realise though that with AKD at the helm only half the battle is won. He needs the people’s mandate to control the parliament. He must have an able crew to help him navigate the choppy waters ahead. At this point the NPP are doggedly sticking to their plan of nominating qualified and capable individuals to attract the attention of the voters. Already the names of high profile academics and professionals are emerging as candidates. This is leading the other parties to scramble and gather similar types to represent them and mirror the opposite camp. At least one thing is guaranteed – an increase in the IQ and capability of the next parliament which will be like none before

The opportunity to make significant change in Sri Lanka’s political, economic and governance landscape
