Colombo, March 30 (Daily Mirror)- India remains unresponsive to the request by Sri Lanka to allow an innocent passage through the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for its fishermen to enter the Arabian Sea, a top source said.

Currently, Sri Lankan fishermen get detained by the Indian Coast Guard when they unlawfully enter Indian waters on their way to the Arabian Sea for fishing activities.

The President embarked on a two-day visit to India in July last year, his first since taking office last year after a tumultuous period that saw the island nation’s economy tank, and protests erupt on its streets leading to ouster of former leaders.

### Baltimore bridge collapse: Insurance loss could hit $3 billion

The collapse of a bridge in the US city of Baltimore will result in the largest single marine insurance loss ever, a British insurance marketplace said.

Six people were presumed dead after a ship crashed into the bridge, and divers have recovered two bodies.

Experts say the damages could cost as much as $3 billion (£2.3 billion).

“I would say it’s certainly going to be one of the largest marine losses in history,” said John Neal, chief executive officer of Lloyd’s of London.

“Of that there is little or no doubt,” Mr Neal told the BBC. “But genuinely the good news is it’s insured.”

Mr Neal said the port and the ship that crashed into the bridge are also insured.

“So from a financial point of view, there is a process that will allow for financial compensation to be made and for the claim to be settled,” he said.

The Maryland Department of Transportation has so far asked the Biden administration for $60m in emergency funds to help clear debris and clean up after the incident.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will replace a ‘special commodity levy’ with a new protectionist tax from January 01, State Minister Ranjit Siyambalapitiya said, which will give extra profit to farmers and keep food prices high.

“The special commodity levy, which was used to protect domestic farmers and domestic producers, will be removed from January 01,” Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

The special commodity levy was advocated by then trade minister Bandula Gunawardana, as the US fired a commodity boom ahead of the collapse of a US housing bubble in a bid to reduce the tax on tax effect of duties, para-tariffs and make food taxes more transparent, according to some analysts.

However, the tax came under fire due to being slapped at midnight as tax payers and the hungry were sleeping and its alleged manipulation to give profits to some importers.

Shakib al -Hasan has any plan for the Bangladesh team again?What do you think about him?When Dhananjaya D Silva was asked, 'I can't tell you about the projects now. And I don't need to talk about him because he is not in my team. The Bangladesh team should be bad about him. It is not the appropriate question for me. You are wrongly asking me. '

Karuna had other troubles facing him on the military front. Of the 5,700  cadres in the East, around 2,000 were young and inexperienced. The  greater part of them were recruited or conscripted after the ceasefire  and had not seen battle.

The LTTE was split vertically and horizontally as a result and gradually weakened. By 2007 the LTTE ceased  having territorial control in the Eastern province

As stated in the previous articles, Karuna  after the split had concentrated the bulk of his forces in the Koralaipattru division of north Batticaloa. He expected an invasion across the Verugal River, which demarcates the border between the Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts. Karuna set up lines of defence to the south of the river

Yesterday, Police spokesman Nihal Thalduwa informed the media that in the police divisions of Negombo, Kochchikade and Seeduwa, police raided 53 spas. According to the spokesperson, 145 suspects including 137 women and eight men were taken into custody.

If this statement is correct, it would appear that many men do not frequent these establishments of alleged ill-fame. Only eight men were found in the 53 spas which were raided. It also makes the lords and ladies who run these establishments philanthropists for keeping over a hundred idle women on their payroll!

The police spokesman went on to add that raids were carried out on information  received from police intelligence reports.

The plight of women in Afghanistan is expected to get worse. The Taliban regime has vowed to “start public stoning of women to death”, an act that the group’s Supreme Leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, claims is “in the name of God”.

Now, Akhundzada, in an audio message, has said that women committing adultery will be stoned to death. In the message, released by the Taliban-run state media, he addresses the West, saying, “We will soon implement the punishment for adultery. We will flog women in public. We will stone them to death in public. These are all against your democracy, but we will continue doing it.”

According to The Telegraph, he compared the West with the Devil and said, “We both say we defend human rights – we do it as God’s representative and you as the Devil’s.”
