    "\u201cI believe that the Tamil community has made a correct decision,\u201d Zhenhong told reporters on November 19.",

    "\u201cThis afternoon I visited Point Pedro and I was impressed by the slogan written there which is \u2018Unity in diversity is the strength of Sri Lanka\u2019. I think this is very correct and I think this is where the hope lies. And this recent general election perfectly reflected this slogan.\u201d",

    "Ministers in the previous government have said India has raised concerns over increasing Chinese investments and activities in its backyard of Sri Lanka\u2019s north citing security concerns.",
    "\u201cToday I am here without a special purpose. Today we are here to see how is the life going in the North since recently, specially to see the lives of our brothers and sisters in the Northern province,\u201d Zhenhong said.",
    "\u201cThis year for the first time Jaffna supported a party from the South, the NPP, to win the election for the first time in the history.\u201d",
    "\u201cAll these show that both Jaffna and the whole Northern Province are making changes and all these make our visit more meaningful,\u201d he said.",
    "China has invested in sea cucumber plants in the North and assured an export market for the products. Some fishermen have gradually shifted to sea cucumber farming due to poor fish catch in the Northern sea amid bottom trawling by Indian fishermen.",
