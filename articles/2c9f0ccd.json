    "UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres speaking at the UN Private Sector Forum",
    "Sri Lankan business leaders joined more than 50 global CEOs, government representatives, and United Nations leaders at the 2025 UN Global Compact Private Sector Forum (PSF) in New York, convened on 22 September, during the UN General Assembly. The high-level roundtable focused on mobilising private sector investment to close the global financing gap for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and accelerate inclusive, sustainable growth.",
    "Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC CEO/Chairman and UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka Chairman Dilhan C. Fernando.",
    "Dialog Axiata PLC Executive Director/Group Chief Executive and UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka Board Member Supun Weerasinghe.",
    "UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka Executive Director Rathika de Silva.",
    "Together, they joined a distinguished group of leaders with a combined market capitalisation of more than $ 2 trillion, reflecting Sri Lanka\u2019s growing visibility within global sustainability dialogues.",
    "Opening the Forum, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres highlighted the urgency of accelerating progress on the 2030 Agenda, drawing attention to the global SDG financing gap, which now exceeds $ 4 trillion annually. He emphasised the need for both governments and the private sector to redirect capital toward priority areas and to strengthen delivery on existing commitments.",
    "Participants engaged with the UN Global Compact Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which outlines six critical transitions: food systems, energy, digital access, education, jobs, and climate and biodiversity. Deliberations focused on advancing investment-ready pipelines in low and middle-income countries, where capital has the potential to unlock productivity, resilience, and growth.",
    "The Forum reflected on the economic case for urgent action. Continuing with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d could cost significantly more than investing in measures to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0C, with climate-related damages already adding up to $ 500 billion annually. By contrast, scaling sustainable solutions across food, water, health, and climate could generate $ 10 trillion in opportunities and create nearly 400 million jobs by 2030.",
    "For Sri Lanka, participation in the Forum carried particular significance as the country continues its journey toward economic stabilisation and sustainable recovery. The presence of UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka\u2019s leadership highlighted the importance of private capital, corporate innovation, and responsible business practices by integrating the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact to actively contribute towards advancing resilience and growth.",
    "By engaging at this level, Sri Lanka reaffirmed that even in smaller markets, the private sector can play an influential role in shaping solutions to shared global challenges such as climate adaptation, food security, and digital inclusion. The delegation\u2019s contribution also reflected a recognition that aligning with international sustainability standards is central to building credibility and attracting investment.",
    "For Sri Lanka, the themes addressed at the Forum resonate strongly with national priorities. Investments in climate resilience, digital transformation, and inclusive growth are essential for long-term stability and recovery. The discussions on energy access, digital infrastructure, and sustainable food systems directly align with the country\u2019s development agenda.",
    "UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka\u2019s participation also serves as an important signal to the private sector locally. It demonstrates the need for businesses to embed sustainability into their core strategies and to actively contribute to building resilience and unlocking opportunities. The delegation\u2019s presence at PSF highlighted Sri Lanka\u2019s readiness to engage with global best practices and positioned the country as a constructive partner in shaping solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.",
    "Outcomes from the Forum will feed into several global milestones in the year ahead, including COP30 in Brazil, the World Social Summit, and the implementation of the Pact for the Future. For UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka, this means continuing to work closely with businesses, government, and the UN system to ensure global priorities are translated into national action.",
    "Partnering with stakeholders to build pipelines for climate adaptation, food security, and digital inclusion.",
    "Inspiring more Sri Lankan companies to join the UN Global Compact and uphold its Ten principles.",
    "As the UN marks its 80th year and the UN Global Compact its 25th, the 2025 PSF reinforced both the urgency and the opportunity of the sustainability agenda. The presence of Sri Lankan business leaders at the Forum affirmed that the country is not a bystander, but an active contributor to global progress.",
    "Network Sri Lanka now calls on the wider private sector to build on this momentum, align with global sustainability standards, and work together to deliver impact that strengthens both the economy and society."
