Fourteen people have died in Taiwan’s popular tourist hub in the eastern county of Hualien, with 124 missing after a barrier lake in the mountains overflowed to deluge a town during a typhoon, the fire department said on Wednesday.

Taiwan has been lashed since Monday by the outer rim of Super Typhoon Ragasa, now hitting China’s southern coast and the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong.

The barrier lake, formed by landslides triggered by earlier heavy rain in the island’s sparsely populated east, burst its banks on Tuesday afternoon to send a wall of water into the township of Guangfu.

The water hit like a “tsunami”, said a Guangfu postman who gave his family name of Hsieh, though he was able to flee to the second floor of the post office just in time. Later, he got home to find his car had been swept into the living-room.

Fire officials said all the dead and missing were in Guangfu, where the waters swept away a major road bridge across a river.

A short time later, Routh was returned to the courtroom to complete the proceedings. This time, he was wearing handcuffs, but there was no blood visible on his white shirt, and he did not appear to have succeeded in harming himself.

There were troubles from the people that the fertilizer was supplied only through a company and that there was a delay in fertilizer supply. Some parties also put forward the idea of ​​getting fertilizer from other companies.

### Gaza, genocide and Sri Lanka’s dilemma of conscience

*2025-09-24 03:04:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Gaza-genocide-and-Sri-Lanka-s-dilemma-of-conscience/4-782109) · `en`

The finding by the United Nations that genocide is occurring in Gaza is an inflection point

The Government should support civil society and free media at home. Journalists should not be threatened for reporting on Gaza

Last week, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, chaired by former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.

The Commission of Inquiry found that four out of the five acts defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention are being carried out. They are: killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part, and imposing measures intended to prevent births.

### NPP Government’s shamelessness over Gaza

What is glaring, however, is just how completely the NPP has capitulated

Among the hopes many had for the NPP Government when it was elected one year ago was that it would move Sri Lanka to actually opposing the devastating genocide Israel was carrying out against the Palestinian people in Gaza. What the NPP Government has gone on to do since then has been the opposite. A look at its positions on Palestine, its actions while in Government and its own past unearths a shamelessness which all Sri Lankans must contend with.

### Who cries for Hambantota, and why?

*2025-09-24 02:56:36* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Who-cries-for-Hambantota-and-why/4-782107) · `en`

Hambantota is not merely an alternative; it is a practical solution to systemic inefficiencies in Sri Lanka’s current LPG supply chain

This article is written to set the record straight in response to misleading narratives about the recent Litro Gas tender. It is not about protecting one company’s interest, but about revealing how Hambantota, if rationally utilised, can deliver long-overdue benefits to Sri Lanka’s economy and people.

For time immemorial, Sri Lanka has been a decisive node in global trade. From the days of the Silk Route, Ceylon—as it was then called—connected East and West. Historical records from the Godawaya port in Hambantota show how this southern coast played a role in international trade centuries ago. After 75 years of independence, despite every Government repeating Hambantota’s location-specific advantage as an election slogan, little was done to convert that advantage into real economic prosperity.

Eco-conscious travellers look for destinations that practise what they preach, and packaging, often overlooked, can reinforce Sri Lanka’s positioning as a responsible, ethical destination

Sustainable food packaging is no longer about simply replacing plastic with paper. The real test lies in creating systems that deliver food safety, preserve shelf life, and meet consumer convenience, all while being environmentally responsible. What matters now is how packaging performs across its entire lifecycle: from raw material sourcing and production to disposal and reuse. That’s where real impact begins.
