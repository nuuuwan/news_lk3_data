    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday slammed the Government\u2019s new social welfare program \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 calling it a mere blindfold.",
    "Premadasa issued a statement noting that while there are 7 million poor in Sri Lanka now only 1.2 million will benefit from the program. He also demanded to know the criteria adopted by the Government to select the beneficiaries under the program.",
    "The Opposition Leader said his party warned former President Gotabaya\u2019s regime of an impending crisis due to its actions. \u201cWe also warned from the beginning that the actions of the incumbent Government are no better than those of its predecessor,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe Government has a singular yearning to endanger the country and its people, or else, it would not do anything to put so much pressure on the people. At this moment, even the negotiation with the International Monetary Fund, which is crucial for the country, has been made by the Government to a deal only to achieve its own narrow goals rather than a common engagement for the good of the country. All this implies nothing but a short-sighted arbitrary process of an opportunistic government,\u201d he added.",
    "Premadasa accused the Government of pushing the entire country into danger through its treacherous games.",
    "\u201cWe repeatedly emphasise that this situation can be changed, and the country can be built with a populist vision only through a new mandate and we also emphasise that we will exert all possible pressure on the government to realise it,\u201d Premadasa said.",
    "He noted that the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 program should be implemented targeting the poor population of 7 million people in the country.\u00a0 \u201cWe would like to recall that instead of the unscientifically selected people to achieve narrow goals, the people who have real needs should be selected through a scientific program,\u201d he said."
