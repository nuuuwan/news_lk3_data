    "Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) Sri Lankan diplomats in Russia will engage with officials of the Russian Defence Ministry this evening, in \"first steps\" towards repatriating Sri Lankans in Russia, who have been thrust into the battlefront of its war against Ukraine.",
    "The Foreign Ministry has received up to 455 complaints of Sri Lankans who are part of Russia's military efforts, willingly or unwillingly, but this number could be much higher, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said.",
    "While some of them had travelled as mercenaries, the State Minister said that others were duped into fighting for Russia at the battle front.",
    "\u201cThe people who have gone to Russia, have gone through different means. Most have gone through visit visas, and they have gone through India or the Middle East, and they have been duped by various nefarious agents, some of whom have been arrested,\u201d State Minister Balasuriya said.",
    "\u201cSome of those who travelled to Russia said that they would not be used for any fighting, but we have reports that they have been put to the front,\u201d the State Minister added, though contending that there may be a number of them who would not want to return to the island.",
    "\u201c26 people were repatriated after coming to the Sri Lankan embassy in Russia, while 16 have been reported missing,\u201d State Minister Balasuriya added.",
    "As a first step towards resolving this matter, the Russian Defence Ministry would meet Sri Lankan diplomats later today.",
    "\u201cToday in Moscow, there will be a meeting in the Defence Ministry, between (Sri Lanka\u2019s) diplomatic mission and defence attach\u00e9, with high ranking military officials. That would be the first step, in the continuous efforts to settle the situation,\u201d Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Levan Dzhagaryan said, at the media conference at the Foreign Ministry today."
