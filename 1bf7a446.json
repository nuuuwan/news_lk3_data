    "Expressing USAID\u2019s commitment to empower Sri Lanka\u2019s migrant workers, Ali Ezzatyar, Acting Deputy Mission Director, USAID Sri Lanka & Maldives, said \u201cAt a time when many Sri Lankans are seeking opportunities overseas, USAID wants to help minimize the negative impacts of their departure for both the migrants and the country, and ensure that when these workers return, they can reintegrate and utilize new skills and experiences obtained abroad to contribute to the development of Sri Lanka\u201d.",
    "Improving the resilience of Sri Lanka\u2019s migrant workers through skills development and recognition, guidance services and access to information are priorities of the SRMW project, and this research study marks the first of several of SRMW\u2019s policy related initiatives.",
