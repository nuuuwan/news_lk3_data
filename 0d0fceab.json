    "The Defence Ministry has granted permission to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to detain the two notorious underworld figures \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d for another 90 days.",
    "The CID has communicated this to the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "On December 06, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID to produce \u201cHarak Kata\u201d before a suitable Magistrate\u2019s Court if the evidence against him is insufficient to keep him in custody on detention orders.",
    "Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne alias \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d were arrested in Madagascar on Match 01 this year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials.",
    "The duo was brought back to the island on March 15 after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry of the arrest of 8 suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. The extradition process had been coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar.",

The police have offered a cash reward of Rs. 2.5 million for a tip-off about the Constable who aided and abetted the ill-famed underworld figure\u2019s escape bid and remains in hiding to date.",
    "Thus far the mother and the brother-in-law of the said Constable, another police officer, and a former sniper of Sri Lanka Army have been arrested over \u201cHarak Kata\u2019s\u201d failed attempt to flee."
