    "Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd., (CPSTL) last week said future decisions on recruitment, promotions, and transfers will be based solely on merit, free from political or personal influence.",
    "CPSTL Chairman D.J.A.S. De S. Rajakaruna, speaking at a media briefing marking one year of the Government\u2019s tenure, said the company had operated without a clear human resources framework for more than three decades. A new policy has now been introduced to address this gap, he noted.",
    "The Chairman urged the public not to seek jobs or transfers through Ministers or senior officials, stressing that only qualifications and experience would guide decisions.",
    "Rajakaruna added that in restructuring its workforce, the company had to reduce staff numbers due to skills gaps and mismatched roles. The new organisational plan, prepared by a State institution after a comprehensive study, defines positions and appointments according to professional criteria.",
    "As part of these reforms, CPSTL has trimmed its workforce by 1,600 employees, while the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has reduced staff by 1,200. Several units within CPSTL were also closed under the restructuring."
