He had taken refuge in the sand in the sand. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, which were called Bunker, have been refugees on the coast.

They faced a series of bombs for several weeks in the area announced by the Army Security Zone.

Luxmi told us at a recent meeting that many were struggling to save their lives.

We were inside the bunker.

We have seen the blood flowing out and the body- we can never forget it, ”he said.

The 26 -year war between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan government is finally over on May 19, alleged that more than one hundred Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) surrendered.

The photos and videos of the state forces as their successes have shown the assassination of prisoners tied up by hands.

Lakshmi was taken to the interim camp where about 250 000 people were detained from suspected LTTE - he is still fearing his true name.

In this beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka, a shadow looms large, shaping much of the turmoil and instability that grips its society. This shadow is corruption, a pervasive issue that seeps through the layers of governance, eroding the trust between the people and their leaders, and undermining the foundations of social and economic development. The claim that corruption is the root cause of the social instability in Sri Lanka is not an exaggeration; rather, it is a reflection of a harsh reality. From FCID investigations to inquiries at local police stations to inquiries at immigration – corruption persists!

Corruption in Sri Lanka manifests in various forms, from high-level political graft to everyday bureaucratic bribery. It affects everything from the simplest government transaction to the largest infrastructure projects. The impacts are profound and multifaceted, influencing not just the economic sphere but also the very social fabric of the nation.

The Meteorology Department says the low-level atmospheric disturbance still persists in the vicinity of the island and therefore, the prevailing showery conditions are expected to continue further.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of the island after 1.00 p.m.

Heavy showers of about 100mm are likely at some places in Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces.

Showers may occur in Western, Southern and Eastern coastal areas during the morning too, it said.

General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
