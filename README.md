### AKD and JVP-NPP’s mega-mandate: Re-founding the nation

*2024-11-21 02:48:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-and-JVP-NPP-s-mega-mandate-Re-founding-the-nation/4-769507) · `en`

There were two classic works on Sri Lanka after 1956. “Ceylon: Dilemmas of a New Nation” (Princeton 1960) by Howard Wriggins (he acknowledges with thanks the input of Mervyn de Silva--aged 30 at the time) and “The Emerging Elite: A Study of Political Leadership in Ceylon” by Marshall Singer (MIT, 1964).

Political theory holds that the ‘circulation of elites’ is imperative for the health of the body politic and society. The composition of the President Anura Dissanayake’s new JVP-NPP Cabinet, as that of the new Parliament, signals that a new elite has emerged and acceded to power and rulership. It faces the old dilemmas.

Over a decade, Sri Lanka’s politics has displayed extreme electoral volatility manifested in swings of increasing amplitude. These began with 2015 when the voters swung against the Rajapaksa regime and elected the liberal-reformist Yahapalanaya (‘Good Governance’) government of Maithripala Sirisena as President and Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM.

With the recent General election victory of the National People’s Power (NPP), Sri Lanka has entered a new chapter in its history. This moment of transition offers a unique opportunity to address the deep-rooted issues that have plagued our governance, economy, and social fabric. The people of Sri Lanka have spoken decisively, expressing their desire for change, transparency, and a fresh approach to leadership.

This article seeks to advise the new administration on critical priorities, highlighting the mistakes of the past and proposing pathways to ensure long-term prosperity, public satisfaction, and fiscal responsibility.

Over the years, successive governments have been criticised for systemic corruption, policy inconsistency, and economic mismanagement. From large-scale scandals like the Central Bank Bond Scam and the Avant Garde Maritime Scandal to misjudged projects like the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and many more, public trust in leadership has eroded significantly.
