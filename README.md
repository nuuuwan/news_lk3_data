### Gaza women, children are nearly 70% of verified war dead, UN rights office says

*2024-11-09 08:28:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103269/gaza-women-children-are-nearly-70-of-verified-war-dead-un-rights-office-says) · `en`

The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70% of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.

The U.N. tally since the start of the war, in which Israel’s military is fighting Hamas militants, includes only fatalities it has managed to verify with three sources, and counting continues.

The 8,119 victims verified is a much lower number than the toll of more than 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the 13-month-old war. But the U.N. breakdown of the victims’ age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war.

This finding indicates “a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality”, the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report.

### Towards Stability, Equity & Prosperity: Part V

As we have previously pointed out, though IMF programs appear to solely focus on development, they do not cater to or deal with matters that affect socio-economic justice and a fair go. Their only formula is one of liberalising markets for generating more profits for investors, with drastic cuts to social welfare benefits and expanding the tax base for increased revenue.

The IMF does not look into the socio-economic equity issues that are prevalent and predominant in most of the societies the world over, including in Sri Lanka. The theory of trickle-down economics[1] underpins their practice. However, nowhere has this theory once implemented been a success in terms of economic development, social stability, and an equitable sharing of the financial burden.

### Does it matter to the world who the next President of the USA is?

While it is unlikely that any well-meaning President would have exercised such powers indiscriminately and without good reason, the overall global situation today of a world near chaos, and the instances of US involvement in numerous countries and in conflicts and their failure to exercise their powers to prevent conflict or at least to minimise them and take the leadership in finding solutions through discussion and negotiation, have left open the question on the effectiveness of the US President when it comes to world affairs

Paradox of Power: Militarily it is a unipolar world of U.S. hegemony; economically it is a multipolar world with U.S. leadership; but on many transnational issues – such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the migration of people, epidemic disease, drugs, and environmental degradation – we live in a world only a step or two short of chaos (https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/american-power-the-world)

Putting a halt to crossovers is one of the key promises that the NPP made to people during our election campaigns. Now we are ready to fulfil these pledges through the right process.

This will be a common law for all political parties

The citizenry vote for political leaders in the hope that ‘this time’ there will be change for the better; and the electorate is disappointed time and again

Ah – yes, the old lie: that the hope of a nation resides in the chamber where chairs are thrown at critics and chillies are employed to evict policemen keen on restoring law and order.

And a major reason for the electorate in general and political pundits in particular being so cynical about the assembly we unmindfully describe as being august is in both the character and performance of the legislators we elected – lest we forget, let us remember and chide ourselves!

As a senior journalist observed in these columns not many moons ago: “Sri Lanka has chronically elected crooks, charlatans, the incompetent, the corrupt, and the utterly unrepentant of their litany of crimes.”

We are deeply concerned about the recent remarks made by Minister Vijitha Herath that no need has arisen to change the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) at this juncture. The comments fail to recognise the long journey towards MMDA reforms in Sri Lanka. For decades, Muslim women and groups have raised concerns about the serious discrimination and harm experienced by Muslim women, girls and families as a consequence of this law. The comments dismiss the grave impacts that Muslim women and girls continue to face on a daily basis due to discrimination under the current MMDA and Quazi system.

"The time has come for the change and we have a chance to create a change," the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Batticaloa district parliamentary candidate and former Member of Parliament, R. Sanakiyan said.

He was speaking at the election campaign meeting in Kalutara.

There is a regime change in the country. The president, who had carried out racist activities, had to go home.

The Rajapaksa family, who joined him as a group, has to go home.

In that way, the newly elected president in the country has clearly stated that he will not connect with the government, such as corrupt, robbers, rape, and comic recipients.

In that way, when we look at the other parties in the district, there is no such thing as any party to work with the president.

The Tamil people have a better chance. This is because the president was elected by 42 types of votes.
