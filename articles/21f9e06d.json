    "Mr Caspersz was also heavily involved in Melbourne\u2019s Sri Lankan community and was the vice president of the Burgher Association, a club that represents the Sri Lankan ethnic group in Australia.",
    "\u2018If he couldn\u2019t start his ride-on mower, I\u2019d go over and help him out, that\u2019s what neighbours do,\u2019 Mr Savoria said.",
    "\u2018To me, your neighbours are better than friends or relatives, because they\u2019re there. In an instant you need something, they\u2019re here right away.",
    "\u2018I know that his son didn\u2019t want him to do any gardening because of his age, but mainly because he wanted (Mr Caspersz) to look after his mum (Marlene) because she wasn\u2019t well.\u2019"
