    "Colombo, March 21 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has barred research activities for German vessel \u2018Sonne\u2019 in keeping with the one-year moratorium on such activities involving foreign ships in its Exclusive Economic Zone, but it will be allowed for replenishment in the Colombo port, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "The government has declared a moratorium on foreign research ships entering its waters for a year amid concerns from India over Chinese research vessels docking in its neighborhood. It was announced in the wake of China asking for the deployment of another research vessel. The government\u2019s decision is seen as in response to growing concerns in India.",
    "Chinese research ship Shi Yan 6 docked in Colombo port for several days last October, while in 2022 the navy vessel Yuan Wang 5 docked at Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. Also, China sought permission for its scientific research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3 to conduct \u201cdeep water exploration\u201d in the south Indian Ocean from January 5, 2024. The government did not permit it in keeping with the new regulations. Later China expressed its dissatisfaction to the Sri Lankan government.",
    "However, Germany sought permission for its vessel even before Sri Lanka announced new regulations. Now the moratorium is in effect, and the government has banned research activities."
