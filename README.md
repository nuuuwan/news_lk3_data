Former MPs must return handguns to Defense Ministry immediately. Over 100 ex-lawmakers received weapons for personal protection under previous government's policy. Current administration's stance unclear.

🟩

Informed sources said yesterday that the handguns provided to former MPs for personal protection were ordered to be handed over to the Defense Ministry without delay.

A senior security official told the Daily Mirror that parliamentary officials had separately sent a letter to the former MPs who had received these guns.

Statistics point out that over 100 MPs in the recently dissolved parliament have received handguns for personal protection.

The latest change has been followed by the previous government's decision to allow former MPs to keep at least two guns for their personal security.

Speaking to the media in August ahead of the presidential election, Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said the government had decided to implement a new policy that former MPs had two guns due to violence in the country.

However, it is not clear whether the current government will support the decision of the previous administration.

### Plantation workers are poor, destitute, and helpless, but their poetic expressions are marvellous

*2024-09-30 05:46:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Plantation-workers-are-poor-destitute-and-helpless-but-their-poetic-expressions-are-marvellous/4-767334) · `en`

When the Britishers introduced tea as an export crop to old Ceylon in mid 19th century, it was a game changer. It transformed the traditional subsistence agricultural economy that prevailed to a modern plantation economy seeking to satisfy the demand for the new beverage called tea spreading like a pandemic across Europe and Americas. Initially, it was a beverage of the rich and the aristocrats. A pound of tea was sold, according to advertisements that were inserted in papers, for 25 Sterling Pounds. This exclusive product was made inclusive by ingenious marketing strategies adopted by tea traders like presenting it as a brain tonic.

### Social reformer AKD, Sri Lanka’s 9th President

*2024-09-30 05:35:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Social-reformer-AKD-Sri-Lanka-s-9th-President/4-767333) · `en`

The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil shocked the country’s political establishment and sharply divided opinion. While some warned that Bolsonaro—a far-right populist who admired Brazil’s military dictatorship—posed a serious threat to democracy, others believed that Brazil’s strong institutions, including an assertive press and independent judiciary, would curb his authoritarian tendencies. This debate mirrors the global discussion surrounding populist leaders. Similarly, Sri Lanka is undergoing a political shift, with citizens demanding accountability from elites who have long failed them.

President Anura’s meteoric rise as a “Leader of the People” to become Sri Lanka’s 9th Executive President is emblematic of this trend. However, his presidency faces significant challenges, particularly in balancing his populist appeal with the deep-seated demands of economic governance and institutional reform.

### Fervent appeal to Minister Amarasuriya; please free Royal College from deep rooted corruption

To date, I have written over 25 letters to Principal Waththuhewa and over 10 to Education Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara, making the same appeal. I don’t mind their not acknowledging my emails, as long as they had acted to eradicate rampant money collections at the Royal Primary.

The Principal and his management team of 50 senior administrators completely ignore the thriving and omnipresent corruption happening right in front of them, employing a handpicked set of parents to rake in millions (without receipts/accounts/audits) and keeping the loot in private bank accounts. Please refer to the recent article where we showed the last year’s illegal collections topped Rs. 100 million (https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Education-Ministry-urged-to-probe-alleged-financial-malpractices-at-The-Royal-College-Primary/14-760265).

### Angajan Ramanathan requests President to reopen several roads in Jaffna

Northern former MP Angajan Ramanathan has formally requested President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to take action to reopen several key roads in the high-security zones of Jaffna.

This request follows the President’s decision to reopen two streets near the President’s House in Colombo for public access.

Ramanathan’s appeal highlights that, despite the war ending 15 years ago, several vital roads in Jaffna remain closed, significantly disrupting daily life and transportation for the local population.

In his letter, the former MP pointed out that the Jaffna-Palaly road, particularly the east side next to the Vayavilan Central College, should be freed from military restrictions. This road connects to the Ponnalai road, an essential route for local traffic. He also emphasised the closure of the Achuveli Vayavilan-Tholakatti street, which has hampered the functioning of major Government and private enterprises in the region.
