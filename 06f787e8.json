    "The 24-hour token strike to be launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) starting from 8 a.m. today (19) at the OutPatient Department (OPD) of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) will go down in history as the first strike at the hospital.",
    "According to GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, the token strike would be launched in protest over Health Ministry's failure to take necessary action against an ill-tempered consultant at the hospital.",
    "Dr. Wijesinghe told the Daily Mirror that the LRH Director and the Director General of Health Services had failed to resolve the issue, resulting in creating an uncomfortable environment for other doctors to work with the particular consultant.",
    "\"Thus, we urge the authorities to look into the issue without further delay, in order to maintain a smooth operation at the hospital,\" he added.",
    "He further noted that the strike would be the first trade union action to be launched at the LRH.",
    "Meanwhile, speaking to Daily Mirror, LRH Director Dr G. Wijesuriya said, \"The strike action could be considered to be inhuman as it put the lives of children at stake.",
    "The probe against the particular consultant is underway. However, the three doctors who worked along with the consultant have not been reporting to duty since June 21,\u201d Dr Wijesuriya added.",
    "Responding to this, the GMOA Media Spokesman said the three doctors had been assigned to the office of Director General of Health Services under a Ministry\u2019s directive. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
