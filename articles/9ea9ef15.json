    "A separate ethnic group in Sri Lanka, living alongside the Malays, Moors, Tamils, Burghers and the Sinhalese, Colombo Chetties form an integral part of Sri Lankan Society. Today, this small educated and cultured community consists of around 150,000 individuals living in the Western and North Western Provinces of Sri Lanka.",
    "The derivation of the name \u201cChetty\u201d is taken from the word \u201cSetthi\u201d, \u201cSitu\u201d or \u201cEtti\u201d meaning merchant, trader or banker indicating that the Chetties are descendants of a community of traders. The early ancestors of this community are said to have engaged in trade with Ceylon which later resulted in their migration to the Island. The Chetty Community has lived for several centuries in the Island from the time of the Sinhalese Kings.",
    "The Colombo Chetty Community has maintained close ties and friendly relations with all communities in Sri Lanka from time immemorial."
