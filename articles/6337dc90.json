    "\u2018The Old Guard has to go\u2019; this is the principal message to the world from the historic youth-led revolts in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and now Nepal. Violence in any form and for whatever cause is difficult to condone but the parasitism of the ruling classes or of the \u2018Old Guard\u2019 in these South Asian countries has been of such proportions and been perpetuated for so long that youth impatience has led to violence.",
    "The devastation meted out to principal institutions of democracy such as the house of parliament and the Supreme Court building in Nepal, for instance, goes beyond mere symbolism and indicates youth impatience and frustration with their seeming impotence and incapability to meet the basic aspirations of the people. As pointed out, the sweeping social media shut-down by the Nepalese government was the mere trigger to the wider violent upheaval that focused on the rooting out of corruption in public life and the political class was seen as chiefly instrumental in perpetuating such corruption.",
    "An uncertain political future currently faces Nepal. The violence has resulted in the democratic process coming to a halt and there is a huge question mark over who will fill the yawning political vacuum in the country. However, law-and-order institutions, such as the army, are still firmly in place and the likelihood is great that they will from now on be playing a prominent role in public life.",
    "However, the army being \u2018in the saddle\u2019, so to speak, anywhere in the world of democracy is no welcome development. Once in power the military tends to perpetuate its rule and this is the danger of allowing law-and-order situations in democracies to get out of hand. Pakistan, for instance, epitomizes these dangers. It will be in Nepal\u2019s interests for these truths to be visited afresh and for the necessary inferences to be drawn by those spearheading the revolt in Nepal, now that the country\u2019s former rulers have been \u2018shown the door\u2019.",
    "Where Nepal would \u2018go from here\u2019 is for the Nepalese people to decide but worldwide experience dictates that it would be in the interests of people anywhere for the basic pillars of democracy to be implanted and sustained in a country. That is, the political sovereignty of the people must be sustained through thick and thin. No doubt, sensible sections in Nepal would be of like mind.",
    "Ideally, fresh parliamentary elections should be held in Nepal and adequate provision made for substantial youth representation in the main legislature and other law-making institutions countrywide.",
    "In other words, youth empowerment should be ensured. It needs to be recognized by Nepal and other countries of this region, with claims to being democratic, that Freedom of Expression and independence of the media are integral to the empowerment of people. These freedoms cannot be done away with or glossed over by rulers. Contemporary Nepal testifies to the importance of these freedoms for the perpetuation of social peace.",
    "Nor could governments tamper with the fundamental pillars of democracy. \u2018Closed societies\u2019, so to speak, which compromised the basic tenets of democracy are a thing of the past. The break-up of the Soviet Union in the late eighties and early nineties testified to these truths.",
    "To be sure, there are yet some thriving totalitarian states in our midst but for how long they could contend against the forces of democracy and progressive change is an open question. Sooner or later the people would revolt on being deprived of their fundamental rights and this is an invaluable lesson of modern history. The Nepalese revolt re-enforces the lesson.",
    "Going forward, Nepal would need to ensure the steady democratization of its body politic. It has a history of identity based violent politics and it is through the consistent empowerment of communities via the democratic process that such violence could be effectively managed.",
    "Meanwhile, as at this writing there is no indication of any foreign involvement in the Nepalese crisis. However, the country\u2019s incoming rulers would need to ensure that Nepal steers clear of big power regional rivalries in its foreign policy orientation. The outgoing administration was seen as pro-China and it would be in Nepal\u2019s interests to ensure that it is not seen in this light in future.",
    "There is India to contend with and being seen by the latter as China\u2019s ally would not do Nepal any good in the near or long terms. Nepal is as dependent on India as it is on China in the area of economic assistance and the adoption of a policy of Non-alignment is best for the country.",
    "Moreover, too great a dependence on China would be detrimental to Nepal from the viewpoint of democratization as well since there is the case of Myanmar, seen as close to China, which is yet to establish even a degree of political stability amid a continuing youth-led, internal armed revolt. Given this backdrop, Nepal would from now on need to evolve domestic and external policies outside their traditional parameters.",
    "An interesting feature of the Nepalese revolt is the popular demand for accountability from all sections of the ruling class. Public anger, that is, was not only directed at the government but at the Opposition as well. The latter too had their houses and belongings vandalized, for example. They too were seen as a parasitic presence who in connivance with the rulers had been instrumental in the repression and disempowerment of the people.",
    "This aspect of the revolt in Nepal is of special interest because the Leader of the Opposition, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, is an avowed Marxist and one who for years led an armed revolt against the state. Today he too is on the run and is seen as tainted by corruption.",
    "We have a reminder here that even those sections that see themselves as opposed to the political Right, turn corrupt on tasting power. That is, \u2018the so-called oppressed internalize the value system of the oppressor.\u2019 This point should be seen by all Marxists in the seats of power as a timely wake-up call.",
