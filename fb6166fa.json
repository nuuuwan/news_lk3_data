    "The ICC is a global business organisation that represents the interests of companies from all sectors and regions. It serves as a platform for businesses to engage in dialogue, shape policy, and promote international trade and investment. The ICC provides a range of services and initiatives to support businesses, including arbitration and dispute resolution, policy advocacy, and the development of international trade rules and standards. With its extensive network of members and expertise in global business, the ICC plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and promoting a rules-based international trading system.",
    "ICC Arbitration is a widely recognised and trusted method for resolving international commercial disputes. It is administered by the International Court of Arbitration, a part of the ICC that offers a neutral and efficient process for parties to resolve disputes outside of national courts. The ICC Arbitration process is guided by the ICC Rules of Arbitration that provide a comprehensive framework for conducting arbitration proceedings. These rules ensure fairness, transparency, and enforceability of the arbitral awards. Parties involved in an ICC Arbitration have the opportunity to select arbitrators with relevant expertise and experience in their specific industry or legal field. The arbitrators, who act as neutral decision-makers are chosen based on their impartiality and independence. ICC Sri Lanka will setup the proposed Colombo International Arbitration Facilitation Centre to promote the hearing of ICC Arbitration in Sri Lanka.",
    "ICC Arbitration also benefits from the support and expertise of the ICC Secretariat that assists parties throughout the arbitration process. The Secretariat helps with administrative tasks, facilitates communication between the parties and the tribunal, and ensures compliance with ICC Rules. A key advantage of ICC Arbitration is its global enforceability. The resulting arbitral awards are widely recognised and enforceable in over 160 countries, by virtue of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Overall, ICC Arbitration provides a reliable and effective means for businesses to resolve their international disputes in a fair and efficient manner, contributing to the stability and predictability of international trade and investment.",
