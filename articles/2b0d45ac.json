    "Now marking its 11th year, the much-anticipated annual CFA Society Sri Lanka Capital Market Awards is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, 18 June 2024, at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. A signature event in the CFA Society Sri Lanka calendar since its inception in 2012, CFA Society Sri Lanka Capital Market Awards is among the most sought-after accolades that recognizes and rewards excellence in the local capital markets.",
    "Held under the theme of \u2018The Power of Public-Private Partnerships\u2019, this year\u2019s event will focus on the current status of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Sri Lanka and their future potential.",
    "The discussion on the theme will also draw from the country\u2019s past experiences in handling PPPs, and the role of the private sector, as well as learnings from a regional perspective.",
    "Aruna Perera, CFA, President of CFA Society Sri Lanka, offers his insights on the local capital markets domain: \u201cThe recently witnessed migration of skilled professionals due to economic conditions in the country has led to a notable skills gap in the research industry. With more experienced talent exiting the market, new entrants may also not be receiving the adequate training required to understand the nuances of the research industry and produce high-quality research as expected. Therefore, it is imperative that both the industry and institutions such as ourselves take the lead in improving the skills of the new research talent, as well as uplift the quality of research. Set against this backdrop, I believe CFA Society Sri Lanka Capital Market Awards provides analysts with a benchmark on which they can improve.\u201d",
    "Aruna Alwis, CEO of CFA Society Sri Lanka, notes: \u201cThe CFA Society Sri Lanka Capital Market Awards bring together stockbrokers, analysts, CFA charterholders, senior management of listed companies and regulators. There is no doubt that this signature event of the CFA Society Sri Lanka calendar has helped uplift industry excellence and investment research standards in the country.\u201d",
