### Britain to roll out red carpet, royal fanfare for Trump visit

United States President Donald Trump will arrive in Britain on Tuesday (Sep 16) for a three-day trip.

An elaborate show of pomp and pageantry awaits the American leader during his historic second state visit, as the United Kingdom spares no effort to charm its most unpredictable transatlantic guest.

The last time Trump visited the storied Windsor Castle was for tea with the late Queen Elizabeth II, during his first term in office in 2019.

This time, he will be hosted to a state banquet by King Charles III at the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his country estate.

It is unusual for non-royals to receive the full ceremony of a second state visit, rendering Trump’s invitation a striking exception.

Analysts said Starmer is hoping the display of royal flattery for the US president – Trump has long expressed a fascination with the royal family – will help keep UK-US ties on a friendly footing.

### Sri Lanka eyes 6% growth in 2026, but 2025 outlook dims amid spending delays: Dy Minister

Sri Lanka is aiming to boost its economic growth to up to 6% in 2026, partly through record government capital expenditure, though delays in passing the budget could drag on its performance this year, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha Fernando said.

Deputy Minister Anil Jayantha said Sri Lankans and investors should be “hopeful” as the country climbs out of the economic crisis that hit in 2022, its worst since independence.

Sri Lanka recorded economic growth of 5% in 2024. That would likely slow to 4% to 4.5% this year, as delays in passing the budget slowed government spending, Fernando told Reuters in an interview.

“Next year ... we will need to go for 5 to 6% growth. We will aim for that,” he said. “In the long run, after five years, we target to maintain an average GDP growth that emerging countries are maintaining. That is around 6 to 7%.”
