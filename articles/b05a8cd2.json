    "DIMO together with its partner Siemens, has delivered a suite of cutting-edge Building Services solutions to Cinnamon Life, the country\u2019s most iconic integrated development project. This transformative project, comprising a luxury hotel, residences, commercial spaces, and retail hubs, now benefits from a highly advanced, future-ready infrastructure technology powered by DIMO.",
    "Safeguarding lives and property, DIMO deployed the Siemens Sinteso Fire Detection and Alarm System, a globally recognised system for its reliability and precision. Featuring ASAtechnology, Sinteso offers intelligent, false-alarm-free detection using multi-sensor devices, plus standby and degrade modes to ensure uninterrupted protection. The system is scalable to over 5,000 devices per panel\u2014making it ideal for large-scale developments like Cinnamon Life.",
    "The Siemens Sinorix 5112 Fire Suppression System complements this with FK-5-1-12 clean agent technology, delivering fast, environmentally responsible extinguishing capabilities. Its high-pressure configuration enables rapid deployment and flexible design, securing mission-critical zones without compromising assets or data.",
    "Centralised Building Management System (BMS) from Siemens automates the control of HVAC, lighting, fire safety, energy systems, elevators, and water supply across the project. From hotel suites to commercial offices and public spaces, real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and mobile access empower facility managers to drive energy efficiency, comfort, and operational excellence. Smart HVAC controls, occupancy sensors, and integrated dashboards ensure personalised environments for occupants while enabling streamlined operations for owners and facility teams.",
    "Siemens, a global technology leader, led the project from the design stage through to commissioning, acting as the principal partner to DIMO in delivering building services solutions for Cinnamon Life. Throughout this collaboration, Siemens provided critical guidance and enabled significant knowledge transfer, empowering DIMO to execute this iconic development to international standards.",
    "As part of its scope, DIMO supplied and commissioned high-performance lighting fixtures, switches, and a KNX-based lighting control system across general and back-of-house areas. This smart solution enables centralised lighting control, automated scheduling, and adaptive brightness based on occupancy and ambient light. Public areas such as lobbies, corridors, and common spaces are illuminated to global hospitality standards, enhancing the guest experience while reducing energy consumption and operational costs.",
    "The advanced Access Control System enables secure, contactless movement across all facilities, using RFID cards, biometrics, PIN pads, and vehicle recognition. The system is fully integrated with fire alarms, CCTV, and BMS platforms, ensuring seamless user access, real-time logs, and centralised credential management\u2014enhancing security across residences, commercial zones, and service areas.",
    "A robust CCTV Surveillance System provides 24/7 coverage using dome, bullet, PTZ, thermal, and ANPR cameras\u2014backed by RAID-secured NVRs and remote access capability. This enables real-time monitoring, emergency response, and enhanced peace of mind for all stakeholders.",
    "The IP-based Public Address System ensures real-time communication, from daily updates to emergency evacuations. Zoning, scheduling, and system redundancy enable fast, clear messaging across interior and exterior spaces.",
    "\u201cSecuring Cinnamon Life involved a rigorous, multi-phase selection process, including detailed technical evaluations, commercial negotiations, and compliance with international standards. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive, integrated solution positioned us as the trusted partner for this landmark project,\u201d said DIMO Executive Director Wijith Pushpawela.",
    "DIMO\u2019s role in Cinnamon Life underscores its leadership in engineering innovation\u2014delivering smarter, safer, and more sustainable infrastructure for the future."
