    "Congratulations on your remarkable election as the President of Sri Lanka. This victory represents the hopes of a nation that has long awaited genuine change and leadership focused on the well-being of all its people. Your rise from very humble beginnings to the highest office in the country reflects the deep trust and belief the Sri Lankan public has placed in you and your party.",
    "However, with this great honour comes an even greater responsibility. The task of healing the ethnic, religious, and political divisions that have plagued our country for decades now lies in your hands. Sri Lankans have endured the painful consequences of racism and division in politics. You now have the opportunity to lead us away from that harmful past, towards a future where unity, fairness, and justice prevail for all communities, regardless of their background. The people of Sri Lanka look to you to foster reconciliation and solidarity across the nation.",
    "The economic crisis remains another significant challenge. Your promises of economic recovery, social justice, and good governance, which resonated with the voters, will now be closely watched. 22 million Sri Lankans are counting on you to revive the economy, stabilise the lives of ordinary citizens, and offer long-term and sustainable solutions that ensure a better future for all.",
    "At the same time, it is important to remember that the people of Sri Lanka are not afraid to hold their leaders accountable. Recent events have shown that they are ready to stand up when leaders fall short of their promises. The same public that lifted you from just 3% of the vote in the last election to the presidency will not hesitate to act again if their hopes are betrayed. You now carry the weight of high expectations, and the people demand nothing less than full dedication to improving their lives.",
    "You stand at a decisive moment in our history. The opportunity to lead Sri Lanka towards a brighter, more prosperous future is now in your hands. The people of this country are eager to see how you will meet this challenge.",
    "I wish you the strength, wisdom, and courage needed to navigate the tough road ahead. The future of our nation depends on the decisions you make today.",
