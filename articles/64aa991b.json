    "The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed two Fundamental Rights petitions that sought to invalidate the recent Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between Sri Lanka and India.",
    "A two-judge bench comprising Justice Achala Wengappuli and Justice Priyantha Fernando ruled that there was no prima facie case to proceed with the applications. As a result, the petitions were dismissed without further hearing.",
    "The petitions had challenged the legality of seven MoUs exchanged on 5 April at the Presidential Secretariat. These agreements, signed in the presence of President Anura Kumara Disanayake and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cover areas including defence cooperation, digital solutions, and a multi-sectoral grant assistance initiative for the Eastern Province.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Manohara de Silva and Senior Counsel Canishka Witharana appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Nirmalan Wigneswaran represented the Attorney General."
