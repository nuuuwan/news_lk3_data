    "Notes five existing vacancies needs urgent attention due to potential adverse repercussions",
    "Stresses backlog of cases would increase, leading to delays in dispensation of justice, erosion of public trust",
    "Urges President to prioritise filling existing vacancies and consider bar members for vacant posts",
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) writing to President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday expressed their concerns over the ongoing crisis relating to the filling of vacancies in the Court of Appeal.",
    "The BASL noted that there are five vacancies to date and said the situation merits urgent attention considering the potential adverse repercussions that would follow in the administration of justice.",
    "\u201cThe judiciary plays a pivotal role in upholding the rule of law, ensuring justice, and safeguarding the rights of all citizens. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system are significantly hampered when key positions remain vacant for extended periods. The backlog of cases would increase, leading to delays in the dispensation of justice, erosion of public trust in the legal system, and ultimately, the denial of justice to citizens,\u201d the BASL said.",
    "The Association also noted that this could reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s ratings in ease of doing business, which in turn, would hamper efforts at economic recovery.",
    "\u201cIt is to be noted, further, that the absence of a full bench in the superior courts diminishes the diversity of perspectives and expertise which are crucial for comprehensive and balanced adjudication,\u201d it added.",
    "The BASL said while it understands the complexity and importance of the appointment process, the association highlighted the need to ensure the prevailing situation does not continue indefinitely.",
    "They urged the President to prioritise the matter and to consider members of the private Bar when making recommendations for filling such vacancies."
