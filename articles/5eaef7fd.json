    "Originating from the renowned city of Kandy, it extends south towards the Hatton and Horton Plains National Park, then east through Haputale and Ella, before meandering around the charming town of Nuwara Eliya. Originally constructed during the British colonial period to transport tea from vast plantations to factories, the trail holds historical significance.",
    "During his walk along the Pekoe Trail, covering a distance of 3.2km, the President engaged in friendly conversation with the workers employed at the Court Lodge estate.",

    "During his visit, Wickremesinghe personally inspected the fundamental requirements of the plantation workers, addressing issues related to education, healthcare and housing. He particularly focused on the prospects of the children within the plantation workers community, especially those set to complete their schooling after the G.C.E. Advanced level examination.",
    "During his tour, Wickremesinghe also emphasized the importance of providing Pekoe Trail tourists with the opportunity to savour a freshly brewed cup of tea. Furthermore, he explored avenues to bolster the tourism industry associated with Sri Lanka\u2019s central highlands by leveraging the Pekoe Trail.",
    "Mr. Miguel Cunat, the visionary behind the Pekoe Trail expedition, who has extensively explored the central mountains of Sri Lanka over the years, expressed his belief that Sri Lanka could be mapped internationally as one of the premier hiking destinations globally.",
    "Pekoe Trail offers tourists a unique opportunity to explore a variety of terrains, delve into the region\u2019s storied history, engage with its vibrant culture and savour authentic local cuisine and beverages. Comprising 22 stages, the Pekoe Trail can be tailored to suit one-day or multi-day excursions, catering to a range of preferences. Plans are underway to further develop the trail, enhancing it with necessary facilities to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for visitors.",
    "The European Union (EU) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have extended their support to the Pekoe Trail project, aligning with Sri Lanka\u2019s national tourism strategies. The initiative encompasses various aspects, including sustainable environmental development, to foster the growth of tourism in the country.",
    "The goal of the Pekoe Trail project is to draw in a new wave of tourism, including adventure seekers, to Sri Lanka while simultaneously improving the livelihoods of rural communities. Mr. Miguel Cunat conveyed his appreciation to the President for the support provided in initiating the Pekoe Trail and commended the President\u2019s vision to revitalize the country\u2019s economy by transforming the tourism industry."
