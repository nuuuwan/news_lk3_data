    "The Vietnamese government said Typhoon Kajiki is expected to be as powerful as Typhoon Yagi, which battered the country less than a year ago, killing about 300 people.",
    "HANOI: Vietnam has shut airports, closed schools and initiated mass evacuations as it prepares for the most powerful storm so far this year.",
    "Typhoon Kajiki was packing winds of up to 166kmh as it approached Vietnam\u2019s central coast and was forecast to grow stronger before making landfall on Monday afternoon (Aug 25), the country\u2019s weather agency said.",
    "\u201cThis is an extremely dangerous fast-moving storm,\u201d the government said in a statement on Sunday night, warning that Kajiki would bring heavy rains, flooding and landslides.",
    "The typhoon - the fifth to affect Vietnam this year - is currently at sea, roiling the Gulf of Tonkin with waves of up to 9.5m. The eye of the storm is forecast to hit an area between Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces.",
    "With a long coastline facing the South China Sea, Vietnam is prone to storms that are often deadly and trigger dangerous flooding and mudslides.",
    "The Vietnamese government said Kajiki was expected to be as powerful as Typhoon Yagi, which battered the country less than a year ago, killing about 300 people and causing US$3.3 billion of property damage.",
    "More than 325,500 residents in five coastal provinces have been slated for evacuation to schools and public buildings converted into temporary shelters, authorities said.",
    "The waterfront city of Vinh was deluged overnight, its streets largely deserted by morning with most shops and restaurants closed as residents and business-owners sandbagged their property entrances.",

    "\u201cI have never heard of a typhoon of this big scale coming to our city,\u201d said 66-year-old Le Manh Tung at a Vinh indoor sports stadium, where evacuated families dined on a simple breakfast of sticky rice.",
    "\u201cI am a bit scared, but then we have to accept it because it\u2019s nature - we cannot do anything,\u201d he told AFP, among only a few dozen people camped out at the evacuation site on Monday morning.",
    "Kajiki skirted the southern coast of China\u2019s Hainan Island on Sunday as it moved toward Vietnam, forcing Sanya City on the island to close businesses and public transport.",
    "Scientists say human-caused climate change is driving more intense and unpredictable weather patterns that can make destructive floods and storms more likely, particularly in the tropics.",
    "\u201cNormally we get storms and flooding, but never this big,\u201d said 52-year-old evacuee Nguyen Thi Nhan.",
    "The typhoon\u2019s power is due to dramatically dissipate after it makes landfall.",
    "In Vietnam, more than 100 people have been killed or left missing from natural disasters in the first seven months of 2025, according to the agriculture ministry.",
