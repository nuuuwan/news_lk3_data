    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s remittances coming through official channels went up to $537.3 million in November 2023, up 40 percent from $384.4 million in the same month a year earlier, due to improved exchange rate after better monetary policy.",
    "The official remittances rose on a month-on-month basis for the first time in five months after falling four months in a row.",
    "In the first 11 months of this year, Sri Lanka received $5.4 billion from official channels, up 63 percent from $ 3.3 billion in the same period in 2022.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s external sector started to stabilize in September 2022, when the central bank started to run balance of payments surpluses after ending money printing to sterilize interventions made with Indian Asian Clearing Union money.",
    "Worker remittances coming through official channels fell in 2021 which could not be paid for by the banking system at the official rate as money was printed to sterilize interventions and keep a policy rate down, triggering parallel exchange rates, which were settled outside the formal banking system.",
    "From April 2022 rates were raised by unprecedented levels, slowing credit and the need to print money to keep rates down. (Colombo/Dec 9/2023)"
