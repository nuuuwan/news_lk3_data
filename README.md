At the Third SAARC Summit Meeting in Nepal on November 2-4, 1987, 1 had called for going “full sail ahead” with the King of Nepal in the host’s chair. I said:

“As we all know, regionalism in South Asia has had a late beginning. One of the remarkable developments since the Second World War has been the spread of regionalism, manifested in the setting up of regional organizations which have to cover most of the globe. The fact that SAARC came to be formed so late has been explained by the disparities and imbalances within our region. Nevertheless, there is at the same time, an underlying homogeneity among South Asian countries, on which we hope to build an enduring regionalism for the common benefit of all of us.

Trump’s new Ambassador to Israel: “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian”

The re-election of Donald Trump to a second term of the presidency of the United States has changed the ideological trajectory of the future of the United States. At least for the foreseeable future.But it has sealed the fate of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Permanently.

To even consider the validity of the above statement, one must look into the constitutional, conventional and practical qualifications for the Presidency of the United States. Constitutionally, the President must be at least 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.

A word first used in 17th century England is gaining new currency in 21st century America. Kakistocracy, a Greek derivative per usual, means government administered by the worst group of citizens – in qualification, competence, experience and scruples. Kakistocracy is in full display in the US with the election of Donald Trump as president for a second term. America is returning to chaos not heeding Kamala Harris’s warning against going back.

In Sri Lanka, Rajapaksas epitomized Kakistocracy for nearly two decades before it imploded under Gotabaya Rajapaksa. After them came Ranil Wickremesinghe to clean up the economic mess left behind by the Rajapaksas. To his credit, Mr. Wickremesinghe did clean up the economic mess. But he also created a political mess, characteristically and superciliously

About 20 years ago, I used the same title, in a writing dealing with Mahinda Rajapaksa’s triumphant ascent to power, published in an issue of the Sunday Island. In that I expressed my deep apprehensions of a Rajapaksa dispensation. As the years unfolded, the grim realities of years of misrule, with the younger Rajapaksa outdoing the elder brother in criminality, corruption and incompetence, exceeded the worst fears of my imagination. In between, not to be forgotten, there was also the crushingly disappointing “yahapalanya” farce, perpetrated by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe collaboration.

### Sri Lanka can cut floor rate, but targeting ‘dysfunctional’ market will lead to trouble

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is just emerging from a default after large volumes of money were printed to target a narrow policy rate, in the pursuit of instant growth (potential output) and denying monetary stability to the people.

From 2015 in particular Sri Lanka very narrowly targeted a policy rate despite being a reserve collecting central bank.

Targeting a mid-corridor rate is the same as printing money to maintain a single policy rate. The label is different but the required inflationism is the same.

The same consequences of targeting a mid-corridor rate in 2015 and especially 2018 when the budget deficit was brought down.

If the call money rate is so dysfunctional as claimed in a recent defence of money printing through OMO, it should obviously not be used as the operating target for monetary policy at all.

Since the end of the war the central bank has cut rates around 18 to 20 months after a currency crisis, just as private credit recovered and triggered a currency crisis.

In these two killing fields IDF has not spared even news reporters and aid workers.
