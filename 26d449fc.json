  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a bid to improve experience for four-wheeler drivers on the platform, Uber has launched a new initiative \u2018Nawa Gamanak\u2019 \u2013 introducing a slew of new features on the app and a driver loyalty program.",
    "The new features will expand earning opportunities for drivers and provide them more choice and transparency each time they drive on Uber. Drivers will now be able to view their expected earnings upfront when they get a trip request besides getting access to multiple requests at the same time during periods of high demand.",
    "Under Nawa Gamanak, the company has unveiled a specialised loyalty program for drivers \u2013 Uber Pro, the company also aims to reward its top rated drivers with more completed trips. Drivers with good customer ratings (above 4.8) and high trip completion rate will receive special cash rewards and exclusive perks. Nawa Gamanak has been designed to help drivers reach their goals both on and off the road by getting more options to choose from besides enhanced support, and discounts on vehicle maintenance and insurance.",
    "Uber Sri Lanka Country Manager Kaushalya Gunaratne said: \u201cDrivers are at the heart of what we do at Uber. Enhanced choice and flexibility for drivers will continue making Uber their platform of choice.",
    "Uber Pro will also reward drivers who provide a great service to riders by maintaining a high app rating and trip completion rate. We believe that these changes will go a long way in promoting the adoption and continued use of the Uber platform by top-rated drivers and elevate the overall experience on the Uber app.\u201d",
    "Uber Pro has four tiers: Blue, Gold, Platinum and Diamond, with Diamond being the highest possible tier. A driver who is new on the platform starts with a Blue tier status and moves upwards by earning \u2018points\u2019 on every completed trip and meeting other criteria.",
    "The points reset every three months, so the drivers\u2019 tier status is determined on a rolling period of three months. As drivers move towards a higher tier status, they get access to exclusive perks and experiential rewards offered by third parties including instalment based premium payment on General Vehicle Insurance and Health Insurance, a no claim bonus of 50%, and 55% off on vehicle detailing. In addition, drivers will also get a free eye check-up and 20% off on spectacles purchased with registered vendors.",
    "Drivers who were able to maintain the top rating \u2018Diamond\u2019 for a full quarter will be given a cash reward of Rs. 25,000.",
    "Top-tier drivers also got access to exclusive other experiential rewards including the following:",
    "Area preference: For two hours every day, drivers from Platinum and Diamond tiers are able to choose to get trips from an area of their choice. This will give them flexibility to drive in their preferred area.",
    "Priority support: Drivers from Gold, Platinum and Diamond tiers can skip the queue at Uber greenlight centres and receive special support on priority. Similarly, they get prioritised support via phone.",
    "Riders will be able to see the tier status of a driver on booking an Uber after being matched with a driver. Drivers will also be able to track their progress on the Uber app. The program is currently live in Colombo, Kalutara, and Gampaha. The company plans to roll this out to more cities in the near future."
