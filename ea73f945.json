    "The need to cope with the immediate realities of economic collapse and the resulting political protests have occupied the center stage of political interest for the past two years.\u00a0 But now President Ranil Wickremesinghe has brought the ethnic problem and reconciliation process back to the center stage of national politics, where it should be.\u00a0 The unresolved ethnic conflict continues to exert a baleful influence on the country\u2019s efforts to respond to the economic and political crises.\u00a0 The belief that the ethnic conflict ended on the battlefields of Mullaitivu with the elimination of the LTTE leadership has long proved to be unfounded.\u00a0 The weakening of internal and overt Tamil resistance to domination by the centralised state has been accompanied by a strengthening of external interventions.",
    "At its last session, the UN Human Rights Commissioner declared that whatever evidence they were gathering on human rights violations in Sri Lanka would be made available to any country that wished to use them for prosecution on the basis of universal jurisdiction.\u00a0 The negative image of a country that is constantly at the forefront of UN-level discussions on human rights violations will surely be an impediment to the country in gaining foreign investments. These regular confrontations have taken the form of the tightening of strictures against the Sri Lankan state at every passing session of the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0 The government\u2019s efforts to attract foreign investments into the country would receive a boost if there is success in the national reconciliation process.",
    "Last week President Wickremesinghe invited all parties in parliament to discuss the implementation of the 13th\u00a0Amendment and the evolution of a political solution. This invitation was accepted by most of the political parties.\u00a0 Speaking at the all party conference the President highlighted that a decision on this matter should involve input from all relevant parties. He said that neither he nor the previous seven Executive Presidents had the authority to pass new laws to address existing problems and the power to do so solely rested with parliament.\u00a0 However, the political parties that did attend expressed sentiments which reflect the mistrust that pervades the entire political system.\u00a0 There is a belief that political self-interest and power-hunger underlie the actions of political actors on all sides.\u00a0 The government\u2019s conduct has done little to dispel this mistrust.",
    "The opposition\u2019s arguments at the all party conference in favour of giving priority to provincial elections gets validity on two counts.\u00a0 First is that any reform of the provincial councils to be implemented there needs to be elected provincial councils. Second is the questionable nature of the mandate that the present government possesses.\u00a0 The mass protests during the period of the Aragalaya which forced the resignation of the then president, prime minister and cabinet of ministers would, in a better functioning democracy, have necessitated a fresh election to be held to re-validate the mandate that the government had once enjoyed.\u00a0 Instead those in parliament elected a new president as per the constitution.\u00a0 The new president had both the political acumen and will power to crack down on the protest movement using the security forces at the government\u2019s disposal, but the question of mandate continues to remain.",
    "The basic feature of a democratic polity is the conduct of regular elections at which the people elect their representatives.\u00a0 Sri Lanka has become a flawed democracy in this regard.\u00a0 Elections to the second and third tiers of government have been suspended with provincial elections not being held for over four years and local government authority elections now five months overdue.\u00a0 At the all party conference most of the political parties present called for provincial council elections to be held prior to enhancing their power as proposed by the president.\u00a0 The provincial councils need to be in existence for them to be empowered.\u00a0 Those elected to provincial councils would have greater legitimacy, and knowledge, to point out inadequacies in the power sharing arrangements.",
    "With this background, it is reasonable for people of goodwill to see the need to conduct elections being the priority requirement at this time.\u00a0 The president\u2019s response at the all party conference to the call for provincial elections to be held was to terminate the meeting. Whether this was due to his rejection of this option or to reconsider his position and that of the government on this matter will become clearer in the days to come. From a democratic perspective there can be no justification for the postponement of elections which is an erosion of democratic norms simply based on the government\u2019s calculations that it is unlikely to perform well at an electoral contest.\u00a0 Deputy leader of President Wickremesinghe\u2019s party, Ruwan Wijewardene has stated that 2024 will be the year of elections and expressed confidence that by then members of the opposition will be joining hands with the president.",
    "In this scenario, the government may wish to postpone elections for as long as possible, which would extend at least up to September 2024 when presidential elections fall due. However, this postponement of elections to suit the time table of the president would constitute an erosion of democracy.\u00a0 Sri Lanka is no stranger to such election manoeuvers which have been to the detriment of the country.\u00a0 One such occasion was in 1975 when the then government used the fact of a new constitution that it brought forth to give itself an additional two years in power.\u00a0 When it went to the polls it lost resoundingly.\u00a0 Another occasion was when the government held a referendum to extend the term of parliament rather than hold general elections when they fell due.\u00a0 The anti-Tamil pogrom of Black July 1983 which followed soon thereafter set the stage for the three decade long internal war that was to follow.",
    "Whatever President Wickremesinghe\u2019s vision of the future might be, he needs to give priority to the democratic process.\u00a0 This calls for local government and provincial council elections to be held sooner rather than later.\u00a0 The value and credibility of the president\u2019s contribution does not lie in whether or not the government wins those elections, but in the integrity of the decisions he makes. \u00a0Consistency in his adherence to democratic norms would engender the trust of the polity in him and his assurances. The president has started the process of economic reforms needed to set the country on the right track.\u00a0 Now he appears to want to do the same with regard to the ethnic conflict which has plagued the country from the very dawn of its independence.\u00a0 The president has a full year until the presidential elections fall due in September 2024 to achieve these twin goals.",
    "In the course of his public pronouncements over the past six months President Wickremesinghe has clearly spealt out the need to implement the 13th\u00a0Amendment in the manner specified in the constitution.\u00a0 He needs to do what the seven presidents who came before him failed to do, which is to implement the constitutional provisions relating to the devolution of powers to the provinces, including police and land powers.\u00a0 The process of full implementation can be started with an educational process led by academics, community leaders and civil society organisations. In his recent writings University of Colombo\u2019s Prof A Sarweswaran who was a member of the constitutional committee to draft a new constitution appointed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has shown how police and land powers even if fully devolved are under the final authority of the central government.\u00a0 The problem in Sri Lanka is the trust deficit, which is all round and needs trustworthy leadership to overcome.",
