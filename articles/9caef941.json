    "On the occasion of World Environment Day, observed today, with a focus on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience, Dilmah, in partnership with Kahawatte Plantations and Dilmah Agricultural Innovation Nucleus, is set to launch an agro-forestry program at Rilhena.",
    "Aligned with Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to increasing green cover by 32% by 2030 as part of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), Dilmah\u2019s green restoration initiatives are significant. Globally, the United Nations calls upon nations to honor their pledge to restore 1 billion degraded hectares of land over the next decade, equivalent to the size of China. Beyond enhancing biodiversity, restoring degraded ecosystems holds potential as a public health intervention, fostering overall health and well-being.",
    "The inauguration will feature tree planting, with careful selection of species suited to the local landscape, including those with commercial value for non-timber uses. This initiative stems from the success of Dilmah\u2019s flagship reforestation project, the Endane Biodiversity Corridor, which has become a model for ecosystem restoration across tea estates.",
    "The Endane Biodiversity Corridor has achieved remarkable results in engineering a forest pathway through degraded tea lands, connecting two separate forest reserves to enhance biodiversity. Utilizing GNSS technology, it has georeferenced 188 threatened tree species and 545 other tree species, enabling continuous monitoring. Over 4000 seedlings, including 40 globally threatened species, have been planted, and nearly 50 threatened tree species have been conserved through its nursery. Dilmah plans to extend this reforestation model to other tea lands, starting with an abandoned tea land at its Rilhena Estate.",
    "The selection of the project site followed a feasibility analysis utilizing available maps and plantation data, identifying approximately 1000 hectares of abandoned land within Kahawatte Plantations suitable for agroforestry. Species such as Garcinia, Pepper, Durian, and Rambutan will be planted, integrating tree-based agroforestry into tea cultivation to enhance biodiversity, enrich soil, reduce erosion, improve water retention, and diversify economic opportunities.",
    "Through its sustainability and conservation arm, Dilmah Conservation, the family tea company has undertaken various green restoration initiatives. These include collaborating with the Urban Development Authority to enhance the educational value of Beddagana Wetland Park and restoring mangrove forest patches, including 2.4 acres in the Anawilundawa Wetland Sanctuary and 2.5 acres in the Kappal-Adi Kite Lagoon in Kalpitiya.",
