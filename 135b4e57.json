    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s health minister said the government will resume providing the Thriposha supplement from next week, after amending the permissible levels of aflatoxins in its ingredients last week.",
    "\u201cWe were unable to supply the necessary Thriposha, due to the failure of stocks meeting aflatoxin permissible levels,\u201d minister of health Dr Ramesh Pathirana said in parliament on Thursday (30).",
    "\u201cAflatoxins should be less than 1 part to a billion was what we allowed earlier. But the World Health Organization and the World Food Program allows 10 parts to a billion.",
    "\u201cWe can start providing Thriposha again from next week,\u201d Pathirana said.",
    "Aflatoxins are a family of toxins produced by certain fungi that are found on agricultural crops such as maize (corn), peanuts, cottonseed, and tree nuts.",
    "Last week (20), Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet approved the permissible levels of aflatoxins in food supplements to 5ppb for type B1 and level 10ppb for total.",
    "Thriphosha is provided under the Maternal and Child Health Program implemented by the Ministry of Health as a supplementary food for children with low nutritional level from 6 months to 3 years of age and as an additional nutrient for pregnant and lactating mothers.",
    "But due to the stringent permissible limits for total aflatoxins prescribed in the existing regulations under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980, it had become difficult to procure maize for the production of Thriphosa, cabinet spokesman minister Dr Bandula Gunawardena said last week.",
    "\u201cTherefore, the cabinet of ministers approved the proposal presented by the minister of health to apply the limit of level 5ppb for type B1 and level 10 ppb of total aflatoxin in internationally recognized food supplements.\u201d",
    "The World Health Organization recommendations are in the range of 0.5 to 15 \u00b5g/kg (a \u00b5g is one billionth of a kilogram).",
    "Pathirana was answering questions on child malnutrition in the country raised by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) and Dr Harini Amarasuriya of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP).",
    "Pathirana said that as per a survey carried out in June 2023, there were 15,763 malnourished children. A fall of point two percent of malnourished children has been seen since 2022, where the total number of malnourished children was 18,420. (Colombo/Dec1/2023)"
