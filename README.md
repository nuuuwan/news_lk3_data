*2025-09-20 22:05:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225615) · `ta`

We challenge the government to hold provincial council elections. We will conquer the majority of the 9 provincial councils. Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara said that all opposition parties are invited to launch programs from now.

He said this while addressing the 79th Federation of the United National Party (UNP) in Colombo on Saturday (20).

Failure to break up was made to us well in the last elections. The UNP has started cracks. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been able to fix the divisions after 77 years. Democracy was protected in the country even though parties were split. Those who have been preventing the development of the country for decades have brainwashed young people.

They say they will change Parliament according to their needs. We will never accommodate to do so. So we see this unity as a blessing. Everyone was united for Ranil Wickremesinghe without calling. This caused the government to kneel.

I had put them in a new place to read later, but had then forgotten about them. It was salutary that they were rediscovered, and I have since spent many happy hours with them.

One that I found fascinating was a booklet in a series produced in the seventies by the Cultural Affairs Department. This was about Theatre in Sri Lanka, and was by A J Gunawardena, who had become a good friend in the decade after I started working for the British Council. He was a polymath and, though an academic in the field of English at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, he was an authority on the Arts, and indeed was seconded from there to head the Institute of Aesthetic Studies.

### Tribute to Rajiv Perera on his 60th birthday

*2025-09-20 16:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tribute-to-rajiv-perera-on-his-60th-birthday/) · `en`

In life we meet many people, most of whom hardly leave a trace of their passing. Some, very few in fact, leave a mark so deep that no passage of time can erase it. For me, at the very top of that list is Rajiv Perera.

I knew of Rajiv at school – St Thomas’, Mount Lavinia – where he was a few years senior to me. A fine sportsman, he played rugby for S. Thomas’, CH & FC, and Sri Lanka. On the field he was fearless yet always a gentleman, respected by teammates and opponents alike. That same spirit carried into the rest of his life competitive when it mattered, but always fair, always gracious.

But I only really got to know him when I went to the UK for my higher studies, about 35 years ago. This was around the time that John Major had replaced the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, and was just settling in as Prime Minister. I knew only a few people in London. It was through the Thomian network that I met Rajiv. We clicked immediately.

### My golden years at Kingswood College

*2025-09-20 16:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-golden-years-at-kingswood-college/) · `en`

Mr. Louis Edmund Blaze’ started his school, which he named Boys’ High School at No. 11, Pavilion Street in the Kandy town itself (the premises were secured by Mr. JW Samaraweera) with 11 boys – quite a coincidence between the school roll and its address – on May 4, 1891 with the intention that it should be run as far as possible on the lines of the old British Public Schools. Later, when the number of students grew, the school was shifted to Brownrigg Street (now Yatinuwara Veediya).

As the rooms in Pavilion Street became too small with increasing number of students, the school was shifted to a house in Brownrigg Street, which had been built by Mr. William Staples about 50 years before. The school began academic activities on January 12, 1898. In December 1897 the school moved into larger premises in Browrigg Street, where the school hall was built and the Boys’ High School took the name of Kingswood College.

### Trump adds $100,000 fee for skilled worker visa applicants

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will add a $100,000 (£74,000) annual fee for applicants to the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers.

Trump’s order mentions “abuse” of the programme and will restrict entry unless payment is made.

Critics have long argued that H-1Bs undercut the American workforce, while supporters - including billionaire Elon Musk - argue it allows the US to attract top talent from around the world.

In another order, Trump set up a new “gold card” to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.

Trump’s order is due to come into force on 21 September. It would only apply to new requests, but companies would have to pay the same amount for each applicant for six years, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.

### Health Matters: Fortify the Over Forties

*2025-09-20 14:12:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/health-matters-fortify-the-over-forties/) · `en`

The human body is continually changing. The human body uses many systems for both daily living and fighting off disease, and over the years, these gradually lose their original youthful powers.

It is very helpful to know how we can reduce or even avoid health problems entirely by taking some simple mineral and vitamin supplements and perhaps by adding a wider variety of foods to our diets. Nutritionists say we need to consume about 30 different vegetables to feed and maintain a healthy micro biome in our stomach. And US doctors say, our micro-biome is a major part of our immune system. Not widely known is that our stomach acid too, declines in strength. This shows up by giving us various symptoms of bloating or indigestion.

The information given here, below, is what the same US medical doctors already mentioned in earlier chapters, are saying about these matters.

The second leg of the peace process and something which the LTTE always considered of the highest priority, and reiterated at the talks, was the rapid rehabilitation and development of the conflict-affected areas – mainly the Northern and Eastern Provinces. This consisted of eight districts of the 25 in the country. Since the conflict had inevitably spilled over the boundaries of the eight districts, it became necessary to also bring in what was called the adjacent districts of Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Moneragala. Some of these were earlier referred to as ‘border villages’ but since it was necessary to have a neutral term instead of accepting territorial borders, the term ‘adjacent district’ was being increasingly used in the documentation.

### Comment: Arundhati Roy’s Mother Mary Comes to Me

*2025-09-20 14:03:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/comment-arundhati-roys-mother-mary-comes-to-me/) · `en`

My title reads ‘Comment …’ I dare not claim this article to be a review of Arundhati’s latest book, since she is too unique a writer for me to attempt criticizing.

I start by saying that her latest book is for the general reader, and not a political or protest publication, is a biography of her mother and autobiography of herself. After a long time I got to read a book that I could not put down – it was so stylishly constructed, written in an easy flowing manner and absorbingly interesting: the two lives – her mother’s after her marriage to a tea planter in Assam and hers from childhood.

The time was now around 3 p.m. I asked the driver to drop my accountant home at Dehiwela and come back to my residence with the car. I also told him that if the conditions were bad, to stay with the accountant in Dehiwela for the moment. He was nervous about driving further, but he left. My few Sinhalese neighbours and I were now faced with a difficult situation. Most of our Tamil neighbours were in a state of panic. Smoke from fires burning on some roads was clearly visible. There was still no curfew declared.

### Poland–Sri Lanka Relations: Beyond Tea and Tourism?

*2025-09-20 12:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/poland-sri-lanka-relations-beyond-tea-and-tourism/) · `en`

Oxford, United Kingdom– While preparing for my next trip to Sri Lanka, I keep reflecting on relations between Poland and the “Pearl of the Indian Ocean.” At first, Sri Lanka and my home country—a democratic nation of 38 million people in Central Europe—may seem very distant from one another. Yet, this year has brought a substantial development in their bilateral relations.

In May 2025, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski visited Sri Lanka. He participated in high-level meetings with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, and Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath. Notably, he was representing not only Warsaw but also the entire European Union, as Poland held the EU presidency.

Shared historical connections between Sri Lanka and Poland stretch back more than a century. One of them is particularly close to my heart: the visit of Adam Asnyk, a renowned poet born in my hometown of Kalisz, the oldest city in Poland. He travelled to Sri Lanka in 1894.
