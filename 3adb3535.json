  "original_body_lines": [
    "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa is to appoint a committee to look into how Sri Lanka went into bankruptcy and has even planned to gather information from foreign institutions, a Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP said today.",
    "SJB MP Tissa Attanayake told journalists that Mr Premadasa will go ahead with the appointment of a committee on his own and will even get information from foreign institutions and experts as well.",
    "Asked about the legitimacy of a select committee appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, MP Attanayake said the Leader of the Opposition would be doing so following the ruling given by the Speaker that he can summon any state officer for any inquiry at any time.",
    "\u201cThe Speaker has already ruled that the Opposition Leader is able to summon any state official at any time and conduct any probe. Therefore the appointment of a committee by Mr Premadasa would be legitimate,\u201d Mr Attanayake said.",
    "\u201cThe committee that will be appointed by the Opposition Leader will comprise MPs from both the ruling party and the\u00a0Opposition,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cAll Opposition MPs have decided to resign from the select committee appointed by the Speaker to find out the reasons behind Sri Lanka\u2019s bankruptcy as it will not serve any purpose. It will not serve any purpose as the majority members of the committee and its chairman are also members of the government which took the country into bankruptcy,\u201d\u00a0 he also said.
