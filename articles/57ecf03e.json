  "original_body_lines": [
    "Leader of the House and Minister Bimal Rathnayake, speaking in Parliament yesterday, asked the Opposition to stop making unsubstantiated allegations, and lodge a formal complaint with the police against him for the alleged release of 323 red-flagged containers without Customs inspection from the Colombo Port in January 2025.",
    "\u201cImprison me if I have done anything wrong,\u201d he told the Opposition, claiming that he had no authority to decide on matters such as releasing containers. One cannot but agree with him that the Opposition should resort to legal action over the container scandal instead of flogging the issue to gain political mileage.",
    "Worryingly, in this country many serious issues, including political killings, are reduced to mere slogans that political parties use to attract media attention and boost their approval ratings.",
    "The Opposition ought to do as Minister Rathnayake says if it has irrefutable evidence to prove that he has committed a punishable offence. However, it is only wishful thinking that anything will come of a police complaint against a powerful minister. The culture of impunity is far from over.",
    "It was only on Wednesday that Opposition MP D. V. Chanaka told Parliament that Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security, former SDIG Ravi Seneviratne, had misused his authority to have two serious charges against him dropped in a case involving an accident he caused while driving under the influence of liquor. The Opposition has also said the police have taken no action against hundreds of NPP supporters who blatantly violated traffic laws by parking buses on the Southern Expressway and having lunch on 01 May 2025. Will the government say what action the police have taken against those transgressors? If the NPP\u2019s rank and file remain above the law, how can the police be expected to act on complaints against Cabinet ministers?",
    "Minister Rathnayake\u2019s challenge at issue to the Opposition coincided with a report that the Additional Magistrate of Colombo had informed the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) that it did not need an arrest warrant to take former Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne into custody in connection with an investigation into a complaint that when he was the Minister of Fisheries he caused a project to be unlawfully handed over to a foreign company, causing a loss of more than 26.3 million to the state.",
    "Senaratne is facing legal action because he is out of power. Some Opposition politicians have been sentenced to jail for financial irregularities that caused losses to the state coffers under their watch as ministers during the previous governments.",
    "The leaders of the SLPP-UNP government had to allow one of its ministers, Keheliya Rambukwella, to be arrested and prosecuted over pharmaceutical scandal because it became too embarrassing for them to defend him, with elections only a few months away, last year; they were left with no alternative but to throw him under the bus.",
    "So, one should not be so na\u00efve as to expect any powerful NPP politician to face legal action for being on the wrong side of the law until the incumbent administration stays in power. Only a future government may consider bringing them to justice.",
    "A country like Sri Lanka gains from alternate power shifts in elections. All the Opposition politicians, save Rambukwella, would have been safe if the SLPP-UNP government had won last year\u2019s elections.",
    "One is happy to see stern action being taken against the rivals of the NPP not only because they must be made to pay for their sins but also because that will prompt those in the Opposition to deal with the current rulers accused of various malpractices, in a similar manner, after the next regime change.",
