    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 The State Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government has announced that all political parties have raised concerns regarding the interim report of the National Delimitation Committee. State Minister Janaka Wakkambura highlighted that objections were based on the potential unfair treatment of certain groups resulting from the proposed consolidation of multiple divisions into a single division.",
    "Furthermore, a majority of political parties expressed their preference for the local government election to be conducted under the old system rather than the proposed system, according to State Minister Janaka Wakkambura. In addition, the State Minister mentioned that parliamentary approval is anticipated for a proposal that reserves 25 percent of the candidate list for youth representatives in the local government elections."
