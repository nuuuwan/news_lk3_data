    "VEN. Omalpe Sobitha Thera yesterday called for the immediate resignation of all parliamentarians holding dual citizenship.",
    "He asserted that there are approximately 10 MPs with dual citizenship currently serving in Parliament and emphasised the necessity for them to step down before the upcoming elections.",
    "Although the Thera refrained from disclosing the names of the implicated MPs, he warned that if they do not voluntarily resign, legal action may be pursued against them. Recognising the time-consuming and costly nature of litigation in such matters, he urged the MPs in question to resign as a matter of respect and responsibility.",
    "Furthermore, he urged party leaders to be vigilant in selecting candidates and urged them to disclose any members within their parties who hold dual citizenship, particularly in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling regarding Diana Gamage\u2019s parliamentary post.",
    "The Thera stressed that MPs holding dual citizenship lack loyalty to the country and are motivated solely by personal gain. While acknowledging the capability to disclose their identities, he urged them to step forward before the upcoming elections to avoid further repercussions."
