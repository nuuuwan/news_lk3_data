    "(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Pieris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "The first half of 1973 saw two important events, the visit of the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi in April. and on May 17 the opening of The Bandaranalke Memorial International Conference Hall. During Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s visit, the two Prime Ministers had set apart some time for one-on-one discussion, without any Ministers or officials being present. This was a period where there was a degree of belligerence on the part of some South Indian politicians, displayed towards Sri Lanka.",
    "The demarcation of the maritime boundary between the two countries, and the issue of the ownership of the island of Kachchativu lay ahead. There was also the residual question of 150,000 people of Indian origin in Sri Lanka, which had not been resolved in the earlier Sirima-Shastri Pact. Added to all this, Tamil politics of the North of Sri Lanka interacted with certain South Indian elements. All this resulted in a degree of hostility shown towards Sri Lanka by certain South Indian politicians.",
    "We had received numerous paper cuttings and reports of various inflammatory speeches and statements made in South India, sent by our High Commission in Delhi, as well as by our office in Madras. There was a thick file of these. Mrs. Bandaranaike was quite certain that Mrs. Gandhi was not aware of the depth and intensity of this situation, and therefore, she wanted to show the Indian Prime Minister, some of these newspaper cuttings. She asked me to be ready with this file, and bring it into her private meeting with Mrs. Gandhi, when she gave a signal.",
    "The meeting was in the sitting room at Temple Trees, with both Prime Ministers sitting side by side on a settee. I stayed within sight in the adjoining dining room area, whilst Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s Secretary, the Indian Foreign Secretary, other senior officials, and the High Commissioner waited in an office room, next to the verandah. I was called in due course, and invited to sit. The Indian officials who saw me going in and sitting down did not seem to appreciate this unilateral initiative. A couple of them came out and walked towards the two Prime Ministers.",
    "Mrs. Gandhi told them, that she would call them if required. She went through the file of paper cuttings and was quite surprised at its contents. She assured Mrs. Bandaranaike that she did not know that matters were so aggravated. Mrs. Bandaranaike said that she was certain that she did not know. The Indian Prime Minister wanted a list of references indicating dates and other details of some of these cuttings, before she left Sri Lanka. I was not happy about staying longer than necessary, in what was to be an informal and private discussion. It also did not look right, since there was no Indian official present. So, I excused myself, as soon as I could.",
    "My Indian colleagues wanted to know what all that was about. I told them it was about lowering temperatures and strengthening bilateral ties. Two banquets were held, one by each Prime Minister. My wife received a gift of a beautiful saree from the Indian Prime Minister, which was delivered at home. I got her to wear it for Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s banquet. It provided an occasion for us to speak briefly with her on more mundane matters such as sarees and the difficulties of matching sarees and blouses.",
    "May 1973 saw the ceremonial opening of the BMICH. This was an outright gift of the Chinese Government, and they sent a high-powered delegation. It was a grand occasion with national anthems, speeches and ceremony. The hall itself was beautiful and spacious and equipped with modern facilities. The opening was followed by a banquet hosted by the Prime Minister in honour of the Chinese delegation, in the new banqueting hall, making it the first banquet in that hall. It was a grand occasion attended by the Speaker; the Cabinet; Senior Judges; the diplomatic corps; and other eminent special invitees. The Navy band provided soft music in the background.",
    "There are however, few occasions that are entirely trouble free. This one had an incident that occurred right before my eyes. Mrs. Ridgeway Tillekeratne, the wife of the Secretary to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was seated opposite to me. One of the waiters balancing two plates of soup in his hands, was about to lay one plate before Mrs. Tillekeratne, when another waiter said something and distracted his attention, resulting in his looking momentarily away. That moment was enough for the plate to tilt, and for poor Mrs. Tillekeratne\u2019s expensive and beautiful saree to receive almost a full load of soup. There was a loud gasp from every one who saw this. We had to come to her rescue with serviettes and handkerchiefs. Mrs. Tillekeratne\u2019s evening was ruined.",
    "Sometime after the opening of the hall, the Chinese Ambassador wished to see the Prime Minister. An appointment was given. What he had to say took us completely by surprise. In a way it was as surprising as the moment when Prime Minister Zhou-En-Lai originally proposed gifting an international conference hall. The Ambassador said that due to the completion of the hall",
    "several months ahead of schedule, there was a saving of a few million rupees. (I cannot quite recall the exact amount). His government had instructed him to offer this money to the Prime Minister, with a suggestion that if she wished, she could use it to stock a library on international affairs, in the complex.",
    "The Prime Minister protested that China had done more than enough by gifting such a magnificient hall, and helping to build it ahead of time. She did not want to accept anything more. The discussion took sometime, because the Prime Minister was quite firm on not accepting this money. But the Ambassador gently persisted, saying that an entire sum of something like Rs. 32 million had been allocated by the Chinese government for the hall, and that the government was most keen that Sri Lanka should receive this full amount. The Ambassador pleaded that the Prime Minister accept this.",
    "There was no choice. She accepted it and thanked the Prime Minister and the government of China. She said she would write to the Chinese Prime Minister separately. But she said that since the",
    "maintenance of the hall to the highest international standards was very necessary, she would like to use this money to start a fund, to which revenue from hiring out the hall would also go, and use this",
    "fund for maintenance. In suggesting this, she was looking far ahead.",
    "She wanted to protect the hall from the vagaries of budgetary allocations by governments. The Ambassador said that she could do whatever she wished with the money, and agreed that her suggestion was a very good one. This gesture by the Chinese government must be historic. I do not know whether there is any other instance of a government allocating a large sum for some",
    "project, and offering the savings that had accrued from the speedy implementation of that project, back to the government as a further gift.",
    "Sri Lanka-China relations had always been good. The Rubber-Rice Pact in the 1950\u2019s brought the two countries closer. Trade and other contacts developed. China came into the field of development assistance to Sri Lanka. Practically all the assistance was in the form of grants. Sri Lanka in turn, not only strongly supported China\u2019s legitimate right to one of the permanent seats in the UN Security Council, but she also through her able diplomats was in the forefront of the diplomatic battle to obtain this seat for China. These warm relations had a lasting influence, as one or two episodes, within my own knowledge, in the future will show. I shall deal with them at the appropriate place.",
    "Early July of 1973, saw the opening of the Hotel Ceylon Intercontinental. This was the first modern five star hotel to be built here, and marked a milestone in our hotel and tourist industry. Among the many things one worked on, an interesting special assignment at this time was working on a paper for the Prime Minister, on the subject of \u201cComparative Techniques of Government.\u201d This was going to be a major topic for discussion at the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of State and Government in Ottawa. The Prime Minister entrusted this task to Mr. Alif, Mr. WT Jayasinghe and myself.",
    "Apart from producing a paper for the Prime Minister, this assignment gave the three of us an opportunity to focus and think deeply, about a broad and fascinating area of government. Although it meant, additional work and effort, it is strange how a project like this energized one. Perhaps the switch from the burdens of management to the freedom of reflection and analysis was the cause.",
