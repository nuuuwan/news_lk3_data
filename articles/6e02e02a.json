  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Liberal Youth Movement yesterday expressed its deep concern over allegations questioning the authenticity of the academic qualifications presented by Speaker Ashoka Ranwala prior to elections and during Parliamentary proceedings.",
    "\u201cThese concerns have sparked significant public debate and raised serious doubts about the integrity of information shared by leaders with the electorate,\u201d said the Liberal Youth Movement\u2019s Co-Convener Namini Panditha in a statement.",
    "While academic qualifications are not mandatory for holding the position of a Member of Parliament or Speaker, such titles carry weight and are often used to influence voters and enhance political credibility. Misrepresentation of credentials undermines public trust and tarnishes the democratic process.",
    "The Government, elected in the wake of the historic civic protests of 2022 that demanded systemic change, is expected to uphold the highest standards of transparency, accountability, and integrity. Any failure to address these allegations risks eroding the hard-earned trust of the people and perpetuating a political culture marked by manipulation and dishonesty.",
    "In light of these developments, the Liberal Youth Movement strongly urges the Government to:",
    "1. Conduct an immediate and impartial inquiry into the authenticity of the academic qualifications associated with Speaker Ashoka Ranwala.",
    "2. Provide the public with a transparent account of the findings, ensuring accountability for any discrepancies.",
    "3. Clarify its position and take appropriate action should the allegations prove to be accurate, demonstrating a commitment to ethical governance.",
    "The response of the Government to this issue will serve as a critical indicator of its commitment to fostering a transparent and honest political culture.",
    "A failure to act decisively will not only deepen public disillusionment but also hinder efforts to build a system rooted in integrity and good governance.",
    "The Liberal Youth Movement reaffirms its dedication to promoting democratic values, inclusivity, and accountability within Sri Lanka\u2019s political system. We stand with the citizens in demanding clarity and truth from our leaders."
