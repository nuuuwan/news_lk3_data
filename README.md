### Walter Stace in British Ceylon, 1910-1932

*2024-11-17 01:25:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/walter-stace-in-british-ceylon-1910-1932/) · `en`

Walter T. Stace was a British citizen born in 1886 and educated in private schools in Wales and Scotland before completing his undergraduate degree at Trinity College, Dublin. He was therefore of middle-upper class background. His philosophical leanings did not deter him from signing up for the Colonial Service. He was sent to Ceylon – reaching the island with his wife … and being posted to the town of Galle in 1910.

He wrote his autobiography at some point and the Sri Lankan chapters have been printed as a book entitled FOOTPRINTS ON WATER under the editorial direction of Bernd Pflug by the Sailfish firm in Colombo marketed by the Perera Hussein Publishing House in a 218-page booklet bearing the ISBN 978-624-5993-02=4

### On ‘Experts’, ‘Expertise’ & ‘Expatriates’

*2024-11-17 01:06:41* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/on-experts-expertise-expatriates/) · `en`

The inability of Sri Lankan citizens, academics and scholars included, to engage properly with critical issues on time presents a risk to society. It also presents a challenge to the new GOSL. I’ve said this before – sadly, the country ended up in its current, precarious state due to a financial crisis brought about by wicked and corrupt politicians, some of whom have amassed vast wealth in just 15 years after the terrorist war ended. But corrupt and stupid politicians didn’t do it alone.

### An Open Letter To President AKD: Make Religious Freedom Or Belief A priority

*2024-11-17 00:58:04* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/an-open-letter-to-president-akd-make-religious-freedom-or-belief-a-priority/) · `en`

Dear Mr. President, I write to you not only as a concerned citizen but as someone who is deeply invested in the international standing and reputation of Sri Lanka. Just a few months ago, I was among those who voiced their skepticism about your ascent to the presidency, questioning whether your promises of eradicating corruption and prioritizing the welfare of the people would blossom into genuine change.

Yet, today, I reach across the chasm of our political differences to appeal to a shared hope: a united and harmonious Sri Lanka – ensuring religious freedom or belief to all. As you have articulated in your speeches, Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads—we either repeat divisive politics or create an opportunity to build a nation that values the rich diversity of its people.

### The Downplaying of Our National Languages: the Advantages of English

*2024-11-16 23:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-downplaying-of-our-national-languages-the-advantages-of-english/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical stories by LC Arulpragasam)

I recognized the advantages that we had inherited from the British through our knowledge of the English language. But I also began to realize that we had so exalted our knowledge of English that it had been at the expense of the neglect of our national languages. For example in India, although the members of its upper/middle classes spoke impeccable English, they conversed at home in Hindi or in their regional languages, whereas in Ceylon the middle class usually spoke English at home, with the local languages being reserved only for the servants.

Coincidentally, this was the 88th classroom building built by Ceylinco Life under a long-running corporate social responsibility initiative that has benefitted schools across Sri Lanka.

The new building will be used by 40 students of Grade 3, who had previously had their classes outdoors or in the dilapidated school hall due to the non-availability of a building. The Bogaha Kanishta Vidyalaya has a student population of 195.

Every classroom built by Ceylinco Life over the years continues to be monitored and maintained by the Company to ensure it serves many generations of students.

### Inquiries about a Legacy and learning law for fun

*2024-11-16 23:11:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/inquiries-about-a-legacy-and-learning-law-for-fun/) · `en`

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

It was also during this period that I received a rather curt letter from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue stating that his department had received information that I had come in for a legacy of a house and several acres of land. He directed that this be declared forthwith so that the department could assess the tax and any penalties to be paid. This was a bit too much. I was extremely busy and had no time for tomfoolery. I called the stenographer and dictated the following reply:-

I was delighted to receive your letter dated …. I shall be most grateful if you could please provide me very early, all particulars regarding this legacy, with addresses, etc., so that I may be enabled to enter upon it without any delay. I am anxiously looking forward to this. Please rest assured that I would be prepared to gladly pay any tax you may levy on it and any penalties you may decide on.
