    "99x, a global technology services leader, has made significant strides in the field of Agentic AI, securing multiple high-impact engagements powered by its proprietary orchestrator platform, Xians.ai (Agentri AI). These engagements span a diverse range of industries including financial services, legal, insurance, transportation, and accounting, validating the adaptability and commercial viability of 99x\u2019s Agentic AI solutions.",
    "\u201cGenerative AI is a phenomenal leap, but its true value is unlocked through business process orchestration getting multiple AI agents to work together toward complex business goals,\u201d said Hasith Yaggahavita, CEO of 99x Product Engineering. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find a powerful enough orchestrator that met our needs, so we built our own. The fact that many of our sophisticated clients have now adopted xians.ai as their orchestrator of choice is an exciting endorsement of our vision and capabilities.\u201d",
    "99x\u2019s Agentic AI framework has rapidly gained traction, with real-world implementations delivering measurable business value. The company\u2019s modular and scalable architecture allows it to address a wide spectrum of enterprise use cases, from automating legal document drafting and providing AI-powered investment advice, to streamlining customer onboarding and financial reconciliation.",
    "\u201cThe tangible, real-world results are what excite our clients and our own teams,\u201d said Chatura De Silva, Chief Customer Success Officer at 99x. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about theoretical possibilities; we\u2019re delivering measurable outcomes. Our own AI-powered sales agent, \u2018Percy the Prospector,\u2019 is a prime example. Since we deployed it on\u00a0xians.ai\u00a0in January, it has more than doubled our sales pipeline activity.\u201d",
    "Percy the Prospector, an autonomous agent built on xians.ai, is specifically designed to enhance lead generation and market research. The agent continuously scans online news platforms and IT magazines for signals from the Norwegian tech landscape. It then evaluates companies against predefined qualification criteria and compiles tailored prospect reports for the business development team. The result is a dramatic increase in outreach effectiveness and a concrete demonstration of AI agents driving real business outcomes.",
