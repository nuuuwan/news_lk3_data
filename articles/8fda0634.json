  "original_body_lines": [
    "There is no rosy picture on the horizon for Asia, nor for much of the planet. West Asia will continue to burn, its embers fanned by the possibility of fresh escalations with Iran, even as the Gaza war drags towards a brutal close by the first quarter of next year. Ukraine remains the grand theatre for warmongers, with NATO edging towards deeper intervention against Russia, threatening to drag the world into a legal and moral limbo from which there may be no escape. Latin America fractures under its own contradictions: Argentina sinks into crisis under Javier Milei\u2019s economic experiments, while Colombia\u2019s Gustavo Petro, Brazil\u2019s Lula da Silva, and others tilt eastwards in defiance of Washington\u2019s grip.",
    "Venezuela faces a year of turmoil that could destabilize the hemisphere further. Across Asia and Africa, the story is eerily similar: conflicts manufactured and sustained by global powers bleed from Myanmar to Sudan, while the natural world delivers its own retribution. Southern Africa was brought to its knees by the worst drought in a century last year\u201427 million lives shattered, 21 million children left malnourished. This year offers no reprieve. Western aid cuts and cynical geopolitical horse-trading have condemned millions to famine. Against this backdrop of systemic crisis, where collapse outweighs stability, APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders will meet in South Korea at the end of this month.",
    "The meeting comes not as a ceremonial summit of economic integration but as a battlefield of contradictions. APEC, founded in 1989 as a loose forum to liberalise trade and strengthen economic ties, has always been a stage for larger geopolitical manoeuvring. Yet in 2025, with the world economy teetering between inflationary shocks and protectionist instincts, APEC stands naked: a bloc that commands nearly 62 per cent of global GDP and 47 per cent of trade, yet cannot shield its own members from the very crises it was created to soften.",
    "The headlines at this meeting will, of course, be stolen by the possible encounter between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Two men, neither strangers to brinkmanship, now cast as reluctant architects of the region\u2019s fragile stability. One presides over a country where property markets collapse like dominos and demographics wither; the other seeks to mask fiscal black holes by resorting to his most cherished mantra\u2014tariffs, tariffs, tariffs. Both understand that to lose face in Seoul is to surrender leverage at home.",
    "Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already sounded the alarm. Its September outlook paints a bleaker picture than April\u2019s, with regional growth trimmed to 4.8 per cent in 2025 and 4.5 per cent in 2026. Developing Asia, excluding China, is barely better at five per cent and 4.8 per cent across the two years. Inflation is forecast to ease to 1.7 per cent next year, only to edge back up to 2.1 per cent in 2026. These are not catastrophic figures in isolation, but when juxtaposed against the needs of billions across Asia, they are a flashing red light.",
    "Mongolia is expected to slow from 6.6 per cent growth this year to 5.7 per cent, while Korea stagnates at a meagre 1.6 per cent. Even India, the supposed bright star, is forecast to dip to 6.5 per cent by 2026. The Pacific islands\u2014those sacrificial canaries of the climate crisis\u2014face an even more erratic future: Fiji shrinking to 3.0 per cent growth in 2026, Kiribati barely scraping 3.3 per cent. These numbers are not abstractions; they are food prices, factory jobs, remittances, the viability of small states.",
    "APEC, however, will sell optimism. Its Economic Policy Report for 2024 emphasizes financial inclusion, digitization, and credit guarantees for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The language is compelling\u2014extending banking to the rural poor, ensuring women and indigenous groups have access to credit, unleashing AI-powered digital wallets to empower the elderly and the disabled. Yet beneath the rhetoric lies an old problem: the gap between aspiration and implementation. In Vietnam, QR-code adoption has indeed leapt forward, creating millions of digital accounts. But in Papua New Guinea, half the population remains outside formal banking. In the Philippines, credit guarantee schemes exist, but MSMEs still face suffocating interest rates. Financial literacy campaigns run in nearly every APEC economy, but scams and mis-selling scandals proliferate at faster speed. To speak of inclusion without addressing predation is not reform but deception.",
    "The Seoul meeting is being billed by diplomats as a \u201creset moment\u201d for US\u2013China relations. Washington insiders whisper that Trump, under fire for the cost of his second-term trade war, will seek to project both toughness and pragmatism. His tariffs, sometimes exceeding 20 per cent on Chinese goods, have crushed US farmers: soybean exports to China fell by more than half this year, sorghum sales by 97 per cent. The American Soybean Association openly voices frustration, warning that growers may abandon fields if a deal is not reached. China, meanwhile, has no incentive to concede on intellectual property or data sovereignty over TikTok\u2019s prized algorithm. Xi will arrive in Seoul projecting calm, but his message will be pointed: lift the tariffs, or relations stagnate.",
    "The truth is that APEC has long been paralyzed by these very rivalries. Few recall that in 1999, its leaders had to cancel their summit in Auckland for fear of anti-globalization protests. Or that in 2018, the Papua New Guinea meeting collapsed without a joint communiqu\u00e9\u2014the first time in its history\u2014because the US and China clashed over trade language. Even today, when officials champion \u201copen regionalism\u201d, they quietly admit that binding agreements are impossible. Instead, APEC has been reduced to incremental capacity-building workshops, financial literacy tool kits, and pilot projects. These matter, but they are crumbs compared to the storm its members face.",
    "The stakes, then, are not about communiqu\u00e9s or photo-ops but about survival. For the United States, the ability to maintain its alliances in Asia depends on positioning China as the perennial rival, the looming threat that justifies security pacts from Tokyo to Manila. For China, survival means ensuring its slowdown does not become systemic collapse. For smaller states\u2014Indonesia, the Philippines, Peru, Papua New Guinea\u2014the danger is irrelevance, their economies buffeted by tariffs they did not impose, climate shocks they did not cause, and financial contagion they did not spark.",
    "And yet, amid this bleak tableau, the truth is undeniable: APEC is failing. Its voluntary, non-binding ethos has become a shield for inaction. It speaks of inclusivity while its own members cut aid to drought-stricken African states. It praises resilience while allowing global supply chains to be weaponized. It trumpets free trade while tolerating the rise of protectionist tit-for-tats that make a mockery of its founding principles. The Seoul meeting, then, risks becoming another exercise in managed decline: leaders speaking in warm tones while their economies drift towards cold realities.",
    "But perhaps the real danger is deeper. By clinging to the fantasy that technocratic fixes\u2014digital wallets, credit guarantees, workshops on women\u2019s entrepreneurship\u2014can substitute for structural shifts, APEC risks becoming complicit in the erosion of the very stability it seeks. Without a coordinated stance on tariffs, debt restructuring, and climate financing, financial inclusion will be cosmetic at best. Without political will to resist great power rivalry, the forum will remain a hostage to US\u2013China dynamics. Therefore, who can deny that history may yet judge the Seoul summit as a squandered moment of consequence?",
