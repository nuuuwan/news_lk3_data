  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has admitted that it is at fault for the recent island-wide power interruptions, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said on Wednesday (Dec.27).",
    "Citing the state-owned electricity supplier, the PUCSL said the CEB is responsible for failing to restore the power supply for over 5 hours following the sudden major outage reported earlier this month and that it was a \u2018problematic situation\u2019.",
    "The CEB has said it could not maintain an additional power generator to be used in the event of such emergencies, due to inadequate funds.",
    "The PUCSL, meanwhile, has stressed that in order for the CEB to find maintenance costs for an additional power generator, the members of the public will have to bear the burden.",
    "On December 09, a sudden major power outage was reported across the country at around 5:10 p.m.",
    "The cause of island-wide power failures was attributed to the breakdown in the transmission line from Kotmale to Biyagama, which the CEB said was a result of lightning strikes."
