    "The Board of Investment (BOI) has established an online portal to streamline the clearance procedure for removing samples from zone firms with the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) and Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters Association (SLAEA), with the Biyagama Export Processing Zone (EPZ) officially implementing the new system. The move aims to improve efficiency and transparency for enterprises operating inside the zone.",
    "The inaugural ceremony emphasised the necessity of digitisng administrative procedures to help businesses run more smoothly, particularly those that manufacture for export. By transferring this critical licensing procedure online, the BOI hopes to cut delays, reduce paperwork, and assist businesses in achieving their production and export schedules more easily.",
    "The launch of this online system is part of the BOI\u2019s larger endeavour to upgrade its services and assist the digital transformation of Sri Lanka\u2019s business sector. The new platform will not only improve operational efficiency but will also contribute to a more transparent and responsible administrative structure.",
    "Future expansion of the technology to other export processing zones is likely to reduce operating bottlenecks and deliver a more seamless experience for businesses across the country. This program is consistent with the BOI\u2019s strategic aim of fostering a business-friendly environment to attract more foreign direct investment and increase the competitiveness of Sri Lanka\u2019s export industry.",
    "By using digital solutions, the BOI hopes to set new standards for public service delivery, ensuring that Sri Lanka remains a top destination for global investors and exporters alike.",
    "The newly established technology enables firms to completely manage the sample removal process online, streamlining what was previously a manual and time-consuming approach. This is how it works.",
    "Enterprises may now make requests via the digital portal, explaining the samples they want to remove and indicating the reason, such as testing, exhibition, or quality assurance.",
    "A specific BOI officer evaluates each request after receiving it. If the information submitted is complete and follows the criteria, the officer will approve the request. If the officer requires additional information or clarification, they will record the request as \u201cqueried\u201d and notify the company to provide the necessary data. Once approved, the system creates a digital approval document. This form, which enterprises can download and print, serves as official authority to remove samples from the zone.",
    "To remove the samples, the firm must submit a written approval document at the Biyagama Export Processing Zone gate. This ensures the release of only approved samples while maintaining regulatory compliance and security."
