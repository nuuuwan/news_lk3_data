    "Cargills announced the launch of its newly redesigned \u2018Go Green\u2019 bag, now available at all Cargills Retail stores. Cargills, the market leader in the modern trade/supermarket industry, was the first to introduce reusable bags in the sector with the original Go Green bag in 2007.",
    "The redesigned Cargills Go Green bag reflects the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to phasing out polythene bags, which pose significant environmental hazards. Polythene bags also contribute to the drain on foreign currency from the country as it is imported. This initiative is part of the company\u2019s broader strategy to encourage eco-friendly consumer habits and reduce the reliance on single-use plastic bags.",
