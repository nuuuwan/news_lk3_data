  "original_body_lines": [
    "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on September 19 said he was not looking to \u201cprovoke\u201d India or \u201cescalate\u201d tensions, but urged New Delhi to take the killing of a Sikh separatist leader with the \u201cutmost seriousness\u201d.",
    "Mr. Trudeau\u2019s comments came hours after Canada and India expelled a senior diplomat each following his allegations about the involvement of \u201cagents of the Indian government\u201d in the killing of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June.",
    "He said the Indian government needs to \u201ctake this matter with the utmost seriousness\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe are doing that. We are not looking to provoke or escalate,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe want to work with the government of India to lay everything clear and to ensure there are proper processes.\u201d Nijjar, 45, the chief of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) and one of India\u2019s most-wanted terrorists who carried a cash reward of \u20b910 lakh on his head, was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen outside a gurdwara in Surrey in the western Canadian province of British Columbia on June 18.",
    "In a speech to the House of Commons on Monday, Mr. Trudeau said Canadian security agencies have been \u201cactively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\u201d",
    "After Trudeau\u2019s remarks in Parliament, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly confirmed that she has ordered the expulsion of \u201ca senior Indian diplomat.\u201d Reacting sharply to the allegations and Joly\u2019s remarks, India on Tuesday rejected Mr. Trudeau\u2019s claims, calling them \u201cabsurd and motivated\u201d.",
    "The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has also asked a Canadian diplomat to leave India within the next five days.",
    "\u201cAllegations of the Government of India\u2019s involvement in any act of violence in Canada are absurd and motivated,\u201d the MEA said in a statement on Tuesday in New Delhi.",
    "\u201cSimilar allegations were made by the Canadian Prime Minister to our Prime Minister, and were completely rejected,\u201d it said.",
    "Canada-based Nijjar was designated a \u2018terrorist\u2019 by India under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in July 2020 and his property in the country was attached by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in September 2020.",
    "Interpol Red Corner Notice was also issued against him in 2016. The local police of Surrey had also put Nijjar under house arrest temporarily in 2018 on suspicion of his terror involvement but he was released later.",
    "Bilateral ties between India and Canada have been tense in recent months. Trade talks have been derailed and Canada just cancelled trade talks."
