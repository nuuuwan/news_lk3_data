    "\u201cConsidering that Brazil is a large oil producer and is driving oil production growth, it is important to have them on board, but it seems that they are not cutting production like Mexico, so [I] would conclude with: good for OPEC+, less relevant for oil market balances,\u201d UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told the Agence France-Presse news agency.",
