    "Colombo, May 28 (Daily Mirror)- The National People's Power (NPP) said today that if the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is not ready for the debate between the two leaders Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake on June 6 as previously announced, there would be no further debate or discussions about a debate after June 6.",
    "Speaking to the media, NPP Executive Member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said if the scheduled debate on June 6 is held, they are ready to engage in discussions on preparations for the debate between the two leaders.",
    "\"What we have to do now is to decide on a television channel or a place to hold the debate. We have no time to waste on other nonsense. We would like to remind Sajith Premadasa and Nalin Bandara that even though politics is a joke for them, it is not so for us. If the debate between the two leaders is not held on June 6, there will be no debates or discussions on a debate after that,\" he said.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa said it is a world practice to hold a debate between the main candidates, when a presidential election is on the cards and added that two debates between US President Joe Biden and Donald Trump have been scheduled for July 27 and September 7 before the presidential election in the US.",
    "\"Neither Trump nor Biden says there should be another debate before the debate on two leaders. If a presidential election is coming, it is important for the people to know the policies of the two main candidates,\" he said.",
    "He said there seems to be controversy even among the members of the SJB economic council on its economic blueprint and said it is better for them to discuss and iron out any arguments and inform their leader Premadasa first of all."
