    "Colombo, June 11 (Daily Mirror) - An investigation has been launched by the Anuradhapura Wildlife Assistant Director regarding a video circulating on social media showing a youth touching a wild elephant while it was asleep.",
    "This video was recorded in the Ranajayapura forest area of Anuradhapura.",
    "The video clearly shows one of the three youths carefully approaching the sleeping elephant, touching it and then gradually retreating.",
    "They recorded the video as an adventure activity, claiming they did not zoom in to make it appear fake. Their stated purpose was to demonstrate how to get close to a wild elephant.",
    "The Wildlife Department urged people not to engage in such activities, highlighting the risks involved, and advised against attempting similar actions after watching the video."
