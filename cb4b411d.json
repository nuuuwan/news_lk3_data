  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Maligakanda Magistrate on Wednesday inquired from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) if its investigations had revealed if the former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella had prior knowledge about the controversial immunoglobulin scam.",
    "Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama noted this observation after the counsel for two suspects in the case claimed that when their clients implicated former Minister Keheliya Rambuwella as the person directing the substandard human immunoglobulin deal, the CID omitted Minister Keheliya\u2019s name from the suspects\u2019 statements and refused to include it.",
    "Following that, the Magistrate instructed the CID to take additional statements from the 1st and 3rd suspects at the prison premises today. The Magistrate also commented that the suspect\u2019s counsel should refrain from making statements based on hearsay and instead present facts before the court if they have any to submit.",
    "At the beginning of the inquiry, Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama submitted an additional report on the CID investigations in court, urging the court to instruct the CID to obtain further statements from two officers, Vijith Gunasekera and A.M.P.K. Alweera of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority.",
    "The DSG also requested the court to issue an order for the CID to summon Vijith Gunasekera, who had migrated from Sri Lanka, to record a statement.",
    "DSG Girihagama conveyed that the Cabinet had granted approval to procure the drug and submitted an English copy of the approval in court. She requested the CID to submit a Sinhala translation of it, if available.",
    "Additionally, she mentioned that the laboratory investigations were still underway and requested a later date for their completion. Girighagama also sought court permission to send the productions to the Government Analyst for examination and to provide a report to the court.",
    "The DSG emphasised that the first suspect was not authorised to manufacture the questionable vaccine, and the suspect also lacked the authorisation to import chemicals, water-cleansing drugs, or bottles, which had already been imported. She said the investigations were still ongoing and requested the court to remand the suspects.",
    "However, counsel for the 6th suspect, Janaka Sri Chandragupta, contested the Criminal Investigation Department, alleging that they are refraining from arresting former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella due to political favouritism. He claimed that the real culprits involved in the crime have not been apprehended.",
    "Six suspects, including the former Secretary to the Ministry of Health Janaka Chandragupta were further remanded until 10 January in connection with the alleged procurement of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. The Magistrate had previously ordered the arrest and appearance before the court of all responsible parties, regardless of their positions, to ensure justice in the case of providing substandard medicine to the public."
