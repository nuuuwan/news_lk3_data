    "(The Hindu); High Commissioner Milinda Moragoda says Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes of benefiting from India\u2019s economic growth and coming out of its current economic crisis hinged on being able to build causeways, bridges, pipelines, electricity transmission lines and landing infrastructure so as to increase travel to and from India, and he says the resolution of the Tamils\u2019 issue would have to be found \u2018within Sri Lanka\u2019",
    "Land connectivity is essential for the growth of ties between India and its neighbouring island, said the Sri Lankan envoy here, pitching for connectivity projects resembling the \u201cChannel tunnel\u201d from the U.K. to Europe as a possible future initiative if environmental concerns are cleared.",
    "Speaking about Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s visit to India in July, where the two countries unveiled an \u201cEconomic Partnership Vision\u201d statement that includes maritime, air, energy, trade and people-to-people connectivity, High Commissioner Milinda Moragoda said Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes of benefiting from India\u2019s economic growth and coming out of its current economic crisis hinged on being able to build causeways, bridges, pipelines, electricity transmission lines and landing infrastructure so as to increase travel to and from India.",
    "\u201cBuilding any causeway or highway across the streets will require environmental impact assessments, and there is a process for that\u201d, Mr. Moragoda told The Hindu in an interview. \u201cIf Sri Lanka is looking at this idea of piggybacking on India\u2019s growth story we have to have [land] connectivity,\u201d he added.",
    "When asked why concerns expressed by India over implementation of the 13th amendment for devolution of power to Tamil majority areas was not, however, included in the joint statements made during the visit, the Sri Lankan envoy said President Wickremesinghe had discussed his latest proposals with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
    "\u201cPrime Minister [Mr. Modi] expressed his views and President [Mr. Wickremesinghe] expressed Sri Lanka\u2019s position. So that conversation will continue,\u201d said Mr. Moragoda, pointing out that eventually the resolution of the Tamils\u2019 issue would have to be found \u201cwithin Sri Lanka\u201d.",
    "The vision statement released after President Wickremesinghe met Mr. Modi in Delhi on July 21 refers to plans for a feasibility study on land connectivity \u201cat an early date\u201d.",
    "\u201cBoth leaders have decided to establish land connectivity between Sri Lanka and India for developing land access to the ports of Trincomalee and Colombo, propelling economic growth and prosperity in both Sri Lanka and India, and further consolidating millennia-old relationship between the two countries,\u201d it said. However, the envoy declined to comment on whether this would involve using the Ram Sethu, or the Adam\u2019s Bridge that connects Tamil Nadu to Mannar Island, which has been the focus of protests by religious and environmental groups, in any way.",
    "In addition, the envoy said that as Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t have refining capabilities, an oil pipeline could help the island\u2019s needs, especially if connected to the oil tank farms in Trincomalee which are also part of the MoUs signed during President Wickremesinghe\u2019s visit. The projects agreed to during the visit most closely mirror a number of MoUs signed during Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s previous visit in 2017, when he was Prime Minister under then Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. Those MoUs, including the plan for India to refurbish energy and port facilities in the eastern city of Trincomalee eventually did not make headway and were delayed due to internal political turmoil in Sri Lanka. When asked about timelines for the execution of the projects agreed to during this visit, Mr. Moragoda said the emphasis now is on encouraging private investments.",
    "\u201cWhen you talk of timelines for initiatives like this in democracies, it\u2019s more complicated. One understanding between the two leaders is to try to encourage the private sector to be more engaged on both sides, which could be more time-sensitive and successful,\u201d he explained. He added that the purpose of the Sri Lankan President\u2019s visit, the first to India since he took over in June 2022, to \u201cchart the way forward\u201d for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery, as the economic vision statement had done, and to thank Mr. Modi and India for the support to Sri Lanka during its debt crisis.",
    "In the past week, Colombo has received visits from French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and an official from the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, all of whom also offered to help Sri Lanka as it works out a debt restructuring programme with the International Monetary Fund by the end of the year. Mr. Moragoda said economic revenue streams would have to be upgraded for a recovery, and hoped particularly for Indian investment and Indian tourists to contribute to that.",
