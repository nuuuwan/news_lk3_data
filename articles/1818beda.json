  "original_body_lines": [
    "Once considered Sri Lanka\u2019s quiet frontier, the island\u2019s east coast is experiencing a deliberate and meaningful resurgence. With its powdery beaches, cultural depth, and warm waters untouched by overdevelopment, the region is fast emerging as the next chapter in responsible, high-value tourism.",
    "And at the heart of this movement stands Sun Siyam Pasikudah, a resort nestled along the sun-drenched shores of Kalkudah that embodies a new kind of luxury. One that is intimate, sustainable, and deeply rooted in place.",
    "Unlike the mega-resorts that line more commercial destinations, Sun Siyam Pasikudah does not compete on excess. It competes on experience. With just 34 villas and suites, the property offers space, silence, and soulful connection, the kind of refined minimalism that today\u2019s conscious travellers increasingly seek.",
    "\u201cEastern Sri Lanka is no longer just a seasonal detour. it\u2019s becoming a core destination,\u201d says Arshad Refai, its general manager. \u201cWhat travellers want today isn\u2019t just scenery. They want cultural texture, sustainability, and a sense of discovery. The east offers all of that.\u201d",
    "From Trincomalee\u2019s spiritual energy to Arugam Bay\u2019s surf culture and Batticaloa\u2019s lagoon life, this coast is a patchwork of micro-experiences. Pasikudah, in particular, strikes a rare balance: serene, swimmable waters with proximity to cultural landmarks like the ancient city of Polonnaruwa and wildlife havens like Minneriya.",
    "But infrastructure is only part of the equation. The real difference is in the kind of hospitality that\u2019s emerging, which are thoughtful, boutique properties that don\u2019t just serve guests but immerse them in the region\u2019s story. Sun Siyam Pasikudah is a standout among these.",
    "Built with a philosophy of less is more, Sun Siyam Pasikudah doesn\u2019t try to replicate five-star opulence. Instead, it offers something rarer: considered luxury. Large freestanding bathtubs, handwoven textiles, open-air courtyards, and coastal colour palettes bring the outdoors in. But the real indulgence? Space, calm, and a sense of home.",
    "Guests aren\u2019t herded into pre-set itineraries, they\u2019re invited to shape their own. Whether it\u2019s learning to weave thatch with a local artisan, taking a cooking class using regional produce, or sipping wine in the largest cellar in the region, the experience is less about ticking boxes and more about meaningful connection.",
    "The dining is another expression of this ethos. From poolside plates to elegant dinners under the stars, menus at the resort are ingredient-led, seasonally responsive, and rich with Sri Lankan heritage. The on-site Latitude restaurant leads the culinary offering, supported by private dining options and curated tea and wine experiences that draw from both local tradition and international finesse.",
    "\u201cLuxury is changing,\u201d notes Refai. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about abundance; it\u2019s about intention. Privacy, slowness, sustainability, and emotional connection are now the markers of an exceptional stay.\u201d It\u2019s a shift that Sun Siyam Resorts has embraced wholeheartedly. The brand while known for its properties in the Maldives has brought a uniquely Sri Lankan depth to its east coast outpost. And that includes a strong sense of responsibility.",
    "Sun Siyam Pasikudah is proudly Travelife Gold Certified, one of the most respected sustainability accreditations in global hospitality. But beyond certification, the team practices what it preaches. Solar energy powers much of the resort. Single-use plastics are actively eliminated. Local sourcing is a priority\u2014from seafood to spa ingredients. Even experiences are curated to benefit the wider community, ensuring that tourism growth is shared and regenerative.",
    "Boutique properties like Sun Siyam Pasikudah aren\u2019t just redefining hospitality, they\u2019re reshaping regional development. By embedding sustainability and community engagement into their operations, they demonstrate that high-end tourism doesn\u2019t have to be extractive. It can be inclusive.",
    "In Pasikudah, this shows up in subtle ways: training local youth in hospitality, sourcing handmade d\u00e9cor and crafts, supporting local fishers, and creating platforms for cultural exchange. Guests are not just observers, they\u2019re participants in a shared narrative. \u201cPeople remember how a place makes them feel,\u201d says Arshed. \u201cHere, it\u2019s calm, it\u2019s real, and guests feel like they\u2019re part of something more meaningful than just a holiday.\u201d",
