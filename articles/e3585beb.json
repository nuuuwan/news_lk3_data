    "Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Wednesday at a Utah college event in an act that drew renewed attention to the threat of political violence across the United States.",
    "The death was announced on social media by Trump, who praised the 31-year-old Kirk, the co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA, as \u201cGreat, and even Legendary.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,\u201d Trump posted on his Truth Social account.",
    "The suspected shooter has not been arrested, Orem, Utah, Mayor David Young said. A person who was taken into custody by law enforcement at the university where Kirk was speaking was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly.",
    "Videos posted to social media from Utah Valley University show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans \u201cThe American Comeback\u201d and \u201cProve Me Wrong.\u201d A single shot rings out and Kirk can be seen reaching up with his right hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators are heard gasping and screaming before people start to run away. The AP was able to confirm the videos were taken at Sorensen Center courtyard on the Utah Valley University campus.",
    "\u201cWe are confirming that he was shot and we are praying for Charlie,\u201d said Aubrey Laitsch, public relations manager for Turning Point USA.",
    "Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political organization. Immediately before the shooting, Kirk was taking questions for an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence.",
    "\u201cDo you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?\u201d an audience members asked. Kirk responded: \u201cToo many.\u201d",
    "The questioner followed up: \u201cDo you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?\u201d",
    "The event had been met with divided opinions on campus. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its \u201ccommitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.\u201d",
    "Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit to Utah colleges was sparking controversy. He wrote, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Utah?\u201d",
    "Trump and a host of Republican and Democratic elected officials decried the shooting and offered prayers for Kirk on social media.",
    "\u201cWe must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot. A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
    "The shooting comes amid a spike in political violence in the United States across all parts of the ideological spectrum. The attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade to demand Hamas release hostages, and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, who is Jewish, in April. The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a campaign rally last year.",
    "Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back.",
    "\u201cIt seemed like it was a close shot,\u201d Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke.",
    "He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough.",
    "\u201cUtah is one of the safest places on the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we just don\u2019t have these types of things.\u201d",
    "Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.",
    "But Kirk\u2019s zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers.",
    "Despite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, during the general election campaign.",
    "Soon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences."
