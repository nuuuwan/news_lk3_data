    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Health and Media Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa dismissed allegations that ongoing law enforcement actions against certain politicians amount to political vendettas, stating that such claims are an attempt to preempt accountability.The Minister emphasized that current investigations target organized crime and narcotics networks, not political opponents.\u201cWe are dismantling major drug rackets involving heroin and crystal meth, and cracking down on underworld gangs,\u201d Jayatissa said.\u201cWhen the CID questions suspects and uncovers these networks, political links inevitably surface. Those who know they are connected to these crimes are now crying \u2018political witch-hunt\u2019 to shield themselves.\u201dHe added that law enforcement agencies are acting strictly on evidence, including phone records and WhatsApp communications, which reveal ties between drug traffickers, underworld figures, and certain political actors.Jayatissa stressed that the government\u2019s anti-narcotics and anti-crime operations will continue without political interference, noting that suspects fleeing abroad are also being brought back to face justice."
