    "Eton College marked a major milestone on July 30 with the move to a new building featuring modern classrooms, a science laboratory, IT center, library, and fully equipped preschool. Established on January 7, 2024, in a rented Maradana facility with 40 students, the college has grown to over 200 students and a staff of more than 20 under Principal and CEO Akram Mohamed Thowfeek. The school emphasizes quality English-medium education, sports, arts, and trilingual fluency through its English, Sinhala, and Tamil societies. Eton Campus in Kollupitiya complements the college, offering TVEC-approved diplomas, degrees, and UK-accredited programs in business, IT, and education.",
