    "The recently announced Indian grant of INR 75 crore, for development projects targeting Sri Lanka\u2019s hill country (Malaiyaha) Tamils, will be used primarily for the education and health sectors in the island\u2019s long-neglected tea estate region, says Jeevan Thondaman, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development.",
    "\u201cWe want to use this grant for transformative change rather than aesthetic change in the lives of the Indian-origin Tamil community here. It is important that we create conditions for long-term impact,\u201d said the 28-year-old Cabinet minister, who is also the General Secretary of the Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress, the party of his late great grandfather Savumiamoorthy Thondaman.",
    "Speaking to The Hindu at his Colombo office on Tuesday, Minister Thondaman outlined the government\u2019s plan for upgrading old creches in the estates into early childhood development centres, converting virtually defunct medical dispensaries into cluster hospitals to provide better healthcare for workers, and setting up a university.",
    "The grant, amounting to roughly USD 9 million, was among the announcements made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s visit to New Delhi on July 21.",
    "It adds to India\u2019s relatively recent engagement in Sri Lanka\u2019s hill country.",
    "The Indian-origin Tamils or Malaiyaha Tamils, as some in the community prefer to identify, has a population of over a million, out of which about 1.5 lakh continue to work and reside in the tea estates, two centuries after their south Indian ancestors were brought down by the British as labourers.",
    "Highlighting the acute economic deprivation in the estate areas, Mr. Thondaman said: \u201cIf you look at malnutrition or stunted growth, it is the highest among the children in the estates.\u00a0 That is why I say we need to transform their reality, and that means focusing on crucial sectors like education and health.\u201d",
    "The Ministry will consult all stakeholders, voices from the opposition and civil society, to decide on the course of developmental initiatives, he said.",
    "The proposed, Indian grant-backed projects will be in addition to India\u2019s ongoing housing programme in the hill country, aimed at building 14,000 homes \u2014 apart from the 50,000 houses built in the war-affected north and east \u2014 for families residing on the estates.",
    "While appreciating the need for housing, the Minister expressed his reservations about any scheme building homes for people, seeing it as limited in its scope to create broader livelihood opportunities for families. \u201cPersonally, I think it is more important to ensure land rights for the people.\u201d",
    "All the same, with nearly 4,000 units having been completed in the estates, the Ministry will focus on launching phase one of building the remaining 10,000 homes, whose construction has been delayed due to a host of factors, including the plantation companies\u2019 refusal to provide the required land.",
    "Mr. Thondaman, who was part of President Wickremesinghe\u2019s delegation to New Delhi, subsequently met Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in Chennai, and discussed prospects for investment and collaboration, especially in education.",
    "\u201cI conveyed to the Chief Minister our commemoration of the 200th year of Indian Origin Tamils\u2019 arrival in Sri Lanka.\u00a0 As much as the Sri Lankan government has a responsibility towards our community, the governments of India and Tamil Nadu, too, owe a duty of care to us,\u201d he said, referring to the Sirima\u2013Shastri Pact of 1964. The \u201csignificant population of the community\u201d residing in Tamil Nadu, he said, was \u201cliving proof\u201d of the past injustices faced by the community.",
    "Meanwhile, commenting on power devolution and the 13th Amendment that India unfailingly flags in talks with the Sri Lankan side, Mr. Thondaman said: \u201cIt is really the failure of our [southern Sinhalese] leadership to pitch the 13th Amendment as something that devolves powers to all provinces, and not as something that gives greater power to only Tamils. That is the reason that the Sinhalese see it as India-imposed, when what India really did [around the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987] was facilitate democracy.\u201d",
    "In his view, the political developments of the last 50 years have strained the historically close ties shared by the neighbours. \u201cNo two countries on this planet have ties as close as India and Sri Lanka spanning centuries,\u201d he remarked. There is, however, a shift in perception more recently, he said.",
    "\u201cThe humanitarian help that India provided us during the economic crisis has made it amply clear to all Sri Lankans that India is a true friend. Moreover, the foreign policy of PM Modi and Mr. Jaishankar, batting for the Global South, is setting a precedent in the region,\u201d he added."
