    "Despite the overall decline, the survey highlights that young people remain a vulnerable group",
    "Youth say drinking alcohol a purposeless behaviour and smoking a useless behaviour",
    "Despite the positive trend in quitting, the survey emphasises the powerful role of social influence in starting to drink as a significant 46.6% of current consumers reported that their first experience with alcohol was with friends. This finding reveals the critical importance of addressing peer pressure in prevention efforts, especially for young people. Among current drinkers, 18.0% were between the ages of 15 and 21, indicating that a substantial number of young people are still initiating alcohol use. ADIC recommends implementing a national prevention program aimed specifically at children and youth to discourage them from starting in the first place",
    "Alcohol consumption in Sri Lanka has shown a decade-long downward trend, with a new 2024 survey revealing that fewer than 30% of men are current drinkers.",
    "Another survey conducted has revealed that tobacco use has also recorded a significant reduction in Sri Lanka and that the rate of current smokers among men has fallen to 21.6%.",
    "Both studies were conducted by the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) in 2024 and found that most of the young people view drinking alcohol as a purposeless behaviour and smoking as a useless behaviour.",
    "According to the studies, there is a significant generational shift in attitudes, with young people increasingly quitting alcohol and smoking.",
    "The \u201cTrend Survey on Alcohol Consumption in Sri Lanka \u2013 2024\u201d surveyed males aged 15 and above across 11 districts, including Colombo, Jaffna, Galle, and Badulla. It found that 29.1% of participants were current consumers, defined as having consumed alcohol within the 30 days prior to the survey. This continued decline is attributed to successful alcohol control policies, public awareness campaigns, and community interventions.",
    "The most striking is the finding that 27.9% of all participants reported being successful quitters. The motivations for quitting, however, varied significantly by age. While older individuals cited health concerns, younger people were more likely to quit because they perceived drinking as pointless.",
    "The study highlights the need for age-specific prevention strategies that address the different values of each generation.",
    "Despite the positive trend in quitting, the survey emphasises the powerful role of social influence in starting to drink as a significant 46.6% of current consumers reported that their first experience with alcohol was with friends. This finding reveals the critical importance of addressing peer pressure in prevention efforts, especially for young people.",
    "Among current drinkers, 18.0% were between the ages of 15 and 21, indicating that a substantial number of young people are still initiating alcohol use. ADIC recommends implementing a national prevention program aimed specifically at children and youth to discourage them from starting in the first place.",
    "The report also highlights the impact of government fiscal policy on alcohol consumption as statistics from the Excise Department of Sri Lanka shows a sharp decline in total alcohol production after 2022, with successive increases in excise duties. The Government implemented a 20% tax hike in June 2023, followed by another 14% in January 2024, with a further 6% increase planned for January 2025.",
    "While production has fallen, government revenue from alcohol excise taxes has soared, rising from Rs. 169.49 billion in 2022 to Rs. 223.25 billion in 2024. This trend, according to the report, demonstrates the effectiveness of taxation as a dual-purpose tool recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) where it successfully increases government income while simultaneously helping to reduce alcohol-related harm.",
    "The ADIC has recommended several initiatives to strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s alcohol control framework to reduce initiation and address the health, social, and economic impact of alcohol use. They are to expedite the adoption of proposed amendments to the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Act, to implement a scientific tax formula that automatically increases excise duties annually in line with inflation and economic growth and to cease issuing temporary liquor licenses and stop granting new licenses under the pretext of promoting tourism.",
    "The study has also recommended enhancing law enforcement to control the illegal alcohol market, to prevent interference from the alcohol industry aimed at weakening policies and to improve and implement counselling and treatment services for individuals struggling with alcohol dependency.",
    "Meanwhile the ADIC study on tobacco use in Sri Lanka has also found a sharp decrease in smoking mainly due to the success of national tobacco control policies and a significant generational shift in attitudes, with a majority of young people quitting or reducing their use because they perceive smoking as a useless behaviour.",
    "The \u2018Trend Survey on Tobacco Use in Sri Lanka \u2013 2024\u2019 surveyed males aged 15 and above across 11 districts to map contemporary smocking patterns. The findings show that while progress is being made, significant challenges, particularly peer pressure and industry influence, remain in the effort to create a tobacco-free generation.",
    "The survey reveals a notable positive trend: 36.5% of all participants have successfully quit smoking, and an additional 20.9% of current smokers have reduced their consumption. This decline is largely attributed to important public health measures, especially tax increases.",
    "According to the report, a 20% excise duty hike on cigarettes in 2023 proved highly effective. It not only increased government revenue by Rs. 7.7 billion but also led to a significant 18% reduction in cigarette production, equivalent to 521.5 million fewer sticks compared to the previous year.",
    "This is also going with WHO\u2019s recommendations that higher prices reduce the affordability of tobacco and, in the long run, decrease consumption.",
    "The reasons for quitting and reducing use differ while price changes were a major factor. The most cited reason was the perception of tobacco use as a \u2018useless behaviour\u2019, particularly among the younger population.",
    "Despite the overall decline, the survey highlights that young people remain a vulnerable group as 11.6% of current smokers are between the ages of 15 and 21, indicating that underage smoking is a persistent issue.",
    "The primary reason for initiation, according to ADIC findings, is social influence. The report states that the majority of initiations occur at social gatherings, with peer pressure being a key driving factor. ADIC warns that promotions by the tobacco industry through traditional and social media also play a significant role in creating a positive image of smoking among vulnerable groups.",
    "The study highlights the urgent need for enhanced awareness within communities and stronger policy formulations to delay or prevent young people from starting to smoke.",
    "The ADIC survey findings recommend several measures crucial to prevent smoking among underaged individuals. One of the main recommendations is to implement a \u2018Tobacco-Free Generation\u2019 Policy recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Association, where sale of tobacco products to be banned to anyone born after 2010, which will facilitate substantial social and economic gains in the long run.",
    "Among other recommendations of the ADIC are banning single stick sales to make cigarettes less affordable and accessible, especially to youth. The report calls for the strict implementation of the ban on selling single sticks, enforcing sales restrictions as survey calls for better enforcement of existing laws, including the prohibition of tobacco sales within a 100-metre radius of schools and to underage individuals, and creating a National Prevention Program, which the ADIC recommends as a program to expose tobacco industry tactics and reinforce the message that smoking is a \u2018purposeless and harmful behaviour\u2019."
