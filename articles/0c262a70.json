    "An 88-year-old man who is the world\u2019s longest-serving death row inmate has been acquitted by a Japanese court, after it found that evidence used against him was fabricated.",
    "Iwao Hakamada, who has been on death row for more than half a century, was found guilty in 1968 of killing his boss, the man\u2019s wife and their two teenage children.",
    "He was recently granted a retrial amid suspicions that investigators may have planted evidence that led to his conviction for quadruple murder.",
    "More than half a century spent on death row has taken a heavy toll on Hakamada\u2019s mental health, though, meaning he was unfit to attend the hearing where his acquittal was finally handed down.",
    "Hakamada\u2019s case is one of Japan\u2019s longest and most famous legal sagas, and has attracted widespread public interest, with some 500 people lining up for seats in the courtroom in Shizuoka on Thursday.",
    "As the verdict was handed down, Hakamada\u2019s supporters outside the court cheered \u201cbanzai\u201d - a Japanese exclamation that means \u201churray\u201d.",
    "Hakamada, who was exempted from all hearings due to his deteriorated mental state, has been living under the care of his 91-year-old sister Hideko since 2014, when he was freed from jail and granted a retrial.",
    "He previously told the AFP news agency that his battle for justice was like \u201cfighting a bout every day\u201d.",
    "\u201cOnce you think you can\u2019t win, there is no path to victory,\u201d he said.",
    "A former professional boxer, Hakamada was working at a miso processing plant in 1966 when the bodies of his employer, the man\u2019s wife and two children were recovered from a fire at their home in Shizuoka, west of Tokyo. All four had been stabbed to death.",
    "Authorities accused Hakamada of murdering the family, setting fire to their home and stealing 200,000 yen in cash.",
    "Hakamada initially denied having robbed and murdered the victims, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.",
    "In 1968 he was convicted of murder and arson, and sentenced to death.",
    "The decades-long legal saga ultimately turned on some clothes found in a tank of miso a year after Hakamada\u2019s arrest. Those clothes, purportedly bloodstained, were used to incriminate him.",
    "For years, however, Hakamada\u2019s lawyers argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his, raising the possibility that the items belonged to someone else. The lawyers further suggested that police could have fabricated the evidence.",
    "Their argument was enough to persuade Judge Hiroaki Murayama, who in 2014 noted that \u201cthe clothes were not those of the defendant\u201d.",
    "\u201cIt is unjust to detain the defendant further, as the possibility of his innocence has become clear to a respectable degree,\u201d Murayama said at the time.",
    "Prolonged legal proceedings meant that it took until last year for that retrial to begin - and until Thursday morning for the court to declare the verdict.",
    "While the DNA argument was quashed, the judge found another argument by defence lawyers credible - that the red stains found on the clothes could not have been blood, as blood would not remain red on clothing immersed in miso for a year.",
    "Thursday\u2019s ruling found that \u201cinvestigators tampered with clothes by getting blood on them\u201d which they then hid in the tank of miso, according to AFP.",
