    "\u201cThere were many big pieces of steel,\u201d said Vassilis Polyzos, a local resident who said he was one of the first people on the scene. \u201cThe trains were completely destroyed, both passenger and freight trains.\u201d",
    "He said dazed and disoriented people were escaping out of the train\u2019s rear cars as he arrived.",
    "\u201cPeople, naturally, were scared \u2014 very scared,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were looking around, searching; they didn\u2019t know where they were.\u201d",
