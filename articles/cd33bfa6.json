    "By and large, we had a hardworking team of officials both in the Ministry and the Departments. The Minister Mr. Herat and the Deputy Minister Mr. Rajakaruna, later himself to become Minister for a short period, were both appreciative and supportive of the officers. I had myself been the recipient of much kindness. I remember an occasion when the Deputy Minister was acting for the Minister. We were at our Tuesday afternoon review meeting. The time was about 6.30 p.m, when the office-aide came and informed me that there was a telephone call from home. I was speaking and virtually in mid-sentence when this message came. I wanted therefore to quickly complete the point I was making before getting up and going to take the call. This did not meet with the Acting Minister\u2019s approval. \u201cFirst, go and see what the call is about,\u201d he said.",
    "I bowed to superior orders and left. My wife said our servant woman had cut her finger rather deeply and inquired when I would be coming home because she thought it best to take her to the doctor, get it dressed properly and give her an anti-tetanus injection. After discussion, since I was getting late, it was agreed that she would take her by taxi. I did not think it appropriate to send my official car all the way from Union Place, Slave Island to Wellawatte for the purpose, although Secretaries to Ministries had the complete power and freedom to use the official car for any private purpose. When I got back, the Acting Minister asked what the matter was.",
    "I told him. He was quite annoyed at the arrangements I had made. He ordered one of the Assistant Secretaries present, \u201cGo in my car, take Mrs. Pieris and the servant to the doctor, and come back when the matter is finished and they are dropped back home. Go now and telephone and tell her you are coming.\u201d This I was able to get altered, because I needed the Assistant Secretary to be present at the meeting. A car was sent. Such was the spirit in which the political and administrative authorities worked in the Ministry. We had political heads who were appreciative of dedication and hard work and who were solicitous of our concerns and welfare. There were also times when I did not want to go on some visit abroad where the Minister said \u201cNo. Go. You need a break.\u201d In that respect, Mr. Herat was like Mrs. Bandaranaike. Both of them were caring people.",
    "There was the matter of my salary during the time I was Chairman and Director-General of Broadcasting to be settled. When I was suddenly moved to the SLBC, due to the events described in the chapter dealing with my period as Secretary to the Prime Minister, I was already on the maximum of the Secretaries scale. The question was, whether my salary was now to be diminished to that of a Chairman of a Corporation. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting did not resolve this matter during the brief period I served under that Ministry. I therefore issued instructions at the SLBC to pay me the Chairman\u2019s salary. I did not draw the Secretaries salary which I had been getting.",
    "This was of course financially disadvantageous to me. When in due course I took this matter up With Minister Herat, his response was spontaneous. He did not see a reason for any diminution of my salary. He asked me to draft a letter to President Jayewardene, for his signature setting out the facts. This was done. His Secretary, Mr. Menikdiwela was very supportive. He telephoned me and inquired as to why I had taken so much time over this matter. A few days later the President replied, conveying his ruling that my salary should not be diminished during the time I served at the SLBC and that my previous salary and scale should be regarded as personal to me.",
    "The SLBC therefore had to pay some arrears to me. The unique circumstances of my case, which I have already recorded, meant that from May 1972 to December 1997 when I left the service, I was on the Secretaries scale of salary, much of that period on the maximum of that scale, a period of over 25 years, surely a record. From November 1977 to the end of December 1997, a period of over 20 years, I was continuously a Secretary to various Ministries.",
    "The year 1980 began with a visit to Australia, at the invitation of the Australian Wheat Board. I have already related our connections with the Wheat Board in the chapter dealing with my experiences as Deputy Food Commissioner. The delegation to Australia which I led consisted of Mr. Hassen the Food Commissioner; and Captain Heyward Fernando, Chairman of the State Flour Milling Corporation. Mr. Mylvagnam the Wheat Board representative in Sri Lanka and Heyward\u2019s wife Mangala accompanied us.",
    "The Prima Mill was being built in Trincomalee and one of the main purposes of the visit was to discuss the various issues pertaining to the potential supply of some Australian Wheat for the mill. We were due to receive substantial quantities of wheat under the United States Government\u2019s PL 480 aid programme. There was however, a potential for Australian wheat for blending purposes, and if the price was right, larger quantities to meet our requirements.",
    "During our mid January visit of about two weeks, we visited Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, the headquarters of the Wheat Board. The visit enabled us to go to Grain Terminals; Ports; Bakeries; Agriculture Research Institutes and other facilities. As usual, as the leader of the delegation I had to make numerous speeches at lunches, dinners and other gatherings, including at receptions accorded to us by Sri Lankan communities in Adelaide and Melbourne.",
    "I also had the responsibility of making a major address to a full formal meeting of the Australian Wheat Board. I had been present when others addressed the Board, during my tenure as Deputy Food Commissioner. Now it was my turn. With experience and confidence these matters become less onerous with the passage of time. But careful and detailed preparation is always necessary, because, apart from anything else, you are representing your country and you cannot let the country down by some shoddy performance.",
    "In Adelaide, I had the pleasure of meeting H.M.Z. Faroque and Dr. Michael Roberts at the reception accorded to us by the Sri Lanka community. We were batch mates at the University and friends. Faroque came first in the Civil Service Examination. in which I came second, and we served in the public service together Until he left to teach law at the University of Adelaide. Michael Roberts and I were regular members of the University of Peradeniya Cricket team and rivals when his hall Ramanathan played my hall Marrs in the Inter-hall competition.",
    "The fact that both halls had strong sides and were invariably in the final added to the friendly rivalry. He had become a distinguished historian and was teaching the subject in the same University as Faroque\u2019s. After the reception, we were literally hijacked to their homes for a most pleasant evening of anecdotes, yarns and laughter.",
    "During this visit, again, we were able to broaden our knowledge through discussions with many different people. These included experienced persons in the wheat, flour, research, management, shipping, finance and logistics fields. We also met some State Ministers of Agriculture, farmer\u2019s representatives, as well as of course, various specialists at the Wheat Board. No amount of reading could give one the kind of detailed knowledge which we acquired as a result of these visits. By way of formal social activities, Sir Leslie Price, Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board hosted a dinner in our honour and we reciprocated by hosting a return dinner. The Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation hosted a lunch for us in their.",
