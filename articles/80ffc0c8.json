    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s restricted default (RD) rating could be removed after debt restructuring is complete, and relations with commercial creditors are normalized, Fitch Ratings said.",
    "With the new administration endorsing a deal with sovereign bondholders, political risks have to debt restructure has receded, Fitch said.",
    "Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said the administration decided to go ahead with the deal negotiated shortly before the Presidential elections because delays could lead to bigger problems for the economy.",

    "Fitch put Sri Lanka\u2019s long term foreign currency rating (the Issuer Default Rating) at RD in May 2022 after coupon payment was missed.",
    "\u201cWe may move the IDR out of \u2018RD\u2019 upon the sovereign\u2019s completion of a commercial debt restructuring that we judge to have normalised the relationship with the international financial community,\u201d Fitch said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign bonds and also a loan from China Development Bank has been classified as commercial debt.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s post-default rating would depend upon our assessment of its credit profile,\u201d the rating agency said.",
    "\u201cFitch upgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to \u2018CCC-\u2018 in September 2023, reflecting the completion of the local-currency portion of Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt optimisation plan.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s debt to GDP ratio is expected to be high under an IMF projection but so far tax revenues are picking up strongly.",
    "Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-09 October 2024: The Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 confirmation that they endorse the targets set under the country\u2019s IMF programme, and intend to implement debt restructuring based on the terms agreed with international sovereign bondholders in September, reduces risks to the debt treatment process associated with the outcome of the presidential election on 21 September, says Fitch Ratings.",
    "The election of Anura Kumara Dissanayake, of the opposition Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as president in September had increased policy uncertainty, raising the risk that the government could launch challenges to key elements of the IMF programme, potentially delaying Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign-currency debt restructuring. However, the Ministry of Finance announced on 4 October that consultations with the IMF and Sri Lanka\u2019s Official Credit Committee had been successfully concluded, suggesting that any policy changes are unlikely to threaten the IMF programme or the debt treatment agreement-in-principle reached under the previous administration.",
    "The Ministry also indicated that the consultation had agreed that the preliminary agreement adhered to the principle of comparability of treatment between official creditors and bondholders, and was compatible with the IMF programme\u2019s terms. We view this as a positive sign for the restructuring process\u2019s prospects.",
    "Fitch has rated Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at \u2018RD\u2019 (Restricted Default) since May 2022, and the government is not currently servicing its foreign-currency debt. We may move the IDR out of \u2018RD\u2019 upon the sovereign\u2019s completion of a commercial debt restructuring that we judge to have normalised the relationship with the international financial community.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s post-default rating would depend upon our assessment of its credit profile. Fitch upgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to \u2018CCC-\u2018 in September 2023, reflecting the completion of the local-currency portion of Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt optimisation plan.",
    "We expect Sri Lanka\u2019s government debt to remain relatively high, even if debt restructuring is completed successfully along the lines laid out in the agreements with its creditors. The IMF forecasts Sri Lanka\u2019s gross general government debt/GDP ratio to decline only gradually to about 103% of GDP by 2028, from about 116% in 2022, after building in a local- and foreign-currency debt restructuring."
