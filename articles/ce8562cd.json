    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized his commitment to building a robust economic framework that ensures long-term stability for future generations, steering away from short-term solutions that could risk economic collapse. He made these remarks today (13) during the inauguration of the state-of-the-art swimming pool at the Anuradhapura Central College.",
    "Reflecting on past economic and political crises, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the necessity of a national-level political apparatus capable of strategic governance beyond the five year electoral cycles. He underscored the need for governance focused not merely on short-term power dynamics but on sustainable national development.",
    "During the ceremony, President Wickremesinghe inaugurated the state-of-the-art swimming pool and engaged with students participating in various activities. He also formally handed over the swimming pool premises to the Anuradhapura Central College and congratulated students who excelled in the 2023 GCE Advanced Level Examination, personally acknowledging their achievements.",
    "Principal Mr. Percy Mahanama presented a donation of Rs. 10,000 to the President\u2019s Fund, contributed by the students of the Anuradhapura Central College, as a token of appreciation.",
    "The Government, along with support from the Alumni Association, has contributed to the construction of this swimming pool, providing your school with a valuable addition. This school, where the educational reforms initiated by Mr. C. W. W. Kannangara began in the North Central Province, holds the distinction of being its first Madhya Maha Vidyalaya.",
    "Since then, the school has made significant strides. The principal has requested a three-storied building, and I will personally notify the Ministry of Education to facilitate its construction.",
    "As we approach the 77th anniversary of the college and celebrate the completion of the swimming pool, I am pleased to announce that the President\u2019s office is actively working towards establishing a fully-equipped fitness center for the college.",
    "During a student\u2019s speech on behalf of the school, the aspiration for a better future was prominently expressed. This aspiration is both reasonable and timely, especially considering recent years. It is imperative that we strategize on how to build this envisioned future.",
    "By averting bankruptcy, we have achieved our first milestone. However, continuing with the current economic trajectory risks accumulating unsustainable levels of debt, jeopardizing the future these students aspire to. In the next 15 years, we could potentially face a severe economic crisis unless we chart a sustainable course forward.",
    "As a nation, we must decide whether to advance or risk economic collapse once more. Considering that you will reside here for at least another 50 years, our focus as a government should extend beyond 2050 and aim towards securing prosperity by 2075.",
    "Therefore, we are planning to transition our country\u2019s economy from one reliant on imports to one driven by exports. This necessitates a fundamental overhaul of our existing economic structures, for which we have introduced the Economic Transformation Act.",
    "Central to this transformation is the agricultural modernization program, crucial for revitalizing our economy. Thanks to the dedication of our farmers, who received essential fertilizer support, we achieved successful harvests in 2022, 2023, and 2024. In recognition of their contributions, we launched the inheritance tax exemption program, benefiting farmers across the North Central Province.",
    "Looking ahead, the global population is projected to increase by an additional 2 billion by 2050, necessitating a focus on utilizing modern technology to maximize agricultural output and ensure food security worldwide. From these arid regions, we aim to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production, which will drive economic prosperity in Anuradhapura, Dambulla, and Vavuniya.",
    "Furthermore, these provinces possess significant potential for solar energy projects and tourism development. Embracing innovation, we are embarking on ambitious initiatives such as the Trincomalee port development project in collaboration with India, which will also benefit Anuradhapura.",
    "In line with our forward-thinking approach, plans are underway to establish three new technological universities, supported by foreign institutions offering technical expertise. Embracing advancements in artificial intelligence, we are poised to chart a new course towards a prosperous future.",
    "As we navigate this transformative journey, it is imperative to continuously reassess and innovate for sustained growth and development.",
    "Some politicians focus solely on gaining power for a five-year term or on ousting their rivals from office. This narrow approach to politics has historically led to economic and political crises in our country.",
    "Through collaboration across political divides, I successfully revitalized the national economy. This effort marked the establishment of a national-level thinking group for the first time in our history. Such a system is crucial for our future, transcending partisan interests to prioritize the nation\u2019s well-being.",
    "Regardless of political affiliation, it is essential that every representative prioritizes the nation\u2019s interests. Our collective success as a nation hinges on the decisions we make in the coming years. Therefore, I urge everyone to focus on the future and work towards our shared prosperity.",
    "Today marks a significant milestone as the swimming pool of this school, which holds a special place in Anuradhapura, is handed over to the students. The completion of this project faced challenges amidst recent turbulent conditions in the country. However, following successful economic stabilization efforts led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, funding was secured to finalize its construction. Under the President\u2019s strategic initiatives, comprehensive measures were implemented to advance the nation\u2019s economic recovery while restoring stability.",
    "Through effective decision-making and a partnership with the International Monetary Fund, the government swiftly restored both the economy and livelihoods. President Wickremesinghe continues to spearhead reforms aimed at safeguarding the economy from future collapses, with new legislation and programs already underway. Concurrently, transformative initiatives are enhancing infrastructure across education, healthcare, and the broader economy, fostering a brighter outlook for the nation\u2019s future.",
    "The ceremony was attended by North Central Province Governor Mahipala Herath, Members of Parliament S.M. Chandrasena, Duminda Dissanayake, Rohana Bandara, former Minister P. Harrison, former Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith, Anuradhapura Central College Principal Mr. Percy Mahanama, members of the staff, parents, alumni, and students."
