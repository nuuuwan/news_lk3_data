### Republicans win majority of US House seats, giving Donald Trump and party control of govt

Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the partyтАЩs sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.

A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.

With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement TrumpтАЩs vision for the country.

The incoming president has promised to carry out the countryтАЩs largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal governmentтАЩs most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.

One of the key happenings in human history, is the so-called тАЬIndustrial Revolution,тАЭ that originated about two centuries ago, with Europe, North America and Japan, as the focal points. These are now broadly defined as тАЬDeveloped Countries.тАЭ They distinguish themselves as having higher per capita incomes, and thereby offering their citizens better living conditions than do the тАЭDevelopingтАЭ or тАЬLess developedтАЭ ones.

It is tempting yet erroneous, to believe that what prevailed two centuries ago, can be transposed today to other countries including Sri Lanka, presently classified among the тАЬDeveloping countries.тАЭ

Typically, the industrial era manifested as a movement away from labour and towards machinery driven enterprises. The unspoken assumption Is that what worked for them then, should do for us now.

The high-level threat area had extended across Sri LankaтАЩs southeastern coast as far as the town of Hikkaduwa.

The rest of the island nation was lowered from level three тАФ moderate тАФ to level two.

The NSC says the threat level is being updated from level 4 (high) in the southwest of the country and level 3 (moderate) in the rest of Sri Lanka, to level 2 (an occasional threat) for the entire country.

The NSC says Israeli travelers should alert local security forces if there are any hostilities toward Jews or Israelis, and cautions against wearing Jewish or Israeli symbols.

### IHP says General Election voting intent estimates uncertain due  to substantial response bias

SLOTS polling of voter intent conducted by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) since the Presidential Election through 8 November has suffered from an increased level of response bias.

тАЬThis has been due to respondentsтАЩ over-reporting support for the NPP. This has resulted in large uncertainty and a significant bias in favour of the NPP in the resulting vote intent estimates,тАЭ said IHP in a statement.

тАЬNonetheless, we are releasing estimates based on these polling data in the interests of transparency. We advise that these estimates are likely to be associated with a large margin of error, and caution should be taken when interpreting them. As with any opinion poll, they should not be regarded as a prediction of the final election result,тАЭ it added.

### Relieving Tired Eyes

*2024-11-13 23:37:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/relieving-tired-eyes/) ┬╖ `en`

Steep two tea bags (black or green tea) in a mug of boiled water for 02 to 04 minutes and then remove the tea bags, and press out the excess water from the bags.

Let the tea bags cool slowly at room temperature or chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

Your cold brew might give you a refreshing jolt, but a caffeine fix for the skin can also help calm blotchiness or swelling.

Start by freezing some brewed coffee in an ice cube tray. Once the coffee ice is ready, spend a few minutes gently rubbing an ice cube: under your eyes, along your brows, across the bridge of your nose, and from the outer corners of your eyes to your temples

Place the slices over your closed eyes for about 15 minutes.

As an alternative, try cold spoons. They can help constrict blood vessels and reduce areas of under-eye darkness.

This election is expected to be a defining moment for Sri Lanka, with outcomes that could significantly impact its political and economic trajectory in the coming years тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The upcoming General elections in Sri Lanka are pivotal, given the countryтАЩs complex political and economic landscape. Several key factors are shaping expectations for the outcome.

First, economic challenges remain a critical concern. Sri LankaтАЩs economic recovery from a severe debt crisis and inflation surge has been slow, with many citizens still experiencing financial hardship. This context has led to frustration with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as many view its policies as ineffective in alleviating economic pressures. This dissatisfaction may boost Opposition parties like the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP), who have gained traction with promises of economic reforms and anti-corruption measures.

### TrumpтАЩs triumph: American Revolution/counter-revolution and world order

President Trump actually thought that Kamala Harris, a feminist progressive-liberal, was a тАЬradical-leftist, Marxist, Socialist, CommunistтАЭ.

The Trump administration and a Republican Senate are going to regard a JVP-NPP regime in the Indian Ocean headed by JVP leader Anura Dissanayake, pale-pink NPP frill, crony corporate d├йcor and all, differently from the way a Democrat White House and Senate did.

The multidimensional triumph of Donald Trump is an outcome I hardly applaud, but as a political scientist and former diplomat, I cannot fail to note its magnitude, even epic character, and respect the political achievement.

Was it a counter-revolution or a revolution? Critics would argue the former; fans, the latter. It is like those two-dimensional pictures we had as postcards or key-tags when we were schoolkids. It all depends on which side you tilt it; which angle you view it from.

A strong educational foundation is one of the most powerful investments we can make in our childrenтАЩs future. In 2023, data from the Department of Census and Statistics revealed that over 3.88 million children were enrolled across 9,103 government schools, while over 137,869 attended private institutions. These young learners, aged 6 to 18, represent the promise of our nationтАЩs future, and supporting their educational journey is crucial for building a brighter and a more prosperous tomorrow.
