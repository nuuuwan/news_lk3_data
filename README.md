We are living in an era where nature pleadingly seeks human support for its survival and sustainability.

Since the spillover effects of these sustainability issues tend to pose a greater threat to the present as well as future generations, it is high time that the present youth understand the importance of being active as well as proactive in tackling this issue strategically.

While he was brilliant in his studies, Amal was always one to experience things to explore, be exposed to different cultures and was in no way someone who enjoyed being buried with his books! But his intelligence and abilities ensured he got his undergraduate degree at LSE and returned to Sri Lanka whilst we in Colombo had barely completed our A’ Levels at Royal

Amal leaves behind him a masterclass in humility, caring, devotion and passion

23 July 2024 marked one year since my friend Amal’s untimely demise. For those who knew Amal, he was a deeply private person. Amal was not guarded with his privacy because he was necessarily shy or not social – he was just a very private person and what mattered to him was caring for the people he loved. He was a man content with the hand that life had dealt him and was never one to trumpet his own achievements.

### Child’s guide to debt and debt restructuring: Part IV

*2024-07-29 00:56:41* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Child-s-guide-to-debt-and-debt-restructuring-Part-IV/4-764832) · `en`

In the case of bilateral credit, the overall debt level has not come down but only the payment terms have been eased

What Sri Lanka has got is a relief on the annual cashflow till 2027 by way of a debt moratorium. But for Sri Lanka to get full relief, it is necessary for the country to get a fair amount of the principal loans as the debt forgiven by the creditors. This is known as a haircut. Considering the gap in the foreign exchange receipts and payments during 2022-27, IMF had anticipated a debt forgiveness of about $ 14 billion which amounted to about 51% of the total debt to be restructured. Hence, Sri Lanka should get a haircut of about 51% if it is to resolve its foreign debt problem permanently

Aseni and Sarath Mahatthaya have been continuing their interactive conversation on Sri Lanka’s debt and the process involving the debt restructuring to facilitate the country to get into debt sustainability, a requirement under the ongoing Extended Fund Facility or EFF from IMF.
