  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court dismissed a fundamental rights petition filed by former Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Senior DIG and current Public Security Ministry Secretary Ravi Seneviratne.",
    "The petition sought a declaration that Seneviratne\u2019s fundamental rights were violated when he was arrested and remanded by the Wellawatte Police in connection with a road accident.",
    "The case was heard before a three-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justices S. Thurairaja, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, and Priyantha Fernando.",
    "Deputy Solicitor General Disna Warnakula, representing the respondents, raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the petition did not comply with Supreme Court rules. Based on this objection, the Court ruled that the petition could not be maintained and subsequently dismissed it.",
    "The Inspector General of Police (IGP), the Attorney General, the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Wellawatte Police Station, and other officers were named as respondents in the case.",
    "Seneviratne\u2019s arrest occurred on 28 October 2023, following a road accident within the Wellawatte Police Division. He was later produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate\u2019s Court and remanded.",
    "In his petition, Seneviratne claimed that placing him in remand custody when bail was legally possible constituted a violation of his fundamental rights. However, the Supreme Court, after considering the arguments, upheld the preliminary objection and dismissed the case."
