    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects to work under Sri Lanka\u2019s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and said it will discuss the timing of the third review of its ongoing economic reform under a 48-month loan.",
    "Sri Lanka has committed a raft of economic reforms including increasing tax revenue and restructuring of state-owned enterprises.",
    "Dissananayake\u2019s Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has pledged to renegotiate the IMF deal citing it has led to some unbearable difficulties for common people.",
    "\u201cWe look forward to working together with President Dissanayake and his team towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery since entering one of its worst economic crises in 2022,\u201d an IMF spokesperson said in a statement.",
    "\u201cWe welcome the announcement of an agreement in principle between Sri Lanka and international bondholders\u2019 representatives, subject to confirmation on comparability of treatment by Sri Lanka\u2019s Official Creditors Committee,\u201d the spokesperson said referring to the last week announcement by former leader Ranil Wickremesinghe on successful agreement in principle with commercial creditors including international sovereign bond (ISB) holders on debt restructuring.",
    "\u201cThis represents significant progress in Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring process.\u201d",
    "The IMF had earlier scheduled the third review of its $3 billion, 48-month bailout package in October this year.",
    "However, economists have said a discussion between the IMF and the Dissanayake\u2019s new administration has to take place before agreeing on a new schedule, with possible risks of some delay in the disbursement of the fourth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).",
    "Originally, the fourth tranche was scheduled for December this year after the completion of the third review.",
    "\u201cWe will discuss the timing of the third review of the IMF-supported program with the new administration as soon as practicable,\u201d the IMF Spokesperson said. (Colombo/September 24/2024)"
