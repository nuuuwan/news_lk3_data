    "The number of active credit cards rose to 1,928,378 by the end August this year from 1,917,085 by the end of last year.",
    "Active credit cards in Sri Lanka have fell nearly 2 percent or 35,655 in the first eight months of last year.",
    "Analysts said Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery and stability have helped customers to use more credit cards than last year.",
    "The number of active credit cards fell to 1,917,336 by the end August 2023 from 1,952,991 by the end of 2022, the central bank data showed.",
    "Some analysts said higher interest (penalty) rates on credit cards also would have prompted some users to cancel their cards in the last year and the same customers might be actively using the cards now.",
    "The central bank spiked the interest rates sharply in April 2022 to fight against a hyperinflation. However, the inflation has now slowed to a deflation last month after the central bank reduced its key policy rates six times since June 2023. (Colombo/October 12/2024)"
