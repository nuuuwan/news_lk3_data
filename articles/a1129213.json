    "(Chandani Kirinde traces the close friendship between Emperor Asoka and King Devanampiyatissa that led to the introduction of Buddhism to this land)",
    "India\u2019s Emperor Asoka and King Devanampiyatissa of Lanka never met in person, but their long-distance friendship paved the way for the introduction of the teachings of Lord Buddha to this island nearly 2,000 years ago.",
    "Their friendship had begun many years before Arahant Mahinda stepped on Mihintale rock and delivered the first Buddhist sermon to King Devanampiyatissa, the epoch-making event in the country\u2019s history which is commemorated on Poson Poya day each year.",
    "Much of what we know of the connection between the Emperor Asoka who ruled from Pataliputra (present day Patna in the state of Bihar in India) and King Devanampiyatissa who ruled from Anuradhapura is derived mainly from the two ancient Lankan chronicles, the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa, the same sources that many historians turn to for clues on their relationship.",
    "Some writers have compared them to pen pals, others describe them as allies brought together by common strategic interests while others call it a predestined friendship that would make them the greatest patrons of Buddhism in the world.",
    "\u2018These two monarchs, Dewananpiatisso and Dammasoko, though they were not personally known to each other, were united by the ties of friendship, from a long  period,\u201d according to the Mahavamsa. However, there is no clarity on when this friendship started.",
    "Given the growing influence of Emperor Asoka particularly after his conquest of Kalinga after a protracted war, it is likely the word of his prowess on the battlefield had reached far and wide beyond the region of his conquests.",
    "We hear of the first direct contact between the two men when in the 18th year of the reign of Emperor Asoka around 236 B.C, Tissa, the second son of King Mutasiva, is crowned king following his father\u2019s death after a reign of 60 years. It is said that on the day of his coronation, many miraculous phenomena took place throughout Lanka with riches, precious metals and gems buried in the earth rising to the surface produced by the virtue of the piety of the newly crowned king, according to the Mahavamsa.",
    "On seeing these precious items, the Lankan King decided that his friend Asoka, and no one else, was worthy of these treasures and decided to send a delegation to take the wondrous gifts to the Indian ruler. The mission was led by his maternal nephew Maha Arittha. The Lankan delegation carried with them three kinds of gems, three royal palanquin poles, a right hand chank, and eight \u2018descriptions\u2019 of pearls.",
    "The journey had taken them seven days by sea and then another seven days by land to reach Pataliputra. They were well received in the court of Emperor Asoka who rejoiced on seeing them and these articles, and consulted his own ministers to decide on the proper presents to be sent in return.",
    "According to the Mahavamsa, the return gifts were to facilitate a second coronation of the Lankan ruler and included a sword of state, a royal parasol,  (golden) slippers, a head ornament (crown), a golden anointing vase, a right hand chank containing water ( to be used at  the  inauguration  of  the  king) from  the stream of  the Ganges, a royal virgin of great  personal  charms, 160 loads of hill paddy  which had been  brought by parrots and a complete  suite  of  royal  attendants.",
    "However, the most precious gift the Lankan delegation was given to take back with them was the gift  of  pious advice. \u201cI have taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha; I have declared myself a lay disciple in the religion of the Sakya son. Seek then even thou, O best of men, converting thy mind, with believing heart, refuge in these best of gems.\u201d",
    "Having resided in Pataliputra for five  months, the Lankan mission departed with word from Emperor Asoka to solemnize the inauguration of his ally, King Tissa at a second coronation which took place on a full moon day of Vesak. After this coronation Tissa added the title Devanampiya, meaning the  delight or the beloved of the Devas or Gods. This was a royal title that even Asoka had adopted.",
    "In the University History of Ceylon publication (1961), S. Paranavitana in his article on \u2018The rise of Buddhism in India and its introduction to Ceylon\u2019 stated that before Tissa there was no royal consecration in Ceylon, and the fact that Tissa and his successors bore the title of Devanampiya, by which Asoka also refers to himself in his inscriptions, indicates the purpose of Tissa of sending the mission to the Mauryan court was for obtaining the consent and the support of the Indian potentate for his assumption of regal status, which his predecessors did not enjoy.",
    "Just a month after the second consecration of the Lankan ruler, Mahinda Thera arrived on the island. According to the Mahavamsa, the meeting between Mahinda and Tissa took place at Missaka-pabbata now Mihintale, the sacred hill eight miles east of Anuradhapura, on the full moon day of Poson (May /June). There Mahinda Thera preached the Dhamma to Tissa, and the king with his retinue took refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and Sangha.",
    "\u201cDevanampiyatissa who had already heard of Buddhism from his friend Asoka received the Buddhist mission with the greatest kindness and regard,\u201d  Venerable Walpola Rahula Thera said in his book \u2018The History of Buddhism in Sri Lanka\u2019.",
    "On his meeting the King, Mahinda first put several questions to him to gauge if Devanampiyatissa had the intelligence to understand the teachings of the Buddha and once convinced the Lankan ruler had the necessary prerequisite, proceeded to at once preach the \u201cChulahaththipadopama Sutta\u201d to him and his retinue.",
    "\u201cThe selection of this sutta by Mahinda for his first sermon was very appropriate. The sutta gives a clear idea of the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha and also contains almost all the principal teachings of the Buddha, such as the Four Noble Truths. Apart from general knowledge of Buddhism, it was necessary for Mahinda to convey to his host who knew nothing about Buddhist practice, an idea of the Sangha and their mode of life, so that the king might learn how to treat his new guests. At the end of the sermon, Devanampiyatissa and his retinue expressed their willingness to embrace the new faith,\u201d Ven. Rahula wrote.",
    "According to a compilation of Historical and Literary Studies on King Asoka and Buddhism edited by Professor Anuradha Seneviratne, Asoka\u2019s personal commitment to Buddhism and the royal  patronage which he extended to it doubtless helped to establish it in various parts of the subcontinent and in  neighbouring countries. The association with Sri Lanka however was not only personal but very close, both in the sending of Mahinda and in his relations with Devanampiyatissa.",
    "\u201cThe mission sent by Asoka to Sri Lanka is unique among his initiatives as the only one of which a full account is available and for its lasting results which are nothing less than the conversion of that country to Buddhism. In no other country to which missions were sent were the results so spectacular or lasting,\u201d writes V.L.B.Mendis, in his book,\u2019 Foreign Relations of Sri Lanka ( From earliest times to 1965).",
    "Today, Asoka and Tissa are distant historical figures but their unique bond paved the way for the introduction of the teachings of Lord Buddha to the island of Lanka, where it remains entrenched firmly, more than 2000 years after Mahinda Thera preached his first sermon at Mihintal"
