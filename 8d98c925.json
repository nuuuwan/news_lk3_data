    "The United National Party (UNP) will effect major changes to its constitution at its special convention scheduled for October 21 similar to the reforms introduced way back in 1978, party\u2019s chairman MP Wajira Abeywardena said.",
    "He said that the Special Convention will be conducted at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo, at 2p.m.",
    "He said it is needed to initiate significant changes in the Party Constitution, to accommodate necessary political change.",
    "\u201cThe Party\u2019s Constitution underwent similar changes during 1978 when the Executive Presidency was introduced. It was thereby included in the Party\u2019s Constitution that \u201cIf a United National Party Member becomes the President of Sri Lanka he will be the Leader of the Party.\u201dThis was included so that national policies could be implemented simultaneously with the Party policies. This is a stance which is followed by many countries in the world including Japan, where the leader of the Party which gains the most votes in Parliament is appointed to a significant position in the government in accordance with the Constitution.",
    "A new Constitution was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1978, along with a new UNP Constitution. The Party Constitution was changed again 1987,as late President Premadasa changed both the country\u2019s Constitution as well as the Party\u2019s Constitution. In 1987, the Constitution introduced three preferential votes to candidates at an election. The voters were given significant choice in selecting their political leaders. However, this has had a drastic effect on our political system, as the voters were divided according to race as Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. This has led to our downfall as a nation.",
    "This Convention is being held at such a crucial juncture in our country\u2019s political history, and it is held with the aim of providing necessary security to all races. President Ranil Wickremesinghe upon assuming duties as President stated that he is not here to serve the interests of one political party, but to serve the interests of 22 million of the population. As President Ranil Wickremesinghe is following on that uphill journey, the UNP too, must follow suit. Thereby, the Party Convention which is to be held on the 21st of October 2023 must allow the voices of the Sri Lankan youth to be heard along with the technological advancement of the times,\u201d he said."
