    "At a time when the impression gained ground among Western publics in particular that the Far Right was proving popular among some sections in their midst, the centre-Left has scored notable electoral triumphs in two of the West\u2019s most vibrant democracies; the UK and France. This is satisfactory proof of the resilience and fight-back capabilities of the Left.",
    "This demonstration of the Left\u2019s effectiveness needs to be welcomed by progressive opinion the world over. Considering that governance by the Far Right could mostly mean fascism and repression of publics anywhere, it is probably with a sense of relief that pro-democracy sections would be receiving the news that the Left is far from being a spent force in the most major of Western democracies.",
    "While the Labour Party in Britain has scored a memorable landslide victory in the recent parliamentary election under Keir Starmer, the British Prime Minister-elect, the New Popular Front (NFP) coalition in France under Jean-Luc Melenchon, has declared that it is \u2018ready to govern\u2019 after having won the majority of seats in the second round of France\u2019s recent elections to the 577-seat National Assembly.",
    "The latter gain is particularly impressive in view of the fact that Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-Right National Rally party and its allies were expected to sweep the poll and easily form France\u2019s next government. While no party or coalition has won a clear majority in France\u2019s poll, it accrues to the benefit of French democracy that the relevant political actors would now be compelled to negotiate among themselves, engage in mutual accommodation where possible and go on to form a coalition government that would win wide acceptance.",
    "Current political developments in Britain and France would need to be watched closely by democratic opinion and ruling elites in particularly the global South. Since the early nineties, most political elites of the South have been enamoured of the free enterprise system, or \u2018market economics\u2019, and capitalist-led \u2018development\u2019.",
    "That is, they have favoured in the main a Rightist economic agenda. Some of them have also favoured power centralization, populist and authoritarian governance. For these sections, the UK\u2019s electoral results should prove an eye-opener.",
    "Of course, Britain has not trod the path of authoritarian governance in modern times but Conservative party rule in the country has meant in the main capitalist-led \u2018development\u2019 and governance that has generally veered away from social welfarism.",
    "Some essential public services in the country continue to be dispensed by the state, but Conservative rule over the past decade and more has plunged Britain into an economic crisis of considerable magnitude.",
    "For example, it has been established by independent sources that Britain has seen \u2018the worst income growth for generations\u2019 under Conservative rule. The country\u2019s GDP per capita has reportedly grown by just 4.3 percent from 2007 to 2023. This is the lowest growth since 1826, we are told. Inflation levels, meanwhile, had reached a 41-year high of 11.1 percent in October 2022, it is learnt.",
    "While such economic data alone reflects the drastic material regression suffered by Britain over the years, it also projects the enormity of the challenges the present Labour government would be saddled with. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, however, has highlighted equal distribution of economic growth and wealth in Britain, as one of his priorities, and this is the way to go.",
    "Meanwhile, the steady rise of the Far-Right in France and other European countries, ought to pinpoint to Southern democratic sections in particular the urgent need to contain fundamentalisms of all kinds. Unresolved issues arising from a high Southern migrant presence in countries, such as France, Italy and Germany, constitute the fertile ground for the rise of the Far Right in those countries, since the political Right in the West generally feeds off xenophobia and the demonizing of ethnic, religious and cultural minorities.",
    "Basically, it is economic disaffection among majority communities, whether they be of the North or the South, which facilitates the rise of the Right. Economic inequalities, for instance, are exploited by the political forces of the Right to damn minority communities as being responsible for the material ills suffered by majority communities. Thus is born racism and xenophobia. Out of these phenomena grow law-and-order issues and criminality.",
    "Thus, fundamentally, it is economic equality that would help lay the foundation for social peace. In this undertaking the political Left could prove invaluable, since it is mainly on a social democratic basis that equality and re-distributive justice could be ushered. Thus, the Left in the UK and France have their work cut out.",
    "Meanwhile, the election of Masoud Pezeshkian, described as a reformist, as President of Iran augurs well for the latter and the Middle East region. It is hoped that social reform will figure high in Pezeshkian\u2019s list of priorities and that the Iranian state would be rid of some of its paternalistic features that have resulted in some Iranian women believing that they have been wrongly treated by their ruling elite. The more than occasional protests by Iran\u2019s women constitute one proof of this.",
    "Iran must be allowed by the West in particular to develop along policy parameters of its choice, but it ought to be all too clear to the Iranian people that constant friction with the West cannot provide for them enduring, trouble-free wellbeing.",
    "Pezeshkian has been described as favouring better ties with the West and he could put his presidency to good use by exploring as to how \u2018opening-up to the West\u2019 could usher in better times for Iranians. However, this does not mean that Iran should capitulate to unfair Western requirements. But a relaxing of Western economic sanctions, for instance, could do Iran considerable good.",
    "The new Iranian President faces the difficult challenge of keeping Iran on a reformist track while sharing governing functions with a political establishment that is fundamentally theocratic in character. This would demand some flexibility on his part but the President could leverage his current popular backing to take Iran some distance from its Rightist, theocratic mould. The President would need to constantly expand his popular base by dialoguing with his people, ascertaining their just aspirations and working steadily towards their realization.",
