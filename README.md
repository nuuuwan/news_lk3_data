### SWRD, JR et al, tradition or mythology?

*2024-11-01 06:06:42* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/SWRD-JR-et-al-tradition-or-mythology/4-768688) ¬∑ `en`

‚ÄúOh little monk, it is an arduous path you are taking‚Ä¶‚Äù on Martin Luther‚Äôs decision to challenge the papacy.

‚ÄúThe tradition of all the dead generations weighs like an incubus upon the brain of the living‚Äù

As the common saying goes ‚ÄòSuccess has many fathers but failure is an orphan‚Äô. And, in recent times, no other political career has been as successful as that of President Anura Kumar Dissanayake.

Hailing from rural Thambuttegama, with no pretension to so called Sri Lankan elite status, member of a putatively Marxist political party (an ideology seemingly out of step with the modern world in many aspects) and having received only about 3% of the general vote at the Presidential elections in 2019, Dissanayake yet won an emphatic approval from the voter in September 2024. His closest rival was more than a million votes behind. Prominent politicians, heralded for decades, would have turned green with envy contemplating the Dissanayake success.

*2024-11-01 06:01:03* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-blame-game/4-768687) ¬∑ `en`

Voters appear to prefer the blame game, pointing to anyone other than themselves

Over the past two years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to talk to many people across the country about what ails this land. On these occasions, I‚Äôve always talked about what we as citizens have done (rewarded politicians who fostered the giveaway culture) and not done (failed to exercise any oversight in the time between elections). Almost always I get significant pushback. A common refrain is ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt get fuel and electricity for free; we can‚Äôt be blamed for the fiscal deficit.‚Äù Citizens are blameless; the leaders are.

### Reforming governance heralds system change

What lessons could the young generation learn from these oldies who with

After reviewing the economy‚Äôs performance during the first two years of its stewardship, IMF noted that without reforming governance, economic stability and economic growth would be slow and shaky. Although a noticeable measure of economic stability had been achieved the reviewers noted that growth prospect was still at knife‚Äôs edge. But even before IMF stepped into the scene the Aragalaya youth already identified the fundamental sickness that was debilitating the economy for decades and that sickness was bad governance.

An ethnonational majoritarian political culture with little or no room for meritocracy became the breeding ground for nepotism and corruption. That culture built a socio-economic and political system which in the end bankrupted the national treasury and along with it the national economy. Hence, the dire need for system change.

Some of the luxury vehicles used by previous administrations parked in Colombo ‚Äì File photo

Do we need to rethink strategies for transport in ministries and State departments?

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake recently made an announcement on LinkedIn which said, ‚ÄúAdvised to allocate luxury vehicles by previous administrations to essential services.‚Äù It seems there is a huge question and dilemma as to what needs to be done with these white elephant vehicles, which are high maintenance assets the Government is currently burdened with.

There were a host of comments following the President‚Äôs post. Since the post was on LinkedIn, a cross section of professionals were seen taking part in this conversation. Someone suggested, it might be beneficial to auction some of these locally to those who can afford luxury and upkeep. The funds could then be directed toward acquiring better, more fuel-efficient vehicles, possibly even performance hybrids to help reduce emissions.

Following is a letter from the Frontline Socialist Party, to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, on the DDR and the risk of moving towards becoming a failed State.

Through the results of the last Presidential election, the people of Sri Lanka have led the corrupt political forces that existed so far to a crucial defeat and opened the country to a new political journey through a Government of the National People‚Äôs Power. This is the result of the people‚Äôs struggle that unfolded throughout the recent past and a large propaganda intervention that influenced public opinion.

The capital, New Delhi, which is among India‚Äôs worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali.

### Anurakumara Dissanayake and the creation of the national people's power

*2024-10-31 13:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197579) ¬∑ `ta`

Based on the detailed historical and political analysis provided, here are the key points regarding the JVP and its evolution:



1. The JVP initially pursued revolutionary violence but shifted towards democratic methods after the armed conflicts in 1971 and 1988-90.



2. In the 2015 parliamentary election, the JVP received 543,944 votes (4.8%) and won six seats.



3. The party contested alone in 2015 instead of joining an opposition coalition.



4. In the 2018 local government elections, the JVP received 693,875 votes (6.27%) but failed to capture any councils.



5. The JVP formed the National People's Power alliance in 2019, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.



6. In the 2019 presidential election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake received 418,563 votes (3.15%) as the National People's Power candidate.



7. In the 2020 parliamentary election, the National People's Power received 445,958 votes (3.84%), winning three seats.



8. Despite efforts to increase its vote bank, the JVP has struggled to overcome its status as the third political power in Sri Lanka.



9. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been instrumental in changing the electoral strategy and enriching his political image within the party.



10. The JVP continues to maintain its independence and does not want to form coalitions or alliances with other parties, preferring to lead as an equal partner.



The analysis suggests that while the JVP has made some progress in recent years, it still faces challenges in increasing its vote share and electoral performance compared to the major political parties in Sri Lanka.

üü©

This is the fourth part of my article on Sri Lanka's new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

In the first part, I wrote about his gradual development in the second part of the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the second part and his rise to the JVP leadership in the third part.

The JVP led by Dissanayake in this fourth part. Let me explain how the national people's power was transformed into a party.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is an important day on February 2, 2014. It was on that day that the 17th National Conference of the JVP was held.

The change in the leadership of the party was the best of the conference. Somawansa Amarasinghe, who has been the leader of the JVP for 24 years, took over.

Anura or AKD. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, popularly known, arrived as the new leader of the JVP.

It was generally revealed before the conference that Somawansa is going to retire from the post of Chairman.
