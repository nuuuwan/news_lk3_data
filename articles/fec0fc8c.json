  "original_body_lines": [
    "On August 3, 1990, one of the darkest chapters in Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic conflict unfolded when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) carried out a brutal massacre at the Kattankudy Mosque in Eastern Province. Over 147 Muslim worshipperswere mercilessly gunned down while offering their prayers in what remains one of the most horrific attacks against the Muslim community in Sri Lanka.",
    "That evening, as devout Muslims gathered for Isha prayers, LTTE militants stormed the mosque and opened fire indiscriminately. The attackers showed no mercy\u2014men, elderly worshippers, and even young boys were slaughtered in cold blood. Survivors recounted scenes of unimaginable terror as the militants ensured no one escaped alive. The massacre was part of a broader campaign of ethnic cleansing by the LTTE, which sought to expel Muslims from areas they claimed as part of a Tamil homeland.",
    "The LTTE, fighting for an independent Tamil state, viewed Muslims as obstacles to their goal. In 1990, they forcibly expelled over 75,000 Muslims from the Northern Province and carried out systematic attacks against Muslim villages in the East. The Kattankudy massacre was a calculated act of terror to instill fear and drive Muslims out of the region.",
    "For Sri Lankan Muslims, August 3rd is a day of mourning and remembrance. While the teachings of Islam emphasize forgiveness, the pain of such brutality cannot be erased from memory. The survivors and families of the victims continue to live with the trauma, and the massacre remains a stark reminder of the consequences of ethnic hatred.",
    "Here is a polished English translation of your Tamil text, maintaining its gravity and nuanced questioning while using formal, precise language:",
    "These massacres continue to raise profound doubts for us today.",
    "In the Eastern Province, at a time when Tamil militant groups \u2014some maintaining close ties with the government military, STF, and state intelligence units, and others actively opposing the LTTE \u2014had surrounded Kattankudy, how did the LTTE bypass all these factions and security forces, enter the Kattankudy mosque, massacre Muslims, loot valuables, and withdraw safely?",
    "Just as I harbor serious doubts that government high officials may have indirectly assisted the LTTE in the Eastern killings of 800 police officers, equally grave suspicions arise regarding these massacres of Muslim civilians.",
    "Was this a coordinated slaughter between the then-Sri Lankan government and the LTTE? The circumstances demand rigorous investigation.",
    "Decades later, justice for the victims remains elusive. The LTTE\u2019s leadership was wiped out in 2009, but the scars of their atrocities linger. The Muslim community, while resilient, continues to seek recognition of their suffering and a commitment from all Sri Lankans to ensure such horrors are never repeated.",
    "This massacre stands as a testament to the need for reconciliation, justice, and a united Sri Lanka where no community suffers such brutality again. The memory of Kattankudy must serve as a lesson for future generations\u2014a warning against division and a call for lasting peace."
