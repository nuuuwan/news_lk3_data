  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has got the largest volume of remittances from countries with currency board like regimes which face chronic labour shortages, followed by those with a 2.0 percent inflation target, official data shows.",
    "Sri Lanka has received 157.7 million US dollars from Kuwait in the third quarter, followed by UAE with 146.9 million US dollars, Qatar 137.5 million US dollars and Saudi Arabia 134.3 million US dollars, according to central bank data.",
    "All the countries have currency board like regimes (their monetary laws have legal faults including in reserve coverage that may permit economic bureaucrats monetary independence that can trigger crises), but the provisions are generally not used due the operational framework in place.",
    "Without a true policy rate, and somewhat limited standing facilities, the countries have very low interest rates and lower levels of banking crises even when the anchor currency nation, the US, has banking collapses from activist monetary policy.",
    "The countries have low or zero income tax, limiting the ability of the state to fritter away savings of the people and corporates, leading to more investment and job creation. The countries have liberal work visas to accommodate the growth.",
    "Before the creation of the inflationist central bank in 1950, Sri Lanka had a true currency board, with no ability to destroy capital through depreciation and was a net importer of labour and outward remitter.",
    "After Saudi Arabia, the US was the next highest source of remittances at 132.4 million US dollars.",
    "The US Fed has a 2.0 percent inflation target, but can create instability through an employment mandate by printing money for growth, ignoring early inflation with various excuses (supply chain bottlenecks in the current crisis) or targeting positive inflation in periods of strong private productivity growth (housing bubble).",
    "The United Kingdom came next with 102.6 million US dollars, followed by South Korea and Italy. All three countries have 2.0 percent inflation targets, limiting the room for central banks to print money.",
    "The Maldives also has a pegged regime, with less credibility than Saudi Arabia or the UAE, triggering forex shortages from time to time.",
    "The country however has a high degree of dollarization protecting the people and savings from the monetary authority and the country continues to import labour, from countries with bad central banks like Sri Lanka.",
    "Sri Lanka has monetary instability from flexible inflation targeting and similar anchor conflicting regimes, making it impossible for some citizens to remain in their country of birth and has to go to currency board like nations with liberal visa regimes to make end meets.",
    "Some go to Western nations with tight immigration and visa regimes as boat people and through unofficial means due to high inflation and capital destruction which makes it difficult for them to live in the country.",
    "Sri  Lanka\u2019s monetary authority has now won the legal right to inflate money by 5 percent every year reducing real salaries and destroying savings, a practice that was carried out without a legal mandate to trigger currency crises in the recent past, critics have said."
