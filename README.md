### Your right to know: Why journalism and access to information matter more than ever

*2025-09-29 06:18:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Your-right-to-know-Why-journalism-and-access-to-information-matter-more-than-ever/14-782311) · `en`

Access to public information is an important resource for journalists, just as

journalists are essential vectors for enabling citizens to access information

Today is both World News Day and the International Day for Universal Access to Information – a good time to remember that if we lose our fundamental universal right to access to information, and if independent journalists lose the ability to report the facts, then our rights and democracies may vanish entirely.

Access to information is a fundamental human right empowering us all to make informed decisions, to participate in democratic processes, and hold our leaders accountable. It’s also critical for survival in a host of situations.

### Cultivating circular futures: Youth as agents of change

Empowering young people to lead in circular food systems generates ripple effects across communities, policies, and markets

On 29 September, the world marks the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste, highlighting one of humanity’s pressing paradoxes. As the global population nears 8.5 billion by 2030, we still waste 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually – enough to feed three billion people. Sri Lanka is no exception. This crisis calls for urgent action, and increasingly, young people are emerging as catalysts for change.

The traditional “take-make-use-discard” model has proved unsustainable. A shift toward circular approaches – refuse, regenerate, reuse, and redesign – is gaining global momentum. At the heart of this transformation lies a simple truth: when young people embrace circular principles, they can reshape communities and inspire wider system change.

Strengthening COPE should mean better research support, stronger audit collaboration, and continuous capacity

As someone who has been privileged to represent all three critical domains of the COPE process — as a Chairman of a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE), a Secretary of a Ministry, and as a Chair of COPE — I feel a strong sense of responsibility to express my concerns about the recent proposal put forward under Standing Order 137 by the current COPE Chair, Dr. Nishantha Samaraweera, MP (NPP).

The motion seeks to amend Standing Order 120, granting COPE the authority to directly refer its findings to law enforcement bodies such as the IGP or the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). While I appreciate the spirit of accountability that underpins the proposal, I must stress — with the full weight of my experience — that such a reform must be approached with great care, constitutional awareness, and institutional intelligence.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s budget deficit fell to 411 billion rupees in August 2025, down 55 percent from a year earlier, amid a 30.7 percent rise in taxes and slower capital expenditure, official data show.

Tax revenues grew to 3,068.5 billion rupees, from 2,348.5 billion rupees and current spending also grew by a double-digit 11.2 percent to 3,381 billion rupees.

Sri Lanka has public sector bloated by unemployed graduates and salaries eat up a large volume of taxes, though nominal wage levels fell after recent currency crises and they now have to be increased. A salary hike was given this year.

Central bank wages have been steeply increased amid criticism as it was responsible for high level of inflation and open market operations, which critics hold out as the height of unaccountability.

Central bank wages are not directly seen in the budget, but is an item that affect non-tax revenues.

### The sacrificial torch Dileepan is not related to the incident; Gajendra team is muddy on us -Ramalingam Chandrasekhar

Ramalingam Chandrasekhar, a member of the party's executive committee and minister, said the Gajendra team was muddy on us, saying that the sacrificial torch of Dileepan's commemoration on the last day of the pamphlets and the national people's power had nothing to do.

Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekhar made this statement while speaking to the media in Jaffna on Sunday (28).

Dileepan Memorial has been held for the past one week. Was blocked when we went to perform the observance there. After that a few days ago, the last day of memory ended. It was reported that someone had distributed pamphlets on that day and that the Gajendra team had dealt with their violence against him, and some others who had gone to hear justice.

The incident has nothing to do with the national people's power. There is no contribution in this. We don't have that downstream work. As a ruling party, we can take a different way if we want to take up the little ones. We do not do that iconic work.

### The road to safety: One man’s eight-year fight against mechanical negligence

*2025-09-28 23:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-road-to-safety-one-mans-eight-year-fight-against-mechanical-negligence/) · `en`

Calls for political will needed to stop the silent slaughter

In Sri Lanka, the road is deadlier than three decades of civil war. Nine lives are extinguished daily, a tragedy often silently attributed to mechanical failures that a proper vehicle inspection could prevent. For eight years, Tokyo-based entrepreneur Sajeev Rajaputhra has carried the burden of this truth, tirelessly advocating for a modern Roadworthiness Inspection System (MOT).

Rajaputhra, an automobile expert, saw the crisis not just as a national shame but as a personal call to action. His solution was comprehensive: a high-tech Public-Private Partnership (PPP) leveraging Japanese expertise, automated inspection lanes, blockchain, and AI – a system requiring zero government funds, designed to eliminate the alleged corruption that plagues current emissions checks.
