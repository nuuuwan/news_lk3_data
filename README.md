### Astronomers finally detect a rocky planet with an atmosphere

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Astronomers have searched for years for rocky planets beyond our solar system with an atmosphere - a trait considered essential for any possibility of harboring life. Well, they finally seem to have located one. But this hellish planet - apparently with a surface of molten rock - offers no hope for habitability.

Researchers said on Wednesday the planet is a "super-Earth" - a rocky world significantly larger than our planet but smaller than Neptune - and it orbits perilously close to a star dimmer and slightly less massive than our sun, rapidly completing an orbit every 18 hours or so.

Infrared observations using two instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope indicated the presence of a substantial - if inhospitable - atmosphere, perhaps continuously replenished by gases released from a vast ocean of magma.

"Digitizing customs services is crucial for reducing export costs and living expenses. Despite Sri Lanka Customs' digital progress during the pandemic, reverting to manual processes post-pandemic led to corruption, delays, and increased costs. The Global Shippers Forum President urges complete digitalization to prevent market share loss to countries offering full digital services, citing India and Bangladesh as examples."

🟩

The government must completely digitize services offered by border agents, including Sri Lanka Customs, to ensure that the cost of exports and the cost of living is to be reduced.

Although Sri Lanka's customs are steadily operating and fully digitalized services during the epidemic, the agency returned to the manual process in the post -infection period, causing corruption with delays and additional expenses.

“Continuing governments do not have the motivation and vision of going to digitalization. Each rupee that is formed at port's transportation cost will come back to you. It is sent to the customer, so the cost of living is increasing.

With this media briefing, we urge the government to implement a complete digitalization, as this is not a neglecting issue in today's global economy, ”said Global Shippers Forum President Sean Wan Dard.

He warned that Sri Lankan exporters would lose their market share in exports as other countries in the region would come up with full digital services.

Colombo, May 9 (Daily Mirror) - Coral reefs in the sea around Sri Lanka risk die-offs if the current marine heat level persists for another one month or so, a top scientist said yesterday.

The Indian media reported that an alarming situation of severe coral bleaching had been reported in the Lakshadweep Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.

Asked for a comment in this regard, newly appointed Director General of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) Dr. K.Arulananthan told Daily Mirror the heat level had increased to 31 degrees Celsius and remained for two weeks.

He said NARA did not carry out any inspection on the status of coral reefs in the island waters but bleaching could not be ruled out.

“If the heat level fluctuates between 27-28 degrees Celsius, it will be alright for coral health. However, if the current high level persists for another one month or so, coral deaths can be expected,” he said.

Though Japan has agreed to resume all the project stopped due to Sri Lanka’s unprecedented economic crisis, Tokyo has not agreed to resume the LRT after the then Japanese government went out of way to help Sri Lanka to fund the project.

“One could question whether Gamage who has been declared as a non-citizen of this country could register a political party. One could also question whether the MOU signed by SJB General Secretary with Ms.Gamage is legally valid.

Further the validity of nomination papers signed by Gamage for certain MPs is also questionable,” the Minister said.

“Some SJB MPs whom I chatted with at the House canteen informed me that they were worried about yesterday’s judgment of the Supreme Courts which ruled that Gamage cannot function as an MP as she is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.

They are concerned since they may have to give up their MP posts,” he added.

What was so deficient in the NEC’s proposal that required a new policy be prepared so urgently, and – more significantly – why did the President not direct these concerns back to the NEC, which is established and maintained by public funds for the explicit purpose of education policy formulation?

When I went to register the birth of our son, I wasn’t asked to provide our marriage certificate – the fact that a man is willing to accept paternity by putting his name down is generally accepted as proof of legitimacy.

While this patriarchal practice is discriminatory – impugning the dignity of the child, who is a human being regardless of the relationship between his or her parents – I have no qualms on employing this practice on a policy document.

### Why did Minister Tiran Alles sign  the outsourcing deal with VFS Global when there’s no rationale for outsourcing since Lankan officials have been handling on-arrival visas since 2012 without a problem.

*2024-05-09 00:54:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84000) · `en`

On every side are seen the burial ground of dreams.” Faiz Ahmed Faiz (The Subject of Poetry)

President Ranil Wickremesinghe expects Lankan rupee to appreciate further and reach 280 per dollar by June. Namal Karunaratna, a leading light of the NPP/JVP, states that rupee will start sliding soon, reaching 400-500 per dollar. He dismisses the rupee’s strong performance as a fluke caused by a recent spate of dollar loans.

Karunaratne’s analysis is wrong. The rupee is gaining mainly due to the boom in tourism and influx of foreign remittances. As some independent analysts have pointed out, the value of the rupee could fall in the second half of the year if vehicle imports are allowed. But the rupee would plunge to the depths of Karunaratne’s expectations only if the Wickremesinghe administration makes a Gotabaya-style error.

### Post-May Day political balance and scenarios

Tyrannical Tiran Alles is about to learn a lesson in politics that his distinguished, respected father would have taught him had he been around. The worst time to play tough guy is in an election year with six months max to go to vote. Citizens (including officials) are impatient to vote, and are unintimidated because they know they have the power to bring the whole power structure down soon, if they so wish.

He is attempting a witch-hunt against an articulate, courageous, mediagenic young man. He has antagonised the socially confident, sophisticated travel industry. Whatever his power (and cross-party connections), he is on a very slippery slope and may start the rockslide that takes the administration down with him.
