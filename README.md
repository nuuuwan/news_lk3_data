But it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down on the grounds that he had broken the law.

Opposition parties plan to hold an impeachment vote at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), with large demonstrations planned ahead of the vote.

Yoon’s conservative People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote a week earlier, preventing a quorum.

Since then, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon has urged party members to vote for impeachment this time, and at least seven PPP members have said they would vote to impeach.

### Rediscovering The Good In Religion This Holiday Season

*2024-12-14 07:23:22* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/rediscovering-the-good-in-religion-this-holiday-season/) · `en`

Every day, headlines are filled with words like deposed, disgraced, defrocked, or displaced—often tied to controversies involving religious authorities or the struggles of various religious groups. Even for someone like me, skeptical of religion in general, this overwhelming negativity seems suspiciously one-sided. How could something that so much of humanity believes in be reduced to nothing but conflict and failure?

Before seeking the good in religions, perhaps we must first confront where we’ve gone wrong. It seems evident that many religions have been transformed into tribal factions vying for power and dominance, losing sight of their core purpose: self-improvement, introspection, salvation, and the pursuit of higher ideals. Instead of fostering unity or moral growth, religion has often become a weapon—used to rally against perceived enemies, threaten with damnation, and fortify an “us versus them” mentality.

Despite strong tourism ties, Indian investment in Sri Lanka’s tourism sector remains cautious. “Indian investors, like their counterparts elsewhere, rely on credible data, projections, and business prudence,” Dr. Bana explains.

I have a distant memory of reading a light-hearted description of heaven and hell, in common belief an inevitable destination for all earthlings; those who lead unsullied lives are directed to the former; botch your book, the man is hightailed to hell.

These two places are obviously ‘constructs’ of the human imagination, by human standards and outlook, the ecstasies promised and the tortures threatened are not only of human concept but are also distinctly period defined (are there personal computers in either place?). There cannot be two more dissimilar destinations in the after-life, heaven is a joyous place of endless pleasures and creature comforts, while hell is all agony, suffering and torture.

### Need to safeguard people’s mandate on AKD and NPP

*2024-12-14 00:02:21* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Need-to-safeguard-people-s-mandate-on-AKD-and-NPP/4-770510) · `en`

While the domestically disgruntled political elements are looking for opportunities to make life difficult for President AKD and his NPP Government those very elements could become tools at the hands of foreign elements with their own strategic agenda

On 21 August 2024 ‘Colombo Telegraph’ published an article titled, “Will the old order accept AKD victory?” The reason for raising that question then was because, of all the 39 contestants in the race for Presidency, including the two front runners Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) and Sajith Premadasa (SP), only AKD stood for something radically different. While all the others had exhibited no understanding of the root cause of the poly-crises that plagued the nation and promising blindly to tackle them rather spasmodically with the help of foreign agencies and advisors, only AKD was advocating something entirely different.

We were told that the Prevention of Terrorism Act would be completely abolished. However, at present, they have eliminated freedom of speech, media freedom, and civil liberties by utilising the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Is it fair to conduct media raids using the Prevention of Terrorism Act? During the election, the current Government received a significant support from the social media sector. Yet now, they are using the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which they promised to remove, to hunt down social media activists. We propose that if they mean what they say, they should stop this repression

### Macron names François Bayrou as French PM after government collapse

French President Emmanuel Macron named key ally Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday, but the scale of the challenge facing the veteran centrist was immediately clear as the Socialist Party refused to join his coalition government.

Bayrou, 73, gave a sober assessment of whether he could tame a hung parliament that ousted his predecessor, Michel Barnier, just last week.

“It is a long road, everyone knows that,” he told reporters. “I am not the first to take a long road.”

France’s festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term until 2027.

It has also lifted French borrowing costs and left a power vacuum in the heart of Europe, just as Donald Trump heads to the White House and Germany braces for new elections following the collapse of its governing coalition.
