The country is emerging from a years-long economic collapse blamed partly on struggling high-debt Chinese mega-projects coordinated through the BRI, the massive infrastructure project that is a central pillar of Xi’s bid to expand his country’s clout overseas.

“I attach great importance to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations and am willing to work with Mr. President to continue our traditional friendship (and) enhance mutual political trust,” Xi said in a message to Dissanayaka, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

Xi said he hoped bilateral cooperation under his flagship BRI would “bear more fruit”, CCTV added.

Challenges in new government: Election delays, potential dissolution, Tamil parliamentary election complexities, party divisions, diaspora involvement, state occupation issues, accountability concerns, international pressure needed for solutions.

🟩

The presidential election results will be fully arrived in the evening of the 22nd. However, if the 2nd and 3rd preferential votes are counted, it may be delayed.

Probably a situation where parliament can be dissolved following the election. If so, the parliamentary election will come before the end of this year.

As far as Tamil politics is concerned, the parliamentary election will be a big challenge. It is not possible to say that how many teams will compete from the Tamil nationality. Three or four teams have the opportunity to compete.

The Tamil National Party can contest alone, the Tamil National People's Front and the Democratic Tamil National Alliance alone.

May try to put pressure on them to go to the coalition. At least the Tamil state party and the Democratic Tamil National Alliance may be forced to act as the Old Tamil National Alliance.

The Tamil state party is now clearly divided and many difficulties in making decisions.
