### KKS Port: A Missed Opportunity Or A Strategic Gateway For Sri Lanka–India Relations?

The Northern Province, and particularly Jaffna, remains one of Sri Lanka’s most underutilised economic regions. A functional port at KKS can directly link northern producers — fisheries, agriculture, dairy, and Palmyra-based industries — to regional markets across the Palk Strait.
