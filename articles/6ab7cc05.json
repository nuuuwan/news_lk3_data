    "HNB Group recorded a PAT of Rs 23.7 Bn growing by 26% YoY, while the Bank\u2019s Profit After Tax increased by 34% YoY to Rs 22.2 Bn for the nine months ended September 2024.",
    "Commenting on the performance, Nihal Jayawardene, Chairman of Hatton National Bank PLC, stated that \u201chaving experienced five years of extreme volatility and unprecedented challenges, Sri Lanka has witnessed macro-economic stability during the year. We believe that the completion of the external debt restructuring as announced, as well as progression in the reform agenda, will boost investor confidence, auguring well for the country and the banking sector\u201d.",
    "Damith Pallewatte, Acting Chief Executive Officer of Hatton National Bank PLC, added that \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s key macro variables continued to move in the right trajectory during the first nine months of the year. However, at bank level, these variables resulted in mixed financial outcomes. The overall improvement in the operating environment created a conducive environment for businesses and individuals leading to better credit growth and debt serviceability by the borrowers. However, steep drop in market rates impacted both yields from the loans and advances and investment portfolio negatively exerting pressure on interest margins. While strengthening of the LKR against the USD resulted in improved economic activity on the imports front, this also resulted in bank having to recognize an exchange loss on the revaluation of foreign exchange reserves. Nonetheless, in this backdrop, Bank\u2019s core focus remained on sustainable growth through responsible lending, mobilization of low-cost deposits, growing non-interest income and improving asset quality\u201d.",
    "Decline in AWPLR by nearly 50% compared to last year and remaining at an average level of 10% for the first 9 months directly reflected in the loan yields as the loan book repriced at lower rates leading to a considerable 25% decline in Gross Interest Income for the period. The Interest Expense also recorded a 29% drop in line, supported by the strong growth in CASA deposits. The resultant NII for the period was recorded at Rs. 68.5 Bn, reflecting an 18% YoY contraction.",
    "Bank\u2019s efforts to minimize the impact of interest rate volatility, resulted in a 10% YoY growth in Net Fee and Commission income despite trade income being relatively lower compared to the previous year with the normalizing of the trade tariff to pre-crisis levels. The growth in fee income was largely driven by higher cards and digital transactions in line with the efforts to drive a cashless economy,",
    "The support extended to customers to revive their businesses, concerted efforts on collection and the overall improvement in economic activity enabled the Bank to record superior asset quality compared to the industry. The net stage 3 ratio improved to 3.32% while the stage 3 provision coverage ratio improved to 60.50%, during the quarter, compared to 4.09% and 56.08% recorded in 1H 2024. The total impairment charge for the nine months amounted to Rs 3.2 Bn, compared to Rs 32.4 Bn for the same period in 2023. The impairment charge for the previous period included an amount of Rs 25 Bn on account of Bank\u2019s investments in international sovereign bonds (ISBs). With the agreement on the external debt restructuring, in line with the industry practice, the Bank maintained its provision cover of 52% on the investments in ISBs. This together with the positive movement in stage-wise loans, led to a significant reduction in the impairment charge for the period.",
