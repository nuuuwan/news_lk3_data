    "Amid the prevailing economic hardships in Sri Lanka, the Australian Border Force firmly stated that individuals attempting to enter Australia's borders illegally will not be provided accommodation, as many Sri Lankans seek means to escape their current circumstances.",
    "The Australian Border Force, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Police have stepped up efforts to deter and counter maritime people smuggling from Sri Lanka.",
    "Since March 2022, a total of seven boats carrying 224 people were successfully, safely and legally intercepted off Australia and returned to the island nation, with assistance from the Sri Lankan authorities.",
    "Speaking to journalists in Colombo, visiting Joint Agency Task Force Operations Sovereign Borders Commander Rear Admiral Justin Jones set the record straight, stressing there is no change in the policies that are relevant to the Operations Sovereign Borders.",
    "\u201cThis is the very lie, deceit and disinformation sown by maritime people smugglers. The Australian government has given crystal clear directions to me that there are no changes to the Operations Sovereign Borders,\" stressed Rear Admiral Jones.",
    "We are to continue in the exact same way to deter, disrupt, intercept and return, under the same protocols that existed since September 2013,\u201d he said, while pointing out that absolutely no individual would be allowed to enter Australia via illegal routes.",
    "The visit of Rear Admiral Jones to Sri Lanka follows an Operations Sovereign Borders interception and return in early May, where 41 Sri Lankans, who left from Valaichchenai, attempted to migrate illegally by boat to Australia.",
    "He asserted that the Nauru island is still available for the Joint Agency Task Force Operations Sovereign Borders, to use as a processing centre.",
    "\u201cIf we need to use it (Nauru island), we will. It is a place of regional processing and the population going there has been reduced to zero. This tells me that the processes are working,\u201d said Rear Admiral Jones.",
    "While pointing out that the success in suppressing the illegal people smuggling trade is an ongoing operation for both governments, the visiting official said there is always more work to be done.",
    "He acknowledged that the partnership between the Sri Lankan and Australian governments to combat the criminal people smuggling trade is \u201cgold standard\u201d and the recent interception is proof of that enduring closeness.",
    "\u201cOur combined work in this area never stops. I cannot stress enough the futility of undertaking such dangerous journeys \u2013 there is zero chance of success for those considering undertaking illegal maritime migration,\u201d said Rear Admiral Jones. (Shabiya Ali Ahlam)"
