### A call to end  ‘Corporal Punishment’  and create a fear-free childhood

*2024-04-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-call-to-end-Corporal-Punishment-and-create-a-fear-free-childhood/172-281587) · `en`

School and home are the places where children spend most of the time of the day; hence corporal punishment should be absent in both places and they should feel safe in such environments

Research unequivocally shows that corporal punishment is linked to adverse outcomes, including increased aggression, poorer mental health, and diminished cognitive development, which could result in long-term psychological issues and social dysfunctions, ultimately contributing to a cycle of violence that affects the broader society and future generations

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74 per cent of parents resort to corporal punishment

Corporal punishment affects over 1.3 billion children worldwide and is the most common form of child abuse globally and in Sri Lanka, where complaints of cruelty against children have increased by three-fold in the past ten years.    As the world celebrates and respective governments pledge to do more to abolish a heinous crime against children on International Day to End Corporal Punishment on April 30th, neither the Government of Sri Lanka nor the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), the most powerful institution maintained by public funds to protect and promote children’s rights is recognizing the only day dedicated to a specific type of child abuse.

What are the proposed legal reforms to ban corporal punishment?

When land-based feudalism replaced urbanism and trade, Buddhism waned in India, says Indian scholar Balkrishna Govind Gokhale

In sixth century BC, Buddhism thrived in the Gangetic Plain in North India due to urbanisation and the development of trade. According to the renowned scholar of Buddhism in India, Balkrishna Govind Gokhale, Buddhism began to decline in India when urbanisation and trade yielded place to feudalism.

In his paper in the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Vol Number 2, 1982, University of Wisconsin Madison), Gokhale says that the use of iron tools, beginning from the seventh century BC, increased agricultural productivity, which in turn led to larger commodity surpluses, which became available for exchange through trade.

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - Pope Francis will decide as to when Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith should retire, Director of Communications, the Archdiose of Colombo Fr. Jude Krishantha said today.

"It is the Pope who will decide as to when Cardinal Ranjith should go on retirement and the latter has no say in it," Fr. Krishantha told the media.

"Every Bishop is bound to inform the Pope that he has reached the retirement age when they become 75. Therefore, Cardinal Ranjith informed one and a half years ago that he had completed his 75th year. However, the Pope had told him to continue as the Archbishop of Colombo for some more time as he is still lively. In the meantime, a Cardinal can remain active and can vote at a conclave to elect a new Pope until he reaches the age of 80. This is the tradition of the Catholic Church," he added.

### Fitch affirms Sri Lanka’s UB Finance rating at ‘BB(lka)’

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch affirmed licensed non-bank lender UB Finance Company Ltd’s national long-term rating at ‘BB(lka)’. The outlook is stable.

The rating is driven by Fitch’s expectation of extraordinary support from Union Bank of Colombo PLC, which owns 89.9 percent of UB Finance.

“UBF’s rating is constrained by our view that any support required may be more of a burden relative to UB’s modest balance sheet size, compared with other Fitch-rated financial leasing companies owned by larger banks,” Fitch said in its assessment.

The rating agency expects the proposed rights issue to bridge UBF’s regulatory capital shortfall. “However, the capital buffer could be thin against the regulatory minimum capital of LKR2.5 billion and may fall below the regulatory requirement should there be any unforeseen losses.”

Fitch Ratings – Colombo – 26 Apr 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed UB Finance PLC’s (UBF) National Long-Term Rating at ‘BB(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable.

### Ratnam - Review

*2024-04-29 17:16:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182259) · `ta`

"Ratnam" stars Vishal, Priya Bhavani Shankar, and others. It's a sequel to "Tamirapparani" and "Pooja," featuring a coalition between Hari and Vishal. The story revolves around Ratnam, who loses his mother early, becomes a legislator, and falls in love with Mallika, facing enemies who threaten her. The film lacks the usual Hari's stressful and strong sentimental scenes, and Vishal's pronunciation in emotional scenes is criticized. Despite this, performances by Samudrakani and Priya Bhavani Shankar stand out. The film includes political satire and a renewed comedy track, but lacks novelty in its scenes. Cinematographer Sukumar and composer Devi Sri Prasad contribute positively.

### Scotland’s Humza Yousaf resigns as country’s leader

Scotland’s leader Humza Yousaf resigned on Monday, further opening the door to the UK opposition Labour Party to regain ground in its former Scottish heartlands in a national election expected later this year.

Yousaf quit as head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) after a week of chaos triggered by his scrapping of a coalition agreement with Scotland’s Greens.

He then failed to secure enough support to survive votes of no confidence against him expected later this week.

Resigning little over a year after he replaced Nicola Sturgeon as first minister and SNP leader, Yousaf said it was time for someone else to lead Scotland’s devolved government.

The SNP’s fortunes have faltered over a funding scandal and the resignation of Sturgeon as party leader last year. There has also been infighting over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters.
