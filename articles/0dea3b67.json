    "Chandrika Kumaratunga blazed like a comet in the Sri Lankan political firmament at a time when the SLFP was riven with dissent. The manipulation of the leadership of the SLFP begun by JRJ, and continued by Premadasa, was facilitated by a series of electoral setbacks faced by Mrs. B. After her civic rights were curtailed she lost her authority as best seen in the emergence of Hector Kobbekaduwa as the SLFP\u2019s presidential candidate.",
    "The Bandaranaike family was divided over the Kobbekaduwa issue. While Chandrika and her husband Vijaya Kumaratunga virtually ran the SLFP campaign, Mrs. B and Anura did their best to sabotage Kobbekaduwa\u2019s chances. Actually Mrs. B had preferred to have the SLFP supporting Colvin R de Silva\u2019s candidature. Anticipating her backing Colvin had thrown his hat into the ring only to find that SLFP support was not forthcoming. On discovering that he was betrayed Colvin attacked the SLFP candidate saying that Kobbekaduwa would be unseated even if he was elected.",
    "Coming from a legal eagle like Colvin that was a serious warning. On the other hand Anura, obviously fronting for his mother, declared that Kobbekaduwa was only \u201ca contractor\u201d who would turn over power to Mrs. B if he was elected. Being at the receiving end of a two pronged attack, Kobbekaduwa not only lost the Presidential election but consequently split up the SLFP into different factions making them easy prey for JRJ and Premadasa. One direct consequence of this SLFP fiasco was the creation of the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya (SLMP) by Vijaya Kumaratunga and Chandrika.",
    "The SLMP caught the imagination of the younger generation of radicals, including those who had earlier supported the JVP but had escaped the army dragnet. Their May Day parade and meeting presided over by TB Ilangaratne-a giant of the original SLFP of Bandaranaike, outshone Mrs. B and Anura\u2019s parade and earned for CBK the hatred of the SLFP old stagers, especially of Anura and Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Open conflict broke out later in their \u201clong march\u201d from Colombo to Kataragama which received the covert blessings of President Premadasa. But CBK persisted in joining the march and won praise from party members who did not approve of splitting the SLFP. But funds were hard to come by and Vijaya had to draw on the goodwill he had earned from the producers of Sinhala films and other people associated with film production.",
    "The position taken by Vijaya and CBK on the national question was not to the liking of several ex-SLFP veterans. Ilangaratne and Kularatne left the party claiming that they were not consulted on this sensitive issue. This intervention became the swansong of Ilangaratne who had suffered many slights from the party and died a poor and disgruntled man. Since he had been my minister when I was a civil servant, I met TBI when he was down in life and tried to be of some service to him. He died not long after. As MP for Galagedera I arranged with the People\u2019s Bank to erect his statue in his home town as an act of homage to its founder.",
    "It soon became clear that Vijaya was the best possible candidate to lead a left coalition. His charisma and position on the ethnic issue made him a candidate who could attract minorities as well. I remember Colvin R de Silva telling me that the LSSP, of which originally Vijaya was a member, was backing him to the hilt. Sampanthan told me that in the opinion of S. Nadesan, the iconic Tamil lawyer, the CBK\u2013Vijaya combination was the most promising partner for the Tamils. Even Tamil separatist leaders like Uma Maheshwaran and Pathmanathan had faith in him.",
    "Though bitterly criticised by Sinhala politicians, Vijaya undertook a visit to the LTTE dominated part of the Jaffna peninsula and with the popular Captain Kotelawela of the SL Army in attendance, had discussions with LTTE commander Rahim [an old Trinitian whose birth name was Kanagaratnam]. With his open backing of the 13th amendment and undoubted popularity among the Sinhala masses, the JVP leadership decided to eliminate Vijaya no matter the cost.",
    "It mustbe stated that Vijaya was the only politician to openly defy the JVP and challenge them to do their worst, especially when he was affected by the killing of his party comrades. A large number of ex-JVPers and left radicals like Reginald Cooray, Dilan Perera, Jagath Naranbedda and Navaratne joined the SLMP much to the indignation of the JVP leaders who approved the \u201cthe termination with extreme prejudice\u201d of Vijaya Kumaratunga. It was a traumatic event for his young family as well as a large multitude of people from all walks of life.",
    "With the assassination of Vijaya, the Mahajana Pakshaya lost its leader and CBK left with her children to seek refuge in the UK. The party was split wide open with some rejoining the SLFP while others like Ossie Abeygunasekera threw in their lot with Premadasa and, with the latter\u2019s death, allied himself with the UNP led by Gamini Dissanayake. Ossie was a victim of the Thotalanga bomb blast and succumbed to those injuries. With the announcement of the first Provincial Council elections, to establish which the SLMP had paid a heavy price, CBK with great courage returned from the U.K. to lead her party.",
    "The SLFP boycotted this election thereby helping in the murderous rampage of the JVP. The JVP went on a killing spree of the candidates and voters who dared to participate in the election. This was a tragic decision since both the SLFP and JVP became enthusiastic participants at subsequent PC elections.",
    "The leaders of the left, particularly Rajitha Senaratne, supported desperate efforts to get CBK back to Sri Lanka to give them leadership in the context of a weakened SLFP now led by Anura Bandaranaike.",
    "Anura was busy trying to reimage the SLFP as a middle of the road Social Democratic party like that of his father. This was after a long period of SLFP subservience to the Marxist parties with whom Mrs. B had entered an alliance in the late 1960s. It had led to a bitter conflict which tore the Bandaranaikes apart. Mrs. B was deliberately humiliated at party meetings and she backed CBK to enter the SLFP with a view to wresting the leadership. All attempts to block her entry to the SLFPs central committee failed because Wisva Warnapala agreed to relinquish his position to accommodate CBK.",
    "As a new star and a dedicated worker she reinvigorated the party. A disappointed Anura then was lured by Sirisena Cooray to cross over to the UNP, where President Wijetunga welcomed him and immediately made him the Minister of Higher Education. But he could not make a difference to the fortunes of the UNP. With the defacto merger of the SLFP and the SLMP and the growing unpopularity of the UNP, partly due to the attacks of the DUNF, the opposition was poised to make a strong showing in the Provincial Council election after over two decades in the wilderness.",
    "The election of provincial councillors for the second tenure of Provincial Councils turned out to be a three cornered struggle between the UNP, SLFP and DUNF. The results were a tribute to CBKs sagacity as she was able to engineer a collaboration between the SLFP and the DUNF in a new context where both Lalith Athulathmudali [DUNF Leader] and Premadasa [UNP Leader] had been assassinated in quick succession by the LTTE and the election was held under crisis conditions. On the results of this election CBK became the Chief Minister of the Western Province with a record poll and thereafter led her party to victory both in the Parliamentary and Presidential elections.",
    "The DUNF, of which I was Vice President, was at the height of its strength when nominations for the Provincial Council elections were called. Our meetings which were directed at criticizing the Premadasa regime were drawing large crowds. Sponsors were coming forward with invitations as well as funds and we were able to increase the number of meetings. The demand was so great that we had to split our schedule of meetings so that while Gamini concentrated on the Kandyan areas and the Mahaweli region, Lalith worked the urban areas in the key demographic triangle of Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara.",
    "G. M. Premachandra who was in great demand as an \u201cattack speaker\u201d led our propaganda in the Kurunegala district. This arrangement was logical in that these leaders were our nominees for the posts of Chief Minister in those provinces. With the internal conflicts in the SLFP surfacing some seniors jumped ship and joined the DUNF. Leading them were SLFP grandees like PBG Kalugalle and Monty Gopallawa. Lakshman Senewiratne and Samaraweera (Weerawanni), long time MPs led our effort in Badulla district while the Gamini Dissanayake electoral machine, now led by his wife Srima, secured a good following in Nuwara Eliya.",
    "Dissidents from the UNP like Dr Cyril led our effort in the Hambantota district. Gamini had the best of relations with Basil Rajapaksa who though not joining the DUNF, maintained links with us as he had earlier contested a seat under JRJ as a nominee of the UNP. His brother Mahinda who was the chief lieutenant of Anura Bandaranaike, was sulking in the SLFP tent and he made no attempt to prevent his mentor from crossing over to the UNP under Wijetunga though he himself refused to leave the SLFP.",
    "We spent a considerable amount of time in preparing the party manifesto. The lead was taken by the indefatigable Lalith, whose training as a constitutional lawyer came into play, as he personally penned many of the provisions of the document after discussions with our group. As the perceived victims of an overweening Presidency, the DUNF was the first to advocate the abolition of the post of executive President. It must be noted however that all those who advocated this measure went back on it no sooner than they were elected to office.",
    "It was rumoured that JRJ had advised CBK, who had pledged in writing to abolish the executive Presidency, that \u201cas PM you will last five months but as Executive President you will last five years\u201d. History shows that CBK accepted that advice. The DUNF was presented as a Social Democratic party which was against privilege and the concentration of power. It emphasized an export oriented economic policy and a domestic food security policy based on high yields following the Mahaweli scheme and recognizing the needs of the farming community.",
    "Special emphasis was placed on the possibilities of export agriculture as in the \u201cagricultural villages/communes\u201d which were pioneered by Lalith. Predictably, emphasis was placed on education and technology. The \u201d Mahapola\u201d scheme aimed at ensuring that no deserving student was left behind, attracted many young people to the DUNE Finally a social welfare net to assist those below the poverty line was included in the manifesto. Though we would have preferred a longer period to continue with our upward trajectory we were in a positive mood when nominations were called. Never in our wildest nightmares did we think that our leader Lalith would be assassinated while on the stump for the DUNF.",
    "It drew the wrath of the public and President Premadasa was forced to be on the defensive. His plaintive call to \u201ckill me but do not kill my good name\u201d was a sign that he was deeply troubled by the shift of public sympathy. He was planning to make this plea the thrust of his May day speech. This manifest anxiety of the President probably hastened his assassination. In order to make this May day a spectacular success, under trying circumstances, he flouted the advice of his astrologers not to step out on that day.",
    "Secondly the LTTE would have thought it the ideal opportunity to kill him because public opinion was turning against him. This \u201ccruellest month\u201d changed the trajectory of contemporary Sri Lankan politics and later with the death of Gamini Dissanayake spelt the doom of the DUNF which had begun with so much hope. All of us who gladly joined in that adventure were dispersed to follow our own destinies and lament the end of the \u201cshining city on the hill\u201d.",
