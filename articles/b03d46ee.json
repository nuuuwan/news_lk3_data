    "\u201cWhen I met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi once, we talked about palm oil cultivation. At that time, the Russia-Ukraine war had started. Ukraine was the key supplier of palm oil to India. Mr. Modi told me that Sri Lanka had been seen as one of the three best countries in the world for growing palm oil. He sought to cultivate palm oil under a buyback agreement for 35 years.",
