    "President\u2019s Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena appearing for a group of religious leaders including Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera alleged that his clients do not see adequate progress regarding the investigation against Pastor Jerome when compared with two other similar incidents. He said the law enforcement authorities instituted stern legal action against stand-up comedian Nathasha Edirisooriya and Ven. Rajangane Saddharathana Thera over making statements that harm religious harmony.",
    "Jayawardena apprised the Supreme Court that the case was coming up, as on the previous occasion, the Attorney General had furnished an undertaking that the law has been duly mobilised against Pastor Jerome, for deliberately insulting the four main religions of the country and that investigations are continuing and facts have been reported to the Magistrate\u2019s Court. He stated that his clients do not see adequate progress.",
    "In response, SASG Nawana stated that examination of 11 bank accounts maintained by Pastor Jerome, has revealed that there have been transactions of as much as Rs.12.25 billion and that complicated investigations were being conducted to ascertain the possible commission of money laundering offences, in addition to other offences. He told the Court that the investigations had been commenced even prior to filing these petitions.",

    "Meanwhile, President\u2019s Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne appearing for Pastor Jerome Fernando informed the Supreme Court that he was not objecting to carrying out an investigation against his client under Money Laundering Act.",
    "Taking into consideration the facts, the Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Justices Shiran Goonaratne and Arjuna Obeysekara fixed the petitions for October 27, in order to ascertain the progress of the investigations.",
    "In their Fundamental Rights petition, a group of religious leaders are seeking an order directing the IGP to immediately arrest Pastor Jerome Fernando over his hate comments against religious harmony in the country.",
    "However, in a separate application, Pastor Jerome Fernando is seeking an order preventing police from arresting him in connection with this controversial Sunday sermon.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
