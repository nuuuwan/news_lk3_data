    "Warns continued borrowing could lead to higher inflation, rising commodity prices, and escalating fuel costs in 2025",
    "Asks President to not repeat promises on campaign trail and now deliver instead",
    "Predicts NPP\u2019s failure to deliver on promises would likely result in reduction in votes for NPP",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo district candidate S.M. Marikkar has sharply criticised the current National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s economy and its failure to meet the promises made to the public.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Marikkar argued that the Government\u2019s current path would prevent foreign investors from coming to Sri Lanka, hinder production, and restrict the growth of exports. He warned that continued borrowing could lead to higher inflation, rising commodity prices, and escalating fuel costs in the coming year.",
    "The SJB candidate questioned the claims made by the NPP, which had declared that corruption, fraud, and theft were rampant in Government institutions. He suggested that while these issues may have been highlighted, the NPP Government had failed to deliver tangible benefits to the people.\u00a0 \u201cIf these issues have been addressed, why are the people not seeing the benefits?\u201d Marikkar asked.",
    "Marikkar also addressed President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s recent statements, in which he promised reductions in electricity bills and taxes. He reminded the public that similar promises were made during the Presidential election, but had yet to be realised.",
    "\u201cThese promises should no longer be repeated; it is time for implementation,\u201d Marikkar said, emphasising that the Government must act now to relieve the people\u2019s burden.",
    "He further criticised the Government\u2019s stance that relief for the people could only be provided after the Parliamentary elections. Marikkar pointed out that the Government had already made decisions, such as imposing customs duties on food, without Parliamentary approval, undermining their argument that certain actions required Parliamentary power.",
    "Looking ahead to the General Election, Marikkar predicted that the NPP\u2019s failure to deliver on its promises would likely result in a reduction in votes for the party.\u00a0 \u201cThe NPP Government has the ability to review its progress during the upcoming elections, but due to unmet promises, it is likely to face a decline in support,\u201d he concluded."
