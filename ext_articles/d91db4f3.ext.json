      "title": "Arundhati Roy\u2019s international splash with her 2025 non-fiction book",
      "body_lines": [
        "She writes autobiographically on her life with her mother and brother and titles her book Mother Mary Comes To Me, mother Mary being her own mother \u2013 Mary Roy, a Malayali Jacobite Syrian Christian who was educator and women\u2019s rights activist known for winning a Supreme Court lawsuit in 1986 awarding equal rights to women to inherit family property. The book is published by Hamish Hamilton. I was sent a Guardian article which was an edited extract from the book.",
        "It carries the long title: Arundhati Roy on her fugitive childhood: \u2018My knees were full of scars and cuts \u2013 a sign of my wild, imperfect, fatherless life.\u2019 The book appears to be starkly telling, cruelties and all, with a mother who was ill with asthma and on steroids and very very short tempered, who vented her wrath on her two small children. It seems to be brutally honest and thus the sympathy the reader feels will be for the two children; the mother too.",
        "Maybe Arundhati wrote this all revealing autobiography as a cathartic exercise as she says her mother was actually cruel to the two young ones aged less than 10-years. The title is intriguing as Mother Mary is also the compassionate mother of Jesus Christ.",
        "Mary married Rajib Roy, a Bengali Christian tea plantation manager from Kolkata. He was alcoholic and abusive so Mary with her son and daughter left him in 1964. The father met the children only 20 years later.",
        "Suzanna Arundhati Roy was born in 1961 and her brother, Lalit Kumar Christopher Roy, maybe a year previous. Thus when they left the father they were four and nearly three years old. This was when war broke out between India and China. Mother and kids moved to Ootacamund \u2013 Ooty \u2013 in Tamil Nadu, to live in an almost empty house of Mary\u2019s grandfather. It was here that the mother\u2019s ire was roused so she turned activist.",
        "Her uncle, G Isaac, came marching along and told Mary she could not squat in the house as she had no right to it. Mother and two children fled in search of a lawyer. They managed to find one who told Mary that the Travancore Act that the uncle quoted to chase the fatherless family out applied only in the state of Kerala, not Tamil Nadu, and that even squatters had rights. Arundhati writes: \u201cHe said if anyone tried to evict us, we could call the police. We returned to the cottage shaking but triumphant.\u201d",
        "She speaks of her mother thus: \u201cA teacher was what my mother had always wanted to be, what she was qualified to be. During the years she was married and living with our father, the dream of pursuing a career of any kind atrophied and fell away. It was rekindled (as nightmare more than dream) when she realized that her husband, like many young men who worked on lonely tea estates, was hopelessly addicted to alcohol.\u201d",
        "In Ooty, her mother\u2019s asthma got worse and as a dire effect of steroid medication she became a very angry person. The three lived in poverty and also fear and constant conflict. There was of course pity shown to the two kids, the son very quiet and introspective, the girl with spirits unsquashed.",
        "Arundhati writes: \u201cWhen my mother became completely bedridden for a few weeks, Kurussammal moved in with us. Our edgy lifestyle came to an end. It was Kurussammal who taught us what love was. What dependability was. What being hugged was. She would cook for us and bathe us outdoors in the bitter Ooty cold with water she boiled in a huge pot on a wood fire. To this day, my brother and I need to be almost boiled to feel properly bathed.\u201d This woman who came to the aid, nay rescue of the two children, was the owner of a knitwear shop.",
        "When she was five, the family moved back to Kerala, where her mother started a school.",
        "\u201cMary Roy was a kind of visionary, but she seemed to drive people around her mad. As well as being frequently driven mad by them. \u2026.She took her children to a cottage that belonged to her maternal grandfather in Tamil Nadu but came up against her family\u2019s invocation of law governing inheritance in her community: daughters had no right to their father\u2019s property.",
        "Finally they came to Ayemenem, recognizable as the village in  The God of Small Things, staying first with their family; extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life\u2019, before once more falling out with them. Mary then set up her own home and, eventually, a school that developed a national reputation.\u201d Also she won a Supreme Court case allowing women inheritance of family property. They lived at the beginning with a maternal aunt, Miss Kurien, with an MA in English Literature who was a teacher in Ceylon. In the 1950s most science teachers in this country were from Kerala \u2013 Syrian Christians. Mary Roy died in 2022.",
        "Arundhati was born November 24, 1961. She attended Corpus Christi School in Kottayam, Kerala, followed by the Lawrence School in Lovedale, Tamil Nadu. She then studied architecture at the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi, where she met architect Gerard Cunha and married him in 1978, to live in Delhi and then Goa before divorcing in 1982. She returned to Delhi where she got a position with the National Institute of Urban Affairs.",
        "She began writing her first novel The God of Small Things  in 1992, completing it in 1996. Semi-autobiographical, it captures much of her childhood experience in Ayemenem. The disadvantaged labourer who the protagonists\u2019s mother rows a boat to the other side of the river close to their home and preserves factory to make love \u2013 Velauthan \u2013 is based on a young man who was kind to the child in Ooty.",
        "The published book catapulted her to international fame as she won the Booker Prize in 1997 and was listed as one of The New York Times  Bestsellers for Independent Fiction. It was a commercial success for which she received a publishing advance of half a million pounds, The novel was out in May and by end June it had been sold in 18 countries. She donated her payment for the published book to one of the causes she advocated. She won many other accolades and prizes.",
        "She spent the next years as an activist, the most prominent being her protest against the building of the Namadar Dam or Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujerat as it meant the relocation of hundreds of poor residents in the area. She \u2018fought many battles\u2019 including falsely reported genocide of minorities in Sri Lanka. She was very engaged in the Kashmir crisis, believing the Indian part of Kashmir should be granted self-rule.",
        "Then in 2007 she started on her second novel \u2013The Ministry of Utmost Happiness \u2013 and had it published by Penguin India and Hamish Hamilton UK in 2016. I quote a blurb from Internet: \u201d The Ministry \u2026 takes us on an intimate journey of many years across the Indian subcontinent \u2013 from the cramped neighborhoods of Old Delhi and the roads of the new city to the mountains and valleys of Kashmir and beyond \u2013 where war is peace and peace is war.\u201d",
        "I dared review the book in this column and was not too satisfied with it. Too much propaganda for the Kashmiri independence cause.",
        "She married Pradip Krishna, film maker and collaborated on making many short films. They are still married but live apart.",
        "And now we look forward to her third book with anticipation. No disappointment for sure! Pictures of her that accompanied The Guardian show her to be even more beautiful and charming than what we remember of her when she visited Sri Lanka in 1997 and spoke at the British Council.",
        "China\u2019s Xi Jinping hosts a Summit of leaders of half the world, with a spectacular display of military force",
