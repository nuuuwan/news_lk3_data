  "original_body_lines": [
    "The newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in his inaugural address to the nation after sworn-in as the Head of the State, assured his full commitment to strengthen and safeguard the democracy of the country, through which he was elected to the office.",
    "Addressing the nation, President Dissanayake said: \u201cThe most significant feature of our country\u2019s democracy is the election of the ruler of the country by the general public, but the democracy is not all about just casting the votes or electing the ruler. We accept that we need a little more strengthening of the structures and strong legislations. Therefore, at first, I assure the public that I am ready to showcase my maximum commitment for the protection of the democracy in the country during my term as the president.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, he expressed his gratitude to the outgoing President Ranil Wickremesinghe for \u2018cordially welcoming\u2019 the mandate of the public and showcasing dedication to the changeover of the power respecting the democracy. He also reminded that no leader of the country\u2019s history has refused to accept the transfer of power, as decided by the mandate of the public.",
    "Commenting further, the new Executive President stated: \u201cWe have deeply understood that we are taking over a very challenging country. There is the need for creating a favourable political culture in the country, which the public expect from us. We\u2019re ready to commit for that. We will do every possible thing from our side for re-assuring the confidence of the public in the politics and the politician.\u201d",
    "\u201cNext, we do not think that the deep crisis situation that we\u2019re taking over can be navigated by a single person, the government or just by a single party. I have stated earlier as well, that I am not a magician, but a normal citizen born in this very country. There are abilities and things we know. But my priority is to extract more abilities, collect more knowledge in order to guide the country with better decisions. My responsibility is to be a part of that collective triumph\u201d, Dissanayake added.",
    "Meanwhile, the newly elected President also commented on his expectations of working together with the international communities for the sake of the country.",
    "\u201cI also expect the support of each and every citizen for ending the crisis. But I will always assure the public that I, as the President complete my responsibility with commitment, for that purpose. I know we need the international support. Therefore, we expect to work together with other nations in a way that is more beneficial to our country, despite the divisions of power. We must not be left alone from the world, but a country that should move forward combined with the other countries of the world. We will not hesitate to take decisions required for that purpose\u201d, he expressed.",
    "\u201cWe also expect the much needed support of the industrialists and the entrepreneurs of the country\u201d, said President Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cFinally, I must say that, I was elected by the democracy of the country. The people have voted me. There are people who did not vote me. We have a clear understanding of the amount and the composition of our victory. My responsibility within this term is to build the confidence in that part of the public who do not believe in us. I firmly believe that I will succeed in that purpose\u201d, Dissanayake signed off."
