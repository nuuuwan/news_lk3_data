    "Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella should call for a meeting with former health ministers from both the ruling party and the opposition to come up with a new health policy, a Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP said today.",
    "\u201cThere are several MPs in both the ruling party and the opposition who have held the portfolio of Health Minister. These include Maithripala Sirisena, Rajitha Senaratne, A.H.M. Fowize, Tissa Attanayake, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Nimal Siripala de Silva who had held the portfolio in the past. He should also talk to MPs like Sudarshani Fernandopulle and Seetha Arambepola who have been State Ministers of Health. The incumbent Health Minister should confer with these MPs and come up with a solution to the present health crisis,\u201d SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne told journalists.",
    "\u201cIt will be useful if these MPs representing the ruling party and the opposition discuss on a health policy. Government and opposition MPs have managed to agree on a policy on education and it would not be impossible to agree on a health policy,\u201d he added.",
    "However, former SJB MP Mujibur Rahman who also attended the media conference hit hard at Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and said the latter should reveal the prices at which emergency procurement of medicines has been made.",
    "\u201cWe understand that emergency procurement of medicine is made to fulfill urgent needs. However the prices should also be revealed so that the people would know how much has been paid for the medicines when emergency procurements are made,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
