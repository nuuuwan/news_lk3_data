### Can abortion legalize in Sri Lanka?;2023 2000 Young Pregnancy Record…!

*2024-08-09 13:16:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190652) · `ta`

Abortion is illegal in Sri Lanka except to save a mother's life. Despite over 2000 cases of young pregnancies in 2023, the government hasn't addressed social issues contributing to them. Doctors advocate for legalizing abortion based on humanitarian and scientific grounds, highlighting cases like a 12-year-old victim of sexual abuse. Former Justice Minister Ali Sabri proposed amending the law in 2022, but progress is hindered by religious and ideological barriers.

🟩

Abortion in Sri Lanka is illegal. And it is also a punishable offense.Abortion surgery is carried out with appropriate reasons in the event of a mother's life risk when viewed. However, there are no solutions to the problems that arise in the country regarding young pregnancies.

It is worrying that the government does not find social crimes in the country's political and economic crises. The National Child Protection Authority said that more than two thousand young pregnancies received complaints last year.

Doctors point out that young adult pregnancies should be viewed in a humanitarian manner and that the child is suffering from the law of the teenage girls who do not have the physical fitness.

Rohan P. Rupura, a doctor of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, said that abortion should be allowed on the basis of fair and humanitarian basis and scientific needs.

### Sri Lanka BOP surplus to June 2024 running slightly behind last year

ECONONYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s balance of payments is still strongly in surplus in 2024 under the current interest rate structure, but is running slightly behind 2023, official data show.

Sri Lanka had recorded a BOP surplus (as defined) of 1,761 million US dollars by June 2024, down from 1,957.6 million dollars a year earlier.

Broadly, the BOP surplus is an improvement in net international reserves, and is a reliable figure unlike numbers like ‘current account’ balances which can be subject to large errors.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has run deflationary policy to collect reserves.

Under IMF programs, a central bank is able to collect reserves soon after hiking rates and contracting domestic credit, but misses reserve targets as the economy recovers and a narrow call money rate is targeted with excess liquidity on mathematical formulae (real interest rates or growth), critics have said.
