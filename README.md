ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has affirmed People’s Leasing & Finance’s (PLC) National Long-Term Rating at ‘A-(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The rating reflects PLC’s financial strength as a large finance and leasing company (FLC) focusing on vehicle financing and other asset-backed loans, Fitch said.

“A gradual easing in vehicle import bans may further underpin growth, albeit with some collateral value risk.”

PLC’s franchise also benefits from the linkages with its parent, state-owned People’s Bank (A(lka)/Stable), the country’s second-largest bank, the rating agency said.

Fitch noted that the operating environment for Sri Lanka’s finance and leasing companies (FLCs) continues to stabilise, with improving GDP growth.

“We expect PLC’s core vehicle financing business to benefit from improving economic conditions and the potential liberalisation of vehicle imports.”
