    "The doubling of US tariffs up to 50% on Indian goods took effect yesterday. This includes an additional 25% tariff imposed as a punitive measure for buying oil from Russia. The massive tariff hike is bound to send India\u2019s export sector reeling; among the Indian exports affected by the Trump tariffs are chemicals, furniture, footwear, jewellery and garments. India now finds itself in the same bracket as China and Brazil, where US\u2008tariffs are concerned. Curiously, the US has given China an easier ride; its tariff linked to Russian oil does not apply to China, the largest purchaser of that product. Self-interest has obviously driven the US to spare China, but the fact remains that it has punished its strategic partner, India, with whose support it is trying to hold rising China in check geopolitically.",
    "The US has no friends as such; it treats all its allies like lackeys, and makes them feel important only when it needs to use them to further its geostrategic interests. It forged close ties with India as part of its strategy to counter China\u2019s global dominance, but has laid bare its true face by imposing a \u2018punitive\u2019 tariff on India. India should be able to do what is good for it as the fastest growing major economy, which is thirsting for oil. Any country that becomes a willing cat\u2019s paw for the US should learn from Ukraine\u2019s predicament. Ukraine provoked Russia at the behest of the US-led Western bloc, but the West now considers the provision of military assistance to Ukraine a favour done to that war-torn nation.",
    "Thankfully, the US tariff hike has jolted India into realising the need to mend fences with China. India\u2019s response to the new US tariffs taking effect was not immediately known, but the Modi government has reportedly taken steps to grant financial assistance to the vulnerable exporters and help them open new markets in China, Latin America, West Asia, Europe and elsewhere.",
    "It will be a gargantuan task for India to cushion the US tariff shock, whose political fallout will also be huge, given the economic cost and anticipated job losses. According to international media reports, it was not possible to monitor the reaction of the Indian bourses immediately as they were closed for a Hindu festival, but \u2018equity benchmarks logged their worst session in three months on Tuesday after a Washington notification confirmed the additional tariff\u2019.",
    "The Indian rupee has also been on a losing streak. These are no doubt disturbing signs, but the Indian economy is resilient enough to absorb such shocks. However, it will be in India\u2019s interest to have further negotiations with the US to obtain a tariff reduction. The Trump administration has earned notoriety for about-turns, which are legion, and it is possible that President Donald Trump will make another U-turn by way of a reconciliatory gesture as the US has to factor in its strategic partnership with India; the thawing of relations between India and China is a disconcerting proposition for Washington. However, the US has made the mistake of seeking to browbeat a formidable strategic ally, and letting the whole world know once again that it does not hesitate to further its own interests even at the expense of its close allies.",
    "Meanwhile, the Indian media has reported, quoting a German newspaper, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been avoiding calls from President Trump during the last few weeks amidst escalating trade tensions between the US and India. Modi is in an embarrassing position, unable to leverage his \u2018special\u2019 relationship with President Trump to obtain a substantial tariff reduction. Time was when he and Trump were seen locking each other in a bear hug whenever they met. India is powerful enough for PM Modi to register his protest with the White House by means of a phone call snub, as it were, but one may recall that the leader of a much smaller state did likewise about 16 years ago.",
    "In 2009, President Mahinda Rajapaksa was left with no alternative but to avoid calls from the White House amidst western pressure mounting on his government to stop the Vanni war and spare the LTTE leadership. He also told the Foreign Ministers of France and the UK where to get off when they rushed here to stop the war. He incurred the wrath of the West, but Sri Lanka gained; democracy has been rekindled in the former LTTE-held areas. No wonder the western powers are out for his scalp. PM Modi is lucky that he is too powerful to be bullied in that manner.",
    "How India is planning to handle the US tariffs in the long run remains to be seen, but it has so far stood up to the Trump tariffs admirably.",
