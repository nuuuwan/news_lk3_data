Due to the exclusion of several standardised components for modern cancer treatments in the original agreement, Sri Lankan oncologists recommended procuring advanced machines.

It is the citizenry at the middle and lower end of the income scale who would be asked to bear the cost of this exercise rather dis-proportionately

“Don’t buy things you can’t afford with money you don’t have to impress people you don’t like”. This quote from Dave Ramsay which applies to individuals and families may as well apply to governments also. Why did Sri Lanka borrow so much, was there proper accounting of how it was spent, how many of the projects funded by borrowed money actually met the real needs of the country, and who really benefited, are all questions that still remain unanswered.

Sri Lanka, who were the winners of the event in 2002, failed to qualify for the Champions Trophy for the first-time ever.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will recruit 500 foreign language teachers for schools, State Minister of Education Aravindh Kumar, said.

“We will be giving priority to Korean, German, French, Hindi, Chinese and Japanese,” Kumar told reporters on Friday.

In March, Kumar said that teaching foreign languages such as Japanese and Korean is essential if graduates are to pursue jobs in foreign countries.

As of June 2024, Sri Lanka had sent 10,000 workers to South Korea, and is planning to send around 6,000 workers to Japan.

In order to seek employment in these countries, the candidates must pass a language proficiency test. (Colombo/Jul12/2024)
