Sri Lankans as a whole haven’t read enough about politics or believe too much about its abilities that it’s the cure for all ills; otherwise, Sri Lankans would not have been cheated by their lawmakers for 76 long years! Now, we are trying to ‘read’ Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People’s Power. We have already read the Wickremesinghe chapter, and only the former hints that all the government’s stolen monies will be brought back and the culprits punished, when a new government assumes power.

We voters have an issue. We don’t demand that the lawmaker talks the truth. When the two Chapters of the highest Buddhist Order of this island nation started giving enough hints of late that politicians cannot be trusted, many thought that this call came very late.

### Defense sharing should not split the country and make power sharing from the dark age -Foreign Minister insists on

*2024-03-06 23:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178124) · `ta`

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri emphasizes the importance of power devolution in Sri Lanka, arguing it's crucial for national unity and progress. He cites Sri Lanka's economic recovery post-crisis and India's stabilization under Manmohan Singh as examples. Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic community, including Tamils, Muslims, and Sinhalese, can progress together, with the Tamil National People's Front advocating for a political solution. The minister warns against the dangers of language-based division, referencing Colvin R.D. Silva's warning against a war that could have been avoided if Tamil-Sinhala languages were declared royal in 1956. He calls for all political parties to focus on the country's welfare over politics, highlighting the need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address war-related issues without external interference.

🟩

Devolution of power does not split the country. Therefore, political parties should dedicate their position on the sharing of power and refer to the country for the country.. If ethnic harmony is confirmed only can the country progress. Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said devolution of power should be made possible to get out of the dark era.

He was speaking at a debate on the Taxes Bill on Wednesday (6) in Parliament.

Sri Lanka is an excellent example of what will happen if you make popular decisions in the economy and what will happen if timely economic policies change. The people of the country will take the benefit of taking strict resolutions to recover from the economic crisis.

India faced the worst economic crisis in 1991. The then Prime Minister of India Narasinghe Rao. Manmohan Singh appointed Finance Minister and stabilized India's economy. Since 1991, many political parties have ruled India but economic policy has not been changed for political purposes.

### Finding solutions to manage the talent drain

President (then Prime Minister) pointed out in 2016 that “given the future growth potential and envisaged development plans, Sri Lanka will have to overcome the scarcity of skilled human resources apart from managing power and water requirements”. Sri Lanka eight years later is still looking for sustainable Human Resource solutions

Official records suggest that over 1.1 million Sri Lankans have left the country in 2022 with a monthly average of about 94,000 while only 27.6% of total departures have left for foreign employment purposes, most of them low- and semi-skilled workers. In 2023, around 300,000. However there is evidence that middle-class professionals joined the exodus in 2022 and 2023 thinking that the country would take years to recover. Overall critical sectors like healthcare, banking sector and information technology increasingly struggle with talent shortages.

### How Anura and the NPP are winning the public imagination

The secret of Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and the NPP’s success, the reason why the combination is drawing record crowds and is the only political entity in the field to do so, is really simple. It’s the public imagination, stupid!

Anura and the NPP have seized the public imagination in a way that nobody in this election year has. They have done so, not by resorting to base invocations of race and religion as Gotabaya Rajapaksa did. They have done so, because they are not boring while almost all others are; they have not lost credibility as all others have; they are interesting and have social energy while the others are tired and lack authentic passion; they have a positive message which motivates and mobilises while others are shrilly negative, imaginatively timid, stale and samey.

British Conservative peer Lord Michael Naseby on Tuesday called on the British government to assist Sri Lanka by way of updating Britain's Travel Advisory on Sri Lanka to provide more accurate information, in order to better assist the country.

“It is the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) comments on that country (Sri Lanka) that currently cause me concern because they refer to the fact that protests are going on when they are not. They say that there is a fuel shortage, but there is not and has not been for 18 months. They also say that there are other difficulties of a terrorist nature, which we have not had for five years,” Lord Naseby told the House of Lords that held a seven-hour debate on Britain's Foreign Affairs.

Claiming that tourism sector is rapidly recovering in Sri Lanka, Lord Naseby believed that more British tourists would visit the country if the FCDO provided more accurate Travel Advisory information on Sri Lanka.
