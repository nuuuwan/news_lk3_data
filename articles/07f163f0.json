    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers has decided to amend the country\u2019s Press Council Act to expand scope of controversial 1970s media control law to electronic and online media, the government said.",
    "The Sri Lanka Press Council Act was introduced during Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2019s government and has long been viewed as a tool for controlling the country\u2019s print media rather than promoting press freedom.",
    "The Act established the Press Council, a statutory body empowered to regulate newspapers, monitor journalistic practices, and enforce restrictions on reporting deemed to threaten national security, public order, or morality.",
    "It gave the Council sweeping powers, including the authority to summon editors, seize publications, and penalize journalists or publishers who violated its provisions.",
    "Critics argue that these provisions enable censorship under the guise of regulation, discouraging critical journalism and undermining the role of the press as a democratic watchdog.",
    "The new amendment will be targeting the electronic and online media which run news with incorrect information from print media sources.",
    "\u201cWith the advancement of communication technology, in addition to newspapers and radio, television, the Internet and social media networks have spread rapidly among the people, and this has had a strong impact on public life\u201d the government said.",
    "The Minister of Health and Mass Media Nalinda Jayatissa\u2019s proposal to amend the Sri Lanka Press Council Act including provisions on the main issues of the requirement that the correction decided after inquiries of a newspaper report has also should be disseminated through electronic online media if they had carried the news published in newspapers.",
    "\u201cWe have not decided the action against those electronic or online media who refuse the punish correction. The cabinet has approved the amendment and we will come up with proper action,\u201d Minister Jayatissa, also the Cabinet Spokesman told reporters.",
    "Over the years, successive governments have been accused of using the Press Council Act selectively against critical newspapers and journalists, especially during times of political tension or conflict.",
    "While advocates of the Act justify it as necessary to maintain responsibility in journalism and to curb misinformation, media rights groups both locally and internationally have consistently opposed it, viewing it as an outdated and authoritarian instrument.",
    "The law applies exclusively to the print media, leaving broadcast and digital media outside its purview, which further raises questions about its relevance in today\u2019s diverse media landscape.",
    "Despite repeated calls for reform or repeal, the Act remains in place, symbolizing the uneasy relationship between the Sri Lankan state and the free press, and fuelling concerns that regulation is often used as a mechanism of control rather than a safeguard of ethical standards. (Colombo/September 09/2025)"
