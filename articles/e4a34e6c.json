    "A Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) office in Yakkala came under attack yesterday morning; four persons suffered injuries. The FSP, an offshoot of the JVP, blamed a group of JVP politicians for the attack, demanding that the police arrest them forthwith. The FSP activists said the attackers were forcibly occupying their office, and named the JVP politicians who had allegedly led the attack. But the police ignored their call.",
    "What one gathers from a video footage of yesterday\u2019s incident is that the manner in which the police handled the situation smacked of their partiality towards the government members, as the FSP has claimed. IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya keeps saying there is no political interference in the police at present, and they can act independently and impartially. But instead of taking action against the alleged attackers, the police yesterday asked the protesting FSP members to leave, make complaints and take the issue to court. There is reason to believe that they would have acted differently if the FSP activists had been responsible for the attack.",
    "Yesterday\u2019s incident at Yakkala is proof that the police have not mended their ways; it reminds us of how they baulked at taking action against a group of pro-government goons who set upon the Aragalaya protesters at Galle Face in 2022. If they had used force against the SLPP goons, stopping them from entering the protest site, attacks on the peaceful protesters and the subsequent spree of retaliatory violence could have been prevented. The then IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon is facing legal action against his failure to prevent the savage attacks led by SLPP politicians. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was the President at the time, is to be summoned by the CID to record a statement on those attacks, according to media reports.",
    "The current IGP was a very senior officer when the police refused to act against the goons who worked for previous governments. As we pointed out in a previous comment, thugs doing dirty work for the Mahinda Rajapaksa government would operate alongside the riot police in full view of the media to assault the then Opposition politicians during anti-government protests. Those violent characters remained above the law, and the police did not dare take any action against them for obvious reasons. When the media demanded to know why the police had allowed a group of club-wielding goons to be with the riot police personnel during an Opposition protest march, the Police Spokesman at the time had the audacity to claim they may have carried \u2018sticks\u2019 to ward off stray dogs!",
    "The FSP says it has occupied the building where its Yakkala office is located for about 13 years, and therefore it has a right to be there. However, the JVP members involved in yesterday\u2019s incident produced what they described as the judgement in a case they had filed against the FSP over the disputed office; they said the court had ruled in their favour, and therefore the building was rightfully theirs. If so, the judicial decision should be carried out by an officer authorised by the judiciary to do so and not by the JVP cadres led by their organisers and MPs. If the winning side in a court case is allowed to implement judicial decisions according to their whims and fancies, how can the government claim that the rule of law has been restored and everyone is equal before the law?",
    "Former Deputy Minister Nimal Lanza has been arrested and remanded over an incident where he allegedly assaulted a person about 20 years ago; he should have been arrested much earlier. So, there is no reason why the police should not arrest those who stormed and seized the FSP office, injuring four persons including a woman.",
    "Let it be repeated that if it is true that the FSP has forcibly occupied the building at issue, which according to a court ruling, belongs to the JVP, then the matter should be referred to the judiciary, and the attackers must be arrested.",
    "Politicians and their supporters, or others for that matter, must not be allowed to take the law into their own hands.",
