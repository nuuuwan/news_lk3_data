    "We as a nation had many names officially and many unofficially such as Pearl of the Indian Ocean, Teardrop Isle, Serendipitous Land, Paradise, Land of the Lotus Eaters. We were famous for our smiles and friendliness; the modest charm of our youth; scenic wonders and the fast and easy accessibility of vastly different climatic conditions, vegetation and terrain. Ceylon was known for its tea. Most of those complimentary names are now obliterated by what we are currently recognised for: corruption; being a country with people up to all sorts of dishonest practices and corruption rife from top to bottom. Well known was a Cabinet Minister asking for a\u00a0santhosam\u00a0from a country to accept a project! He still sits in Parliament, nodding many times.",
    "Discouragingly pronounced but truly is it that Sri Lanka can never develop until its rife corruption is eliminated or even reduced and the corrupt punished severely so they are stymied in their malpractices and others would not try emulating them. Once in a way, a ray of sunshine comes through the fog of corruption that it will evaporate. Presidents have pronounced war on corruption but they soon comfortably sink in. Immunity is blamed. Hopes rose with Mr Clean taking centre stage. Complete flop and burst of the balloon of anticipation. He does worse: shields the vile. If that is too strong a statement, let\u2019s mild it to \u2018he turns a blind eye\u2019. To him too, self before country; \u2018I must keep my position so let the stinking rats play their vile games.\u2019",
    "He had already proved himself to be against corruption; was brave enough to identify and publicly name it within a very powerful body; exposed it and sacrificed his ministership rather than condone corruption and let it be covered up.\u00a0 Yes, this all too rare politician is Roshan Ranasinghe.",
    "For all to see and read,\u00a0The Island\u00a0published a full-page interview that Saman Indrajith had with this Ex-Minister of Sports \u2013 ex because he was sacked by the present Prez and his SLPP government for his crusade against SLC corruption.",
    "I quote a little of what he said during the interview. \u201cWhat we need is a righteous leader instead of a person who promotes family bandyism, protects corrupt officials, and indulges in corruption. We have become a bankrupt nation. We are against corruption. Talking about rebuilding this nation without putting an end to corruption is only a pipe dream\u2026 We are forming an alliance under the theme: \u2018Let\u2019s put an end to corruption to build our nation.\u2019 There is a pressing need for a formidable force against corruption.\u201d No truer words were ever said. The action outlined is what is urgently needed.",
    "The first line in this quote covers almost the entire present Cabinet and Prez. Also, past Prezs and others excluding the present PM. There should be a surge of national minded, fair thinking citizens who will join his force since Roshan Ranasinghe appears to be a man of his word; a politician truly opposed to corruption and ready to face immense danger by declaring war against the rich, powerful and corrupt in this land \u2013 a sizeable proportion of politicians way up high, and bureaucrats too.",
    "Touching on the migration of youth particularly, and the dearth of entrepreneurs and investors, Ranasinghe said: \u201cIf we can convince them that the country will be rid of corruption and a viable programme is underway to develop the economy and improve the people\u2019s lot, they will not leave this country. That is what we are striving to do.\u201d He\u2019s hit the nail on the head!",
    "TV News I channel recently included a clip of Dr Rohan Pethiyagoda speaking about the wind power project in Mannar inaugurated by THE Indian billionaire. The clip has gone viral and that is excellent. The Indian businessman is: \u201cGautam Shantilal Adani (b. 1962), an Indian billionaire business magnate, who is the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, a multinational conglomerate involved in port development and operations in India.\u201d Also, much in Sri Lanka of recent times, one must add. He is said to be very close to PM Modi.",
    "Dr Rohan Pethiyagoda speaking at a conference in Colombo convened to assess Adani\u2019s Mannar Wind Power Project exposed corruption within the project.\u00a0 Cassandra was mildly surprised that with all the recent searchlights focused on specific acts of corruption and shouts for, and mild promises to bring back secreted illegally amassed wealth stashed safely away overseas hiding spots, big corruption is still carried out. The finger is pointed at those in power responsible for the acceptance and implementation of Adani\u2019s windmills.",
    "Dr Rohan Pethiyagoda did not mince his words in criticising the Adani Wind Power Project which he said does not benefit Sri Lanka at all and is a curse that will descend on our children and generations to come. Why? He quoted prices. A kilowatt of wind power energy or electricity per hour costs less than US cents 2. The Adani project generated electricity will cost around 4 US cents. Thus, we will have to pay 200% to 300% more than world prices and this will continue for a decade and more, while wind power generation decreases in cost worldwide. Adani will take away 1250 million US dollars from the project leaving Sri Lanka to pay for wind power from Mannar far more than world prices. And wind power is a renewable resource plentifully available to us.\u00a0 Dr. Pethiyagoda asked very succinctly, \u201cWho benefits from this?\u201d \u201cWho pockets the extra money paid?\u201d",
    "Cassandra\u2019s question is: Have the project papers been signed? Who signed on behalf of Sri Lanka? Is the project a fait accompli with no previous consultation with experts outside of the CEB?",
    "We remember very well how Prez Gotabaya R implemented his ban on chemical agricultural fertilisers and pest controls overnight, listening to two main advisors \u2013 a specialist brain doctor and monk. Loud criticism was made by agricultural experts. Not heeded.\u00a0 An analysis by Dr Rohan Pethiyagoda on the ban and refuting arguments for it put forward by Dr Padeniya went viral worldwide. Not listened to by our Heads. So, the final push to the Island to bankruptcy as it was poised on the brink by extravagance and corruption of the Mahinda R government aided and abetted by Governors of the Central Bank in his time.",
    "Cass asks a very simple question. Why are these illogical deals, nay, simply bad for Sri Lanka, being allowed and implemented when glaringly it is money making for some and damning the country for generations to come?",
    "She adds: please never forget the national fiasco of the Light Rail Project funded by JICA which was unilaterally terminated by Prez Gotabaya and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa when they came to power in 2020. People muttered it was to hit Patali Champika Ranawaka who, as Megapolis Minister in the Yahapalanaya government, mooted the idea. On March 11, 2019, Japan and SL signed the loan agreement to construct a 17 km long elevated rail track including 16 stations to cover major intersections from Malabe to Colombo Fort. We antagonised the always helpful Japan and had to pay back. The matter was resolved but it again showed stupidity of the worst kind. The actors live well, it is the country that suffered the loss of a beneficial project and loss of good name and even insulted Japan that had always aided us.",
    "Sri Lanka never seems to learn from past experiences. We sink into our cesspit of corruption, immunity to wrong doers and all that. When will true leaders emerge? There are plenty in this land.",
