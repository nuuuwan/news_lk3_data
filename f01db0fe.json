    "A top Sri Lankan athlete Sachini Perera who set national records in the pole vault and has been working as a housemaid in Dubai to help support her family at home said \u201cI do want to start my sports again\u201d.",
    "For the last year Sachini Perera, 24, has put her athletics dreams on hold when Sri Lanka's currency crisis and soaring medical bills made it difficult for her to look after her mother, who requires long-term care.",
    "It has been more than a year since she swapped crossbars and crashmats for a mop and bucket but Perera, called Sri Lanka's \"Vaulting Queen\" by the media back home, continues to dream of winning gold.",
    "\u201cI feel this is my world now,\u201d Perera told The National in her first interview in English since she moved to the UAE in July last year.",
    "\u201cBut step by step I will fly. I will work \u2013 one step, then the next \u2013 for my dream to fly again.\u201d",
    "She takes care of a young child and does the housework in a Dubai home during the day, setting aside time to exercise after work.",
    "She follows a weekly strength training schedule sent by her coach in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cI came to Dubai to find a solution for my family. My parents say, 'you are an athlete, you are not a housemaid. This is a break from your sports life'.",
    "Perera has always wanted to win a medal on the world stage, representing her country and her people.",
    "\u201cI want to be the one girl from Sri Lanka who wins an international medal for the pole vault,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cBeing a housemaid is my job. But my work is not me \u2013 I\u2019m a gymnast and athlete.\u201d",
    "Perera's situation drew attention after a Sri Lankan television channel profiled her, causing outrage with people criticising the authorities for not doing enough to retain sporting talent.",
    "Soon after, The National spoke to Alexi Gunasekera, Sri Lanka's consul general in Dubai, who said efforts were being made to find her a sports-related job in the emirate.",
    "He accompanied Perera to a meeting with sports authorities in Dubai on Wednesday to explore options so she could focus on training. The details are being worked out, he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economic collapse last year sent fuel, food and electricity prices soaring as the currency plummeted and the nation defaulted on external debt for the first time since independence in 1948.",
    "This prompted more than 311,000 people to leave in search of jobs, mainly to Gulf nations, as per government employment bureau numbers last year.",
    "Similar numbers are expected to leave to find work abroad this year.",
    "Perera also wants to address critics on social media who deride her for taking a maid's job and giving a \u201cnegative\u201d portrayal of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIt is my private life that I came to Dubai and I work as a housemaid,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cWhen I left, no one cared for my athletic life so I had to leave to take care of my family.",
    "\u201cNow they say why go as a housemaid and that I should come back.",
    "\u201cPeople ask why I make sad news about Sri Lanka, but I\u2019m speaking to say I'm taking care of my mummy and my family.\u201d",
    "Perera says she also wants to speak up for her friends and other athletes who have won medals for Sri Lanka and also struggle to make ends meet.",
    "\u201cPeople should know about them. Mine is only one story. We have many stories in Sri Lanka, they need help,\u201d she said.",
    "Despite her brave front, it has not been easy to step off the track.",
    "\u201cI miss my competition, my dreams, my future,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard.",
    "The Sri Lankan government has taken note of her story, meaning there may be a happy ending for Perera.",
    "\u201cWhen we got the news that a Sri Lankan national record holder has come to the UAE and is working as a housemaid, as consular officials we had to act,\u201d said Mr Gunasekera.",
    "\u201cWe are trying to see what can be done with the support of Dubai sport authorities.",
    "\u201cShe needs time to train and she needs an employment opportunity to earn because she has to look after her mother.\u201d",
    "Mr Gunasekera said in popular sports such as cricket, Sri Lankan sportsmen earned enough to handle their family's medical expenses but other athletes may not be able to cover charges.",
    "\u201cSachini has the talent and is determined. I'm positive there are clubs in the UAE or schools she can work in to achieve her dream,\u201d Mr Gunasekera said.",
    "Despite yearning to follow her passion, Perera said she is grateful to her current employers who give her time off to use the gym, pool facilities and take her to the beach and Safa Park to train every week."
