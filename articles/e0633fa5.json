    "AIA Insurance\u2019s pioneering initiative, Suwa Walan, made a powerful impression at the Medicare \u2013 International Healthcare Exhibition, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest healthcare event recently. Conducted in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society, Suwa Walan is a culturally inspired campaign designed to raise awareness about breast cancer and promote early detection. The initiative draws from the traditional Sri Lankan practice of inspecting clay pots (walan) for imperfections, linking it to breast self-examination. At the exhibition, AIA showcased specially crafted clay pots embedded with symbolic lumps and visual guides, encouraging women to adopt regular self-checks in a familiar and non-threatening way.",
    "The campaign stood out for its innovative blend of cultural relevance, health education, and artistic expression. It has already earned multiple awards for its creative approach to public health communication.",
    "By breaking taboos and making cancer awareness accessible, AIA Insurance and the Sri Lanka Cancer Society are empowering communities to take proactive steps toward better health.",
