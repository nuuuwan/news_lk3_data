  "original_body_lines": [
    "In Sri Lanka, road accidents remain a grave national concern, claiming around 3,000 lives annually\u2014roughly 9\u201310 deaths each day. Pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable. Beyond fatalities, accidents cause lasting injuries, property damage, and an economic loss equivalent to nearly 4% of GDP.",
    "Despite this alarming toll, the response of responsible authorities remains reactive and fragmented. Commonly cited causes\u2014such as fatigue, speeding, poorly maintained vehicles, and weak infrastructure\u2014are often vague and lack rigorous, data-driven analysis. No comprehensive national or regional studies exist, and accident trends expose systemic shortcomings in the Traffic Police and the relevant Ministry, which have failed to implement long-term, evidence-based strategies.",
    "Although a National Council for Road Safety exists, its role is limited. The Council provides little public research, awareness campaigns, or educational content in national languages. In 2022, they reported that pedestrians and motorcyclists accounted for two-thirds of fatalities, yet no meaningful follow-up studies or interventions to date.",
    "Sri Lanka needs more than trial-and-error measures; it requires an overhaul of its road safety system. Institutions must be independent, research-driven, and accountable, with measurable goals and strong leadership guiding the Traffic Police toward evidence-based solutions. Reforming the National Council for Road Safety is crucial to move beyond rhetoric and ensure meaningful improvements that save lives.",

    "Accidents often occur when road users act unpredictably. Drivers may legally pass through green lights only to encounter pedestrians crossing against the signal, or motorists may overtake without considering oncoming traffic. Collisions are frequently avoided only by last-second braking or swerving.",
    "Road discipline is critical for safety. Education and enforcement must go hand in hand: punishment without awareness is ineffective. Ignorance or disregard of rules inevitably leads to accidents. In Sri Lanka, traffic laws grant priority to the right, yet these rules are routinely ignored\u2014even by police. Roundabouts are often clogged because drivers fail to observe this basic principle.",
    "For traffic police, enforcing right-of-way and other core rules must be a top priority, especially during peak hours. Suspending enforcement during busy periods allows overtaking on the wrong side, lane violations, and pedestrian violations\u2014creating chaos rather than improving flow. Such practices normalise lawlessness, sending the wrong message to the public and endangering lives.",
    "Raising public awareness on road discipline and its contribution to safety is central to reducing Sri Lanka\u2019s alarming accident rate. Education must go beyond rules to emphasise shared responsibility among drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. Campaigns should be broadcast on television and radio during peak hours in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, with regular features in newspapers.",
    "Driver education and testing must be strengthened, with stricter penalties linked to retraining and greater emphasis on vehicle maintenance. Enforcement must also improve. Traffic officers often target isolated violations while neglecting right-of-way enforcement, a leading cause of accidents. Speed traps are frequently set in areas unrelated to risk, fueling public suspicion that fines serve revenue or corrupt purposes. Laws exist to save lives\u2014not generate income.",
    "Speed limits should be clearly posted every 0.5 km, using lampposts or similar infrastructure to minimie costs. Speed checks should only occur where signage is visible. Regulations must be modernised, widely communicated, and made compulsory for online reading by existing drivers. Road safety education should be integrated into school curricula.",
    "Driver training should be expanded to include structured programmes, online simulations, public awareness campaigns, and unbiased technology, such as automated speed cameras and solar-powered warning signs, even in rural areas. Traffic officers must undergo annual training, with completion considered in promotions.",
    "Rules without understanding are ineffective. Helmet laws, for example, save lives only if helmets are worn correctly. Educational videos should clearly explain both rules and reasoning, using engaging audio-visual content to change public behaviour.",
    "Exemptions must be applied fairly. Disabled citizens should receive official badges, but clergy or foreigners should not receive special treatment. Road safety rules exist to protect all, and enforcement must reflect that principle.",
    "Road safety relies not only on enforcement but also on responsible self-regulation by road users. Legalising authenticated video evidence\u2014such as dashcam, CCTV, or smartphone footage\u2014would allow the public to participate in reporting traffic violations.",
    "Incentives could further encourage self-policing. Citizens who help identify offenders might receive a share of collected fines, turning ordinary road users into active partners in safety and fostering a culture of accountability.",
    "A major contributor to road accidents in Sri Lanka is the prevalence of unlicensed and uninsured drivers. Tackling this issue requires stricter enforcement and a fundamental shift in insurance practices.",
    "Digitising licensing and insurance systems would provide real-time access to records at the roadside or through number-plate recognition cameras, enabling instant verification while reducing congestion and opportunities for corruption. Penalties should combine fines with mandatory training, deterring repeat violations and raising driver competence.",
    "A shift from vehicle-based to driver-based insurance is essential. Repeat offenders and accident-prone drivers would face higher premiums\u2014a model proven effective in other countries. This would create financial incentives for responsible driving, particularly for high-risk groups like private bus drivers and young, newly licensed motorists.",
    "Although Sri Lanka\u2019s road infrastructure has improved over the past three decades, sustained development and regular maintenance remain essential.",
    "Pedestrian footpaths, marked crossings, and dedicated cycle lanes in densely populated areas. Crossings longer than two lanes should have central refuge islands.",
    "School zones with time-based speed limits (e.g., 30 km/h during school hours).",
    "Clearly marked bus stops and safe drop-off zones for children.",
    "Physical improvements must be complemented by education. Introducing road safety lessons in schools, as practised in developed countries, would instil safe habits early and reshape road culture over time.",
    "Lowering speed can reduce accidents, but inconsistent speed\u2014rather than high speed itself\u2014is often the primary risk. Highways with consistent speeds (100\u2013120 km/h) typically record fewer crashes than urban areas.",
    "In urban zones, speed limits should be consistently enforced, with school zones reduced to 30 km/h during peak hours and supported by flashing lights. Both over-speeding and under-speeding on highways must be penalised, ensuring a predictable and safe traffic flow. Consistency\u2014not merely lower speeds\u2014is key to reducing accidents and unnecessary congestion.",
    "Poorly maintained vehicles significantly contribute to accidents. Current checks, often limited to emissions, are insufficient and vulnerable to corruption.",
    "Annual inspections should rigorously assess brakes, tyres, lights, wipers, and overall safety, with strict enforcement. An independent investigation of high-accident zones is essential, as the root causes often extend beyond road surfaces.",
    "Private bus operators often endanger lives through reckless competition. Hazardous practices include dangerous overtaking and the use of illegal hand signals by assistants on the footboard.",
    "Strict timetables and designated stops must be enforced. Only licensed drivers should operate buses, and assistants travelling on footboards must be banned. Bus parking should be limited to designated areas outside town centres. Safety\u2014not competition\u2014should guide passenger transport policies.",
    "Traffic congestion often prompts rule violations. Even minor obstructions\u2014such as illegal parking, reversing lorries onto the main road, improper turns, or construction-related misuse\u2014can create bottlenecks.",
    "Traffic regulations should never be suspended to \u201cimprove flow.\u201d Consistent enforcement, adherence to signage, and proper planning for road closures are essential to maintain safety and efficiency.",
    "National traffic data alone cannot reveal the true causes of accidents. A Traffic Safety Performance Index tailored to each police division would identify regional strengths and weaknesses, compare performance, and share best practices.",
    "Data collection must include vehicle flows, accidents, convictions, and educational initiatives, standardised against population density and road usage. This enables proactive, data-driven management and accountability.",
    "To create a sustained, long-term strategy, the Ministry of Transport, Road Safety Institute, and Traffic Police should adopt the PRIOR Framework:",
    "P \u2013 Planning: Identify accident-prone areas, high-risk behaviours, and infrastructure gaps. Prioritise interventions.",
    "R \u2013 Preparation: Train personnel, upgrade roads, install signage, operationalise vehicle inspections, digitise licensing and insurance systems, and prepare public campaigns.",
    "I \u2013 Implementation: Enforce traffic laws consistently. Utilise technology (such as speed cameras and dashcams) and combine penalties with corrective education.",
    "O \u2013 Oversight: Monitor traffic systems, congestion, and enforcement. Conduct independent audits.",
    "R \u2013 Review & Reform: Regularly assess outcomes, update strategies, and implement innovations like driver-based insurance, time-based speed limits, and pedestrian-focused urban planning.",
