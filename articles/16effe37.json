    "During the first eight months of 2024, tea production saw a year-on-year decline, primarily due to unfavourable dry weather in March and April. However, production recovered in the subsequent months as weather conditions improved. Rubber production, although increasing steadily at the start of the year, experienced a year-on-year drop from January to August, largely due to adverse weather that affected tapping operations, particularly in the second quarter. In contrast, coconut production registered a year-on-year growth during the first eight months of 2024, including in August, according to the Weekly Economic Indicators Report of the Central Bank.",
    "Further according to the report, in September 2024, Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indices indicated expansions in both Manufacturing and Services activities, on a month-on-month basis.",
    "Between 12th October and 18th October, 2024, crude oil prices exhibited a largely declining trend. Prices fell owing to easing fears surrounding the Middle East conflicts, the OPEC\u2019s lowered outlook for global oil demand growth in 2024 and 2025 and investor concerns about China\u2019s demand. Overall, Brent and WTI prices fell by US dollars 3.28 and US dollars 3.61 per barrel, respectively, during this period.",
