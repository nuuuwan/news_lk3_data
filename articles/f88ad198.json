    "Officers from Sanasa Life Insurance, Colombo-Re Insurance Brokers, and Carekleen at the MoU signing ceremony",
    "Stemming from its ethics of supporting the underprivileged, Sanasa Life Insurance has revolutionised the insurance landscape by providing various innovative and affordable insurance solutions. It is with this background that Sanasa Life Insurance partnered with Colombo-Re Ltd., and Carekleen Ltd., to bring yet another insurance policy to provide an affordable insurance scheme for the employees of Carekleen.",
    "With over 36 years in the sanitation and cleaning industry, Carekleen is supported by its dedicated workforce of 1,800 employees, who undertake demanding labour-intensive work. Given the nature of their work, employees are exposed to the risk of occupational hazards daily. These workers come from underprivileged backgrounds. As a consequence of their economic situation, they could easily face devastating challenges in managing unforeseen circumstances, such as the breadwinner in the family losing his or her life. It is with this in mind that Sanasa Life Insurance came up with a tailor-made insurance scheme that addresses the risks these workers face.",
    "This groundbreaking and cost-effective insurance policy provides employees with life and funeral coverage for an annual premium of a modest Rs. 800.",
    "To commence the introduction of this specialised life policy, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed among the three organisations. The MoU was formalised through the signatures of Sanasa Life Insurance Chief Executive Officer Ivan Nicholas, Colombo-Re Insurance Brokers Ltd. Chief Executive Officer and Principal Officer Roshini Silva, and Carekleen Ltd. Managing Director Jehan Fernando.",
    "\u201cWe are proud to play a significant role in this organisational partnership that secures the future of low-income earners. Insurance is an evolving field and we have been able to evolve with it, creating innovative solutions geared to meet the financial capabilities of our clients and helping them during times of need,\u201d said Nicholas.",
    "This collaboration between these three organisations is a commitment to bring about a change for the better, assuring underprivileged individuals are provided with extended support by their employers.",
    "\u201cAn organisation\u2019s greatest asset is its employees. At Carekleen, we maintain this as a core ethic, aspiring to do as much as we can to enhance the lives of our employees. Enabling an insurance policy that they can easily afford is such an initiative. We express our sincere gratitude to Sanasa Life Insurance and Colombo-Re for this innovative insurance scheme, which aligns seamlessly with our commitment to enhancing the well-being of our employees,\u201d explained Fernando.",
    "This scheme provides a comprehensive cover in the event of loss of life during their employment period at Carekleen. Connecting Carekleen and Sanasa Life Insurance to bring about this unique solution, Colombo-Re Insurance Brokers played the intermediary role.",
    "\u201cBeing able to play a pivotal role in this structure of an innovative insurance policy and its implementation is our pride and joy. We, as an organisation, embrace the ethics that Sanasa Life Insurance abides by, and are glad to bring this specialised insurance policy to a truly deserving workforce,\u201d Silva explained.",
    "A notable benefit of this policy is its provision of financial security beyond the employee\u2019s immediate family, extending protection to extended relatives such as in-laws. The signing of the MoU between Sanasa life Insurance, Colombo-Re Brokers, and Carekleen marks yet another first in the field of insurance."
