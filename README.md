### Is intelligence in the right place?

*2024-10-11 06:16:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Is-intelligence-in-the-right-place/4-767811) · `en`

The need for proactive intelligence to prevent incidents like the Easter Sunday attacks cannot be overstated

witness that men, consciously—that is, fully understanding their real interests—have left them in the background and rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness.

Given the recent political changes the country has experienced, the writer senses a need to reproduce this article (which was published previously). At a time when the track record and performance of the country’s intelligence services and law enforcement agencies have been debated in the public sphere, and with the appointment of a new Chief of State Intelligence, the writer feels it is pertinent to re-examine this interesting, albeit somewhat “murky,” subject.

Renegotiating parts of IMF’s economic recovery program underlined the campaign platforms of AKD and his NPP teammates right from the beginning. While RW was bragging about his record of stabilising the economy and restarting growth, AKD was questioning the benefits of that growth to the citizenry. RW’s answer was that they may have to wait until 2048 to enjoy the splendour of his high-tech export miracle. In other words, their debate was about one of the fundamental controversies in economics of development between growth and equity.
