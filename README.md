Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism requested all Sri Lankan nationals in Nepal to remain vigilant and adhere to the advice of local authorities in view of the prevailing situation.

### Sri Lanka electricity utility seeks 6.8-pct tariff increase

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has sought a 6.8 percent tariff hike, spread uniformly across consumer groups, according to a public consultation document published by the regulator.

The increase is sought mostly on account of higher demand forecast being met by thermal energy, the regulator said.

There were also some work-in-progress and finance costs, including capital repayments and some penalty interest due to renewable energy suppliers.

The CEB has proposed spreading the increase evenly across consumer groups.

Sri Lanka has highly discriminatory pricing, with the regulator and utility picking winners and losers with wide gaps.

Among the worst hit are houses with higher usage (domestic demand does go up in the night peak) and general purpose customers. However, hotels also use power in the night.

Under the current pricing system, cross subsidizing consumers are permitted. (Colombo/Sept10/2025)

### SriLankan Airlines suspends flights to Nepal

*2025-09-10 11:09:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112349/srilankan-airlines-suspends-flights-to-nepal) · `en`

SriLankan Airlines announced that all flights to Nepal have been temporarily suspended until further notice.

Most airlines, including Indian carriers, have suspended flights after Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu was forced to shut down on Tuesday afternoon amid escalating violence in the country, grounding hundreds of passengers and cancelling multiple services.

Indian media reported that as the day progressed and the situation worsened, multiple Kathmandu-bound flights hovered near the city before diverting or returning to India. Subsequently, airlines suspended flights.

By Tuesday afternoon, Nepal aviation authorities issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) about Kathmandu airport being closed. Now flights can resume only after this NOTAM is lifted.

The airport’s closure has disrupted more than 250 daily flights that the airport usually handles, spanning carriers such as Air India, IndiGo, Fly Dubai, Air Arabia, Singapore Airlines and Batik Air.
