  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) states that there will be no revision of electricity tariffs for 2024, citing delays in the submission of necessary proposals by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).",
    "The PUCSL Corporate Communications Director, Jayanath Herath pointed out that the CEB submitted an initial set of tariff revision proposals at the end of September. However, the PUCSL deemed the proposed reductions insufficient and requested a revised submission by November 8.",
    "Despite the initial deadline, the CEB sought multiple extensions, most recently requesting an additional two weeks after failing to meet the extended deadline of November 22. Consequently, the PUCSL has planned to grant an extension until December 6.",
    "Even if the CEB submits the revised proposals on December 6, the PUCSL clarified that it would take six to eight weeks to review and finalize the tariff adjustments. As a result, any potential revisions to electricity tariffs will be postponed to 2025."
