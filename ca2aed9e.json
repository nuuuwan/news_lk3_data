    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has seen a surge of containers being cleared ahead of a value added tax hike on imports, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said, but made no mention of protected domestic businesses which have been engaged in the practice for decades.",
    "Containers being cleared each day has risen from around 700 to 1,000, he said.",
    "Importers were trying to beat the January deadline when many imports would be subject to an 18 percent tax.",
    "The idea was a trick (upakramaya) to sell at the import VAT plus price after the tax hike, he claimed.",
    "Selling at border tax plus prices is known as \u2018tax arbitrage.\u2019",
    "However, VAT is neutral on imports and domestic sales and VAT on the full sale price will have to be paid from January, with no \u2018input credit\u2019 for taxes charged at the point of import.",
    "The benefit importers will get is higher sales if they are able to sell before December 31 at lower prices or better cashflows as the input credit does not have to be paid.",
    "Protected import substitution and \u2018domestic production\u2019 business which have been selling for years at import duty plus prices, arbitraging billions of rupees of taxes.",
    "Protected business, including in steel, ceramic products, as well as producers and collectors of basic foods like rice and maize have been engaging in the practice for decades.",
    "Unlike protected business importers will get caught to VAT on the sale price if they sell after December, as value added tax is a superior tax which is neutral on imports and domestic sales.",
    "Protected businesses are also engaging in permanent tax arbitrage with the blessings of economic nationalists and politicians. (Colombo/Dec30/2023)"
