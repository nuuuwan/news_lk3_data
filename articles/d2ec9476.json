  "original_body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation has issued an extraordinary gazette notification mandating the use of seat belts for all occupants of vehicles traveling on expressways.",
    "The regulation, signed and announced by Minister Bimal Rathnayake, stipulates that both drivers and passengers seated in the rear must wear seat belts at all times while on expressways.",
    "This marks a significant expansion of previous safety requirements, which primarily focused on front-seat passengers.",
    "According to the gazette, every vehicle must be equipped with a standardized seat belt system comprising three anchoring points: one belt running diagonally across the chest, another horizontally across the lap, and a third securing the side of the torso.",
    "These specifications aim to ensure maximum protection in the event of a collision or sudden deceleration."
