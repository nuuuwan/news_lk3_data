Australian police have declared Monday’s stabbing at a Sydney church a religiously motivated “terrorist act”.

A 16-year-old boy was arrested after a bishop, a priest and churchgoers were attacked during mass at the Assyrian Christ The Good Shepherd Church.

### Sri Lanka could get hit from a disorderly US tumble

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is recovering fast but the country could get hit from an unravelling of advanced economies, particularly the United States, which is skating on very thin ice, after exceptionally bad monetary policy, which has destroyed fiscal metrics as well.

The US was running bad to atrocious monetary policy since 2001, when Ben Bernanke misled Alan Greenspan into printing money to run an 8-year cycle, firing a commodity and housing bubble which collapsed after rates were kept at around 5 percent for about a year.

That was the end of the Great Moderation started by Paul Volcker and continued with some skill under Greenspan, until the Fed was infected by Bernanke, the depression scholar. Keynes was also a ‘depression scholar’, in essence.

Gold prices fell from 800 to 284 dollars an ounce under Volcker-Bernanke, until Bernanke cooked up a false deflation scare with a healthy banking system and started to reverse it, firing the housing bubble and the Great Recession in its wake.

Chocolatier Mendis points out shortage of cocoa beans and poor cooperation of authorities as key challenges

Says local growers stand to gain higher prices, due to limited availability of cocoa globally

Sri Lanka’s celebrity chocolatier, chef and agriculture enthusiast Gerard Mendis faces an uphill battle in his bid to take single-origin Sri Lankan chocolates global. This is primarily due to the shortage of cocoa beans and absence of active cooperation of authorities.

“In Sri Lanka, we have our own cocoa beans but we don’t have a sufficient quantity to cater to the demand of the local market. I took some (local) cocoa beans to a factory in Switzerland. Their feedback was that it (Sri Lankan cocoa) was one of the best they had ever tried and were keen on getting more. Unfortunately, we don’t have the quantity,” Mendis told Mirror Business.

### Central Bank’s March dollar purchases hit record high

The Central Bank has purchased the most amount of dollars for a single month in March, a sign that the country is currently in a very comfortable position in its foreign currency liquidity, after two years into the worst currency crisis in the country.

According to the data released last week, the Central Bank purchased US $ 715.1 million in March, which is the highest ever in the last decade. While the monetary watchdog sold none, the dollar purchase is a sharp increase from the roughly US $ 240 million purchased from the banking system in February, on a net basis.

In January, the Central Bank purchased US $ 245.3 million and thus, the March net absorptions brought the first three months’ purchases to US $ 1,199.0 million.

The Central Bank later last month said it would intervene in the foreign currency market to prevent excessive volatility, as the rupee has in recent times appreciated quite significantly after it plunged to its lowest levels in 2022.

### Political accounts in the presidential election

*2024-04-16 01:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181186) · `ta`

Minority parties, including Tamil, Muslim, and Upcountry groups, are negotiating political deals for influence, focusing on parliamentary victories and ministerial positions. Douglas Devananda, a key figure in the North, supports Ranil, influenced by past support from the TNA and his desire for autonomy. Ranil's potential support from SKK members and the All Ceylon People's Congress could secure his position in the UNP. Despite this, the UNP's chances in parliamentary elections are slim, leading to a strategic shift. Ranil is firm in the Vanni district, potentially leaving the PA for the UNP, with no immediate crisis for the UNP in Vanni. The Eastern Province's support for Ranil is also noted, with plans for ministry status in future elections. Other parties, including the Ceylon Workers Congress and the Tamil Progressive Alliance, have their positions, with the latter supporting Sajith. The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) plans to boycott the presidential election in the North and East, highlighting the complexity of uniting Tamil parties.

🟩

The minority nationals, the Tamil, Muslim and Upcountry parties, have put political accounts for bargains in accordance with their influence, like the political account centered on the main candidates of Ranil, Sajith and Anura.

In particular, all these parties make a final resolution, focusing on their victories in the parliamentary election, and the ministry and the ministry of the Ministry of State.

In that respect, Douglas Devananda in the North took a decision to support Ranil before the political parties or individuals in the country decided.. There are two reasons for this.

The first reason was during the 2015 regime change, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) supported the Ranil Federation. Even if Ranil wanted to incorporate Douglas, the federation did not allow it.

Even if the federation is currently in action, its membership parties are still in operation;Douglas may have thought it was appropriate to announce resolutions before such conditions occur.

### Nettles Needing To Be Grasped By Future Leaders Of Sri Lanka

The New Year celebrations this year were low key compared to the past. The loud sound of crackers and other fireworks that traditionally accompany the dawn of the New Year were less than in the past. The economic burden on the people has begun to tell and was evident in the reduced purchase of new clothes and other items in preparation for the New Year. It can be surmised that the general population has less savings to utilize due to those savings being consumed in earlier months when people’s expenditures exceeded their income. The latest World Bank publication titled ‘World Bank Update: Bridges to Recovery’ released on April 2 shows that poverty has increased over the past four years—from 11 percent in 2019 to almost 26 percent in 2024 in Sri Lanka. According to it, approximately 60 percent of Sri Lankan households have decreased incomes, with many facing increased food insecurity, malnutrition and stunted growth.

*2024-04-16 00:56:41* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/India-lifts-export-ban-on-onions-for-Sri-Lanka/34-760643) · `en`

In a gesture reaffirming India’s commitment to its Neighbourhood First policy, the Government of India has announced the lifting of the export ban on onions for Sri Lanka.

Under the new directive issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, Sri Lanka is now permitted to import up to 10,000 tons of onions from India.

The decision to exempt Sri Lanka from the export ban on onions underscores the close bilateral ties between the two countries and comes as a timely move ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year festivities in Sri Lanka.

SJB leader shares his vision at National Conference and Policy Dialogue Forum of the Samagi Buddhi Mandapaya featuring host of professionals who highlighted scientific and practical policies to rebuild Sri Lanka

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader and Presidential hopeful Sajith Premadasa on 7 April took the stage at the SJB National Conference with a clear message for the audience: “He stands apart from other politicians in Sri Lanka today.”

In fact, while the event was organised to outline the party’s future policies, Premadasa in his speech made a concerted effort to distinguish himself from the current political system and issued a clarion call for the rejection of politicians he labelled as “classists, communists, and extremists.”

Though he failed to explicitly name these “classists, communists, and extremists,” Premadasa asserted that these groups are incapable of delivering the essential economic and social reforms the country desperately needs.

### Is the Indian Ocean “Zone of Peace” sinking in troubled waters?

UNITED NATIONS (IDN) – Just after a group of mercenaries tried to unsuccessfully oust the government of Maldives in 1979, I asked a Maldivian diplomat, using a military jargon, about the strength of his country’s “standing army.”

“Standing army?”, the UN diplomat asked with mock surprise, and remarked perhaps jokingly, “We don’t even have a sitting army.”

With a population of about 250,000, in a bygone era, (currently over 500,000), the Maldives was perhaps one of the world’s few countries, along with Costa Rica, with no armed forces, fighter planes, combat helicopters, warships, missiles or battle tanks.

As a result, the island’s fragile defences attracted a rash of free-lance mercenaries and bounty hunters who tried to take over the country twice-- once in 1979, and a second time in 1988.

World Bank and the IMF are not unaware of the economic devastation caused by their policies

The World Bank and the IMF Spring meetings begin this week in Washington. And with the worst sovereign debt crisis in decades, the pronouncements at these meetings will be monitored closely by many for the relief that debt-distressed countries in the Global South can expect. However, regardless of what is discussed and announced, the policies of the World Bank and the IMF will continue to safeguard the interests of global finance capital to the detriment of the social and economic lives of the people affected by the debt crisis.

### CBK’s case against Sirisena and moral suitability of politicians

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which ruled the country alone and under coalitions for the most part (40 years) of the 76 years since  independence is currently entangled in the second toughest leadership feud in its history. The first leadership tussle occurred in early 1980s, soon after the World’s first Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was deprived of her civic rights.

Interestingly, both conflicts involved a female member of the Bandaranaike family and a person by the name of Maithripala – the first tussle was between Sirimavo Bandaranaike and a former minister Maithripala Senanayake and the second between former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena. Both battles went to courts.

### Prioritise building inclusive social protection system: ADB tells Sri Lanka

*2024-04-16 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Prioritise-building-inclusive-social-protection-system-ADB-tells-Sri-Lanka/108-280728) · `en`

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) stressed that for Sri Lanka, the near-term priority during economic recovery is to lay institutional and structural frameworks for an inclusive social protection system.

In the absence of a cohesive social protection strategy and governance mechanism, programmes in the past have been fragmented, with low coverage, poor targeting, high inclusion and exclusion errors and low payments, the ADB said in its annual flagship economic publication, the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) April 2024.

In 2023, the government introduced the Aswesuma programme to consolidate over 25 state-sponsored cash-transfer programmes that were previously managed by several government agencies.

The ADB asserted that this programme could be further strengthened with increased individual support, better forward planning and an effective graduation mechanism with technical and life skill training, better financial literacy education and enhanced social and financial inclusion.

### Debate Over Profits Of Banks: Who Shares Them Ultimately? – Part II

*2024-04-15 23:30:52* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/debate-over-profits-of-banks-who-shares-them-ultimately-part-ii/) · `en`

A reader of the Part I of this article has brought to my notice that banks should make profits, in addition to the reasons mentioned earlier, to support them when they are financially insolvent. This argument has validity in the current legal context in Sri Lanka. It is the accepted policy of the Parliamentarians in Sri Lanka, as revealed in the new Central Bank Act and the Banking (Special Provisions) Act that when banks get into insolvency, they should not be rescued through printing of new money by the Central Bank. Section 6 of the Central Bank Act has stipulated that the primary objective of the bank is to achieve and maintain ‘domestic price stability’ and ‘the other objective’ shall be to secure ‘financial system stability’.
