    "COLOMBO (News 1st); In a decisive move to address service disruptions and improve efficiency within the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera has announced a crackdown on employee misconduct.",
    "\"Instructions have been given to the CEB management to suspend and take appropriate disciplinary action against any employee that disrupts the services or acts in violation of the guidelines issued by the CEB management,\" declared Minister Wijesekera in a firm statement.",
    "Looking ahead, the Minister unveiled plans for sweeping reforms at the CEB.",
    "\"The proposed reforms of CEB will be presented to the Parliament with amendments for approval,\" he stated.",
    "These reforms, expected to be comprehensive and forward-thinking, aim to streamline operations, optimize resource allocation, and enhance the CEB's overall effectiveness.",
    "\"The CEB will also submit the electricity tariff reduction proposal to PUCSL (Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka) next week,\" he announced.",
    "This development follows the announcement of a planned protest by the Ceylon Electricity Boards Joint Trade Union Alliance, starting today outside the CEB headquarters. The union, led by Ranjan Jayalal, vehemently opposes the proposed bill, fearing it will \"split the CEB into 12 parts and sell them,\" jeopardizing the future of the sector and national security.",
    "The government, however, maintains the bill aims to improve efficiency and attract foreign investment to the struggling power industry.",
    "Earlier in the day, the Acting General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has issued a circular cancelling all leave for CEB workers until further notice. This comes as electricity workers across the country prepare to launch a three-day protest campaign against the proposed Sri Lanka Electricity Bill.",
    "The circular cites an extraordinary gazette notification that designates the supply of electricity as an essential service. To ensure \"uninterrupted service,\" it states that all leave for CEB workers is cancelled, effective January 2nd, 2024. However, the circular allows for exceptions in cases of emergency, as approved by the relevant Executive Officer.",
