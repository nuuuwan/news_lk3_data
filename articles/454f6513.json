    "South Korea\u2019s main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened.",
    "The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s short-lived bid to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that he partly blamed on the opposition\u2019s propensity to impeach government officials.",
    "Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday.",
    "The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s failed bid to impose martial law.",
    "It said Han was acting against the will of the people, effectively aiding Yoon, whose powers have been suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
    "Once an impeachment bill is submitted then formally introduced at a plenary session, it must be voted on within 24 to 72 hours.",
    "If Han is impeached, the finance minister would be next in line to lead the government as acting president, according to South Korean law.",
    "Prime Minister Han took over from the suspended Yoon, who faces a Constitutional Court review on whether to oust him or restore his powers.",
    "\u201cActing president Han made it clear at today\u2019s cabinet meeting that he would not greenlight the special prosecution law,\u201d the DP\u2019s Park said.",
    "\u201cThere is no way to interpret it other than that he is delaying time.\u201d",
    "With its parliamentary majority, the DP passed bills this month to appoint a special counsel to pursue charges of insurrection, among others, against the conservative Yoon, and to investigate his wife over a luxury bag scandal and other allegations.",
    "An unnamed high-ranking official from Han\u2019s office called the DP\u2019s move to impeach Han \u201chighly regrettable\u201d, the Newsis news agency said.",
    "\u201cThe international community is currently supporting the acting president system ... Impeachment could undermine that trust, and adversely affect the economy,\u201d Newsis cited the official as saying.",
    "Yoon\u2019s ruling People Power Party (PPP) has accused the DP of threatening to topple the government for not complying with their demands, at a time when South Korea\u2019s key ally the United States has just restarted planned communications with the country under Han\u2019s stewardship.",
    "Yoon has yet to announce his legal team or appear publicly since a televised statement on Dec. 14, the day parliament impeached him.",
    "Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that Yoon is unlikely to appear for questioning on Wednesday, Christmas Day, in answer to a summons by authorities investigating his move to impose martial law."
