  "original_body_lines": [
    "PickMe has announced its expansion into the entertainment and lifestyle sector with the launch of a QR code ticketing system for events. The new feature allows users to discover, book, and access concerts, theatre, cultural festivals, and educational events, seamlessly through the PickMe app.",
    "Over the past decade, PickMe has grown from a pioneering ride-hailing tech service into a key player in Sri Lanka\u2019s shared economy. The company has expanded its tech capabilities to facilitate services across mobility (cars, three-wheelers, bikes), food and grocery delivery and logistics, including parcel delivery services, and is now entering the events and cultural space to further enhance the country\u2019s digital ecosystem.",
    "PickMe CEO Jiffry Zulfer said, \u201cOur vision goes beyond mobility. We want to be the platform that connects people with experiences that enrich their lives. Today, it\u2019s hard for people to even know what\u2019s happening in their own city. Whether it\u2019s a stand-up comedy, a Shakespearean play, or a local concert, discovery is fragmented. With PickMe\u2019s new events platform, users can easily discover what\u2019s on, purchase tickets digitally through independent event organisers, and get to the venue in one seamless journey.\u201d",
    "The QR code based ticketing feature offers significant benefits for both consumers and independent event organisers. For consumers its hassle-free digital tickets, instant access without queues, and the convenience of booking rides and managing event tickets on the same app. For organisers, the benefits are real-time sales visibility, upfront revenue access, easy redemption with a smartphone, and post-event analytics on audience demographics and attendance.",
    "PickMe\u2019s entry into events also aligns with the company\u2019s broader mission to increase the \u2018soft power\u2019 of Sri Lankan cities, making them more vibrant, connected, and attractive to residents, tourists, and returning expatriates.",
    "\u201cBy promoting entertainment and cultural events, we are helping to light up the city and boost tourism,\u201d Zulfer added. \u201cJust as our platform encouraged new entrepreneurs to set up dark kitchens, we believe it will inspire more event organisers to build businesses around culture and entertainment. This is not just about making events more accessible, it\u2019s about energising urban life and uplifting the local economy.\u201d",
    "The move also supports Sri Lanka\u2019s digital transformation agenda, creating new opportunities for data-driven city planning, tourism promotion, and inclusive growth.",
    "With over 10 million registered users, PickMe will leverage its vast reach to support event promotion, giving organisers direct access to large, diverse audiences. The company also envisions expanding QR ticketing to historic and cultural sites in the near future, which will allow tourists and locals to pre-book entry digitally, further enhancing convenience and efficiency.",
    "Zulfer emphasised that provincial governors and city mayors must see this as an opportunity to encourage event organisers to connect with digital platforms. Such platforms not only make it easier for visitors from abroad to discover and attend events, but also enable people from other towns and districts to participate through simple digital ticketing. He added that policymakers share the responsibility of enhancing the soft power of cities by creating supportive systems that actively encourage such cultural and entertainment activities.",
    "PickMe Events was officially launched on 1 September 2025, marking its entry into the entertainment space by becoming the exclusive ticketing partner for \u201cNe-Yo Live in Concert,\u201d by Brown Boy Presents. The event\u2019s early bird tickets were sold out in three minutes flat, and 25% of the event was sold within just 24 hours, setting a record for a Sri Lankan ticketing platform. This milestone partnership positioned PickMe as the sole digital gateway for fans to secure tickets to one of the year\u2019s biggest shows.",
    "PickMe will also power the end-to-end digital ticketing for the Colombo Book Fair, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest literary gathering, along with a series of other key events in the coming months. By doing so, PickMe reinforces its commitment to connecting people not only to rides and food but also to the cultural heartbeat of the nation."
