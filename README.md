### AKD should not try out RW‚Äôs failed ‚ÄòVel Palama‚Äô to cross to the other side

AKD cannot waste his time by seeking to cross the cliff by walking through the unstable Vel Palama as suggested by Ranil

The weakness in this Vel Palama equation is that it seeks to resolve the economic issues faced by the country at that time through a conventional method. It is a ‚Äòwithin-the-frame solution‚Äô. When you see a difficulty and there is a conventional way to overcome that difficulty, you follow it without considering its efficacy or timeliness or costs. Economic strategists seek to resolve the issues by looking for solutions outside the frame. This is true for military strategists as well

I attribute RW‚Äôs defeat to a distinct lack of empathy which impaired his ability to understand the needs, hardships, feelings, yearnings, and thoughts of a significant component of the population, these being the low-income earners and the lower middle-income earners. Opinions may differ but facts are stubborn. The Achilles heel of RW in many past elections, both presidential and general, has been his inability to respond to the needs of the common person. AKD, on the other hand, understood them perfectly and his message was astutely crafted to tugging at the heart strings of this section of the population, a section which had been disadvantaged over many years by elitist thinking

### A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Lebanon

An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Israel still battles Hamas a year after the group‚Äôs Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks further drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.
