    "The commission stated that although the decisions of the commission regarding the appeals received in relation to the annual transfers for the year 2024 have been notified so far, further requests are being made from various parties regarding the matter.",
    "As a result, some of the transfer cycles given under the Annual Transfers have not been implemented and therefore other officers in the relevant transfer cycles have been prejudiced, the commission highlighted, adding that the officers who are dissatisfied with the decisions given by the Public Service Commission in relation to annual transfers can submit their appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.",
