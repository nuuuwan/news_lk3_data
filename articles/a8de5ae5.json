    "Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday confirmed that the new Constitution will be introduced in three years, following an extensive dialogue with the public.",
    "Responding to a query at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he asserted the Government\u2019s commitment to ensuring widespread consultation and participatory governance.",
    "\u201cWe are planning to allow enough time for a dialogue with all the people,\u201d Dr. Jayatissa said.",
    "On 5 September, during a campaign rally in Jaffna, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pledged that a National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government would draft a new Constitution grounded in equality, democracy and participatory governance. He promised a referendum on the proposed Constitution and vowed to hold delayed Provincial Council and Local Government polls within a year. Additionally, he announced plans to establish a committee to investigate and address discrimination.",
    "Dissanayake highlighted the urgent need for a new Constitution, stating it would build upon efforts initiated by the 2015-2019 administration to address governance gaps and ensure inclusivity.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa extended an invitation to the public to submit proposals and solutions through Local Government bodies, Provincial Councils and administrative systems, implying these inputs will help shape discussions on power devolution.",
    "\u201cThen we can discuss and determine whether Provincial Councils should be reformed or retained as they are. Otherwise, we cannot decide to abolish or maintain them without public input,\u201d he explained.",
    "The draft Constitution will aim to devolve power across Local Government bodies, districts and provinces. It will also ensure political representation for all ethnicities, assuring inclusivity at every level of governance.",
    "The Cabinet Spokesman said till the new Constitution is enacted, the Government will continue to operate Provincial Councils with their current powers. \u201cAt the moment, we are running the Provincial Councils with the existing powers \u2013 no additions or omissions,\u201d Dr. Jayatissa clarified."
