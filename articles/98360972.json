    "The Parliamentary Staff Advisory Committee has reportedly decided to consider a proposal to arm the MPs and other people\u2019s representatives\u2014not with lethal weapons but with knowledge and skills! It has, at a recent meeting chaired by Speaker Dr. Jagath Wikramaratne, decided to consider converting the Speaker\u2019s official residence into a centre for parliamentary studies and research, which will serve as an exclusive hub for the MPs, Provincial Council members and Local Government councillors. The proposed outfit is expected to provide the MPs and others with access to advanced research resources, specialised training, and policy analysis thereby strengthening legislative and governance capacities across all levels of government.",
    "The Speaker\u2019s official residence is an Ozymandian edifice, and the public, who paid for its construction and maintains it, will surely gain from its conversion into a research hub. However, it will require a great deal of funds and other resources, especially experts drawn from various fields to run a research institute of that magnitude. Will the government be able to allocate enough funds for the project? There has been a proposal to seek funds from international organisations like the UNDP and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. We thought the NPP government was keen to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign aid!",
    "The government may be able to overcome most of the issues it is bound to encounter along the way if the institute to be set up is affiliated to the postgraduate institution of a national university. There are also many research outfits under various ministries, and they will also be able to help the proposed institute.",
    "The need to equip the people\u2019s representatives with knowledge and skills to carry out their legislative functions better cannot be overstated. Thankfully, the current Parliament has a considerable number of members with impressive academic and professional qualifications. They will also be able to share their knowledge with their fellow MPs and others in a convivial environment away from the parliament if the proposed institute comes into being.",
    "While the proposed research hub is welcome, it remains to be seen how the government will ensure that the MPs and other elected representatives make the best use of it. An oft-heard complaint is that most MPs do not use even the well-equipped parliamentary library, which is easily accessible. This is one of the main reasons for the decline in the standards of parliamentary debates, which are characterised by rhetoric and insults.",
    "It will be incumbent upon the leaders of the political parties represented in Parliament to ensure that their MPs use the centre for parliamentary studies and research to be set up.",
