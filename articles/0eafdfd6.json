    "A spokesperson for the SLPP stated that letters informing of this decision will be forwarded to the relevant MPs as soon as possible.",
    "It is also mentioned that after taking disciplinary actions, the party membership of MPs who opposed the party\u2019s decision will be cancelled.",
    "The SLPP politburo recently met to discuss the party\u2019s approach to the presidential election. During the meeting, it was decided to nominate a candidate from the party and to suspend the membership of any member acting against the party\u2019s decisions, regardless of their position.",
    "It is reported that the party\u2019s politburo has been under significant pressure over the past few weeks to take immediate action against members who have opposed the party\u2019s stance. Many SLPP activists have requested the cancellation of the party membership of these MPs.",
