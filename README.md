### Kenya‚Äôs deputy president sacked while in hospital

Kenyan senators have voted to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office despite his failure to testify at his impeachment trial after his lawyer said he had been taken to hospital.

In one of the most dramatic days in Kenya‚Äôs recent political history, Gachagua had been due to appear in the Senate after lunch to defend himself, a day after he had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges.

However, Gachagua, popularly known as Riggy G, did not show up and his lawyer requested a postponement saying his client was suffering from chest pains and was being treated by doctors at The Karen Hospital.

Senators chose to continue the trial without him, prompting the defence team to leave the chamber.

The senators‚Äô refusal to delay proceedings until Saturday - as long as would have been legally allowed - shows how determined they were to get rid of Gachagua, several months after he fell out with President William Ruto.

First action he is to take, is to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections. During this period from dissolution to summoning new parliament, country would be ruled by an interim government, which will be constituted by members of the existing parliament.

### Eliminating Ethnic-Based Politics In Sri Lanka: A Path Toward National Unity

*2024-10-17 22:28:01* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/eliminating-ethnic-based-politics-in-sri-lanka-a-path-toward-national-unity/) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lanka, with its rich diversity of ethnicities, religions, and cultures, has long faced the challenge of balancing these identities in its political landscape. Ethnic-based politics, which has shaped much of the country‚Äôs history, continues to be a divisive force that hinders national unity, sustainable development, and long-term peace. Eliminating ethnic-based politics is essential for Sri Lanka‚Äôs progress toward a truly united, prosperous, and peaceful society.

Ethnic politics in Sri Lanka can be traced back to the colonial period, when the British promoted communal identities for administrative convenience. After independence in 1948, political parties began to align themselves along ethnic lines, leading to an entrenched system of division. The Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities were often pitted against one another as political elites manipulated ethnic tensions for electoral gains.

Also, a cursory look at the troubles brewing in the SJB would reveal that it is not just the old guard collapsing. It is, in fact, the entire machinery of the political opposition that is actually collapsing.
