    "There was a time when Amirthalingam was a hero to Tamil youths. He took the lead role in articulating the demand for a separate state called Tamil Eelam in 1976. However Amirthalingam had later downplayed the Tamil Eelam demand and opted for a power sharing arrangement in a united but not necessarily a unitary Sri Lanka. This angered the LTTE and fellow travellers who dubbed Amir as a traitor. The LTTE animosity towards Amirthalingam increased further due to his stance on the Indian army. It was against this backdrop that the assassination of Appapillai Amirthalingam occurred 36 years ago",
    "The first major assassination of a prominent political leader in Sri Lanka known formerly as Ceylon was in September 1959. The country was shocked when the serving Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was shot dead by a Buddhist monk Talduwe Somarama Thera. In later years there were many more assassinations of political leaders on either side of the ethnic divide. The political violence unleashed by various Tamil militant groups including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)\u2019s political violence and the counter violence of the State and its organs has resulted in a very large number of political leaders being killed over the years.",
    "An important chapter in the saga of political assassinations in Sri Lanka is the killing of well-known Tamil political leader Appapillai Amirthalingam on 13 July 1989. Hailing from Pannaaham in Jaffna, Appapillai Amirthalingam was born on 26 August 1927. He was a charismatic and dynamic politician who served for many years as the chief lieutenant of the respected Tamil leader S.J.V. Chelvanayagam known as the Gandhi of Eelam.",
    "Amirthalingam was a lawyer by profession and had been the Illankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) MP for Vaddukoddai from 1956 to 1970 and the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) MP for Kankesanthurai from 1977 to 1983. He held office as opposition leader from 1977 to 1983. In 1989, he was appointed MP on the TULF National List.",
    "The Indo-Lanka accord of 29 July 1987 between Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene had resulted in the Indian army known as the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) being stationed in the North and East of Sri Lanka. Soon war broke out between the LTTE and the Indian army. Meanwhile the presence of the Indian army in Sri Lanka was resented by many Sinhala people also. The JVP began a campaign of violence protesting the Indian army presence.",
    "Ranasinghe Premadasa who was earlier the Prime Minister succeeded J.R. Jayewardene as President in 1988. One of Premadasa\u2019s key campaign pledges was that he would ensure the exit of the Indian army if elected. After winning the presidency, Premadasa took the unorthodox step of initiating talks with the LTTE. There was a convergence of interests between President Premadasa and LTTE leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran as both wanted the Indian army to be withdrawn for different reasons.",
    "However many Tamils like Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) leader Amirthalingam wanted the Indian army to remain in Sri Lanka until the provisions of the Indo-Lanka Accord were implemented. It was the accord that enabled the setting up of Provincial Councils. While the Premadasa Government and the LTTE wanted the Indian army to be sent away, Amirthalingam opposed it. In June 1989 Amirthalingam eloquently argued in Parliament, that the Indian army should not be sent away from Sri Lanka at that juncture. It was the opinion of non-violent political leader Amirthalingam that carried greater clout internationally due to his political credentials and stature.",
    "There was a time when Amirthalingam was a hero to Tamil youths. He took the lead role in articulating the demand for a separate state called Tamil Eelam in 1976. However Amirthalingam had later downplayed the Tamil Eelam demand and opted for a power sharing arrangement in a united but not necessarily a unitary Sri Lanka. This angered the LTTE and fellow travellers who dubbed Amir as a traitor. The LTTE animosity towards Amirthalingam increased further due to his stance on the Indian army.",
    "It was against this backdrop that the assassination of Appapillai Amirthalingam occurred 36 years ago. I was in Canada when this happened. However, I have spoken at different times with different people connected to the TULF like the late M. Sivasithamparam, Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam, Sarojin Yogeswaran, Mangaiyarkkarasi Amirthalingam, Dr. Baheerathan Amirthalingam, V. Anandasangaree, P. Soosaithasan and Somasundaram (Mavai) Senathirajah about the incident. I have written about the Amirthalingam assassination in detail earlier on the basis of these conversations, interviews and related media reports. I now revisit the assassination with the aid of earlier writings even as Amirthalingam\u2019s 36th death anniversary on 13 July draws near.",
    "Amirthalingam and his wife Mangaiyarkkarasi were staying at 342/2, Bauddhaloka Mawatha/Bullers Road in Colombo 7. It belonged to a prominent Muslim businessman from Mannar engaged in the manufacture of garments. Apart from the Amirthalingams, former TULF President M. Sivasithamparam, ex-Jaffna MP V. Yogeswaran and his wife Sarojini and TULF youth wing chief Maavai Senathirajah were also staying there. Former Cabinet Minister Gamini Dissanayake took the initiative in ensuring the security of TULF leaders when he was a minister. Some Police officers attached to Mahaweli ministry were \u201cseconded\u201d for the protection of the TULF leaders.",
    "Meanwhile the LTTE began communicating with former Jaffna MP Yogeswaran. The Tigers wanted Yogeswaran to arrange a meeting with Amirthalingam to discuss overall Tamil unity. Yogeswaran in turn spoke to Amirthalingam and Sivasithamparam and obtained their consent for a meeting with the Tigers. The two Tigers in contact with Yogeswaran were Aloysius alias Wigna and Sivakumar alias Arivu. Yogeswaran informed them that a meeting could be held at Amirthalingam\u2019s Bullers Road residence itself.",
    "On Thursday, 13 July 1989, Aloysius rang Yogeswaran at about 10 a.m. and said the LTTE was amenable to the suggestion. The meeting was scheduled for 6 p.m. on the same day. Yogeswaran informed Amirthalingam and Sivasithamparam. There was a hitch as both of them had to attend a dinner hosted by the then Indian High Commissioner in Colombo Lekhan Lal Mehrotra at the Taj Samudra. Yogeswaran requested both TULF leaders to stay and meet the Tigers at 6 p.m. and then leave early for the Indian envoy\u2019s dinner. They agree to do so.",
    "Yogeswaran received a second telephone call from Aloysius at about 4 p.m. Aloysius said Narendran alias Yogi, the LTTE\u2019s political wing chief, was likely to participate in the meeting. Aloysius said the LTTE would be there between 6:30 and 7 p.m. and not at 6 p.m.as arranged earlier.",
    "He also had a request. Yogeswaran was asked to tell the security men not to frisk or search the LTTE team when it arrived as a leader of Yogi\u2019s stature would feel insulted by such acts. Yogeswaran was excited at the prospect of Yogi participating at the talks. He immediately instructed head of security Sub Inspector Thambirajah Kandasamy not to search the LTTE team scheduled to arrive in the evening because they would feel humiliated. Kandasamy demurred saying \u201cyou can\u2019t trust these fellows sir.\u201d Yogeswaran assured him that nothing would happen.",
    "Yogeswaran said a senior LTTE leader was expected and that he should not feel insulted. \u201cWe must treat them with respect as they are our guests. If they feel insulted they won\u2019t come in the future and our discussions will collapse,\u201d said Yoges. Kandasamy agreed somewhat reluctantly and instructed his subordinates accordingly.",
    "Yogeswaran and wife Sarojini along with Sivasithamparam were staying in the upper storey of the house while the Amirthalingams and Somasuntharam Senathirajah known as \u201cMavai\u201d were on the ground floor.",
    "It was 6:40 p.m. when the LTTE trio arrived in a yellow cab. Contrary to expectations, Yogi was not present. The three Tigers were Rasiah Aravintharaja alias Visu, Peter Leon Aloysius a.k.a. Vigna and Sivakumar alias Arivu. Police officer Sathyamoorthy who was manning the entrance allowed the trio to enter without searching them.",
    "Sathyamoorthy informed Kandasamy who told him to send the people up to meet Yogeswaran. Visu and Aloysius went up while Arivu positioned himself at the foot of the stairs. Yogeswaran was watching TV upstairs with his wife. Upon being told that the Tigers had come, he went down the stairs and met Visu and Aloysius halfway. Yogeswaran was disappointed that Yogi had not come but greeted Visu warmly.",
    "They sat down and chatted. Sarojini went to prepare refreshments. Yogeswaran sent a note through the servant boy Raju to Amirthalingam who along with his wife, Sivasithamparam and Senathirajah was also watching TV in another room downstairs. Both Amir and Siva dressed up to attend the Indian envoy\u2019s dinner went upstairs while Mangaiyarkkarasi and Senathirajah continued to watch TV.",
    "The two Tigers Visu and Aloysius stood up when Amir and Siva entered. Amirthalingam patted one on the shoulder and sat between them on a cane chair. Sivasithamparam sat down a little further. Yogeswaran got up and went to help his wife with the refreshments. Sarojini brought tomato sandwiches and biscuits. She asked what they wanted to drink. The two Tigers wanted a soft drink. Amirthalingam opted for tea. Siva and Yoges did not want anything to drink. Sarojini made two passion fruit drinks and a cup of tea. She then retired to her room.",
    "After Yogeswaran made the introductions, the Tigers said they were very happy to meet the TULF leaders. Amirthalingam and Sivasithamparam reciprocated with similar sentiments. The two TULF leaders said they admired and respected the Tamil militants for their dedication and sacrifices. It was now necessary for all Tamil groups to come together and forge unity and evolve a common approach. Otherwise the gains made through the Indo-Lanka Accord would be lost. Amirthalingam assured the Tigers that any political arrangement would give pride of place to the LTTE.",
    "Visu said he would convey the views expressed to the Tiger leadership. He said the LTTE hierarchy was keen to meet them and discuss these matters. Visu said senior LTTE leaders would be prepared to meet and discuss further with the TULF in Colombo. The conversation was quite cordial. Most of the talking was done by the Amir-Siva duo and Visu while Yogeswaran and Aloysius were generally silent.",
    "At one stage, Amirthalingam stated benignly that it was time for the LTTE to give up the armed struggle and turn to the democratic path. Sivasithamparam stated: \u201cDemocracy may seem old-fashioned to youths like you all but please listen patiently to what we old people tell you also.\u201d",
    "While the conversation continued cordially upstairs, there was some excitement downstairs. Sivakumar alias Arivu who was waiting below began to get agitated after 7 p.m. He kept glancing at his watch and paced up and down restlessly often looking upwards in an anxious manner.",
    "One of the policemen on duty got suspicious at Sivakumar\u2019s conduct. His name was Nissanka Thibbotumunuwa. The policeman\u2019s native place was Akiriyagala at Hettimulla in the Kegalle District. Nissanka as he was called had been seconded for Amirthalingam\u2019s security from the Mahaweli Ministry.",
    "Nissanka Thibbotumunuwa and Sathyamoorthy forcibly searched Sivakumar and found a grenade and live bullets on his person. Thambirajah Kandasamy was informed. After placing Sivakumar under Sathyamoorthy\u2019s custody, Kandasamy and Nissanka went upstairs quietly. While Kandasamy remained at the top of the stairs, Nissanka went to the balcony and stationed himself there staying out of the sight of the occupants in the main room. Both did not want to disturb the ongoing conversation but were alert because of the grenade and bullets found in Sivakumar\u2019s possession. The spirit of bonhomie continued to prevail inside. And then it happened!",
    "It was about 7:20 p.m. Visu finished his drink and got up to place the empty glass on the table. He then turned and looking at Amirthalingam said: \u201cEveryone thinks we Tigers are the \u201cArakkar\u201d (ogres) but actually you all are the real ogres.\u201d The TULF trio thought Visu was joking. Yogeswaran guffawed while Amir and Siva smiled. Visu then pulled out a gun and began firing at Amirthalingam. Yogeswaran shouted out and rose from his chair. Aloysius whipped out a gun and fired at him. A stunned Sivasithamparam sitting further away stood up shouting \u201cVaendaam. Vaendaam\u201d (\u201cdon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u201d) in Tamil. Visu fired hitting him in the right shoulder.",
    "Nissanka Thibbotumunuwa heard the shots and looked inside. Seeing what was happening he began firing through the glass panes. He shot and injured both. Visu and Aloysius then ran outside. Kandasamy who also heard the shots ran towards both firing. The injured Visu and Aloysius fired back and tried to run down the stairs but Nissanka who had a second gun with him came around and kept firing. He killed both. Upon hearing the shots, Sathyamoorthy had grabbed Sivakumar who began grappling with him.",
    "Sivakumar alias Arivu broke free and tried to take hold of the grenade seized from him earlier. Before he could lob it, Nissanka who ran down shot and wounded him. Sivakumar then tried to run but Nissanka fired again and brought him down. All three assassins were killed on the spot by Nissanka.",
    "Although Nissanka had inflicted the fatal injuries, the others too had drawn blood. Sub Inspector Kandasamy shot and injured Aloysius while constable Lakshman fired and wounded both Aravintharajah alias Visu and Sivakumar alias Arivu. Since both officers were Tamils, details of their firing were kept out of newspapers then in a bid to protect their families from possible LTTE vengeance.",
    "The key factor that helped Nissanka Thibbotumunuwa in the firefight with the Tigers was him having a second gun. It was possession of a second weapon that helped Nissanka to overcome the Tigers, particularly Arivu who had a grenade clenched in his fist when he was shot first. This was because another colleague on security duty at the Amirthalingam residence was on leave that day. This man named Silva had entrusted his weapon to Nissanka. This was how Nissanka had two guns with him when the firing began. Both Nissanka and Silva were from Mahaweli security and were personally assigned by Gamini Dissanayake for Amirthalingam\u2019s security as trustworthy officers.",
    "Mangaiyarkkarasi, Sarojini and Senathirajah heard the shots and ran upstairs by the second stairway behind. Amirthalingam sat motionless on his chair bleeding. His wife not realising her husband was dead placed a cushion behind his head and held him up. The dying Yogeswaran lying in a pool of blood on the floor kept muttering \u201cbastards, bastards\u201d in English as Sarojini knelt at his side. Sivasithamparam slumped against the wall speechless and dazed. Ambulances arrived and the victims were taken to hospital.",
    "Colombo Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) Dr. M.S.L. Salgado conducted the autopsy on Amirthalingam and declared that death was caused by injuries to the head and chest. Deputy medical officer Dr. L.B.L. de Alwis performed the autopsy on Yogeswaran and stated that death had resulted due to bullet injuries to the heart and liver.",
    "The inquest of the assassins was held on 21 July. The three bodies were disposed of by the State after a reasonable period of time as no one came forward to claim them. The LTTE had officially disclaimed responsibility and continued to keep up its \u201cdenial\u201d but there were reports of a mock funeral being held at Ananthapuram. The Tamil community grapevine however buzzed with the news that the Tigers were indeed responsible.",
    "The LTTE could have gotten away without being blamed for the assassination if the three assassins had escaped alive. Thereafter, the then Premadasa Government itself may have strained every sinew to deny Tiger involvement. The blame could have been put on the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) or a Tamil group aligned to New Delhi. A case could have been made out effectively that a conspiracy was afoot to implicate the Tigers in the killing and thereby sabotage the Government-LTTE talks. This scenario however could not unfold as envisaged because the three Tigers were shot dead and their identities revealed.",
    "The hero in this sorrowful saga was Sinhala cop Nissanka Thibbotumunuwa who shot dead all three Tiger assassins. It was the first and perhaps only occasion where all Tiger assassins involved in an assassination attempt had been shot dead.",
    "The truth about the Amirthalingam assassination could have been revealed more comprehensively if the TULF or ITAK had taken the initiative to do so years ago when it occurred. The only surviving eye-witness Murugesu Sivasithamparam maintained a deafening silence overtly on the matter. This was understandable in view of prevailing circumstances at that time. Sivasithamparam would however privately relate what happened to a select few.",
    "\u201cSiva Aiya\u201d as he is known told me what had exactly happened over a telephone conversation. It was a very graphic account replete with minute details. When I commended him for his memory, Sivasithamparam replied: \u201cHow can I ever forget what happened that day Thambi?\u201d",
    "This conversation on the telephone was a few years after the incident. Siva however wanted an assurance that I refrain from publishing what he told me then. \u201cYou can write after my death,\u201d he said. Siva died in 2000. I have also spoken with Mrs. Mangaiyarkkarasi Amirthalingam and Mrs. Sarojini Yogeswaran about their recollections. Sadly, Mrs. Yogeswaran elected as Jaffna Mayoress was killed by the LTTE in 1998. Mrs. Amirthalingam passed away peacefully in 2016.",
    "This then is the tragic tale of how former Opposition leader Appapillai Amirthalingam was assassinated along with Vettivelu Yogeswaran by the LTTE. When Lasantha Wickrematunge informed the then Opposition leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the incident, she hastily inquired: \u201cWho did it?\u201d When told it was the LTTE, Mrs. Bandaranaike heaved a sigh of relief saying: \u201cI am so glad that no Sinhalese killed him.\u201d",
    "Many Sinhalese may have hated the politics of Amirthalingam, but they did not kill him. He was killed by the Tamil youths who regarded him as their hero earlier."
