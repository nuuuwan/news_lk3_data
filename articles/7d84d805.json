    "Sri Lanka thrashed West Indies by 9 wickets on Thursday (October 17) to take the series by 2-1. Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga chipped in with 2 wickets each to help the hosts restrict West Indies to 162 runs. In reply, both Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera brought up magnificent fifties to take the series.",
    "Opting to bat first, West Indies had a terrible start as they were crumbling on 55-4 after the halfway stage, adding some runs to it they lost another and soon became 62-5. This walked in, Gudakesh Motie, who slammed three sixes to uplift West Indies and smashed a quick-fire 32 off 15 balls.",
    "After his departure, captain Rovman Powell too showcased his power hitting skills and he got some timely boundaries to score 37 off 27 balls and help his side finish on 162 on the board.",
    "In reply, Sri Lanka started off to a flier. Openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis teed off the West Indian bowlers with their power pack batting. The duo added 67 runs inside the powerplay before the former one fell to Motie after his brisk 39 off 22 balls. And then Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera stitched an incredible partnership together, they strung for 106 runs off 76 balls.",
    "Both of them notched up fifties together and steered Sri Lanka home with superb authority. Kusal Perera was unbeaten on 55* off 36 balls, while Kusal Mendis made 68* off 50 deliveries.",
    "This is, however, Sri Lanka\u2019s maiden T20I series victory over the West Indies."
