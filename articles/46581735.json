  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Khan were sentenced to seven years in prison and fined on Saturday by a court that ruled their 2018 marriage broke the law, his party said.",
    "It was the third ruling against Khan this week and comes ahead of national elections on Thursday that he is barred from contesting.",
    "Khan, 71, has in recent days been sentenced to 10 years for leaking state secrets and 14 years along with this wife for illegally selling state gifts. His representatives say he will launch appeals in all three cases.",
    "It was not immediately clear if his various sentences would run concurrently.",
    "Khan is in prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, while his wife will serve her sentence at their hilltop mansion in nearby Islamabad. He already faces a 10-year disqualification from holding public office.",
    "\u201cAfter hours of rushed hearings at court, no cross examination of witnesses, and no due process - a mockery of the law,\u201d Khan\u2019s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said in a statement.",
    "\u201cWith the way these trials are being conducted, there will be a huge question mark on the February 8th elections. This is a test case for Pakistan\u2019s higher judiciary.\u201d",
    "The couple were each fined 500,000 rupees ($1,800), ARY News reported.",
    "Bushra was accused of not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called \u201cIddat\u201d, after divorcing her previous husband and marrying Khan.",
    "The Khans signed their marriage contract, or \u201cNikkah\u201d, in January 2018 in a secret ceremony seven months before the former cricket superstar became prime minister for the first time.",
    "There was controversy over whether they had wed before the period was complete. After initial denials of the marriage, PTI confirmed it weeks later.",
    "\u201cCan say I\u2019m a witness in the Nikkah and it\u2019s a categorically yet another fake case,\u201d Khan\u2019s media advisor Zulfi Bukhari told Reuters. \u201cFrom witnesses to the evidence to the procedure.\u201d",
    "Bushra\u2019s ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, to whom she was married for about 30 years, brought a criminal complaint against the Khans, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.",
    "Khan has often called Bushra his spiritual leader. She is known for her devotion to Sufism, a mystical form of Islam.",
    "Born Bushra Riaz Watto, she changed her name to Khan after her marriage. Her husband and followers commonly refer to her as Bushra Bibi or Bushra Begum, titles that denote respect in Urdu.",
    "It was not clear when or how Khan met Bushra, but former aide Aun Chaudhry said Khan was impressed with her spirituality.",
    "Khan, who had acquired a playboy image in the 1990s as his cricket career took off, has said he is keenly interested in Sufism.",
    "Khan\u2019s two previous marriages - to Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of tycoon James Goldsmith, and television journalist Reham Nayyar Khan - ended in divorce.",
    "Khan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022. He says his removal was backed by the powerful military with whom he fell out while in office.",
    "He and his party say they have been subjected to a military-backed crackdown, including arrests of hundreds of supporters, party members and key aides.",
    "The military, which has for decades held sway over Pakistan\u2019s politics, denies the claims.",
    "NAB, the anti-graft agency that put Khan on trial, has at various times investigated, tried and jailed all prime ministers to have served since 2008, including Nawaz Sharif, whose party is considered the frontrunner in next week\u2019s election."
