  "original_body_lines": [
    "Expressing his gratitude to \u201ctrustworthy friend\u201d India for saving Sri Lanka and preventing a \u201cbloodbath\u201d during its unprecedented economic crisis last year, Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has said that not a single nation has extended that kind of assistance to Colombo as done by New Delhi.",
    "Sri Lanka was hit by a catastrophic financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves.",
    "As the country struggled, locked in the throes of the crisis, India extended multi-pronged assistance of about USD 4 billion to it last year, through multiple credit lines and currency support, in line with India\u2019s \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy.",
    "In his address at the gala dinner reception hosted for delegates of the Indian Travel Congress here on Friday, Abeywardena said India \u201csaved us\u201d during the financial crisis, otherwise, there would have been \u201canother bloodbath for all of us\u201d.",
    "At the evening reception, he thanked India for the help extended to the cash-strapped nation and recalled the civilisational ties and similarities between the two countries and their cultures.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka and India are very, very closely interconnected countries, culturally, nationally, and policy-wise, and above all, India has been a very close associate and trustworthy friend of Sri Lanka,\u201d Abeywardena said, adding that when \u201cwe were in trouble\u201d, India always helped out.",
    "\u201cAnd, even this time, today, I heard that India is willing to extend our restructuring of loans for 12 years. Never expected, and never in history, not a single country has extended that kind of assistance,\u201d he said.",
    "He recalled the helping hand lent by India during the period of trouble last year that devastated the Sri Lankan economy, pushing it into a debt crisis.",
    "\u201cI must tell you, during the trouble that we had last year, you (India) saved us, India saved us otherwise, there would have been another bloodbath for all of us. So, that is how India came to help us,\u201d Abeywardena said.",
    "He made the remarks in the presence of the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay, Sri Lanka\u2019s Tourism and Lands Minister Harin Fernando, and other senior officials of the Sri Lankan government.",
    "\u201cYour ambassador here, (is a) very close friend of ours. We love and respect him,\u201d the Speaker said, referring to Baglay.",
    "Later, in an interaction with PTI on the sidelines of the reception, Abeywardena said, \u201cIndia has always come to aid of Sri Lanka\u201d in times of crises, and laid emphasis on the financial assistance given by New Delhi last year when the island nation was mired in the economic turmoil.",
    "\u201cThat helped us survive for six months in the midst of the crisis,\u201d he said \u201cWe thank India for the kind gesture, and I also say, thank you, honourable Prime Minister of India (Narendra Modi),\u201d he told PTI.",
    "Noting the similarity between the Indian surname Singh and the Sri Lankan surname Singhe, Abeywardena said, \u201cIt shows we are genetically connected to India\u201d.",
    "\u201cThat way, India is not a new country to us. It\u2019s part of the ethos of our country, part of our life, part of our heart,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are here to receive you, respect you, join with you.\u201d \u201cTogether, we (Sri Lanka) can join with you (India), without any difficulty or hesitation, with great trust,\u201d the Speaker said.",
    "In his address, Tourism and Lands Minister Fernando pitched Sri Lanka -- Pearl of the Indian Ocean -- as a unique destination for India and the rest of the world, saying, \u201cOne island nation offers so many different tourist experiences, without travelling far from one location to another.\u201d Meanwhile, several sessions were held on Saturday as part of the three-day 67th Convention of the TAAI (Travel Agents Association of India) which began here on July 6.",
    "The four-day convention of the TAAI which was established in 1951, is being held with the support of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) and the Sri Lankan Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO)."
