    "Think back to a time you helped someone move a heavy object, such as a couch. While at first the task may have appeared simple, it actually required a suite of advanced behaviours.",
    "The job needed verbal commands for social coordination (\u201cpivot!\u201d) and anticipation of near-future events (moving other furniture out of the way). It also required a clear, shared vision of the final goal (which room to take the couch to).",
    "It\u2019s a small but satisfying example of human cooperation. But before we all get too pleased with ourselves, consider that ants \u2013 creatures with tiny brains and no capacity for speech \u2013 routinely pull off feats that rival, and sometimes exceed, our own.",
    "Earth is literally crawling with ants. Scientists estimate there are at least\u00a020 quadrillion ants on Earth. That\u2019s 20 followed by 15 zeros \u2013 more ants than stars in our galaxy!",
    "These incredible insects are amongst the most successful organisms on the planet. Part of the success comes from an ability to form complex societies, ranging from a few individuals to millions. And those societies, or colonies, are remarkably co-operative.",
    "Take, for example, ants\u2019 abilities to move large food items. To do it, they mobilise teams of dozens \u2013 or even hundreds \u2013 of fellow workers. Together, they efficiently work together to transport the load back to the nest.",
    "Longhorn crazy ants (Paratrechina longicornis) are even known to clear debris from a path before a heavy object arrives \u2013 seemingly anticipating its trajectory and\u00a0preparing the way.",
    "One\u00a0experiment\u00a0pit longhorn crazy ants against humans, all tasked with moving T-shaped objects (scaled to body size) through tight spaces. In some trials, the human teams were not permitted to speak or use gestures.",
    "And the result? Ants performed better in larger groups compared to smaller ones, showing the clear benefits of collective action.",
    "In contrast, human performance did not improve with group size. And when communication was restricted, human performance declined as group size increased.All this highlights how ants rely on collective intelligence, without the need for central control or sophisticated cognition.",
    "Humanity\u2019s invention of agriculture\u00a012,000 years ago\u00a0is understandably hailed as one of our greatest achievements.",
    "But leaf cutter ants beat us to it. These ants (from the species\u00a0Atta\u00a0and\u00a0Acromyrmex) evolved to undertake large-scale agriculture about\u00a055 million years ago.",
    "These ants cut and transport fresh leaves not to eat directly, but to feed a fungus that serves as their main food source.",
    "This evolutionary partnership allows the ants to feed colonies with populations in the millions.",
    "Remarkably, leaf cutter ants have also evolved a form of biological pest control to protect their crops from bacteria. Some worker ants patrol the gardens, detecting infected sections of the fungus. Then they\u00a0apply antibiotics\u00a0produced by bacteria that live on their bodies.",
    "As these farmed insects feed on plant sap, they excrete a sugary liquid the ants eagerly collect. In return, ants serve as bodyguards, defending their tiny livestock from predators such as ladybirds and lacewings.",
    "In some species, queen ants\u00a0gently carry sap-sucking insects\u00a0in their jaws as they fly off to start new colonies. Fossilised ants preserved in amber suggest this behaviour evolved\u00a0up to 20 million years ago, long before humans domesticated animals.",
    "Medical care may seem like a distinctly human innovation. But several ant species have evolved sophisticated ways to treat injuries.",
    "When a Florida carpenter ant (Camponotus floridanus) is injured during a battle between colonies, its nest-mates will\u00a0amputate a damaged limb\u00a0to prevent infection from spreading. Ants receiving this battlefield care are more likely to survive than ants left untreated.",
    "Some ants can also\u00a0detect infection and treat infected wounds\u00a0by cleaning them and applying antimicrobial secretions from specialised glands.",
    "Some ant species are known to literally\u00a0put their bodies on the line for the colony.",
    "Army ants (Eciton burchellii) join their bodies together to form structures. These include bridges across gaps on the forest floor, and \u201cscaffolds\u201d across steep terrain to\u00a0prevent other ants from slipping.",
    "Even the nest is made of hundreds of thousands of ants joined together, complete with tunnels and chambers housing the larvae and the queen.",
    "The entire structure is packed up and rebuilt each day, after the colony emigrates a few hundred metres into the forest. (The Conversation)",
    "Weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina), meanwhile,\u00a0self-assemble into rope ladders\u00a0to span vertical gaps.",
    "They also form a line of workers that pull leaves together in treetops to form nests. Once the leaves are winched into place, other ants arrive with ant larvae in their jaws. Each larva produces a tiny blob of silk which the ants use to glue the leaves together.",
    "Humans rightly take pride in our greatest achievements \u2013 agriculture, medicine, engineering and building civilisations. But remarkably, ants mastered these innovations millions of years before we did.",
    "Ants may be tiny \u2013 but by working together they can build complex societies and solve many problems. They might even teach humans a thing or two.",
    "Small States\u2019 foreign policy posers heighten in the wake of US tariff pressures",
