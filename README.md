Sydney (AFP) - New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.

"Having played 95 Tests - 27 as captain - the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.

"I had to weigh up everything and, in the end, with a young family, it seemed like the best decision to help set up our future," he said.

"It was a very hard one because I love the teams that I represent here in New Zealand."

The number of people killed by flash floods and cold lava flow from a volcano in western Indonesia over the weekend has risen to 41 with 17 more missing, a local disaster agency official told AFP Monday.

Hours of heavy rain caused large volcanic rocks to roll down one of Indonesia’s most active volcanos into two districts on Sumatra island Saturday evening, while flooding inundated roads, homes and mosques.

“Data as of last night, we recorded 37 dead victims... But from this morning it has grown again, the figure reached 41 (dead),” Ilham Wahab, West Sumatra disaster mitigation agency official, told AFP.

Rescuers were searching for 17 still missing, three in Agam district and 14 in Tanah Datar, both the worst-hit areas of the flood and home to hundreds of thousands of people, he said.

Ilham could not confirm the number of locals evacuated because officials had encouraged “people to evacuate to relatives’ places, which are safer” than tent shelters in heavy rains.

The People's Organization for Equality and Relief in Sri Lanka criticizes the government for its role in the genocide 15 years ago, highlighting the arrest of those commemorating their lost loved ones. The incident involving police giving biscuits to locals on Vesak Day last year further exposes the government's hypocrisy.

🟩

The Sri Lankan government, which threatens to persecute Tamils who are engaged in the commemoration, cannot be informed that the Sri Lankan government is in the process of reconciliation, said the People's Organization for Equality and Relief in Sri Lanka.

Mullivaikkal porridge at this moment has become part of the joint venture of the Sri Lankan government's ruthless genocide of the Sri Lankan government 15 years ago.

The arrests that threaten the Tamils who commemorate their beloved people cannot be informed that the Sri Lankan government is trying to reconciliation.

The Sri Lankan police were given biscuits to the local people on the eve of Vesak Day last year - the Trincomalee incident has revealed their pseudo -country.

Colombo, May 13 (Daily Mirror) - Despite the cost of living sizzling at red hot levels and the country being cash- strapped, the House Committee of Parliament has endorsed the proposal to offer concessionary vehicle permits for MPs as requested by them, a top source said.

The source familiar with the decision said the committee which looks into the requirements of the MPs positively considered the request by them for such permits in line with the similar facilities offered to executive graders in different categories of the public service.

The MPs , numbering more than 100 and representing different parties, submitted a letter to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena asking for permission to import vehicles with no duty for their use.

Following the approval by the House Committee, the Speaker is expected to write to President Ranil Wickremesinghe who is authorized to execute the decision as the Finance Minister.

### Sri Lanka VFS Global visa deal despite IMF anti-corruption requirements: opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s controversial visa deal with IVS-GBS and VFS Global is coming despite the country being required to reduce corruption stemming from an International Monetary Fund governance assessment, the island’s main opposition has said.

The main opposition has also slammed the unsolicited deal with VFS Global, a private contractor, as being bigger than a central bank linked bondscam in 2015.

“This is three or four times bigger than the bondscam,” opposition legislator Rauff Hakeem told parliament.

“I am bringing to the attention of this house this massive fraud (visharler wanchawak).

The deal came despite procurement requirements and anti-corruption roadmap required in an International Monetary Fund deal, following a ‘governance diagnostic assessment’.

“Having pledged all those new measures, and agreed to the IMF conditions, what does the government do?,” Hakeem asked in parliament.

The votes from the Tamil and Muslim communities may determine who the 2024 Presidential hustings victor is likely to be

This is the fourth article in a series focusing on Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his evolving strategy to contest the forthcoming 2024 Presidential Elections. In a political climate where deliberate attempts are being made to mislead people about Wickremesinghe’s Presidential Election plans and prospects, the objective of this series is to analyse in detail the  game plan and stratagems adopted by Wickremesinghe to face the 2024 Presidential hustings. Since Wickremesinghe is the incumbent President, priority is being given to him. However, after this series is concluded, I do intend to write about other presidential aspirants and their election campaigns also in the future.

In a situation where the Sinhala vote is trifurcated, the Tamil and Muslim votes, if delivered en bloc, may determine who the 2024 Presidential hustings victor is likely to be

### Israel has lost its moral compass and conscience

A former IDF soldier, interviewed on another channel, admits that some of the IDF actions he witnessed in Gaza could amount to war crimes.

Most Israelis simply do not care about what happens to Arabs and Palestinians

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reflects this cynical insularity of the Israeli public

Protests against Israeli excesses in conducting its war against Hamas in Gaza are widening in scope daily. This is not a war against Hamas; it’s a total war against the Palestinians designed to drive them out of ‘Greater Israel.’

These protests are almost exclusively in the West. It isn’t that the rest of the world is deaf and blind to what’s going on. But this is a Western problem, because of the West’s troubled historical relationships with the Jews, culminating in a great deal of sympathy for Israel after its creation (essentially a Western creation because of British Middle Eastern politics after WWII).

Oh dear, oh dear, a British citizen and non-Sri Lankan, MP Diana (not to be mistaken for Britain’s Princess Diana) has been unseated as a Member of our Parliament. O tempora, o mores we are once again being made the laughing stock of the world. A British citizen is not only a member of our Parliament, she is also a State Minister of this country.

The 60-year-old was (according to media reports) appointed a National List MP by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in return for the transferring of control of the Ape Jathika Peramuna (AJP) to the SJB.

Ever-popular past Commissioner of Elections Mahinda Deshapriya -respected for his nonpartisan rulings during election controversies- and an expert on election practices, speaking to this newspaper days ago said: “Sri Lankan law only prevents a non-citizen from becoming a Member of Parliament, to contest an election, while the law also prohibits a non-citizen to vote in an election...”.

Indian High Commissioner Santhos Jha: ‘The potential of India-Sri Lanka friendship is limitless’

Indian High Commissioner Santos Jha, in an interview with a select group of journalists, discusses the current status of bilateral ties and the future direction particularly with emphasis on connectivity.

Q  It has been a little over four months since you assumed duties as High Commissioner here. What are your initial impressions?

Coming to Sri Lanka as India’s High Commissioner was in some way a homecoming for me - in a role with greater responsibility. I was here from 2007-10 as Counsellor. Sri Lanka has always been close to my heart with many memories and several friends who will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Since December, I’ve had an action-packed 4-4.5 months. I’ve travelled the length and breadth of the country, met people across spheres - political, business, media, academia and so on - and everywhere I have experienced a sense of filial warmth.

Colombo, May 12 (Daily Mirror) - It is clear that some Ministers seem determined to promote immorality and erode morality by perpetuating the illegal and immoral programmes initiated by former State Minister Diana Gamage, Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said.

Addressing the media, the thera said that Diana Gamage does not seem to have done anything for the country.

"The only thing that was done was that she raised her voice about the promotion of ganja and the promotion of immorality," he said.

The conspiratorial act she tried to do by developing immorality in the country, destroying morals and showing the illusion of economic development has now stopped due to the court decision. But some Ministers want to continue those programmes, he added.

According to the court decision, the role of Diana Gama has been rejected. That character does not suit social leadership at all. Finally, since she is not a Sri Lankan, she has no right to engage in politics in this country, the thera said.

Economic growth and national security are complementary to each other

When States fail to observe the Rule of Law and maintain the Law and Order, markets will start disintegrating themselves leading to a collapse of the same. Collapsed markets will stunt economic growth and stunted growth, as we have explained earlier, will reduce national security. Consequently, the resources spent on national security is not a waste but an essential cost to ensure the smooth operation of all the needed economic activities. Hence, no nation should compromise the national security on the ground of saving resources. It will cause the nations to sacrifice all their gains on all the economic fronts
