    "Operation \u2018Yukthiya\u2019, launched last weekend in a bid to crack down on narcotics distribution and organized crimes in the country, will be stopped briefly in view of the upcoming holidays.",
    "Speaking on the matter, Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said the island-wide special operation would thus be temporarily halted on December 24, 25 and 26.",
    "Thalduwa explained that the decision was taken as the police officers have to be deployed to other specific duties on Christmas Day (Dec.25) and Poya Day (Dec.26).",
    "Further, clarifying that this does not mean the special operation is coming to a halt, the police spokesman added that it would resume after the holidays."
