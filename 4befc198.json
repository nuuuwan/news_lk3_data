    "Every girl dreams of having soft, creamy-smooth skin, right? If you eat papayas regularly, you will definitely have the skin of your dreams. This is due to its high water content, which keeps the skin moisturised and hydrated, from the inside out. You can also mash papaya into a pulp and apply the paste on your skin. Leave it on for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then wash it off and dry with a soft towel.",
    "If you have dark spots, or blackheads, on your skin\u2019s surface, use papaya to help you out. Papaya has lightening properties that can help those dark spots fade away in no time. All you need to do is mix the pulp of the papaya with a teaspoon of lemon juice, or honey, and apply it onto the affected area. The end results will be simply great.",

Smoother, better-looking hair.",
