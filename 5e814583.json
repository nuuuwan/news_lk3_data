  "original_body_lines": [
    "Cracks seemed to have surfaced on Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB)\u2019s machinery in Colombo District with its Maharagama co-organiser teledrama actor Rodney Fraser threatening to resign from the party and move out of politics following alleged sidelining.",
    "Mr. Fraser announced his desire to resign from the party and give up politics, at a meeting held in Maharagama over the weekend. \u201cMy family had wanted me to give up politics. Also I would like to tell the party leader to remove me from the party if he does not require my services. This maybe my last speech as a member of the SJB,\u201d he told the rally.",
    "\u201cI have spent my personal funds in order to campaign for the SJB leader and had even sold my personal properties to engage in politics. I am also a coordinating officer of Mr. Premadasa.",
    "\u201cI hope the party leadership decides to gather all SJBers in Maharagama together and decide to work with everyone instead of sidelining anyone,\u201d he also said. (Yohan Perera)"
