    "Speaking at a media briefing, CEA media spokesperson Dr. Ajith Gunawardena stated that the SLAQI readings in many areas ranged between 100 and 110 as of yesterday (Dec. 01).",
    "Dr. Gunawardena assured the public that the current slightly unhealthy levels of the air quality are temporary and are expected to improve significantly within the next two days.",
    "The air quality levels dropped in Colombo and several other areas across the country during last two days as a result of the recent adverse weather conditions and a border disturbance from the north.",

    "However, the NBRO forcasted that AQI level will be between 86 \u2013 120 over the day today, indicating slightly unhealthy level in most urban areas due to the trans-boundary conditions happening from northern region.
