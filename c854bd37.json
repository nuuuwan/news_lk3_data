    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves went up by 829 billion rupees to 4.4 billion US dollars in December 2023, official data showed, helped by loans from multilateral lenders including the International Monetary Fund.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves include monetary reserves collected by mopping up or sterilizing current flows against central bank held treasuries and reducing domestic credit (deflationary monetary policy) which does not increase either domestic or foreign official debt, as well as loans taken by the Treasury, which increases net debt.",

    "Treasury balances can be used to repay maturing debt or state imports, without undermining reserve money or causing forex pressure, unlike the use of central bank reserves for imports which involves printing money to maintain the policy rate.",
    "The central bank has largely conducted deflationary monetary policy in the recent past. In November it bought 117 million US dollars from the market.",
    "In December also the central bank bought dollars, market participants said. The rupee was allowed to appreciate towards the end of the month under an unstable pegging arrangement called a \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019.",
    "In years where the central bank maintains monetary stability with deflationary policy, it is able to buy dollars and meet part of the cash drawdown that takes place in the festival season, a type of short-term private sector sterilization. (Colombo/Jan06/2023)"
