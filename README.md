### How should Sri Lanka leverage a new era in the UK?

*2024-07-01 05:50:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-should-Sri-Lanka-leverage-a-new-era-in-the-UK/4-763705) · `en`

Sri Lanka should advocate for genuine and impactful change from the next UK government while also striving for systemic change within its own country

The anticipated victory of the Labour Party in the forthcoming general election in the United Kingdom presents a pivotal opportunity for political activists campaigning for a fairer and more sustainable Sri Lanka. This potential shift in power offers a chance to press for significant changes in the global economic order. For Sri Lanka to overcome its external debt crisis and economic difficulties, Labour’s commitment to strengthening and reforming multilateral institutions, tackling corruption and illicit money flows, and supporting the recovery of stolen assets is crucial.

### Yes, it is $ 26 b in just 5 years

The table illustrates the accumulated foreign currency inflow gap for Sri Lanka over the past five years compared to 2018, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Easter Sunday attacks. To emerge from the current crisis, it is crucial to strengthen and expand these verticals. According to the table, Sri Lanka has experienced a loss of about $ 26 billion over the past five years, compared to if it had maintained the same inflow numbers as in 2018 each year.

The impact from tourism over the past five years amounts to approximately $ 13.9 billion. During this period, the industry was severely affected due to a global tourism slowdown. Consequently, we failed to maintain hotel standards even at their previous levels. This has resulted in poor conditions of the facilities, pressing room rates down compared to regional competitors.

Saudi Arabia aims to utilise her vast arid lands to harvest renewable energy resources and to increase her share of renewables to around 50% by the year 2030. This is similar to Sri Lanka’s stated goal of 70% renewable energy usage by 2030. However, sadly this is where the similarity ends.

### Taking the dread, apprehension and suspicion out of Performance Reviews

Employees must believe that PRs are fora where they can openly discuss their needs and concerns

A pulse check of corporate Sri Lanka reveals that there are mixed feelings about the appropriateness and effectiveness of Performance Reviews (PRs). While there are some who swear on the positive role which PRs play through their focus on goal setting, performance monitoring and employee development under an overarching umbrella of performance management, there are others who believe that PRs do more harm than good because they are not conducted methodically, transparently and/or democratically and because they are too focused on the past, time-wasting, one-sided, inaccurate, unfair, pre-meditated and biased.

Twelve years ago, ex-Foreign Secretary, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara, chairing the late H.L. de Silva memorial events in Colombo opined that what was prevailing in Sri Lanka was not the cherished Rule of Law but a system that could be branded as the Rule of Men in power.

### Rock, paper, scissors: Sri Lanka’s mineral merry-go-round

We can achieve little in isolation in this modern milieu, and this rings true even in the muddy business of minerals and mining

Sri Lanka’s mineral resources were once again in the spotlight recently, when news broke that India had shown interest in acquiring mines in Sri Lanka. As detailed in a study by the Institute of Policy Studies earlier this year, the local graphite industry must reposition itself with adequate international partnerships to take maximum advantage of the resource. Sri Lanka has about 1.5 million tonnes of graphite, which is inadequate to meet serious international demand, but the quality of the deposit promises a high price.

German investment via Bogala Graphite Ltd. over the past two decades have seen significant value addition and enhanced operating standards, and despite a 70% decline in operating profits last year due to global exigencies the sector has grown well with foreign participation.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax is an additional burden

*2024-07-01 05:30:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Imputed-Rental-Income-Tax-is-an-additional-burden/14-763699) · `en`

Many owners of houses (that are somewhat small) located in Colombo have given these on rent and have moved to more spacious houses in the suburbs.

This they are compelled to do when family members increase when their children get married. The rent received from these houses is not enough to pay the rent for the relatively bigger house. Inevitably they have to pocket out an extra sum of money to bridge the difference.

With the proposed imputed rental income to be implemented in mid-next year, this will become an additional burden for the home owners who have given their houses for a smaller rent and paying a bigger amount for the occupation of a larger house. Hope the President will rescind the move to impose the “Imputed Rental Income” for the above reason.

### Complaint filed against SIS over COVID-19 forced cremations

*2024-07-01 04:53:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Complaint-filed-against-SIS-over-COVID-19-forced-cremations/56-763671) · `en`

Activist Chirantha Amerasinghe filed a complaint against the State Intelligence Service (SIS) over the controversial forced cremations of COVID-19 dead. Amerasinghe and several others filed the complaint at the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters on Saturday.

Speaking to the media, Amerasinghe said the mandatory cremation policy was imposed to target the Muslim community in an attempt to oppress them.

He noted that while the Easter Sunday attack mastermind Zahran Hashim at one point could not find followers for his cause, the various attacks against the Muslim community helped him recruit over 35 members at the time.

Amerasinghe claimed that the SIS had informed the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) that COVID-19 could spread through water contamination. Based on this SIS information, he said he was detained by the police in 2020 after he posted on social media that there was no evidence of negative impacts from burying COVID-19 victims.

Marking the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) has issued a pressing call to halt recent efforts to legalise the cultivation of cannabis in Sri Lanka.

Despite the Ministry of Investment Promotion and the Indigenous Medicine Section of the Ministry of Health actively seeking project proposals for the cultivation of cannabis for export and medicinal purposes, ADIC raised significant concerns about the initiative’s true impact on the country.

In a press release, ADIC noted that while the ministries assert that their primary aim is to achieve economic benefits through cannabis exports, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves, a comprehensive review by ADIC of financial records from leading cannabis firms worldwide suggests otherwise.

### Hardik Pandya's next captain of the Indian cricket team…?

*2024-07-01 03:43:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187347) · `ta`

Despite initial criticism and social media roasts for leading Mumbai Indians to defeat themselves in the IPL, Hardik Pandya's exceptional performance in the T20 World Cup, including crucial contributions in both batting and bowling, has positioned him as a strong candidate for India's cricket captaincy. With senior players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli retiring from international T20s, Pandya's emergence offers a fresh perspective and potential leadership for the team. His strategic decisions, such as bowling the final over effectively in key matches, have showcased his capabilities beyond just being a player. Despite the challenges and criticism, Pandya remains focused on proving himself through his actions, indicating a promising future as India's cricket captain.

🟩

Fans have roasted him on social media that Mumbai Indians defeat Mumbai Indians in the IPL.. But in the second twenty -twenty -two World Series, his best batting bowling is now the reason for the Indian team to win the bowl.

Rohit Sharma was the successful captain of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL series. He was the captain of the Mumbai Indians for ten years but also the winner of five times. But in the 2024 season, the team's administration lifted the post to Hardik Pandya.

Mumbai Indians have not been able to achieve significant victories this time due to Pandya's indifferent body. Rohit Sharma's fans have roasted Pandya. Pandya insults Rohit at the stadium. Although Rohit Sharma was appointed as the Indian captain of the Twenty20 World Cup, Pandya's feature in the squad has caused severe criticism.. However, Pandya has responded to the criticism of her.

### Can A Country Swamped By Mythological Beliefs Prosper?

Mythological practices are prevalent in many religions worldwide, ranging from visiting places of religious significance to ringing bells dangling on the testicles of a sage. This piece is not to entirely reject these practices, as some rituals have become traditions, but to highlight the absurd levels of indulgence in Sri Lanka, primarily driven by a segment of Buddhist monks.

Almost every family adheres to traditions such as consulting horoscope readers and waiting for auspicious times for significant events. Indigenous chanting and dancing, like Bali Thovil, are commonly accepted customs. However, there is an over-dependence on newly found practices and beliefs, where authorities need to act before these characters turn the youth into blind followers.

### Is The News Really Good?

*2024-06-30 18:06:46* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/is-the-news-really-good/) · `en`

When a bankrupt country receives good news, it raises great expectations in the hearts of its people. Last week, the government gave extensive publicity to this so-called good news. Consequently, various opposition groups were very concerned about this trend. Some were worried if this was genuinely good news, while others were anxious to learn more details about it. Nevertheless, at first glance, being able to restructure bilateral debts and officially come out of bankruptcy should be good news for the people of a bankrupt country. This is particularly true for those who have suffered in long queues for oil and gas, and for the business community that had to stop operations due to the inability to open letters of credit. However, it seemed that this news was not very favorable for political groups hoping to seize state power in the near future.
