  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has affirmed the government\u2019s commitment to fostering development through reconciliation, emphasising that nations worldwide which have eradicated racism and bigotry have experienced significant development.",
    "The President further highlighted how racism and bigotry have become convenient tools for politicians to wield power and for religious leaders to maintain their authority, recounting the grim lessons learned from the prolonged use of these divisive tactics, which ultimately led the nation into a devastating conflict.",
    "Addressing the \u2018Religions to Reconcile\u2019 National Inter Religious Symposium, organized by the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, held today (28 Feb.) at the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo, President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of fostering unity and religious harmony among all citizens, underscoring the government\u2019s proactive measures toward this goal.",
    "The interreligious conference served as a culmination of the \u201cPlural Action for Conflict Transformation\u201d project, spanning three years and encompassing 17 districts.",
    "President Wickremesinghe actively engaged with district representatives, addressing their queries and concerns during the event, underscoring the government\u2019s commitment to fostering reconciliation and harmony across the nation.",
    "Having acknowledged the intrinsic connection between religion and reconciliation, our nation has endured the bitter consequences of racism and religious extremism, culminating in a devastating conflict. Following the cessation of hostilities, our main objective has been to foster coexistence among all communities.",
    "The responsibility of cultivating harmony rests significantly on the shoulders of religious leaders. It is imperative that we remain mindful of our intentions. While politicians often pursue power, religious leaders strive to maintain their positions, frequently resorting to the perilous avenues of racism and bigotry. This unfortunate trend has plagued our country since the 1930s, yielding disastrous outcomes that require no further explanation.",
    "Take Singapore, for example, where the absence of racism and bigotry has contributed to its rapid development despite its diverse linguistic landscape. With the military conflict resolved, Sri Lanka\u2019s political challenges are now receiving attention, necessitating a renewed focus on coexistence, a topic also being deliberated in Parliament.",
    "Mr. Karu Jayasuriya, served as the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Religious Affairs and Co-Existence when he was serving as the Speaker. This committee was established in response to conflicts involving Muslims in March 2018, as well as incidents in Galle in 2017 and Beruwela in 2014.",
    "Various proposals were put forth by these committees to address these issues, and consensus was reached on their implementation. It\u2019s crucial that we uphold this agreement and continue working collaboratively to resolve these challenges.",
    "Towards the close of last year, numerous Buddhist monks and Tamil leaders presented the Himalaya Declaration, a document we are currently adhering to. As we move forward, the final phase entails fostering synergy, particularly through discussions with Tamil political parties and MPs, aimed at addressing lingering issues.",
    "Steps have been initiated to resolve the matter of missing persons, with further updates forthcoming in the near future. Additionally, arrangements have been made for the release of certain individuals held in connection with these matters.",
    "The primary concern at present revolves around the fate of the missing persons To address this issue, we\u2019ve presented and successfully passed a bill in Parliament to establish the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Numerous reports from Disappearance Commissions have been reviewed, and one report authored by Judge A.H.M.D.Nawaz was selected.",
    "Following the approval of the draft for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pledged his support for these initiatives. Similar assistance is being extended by other nations as well, enabling us to advance these critical endeavours.",
    "Addressing the on-going political challenges, our attention is directed towards resolving land disputes, particularly in regions like Jaffna where tensions persist between villagers and the Wildlife Department. Similar conflicts also arise in areas such as Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, and Mahianganaya. We aim to address these issues through inclusive dialogue, involving all concerned parties.",
    "Furthermore, I have instructed to proceed in accordance with the 1985 map. Additionally, I anticipate meeting with Tamil MPs in Parliament next week to discuss these matters further. Following consultations with the security forces, agreements have been reached to release more land, providing a pathway forward in our efforts.",
    "Another pressing issue is the delimitation of powers. A key demand is the empowerment of the 3rd list of devolution, with an emphasis on not interfering with police powers at present, leaving them open for future consideration.",
    "The Land Act is slated for presentation, and there are no objections to the delegation of other subjects in the 3rd list. However, securing the necessary consensus with other parties in Parliament to achieve a two-thirds majority remains crucial.",
    "Simultaneously, discussions are underway regarding the implementation of the Provincial Board of Education. Proposals have been made to establish provincial professional training institutes in each province. Additionally, plans are underway to appoint provincial-level committees to lead the modernization of agriculture, establish a tourism board, and undertake related initiatives.",
    "Additionally, the work of five provincial ministries is expected to be distributed among twenty ministries. This restructuring cannot simply resemble a general ministry, so officials are currently deliberating on adjusting their structure accordingly.",
    "I eagerly anticipate addressing the final aspect of this matter, the decentralized budget, once all parties have convened. There\u2019s also a call for a secondary board, akin to a Senate, which the government does not oppose. However, such an initiative would need to coincide with the framing of a constitution, potentially requiring a referendum. I also intend to engage in discussions on this topic with other party leaders.",
    "These measures aim to lay the groundwork for a new era in our country. Religious leaders have been entrusted with significant responsibilities in this endeavour. I am confident that further discussions on these matters will yield fruitful outcomes.",
    "The Maha Sangha, along with religious leaders and representatives, former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka H.E. Dr. Felix Neumann, South African High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, H.E. Sandile Edwin Schalk, MISEREOR Regional Officer for Sri Lanka and Oceania\u00a0 Corinna Broeckmann, Head of Cooperation for the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka Johann Hesse and Representatives from several embassies, Chairman of the Office on Missing Persons Mahesh Katulanda, Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives Dr Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Chairman of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka Dr. Joe William and various stakeholders, including representatives of the \u201cPlural Action for Conflict Transformation\u201d project attended the event."
