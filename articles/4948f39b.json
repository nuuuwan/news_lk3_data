    "In the Nahrin district of Baghlan province, people carried their shrouded dead to a gravesite.",
    "\"We have no food, no drinking water, no shelter, no blankets, nothing at all, floods have destroyed everything,\" said Muhammad Yahqoob, who has lost 13 members of his family, children among them.",
    "\"Out of 42 houses, only two or three remain, it has destroyed the entire valley.\"",
    "In a statement, the Taliban's economy minister, Din Mohammad Hanif, urged the United Nations, humanitarian agencies and private business to provide support for those hit by the floods.",
