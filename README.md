Last month, Gantz presented Netanyahu with a June 8 deadline to come up with a clear day-after strategy for Gaza, where Israel has been pressing a devastating military offensive against the ruling Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Netanyahu brushed off the ultimatum soon after it was given.

### French President dissolves parliament and calls a snap election

PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France’s parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.

The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union’s parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron’s pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.

Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron’s Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.

Macron himself wasn’t a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.

### Tourism trade remains robust despite seasonal softening in May

The tourism trade is going through an expected softening due to the seasonality tied to the arrivals, but it has managed to eke out an income of US$ 154.0 million in May, data showed.

This was down from US$ 225.7 million in April but up from US$ 100.0 million a year ago when the trade was recovering from repeated crises.

Sri Lanka’s economy weakened due to waning inflows from tourism and other foreign currency inflows due to the 2019 Easter attacks, two years of pandemic induced restrictions over travel and in-person events, and then by the ‘Aragalaya’ in 2022.

It added to the challenges faced by tourism in its efforts to revive while the global travel industry started picking up from two years of pursuing stay at home orders due to the worldwide pandemic.

This caused many countries to put up travel advisories against their people who were thinking of taking flights to Sri Lanka, delaying what looked like a continuous recovery in the trade.

### Maithripala Sirisena: The highest President has violated the constitution and basic rights

*2024-06-10 06:24:52* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c0ww1537rv0o) · `si`

Based on the detailed account you've provided, here's a summary of the fundamental rights cases against Maithripala Sirisena and the rulings issued against him:



### Fundamental Rights Cases Against Maithripala Sirisena



1. **Dissolution of Parliament**: Maithripala Sirisena, while serving as the Executive President, dissolved the Parliament on November 9, 2018, leading to a general election held on January 5, 2019. This action led to several fundamental rights petitions being filed against him, challenging the legality of the dissolution.



2. **Violation of Constitutional Provisions**: The Supreme Court examined the petitions and issued a divisional injunction against the gazette notification issued by President Sirisena, preventing the dissolution of Parliament. The court ruled that the dissolution was unconstitutional because it did not comply with the required procedures outlined in the Constitution.



3. **Misuse of Power**: The Supreme Court further found that President Sirisena had abused his powers by not adhering to the legal requirements for dissolving Parliament. Specifically, the dissolution did not occur after the expiration of four and a half years following the previous general election, nor was it preceded by a vote of no-confidence in the government.



4. **Constitutional Violations**: The court concluded that President Sirisena's actions were in direct violation of the Constitution, particularly Article 70(1), which outlines the conditions under which the President may dissolve Parliament.



### Rulings Issued Against Maithripala Sirisena



1. **Compensation Order**: Following the Supreme Court's ruling, Maithripala Sirisena was ordered to pay Rs. 103 million as compensation for violating the fundamental rights of citizens through his unconstitutional actions.



2. **Interim Injunction**: This was the first time the Supreme Court issued an interim injunction against the President, suspending the gazette notification that led to the dissolution of Parliament.
