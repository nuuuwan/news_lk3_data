    "Mohammed Mihilar Mohammed  Hanzeer alias  Azad Maulana was the main whistleblower featured in the Channel 4 documentary on Sri Lanka that was aired on 5 September  2023. . Azad Maulana made some startling revelations against former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, State Intelligence Service head Maj-Gen Suresh Salley and Rural Road Development State Minister  Shivanesathurai Santhirakanthan known widely as Pillaiyan in that film. Gotabaya, Suresh and Pillaiyan have denied the allegations..",
    "There were two main aspects in the disclosures made by Azad Maulana. One was the allegation that top  Sri Lankan intelligence  officials were involved  with those responsible for the horrible  Easter Sunday terror bombings of Churches  and Tourist Hotels on 21 April 2019.  Maulana alleged that the bombings were done as part of a plot to help Gotabaya become President by creating  feelings of insecurity among the people.",
    "The other important aspect of Azad Maulana\u2019s statements in the TV documentary was the  allegation  about  a killer squad reportedly formed by Gotabaya  Rajapaksa when he was the Defence Secretary under his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was alleged that  many members of the Thamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal(TMVP) led by Pillayaan were part of this squad known as \u201cTripoly Platoon\u201d and that this squad was responsible for many extra-judicial killings, enforced disappearances and other human rights violations.",
    "Gotabaya Rajapaksa who became the President of Sri Lanka in November 2019 and quit office in July 2022  broke his conspicuous silence by issuing a statement of denial  after the documentary was aired. However Gotabaya made no reference to the allegation about \u201cTripoly  Platoon\u201d in the statement. The statement issued by the Defence Ministry refuting the Channel 4 \u201crevelations\u201d also had no reference to this.",
    "TMVP leader and  Rural Road Development State Minister Santhirakanthan alias Pillayaan faced the challenge posed by the Channel 4 TV disclosures directly. Since whistleblower Azad Maulana was his former key aide, Pillayaan took up the matter personally. The Batticaloa district MP gave a number of media interviews to newspapers and TV refuting the allegations against him and accusing his erstwhile deputy of being economic with the truth.",
    "One does not know whether the allegation about  the existence of a killer squad named Tripoly Platoon is true or not. However the  charge of alleged involvement by  Pillayaan\u2019s group in various human rights violations  during the war years does have its merits. Several reports by UN related agencies and NGOs concerned with Human Rights violations  in Sri Lanka have mentioned Pillayaan\u2019s  group  in a negative light.",
    "I myself have in my journalistic capacity written several articles in different newspapers  about  incidents where  Pillayaan\u2019s group I was involved n the past.   Some of these  articles were about the killing of  journalist Aiyathurai ,Nadesan, the murders of TNA Parliamentarians Joseph  Pararajasingham and Nadarajah Raviraj,  the killing of former Amparai district MP A. Chandranehru and LTTE Eastern political commissar Kausalyan, the disappearance of Easterbn University Vice-chancellor Prof S.Raveendranath and the murder of seven  Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO) employees.",
    "It was well-known that the Pillayaan group was collaborating with the state  as a para-military outfit during the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) and were largely carrying out \u201cofficially sanctioned unofficial\u201d instructions. In most instances Pillayaan\u2019s goons were aided and abetted by state agencies in executing these orders",
    "It must be noted that the Pillayaan group was not the first of its kind to operate as a state sanctioned  para-military outfit in the Eastern province. The Pillayaan group was an off-shoot of the LTTE. But  before its advent ,at least three such para-military outfits  had collaborated with the state in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts.  With the passage of time, memories of the long war are  fading. Very few remember these armed groups now.",
    "All of these armed groups  were off-shoots of Tamil militant organizations.One was the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) off -shoot group led by Ranjan. The other was the Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) linked group led by Mohan. The third was the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) group led by Razeek. They were known as the Ranjan group, Mohan group and Razeek group respectively. Arguably the Razeek group  during its heyday was regarded as the most   vibrant of the three.",
    "Interestingly enough Razeek was not a Muslim as the name indicates. Razeek was a Tamil named Muthulingam Ganeshkumar whose nom de guerre was Razeek. Being totally opposed to the LTTE, Razeek  aligned himself with the Indian army first and later the Sri Lankan armed forces to fight the tigers. Ultimately he was killed by the LTTE This column focuses this week  with the aid of earlier writings on the Razeek group , its leader and his death at the hands of the LTTE.",
    "Muthulingam Ganeshkumar  alias Razeek was born in the ancient Tamil village of Karaitheevu in the Amparai district. Karaitheevu was the birthplace of the eminent Tamil scholar and spiritualist Swami Vipulananda (Samithamby Mailvaaganam).  Ganeshkumar\u2019s  father  Muthulingam was a government clerk while his mother was  a school teacher.",
    "Ganeshkumar  became a student activist of the General Union of Eelam Students (GUES) the student wing of the EPRLF during his school days. He flocked along with hundreds of Karaitheevu youth to the EPRLF after the 1983 anti- Tamil pogrom. The village itself was an EPRLF stronghold in the Amparai district like Thambiluvil and Paandiruppu. After being trained initially at an EPRLF camp in the East Razeek  was selected along with 119 other EPRLF cadres to undergo intensive training at Uttar Pradesh in early 1984.",
    "Returning to Sri Lanka Razeek was involved in EPRLF activity in the east till 1986. He was promoted and sent to Mullaitheevu. The LTTE trained its guns on  the TELO in April 1986 and followed suit against the EPRLF in December 1986. The comparatively weaker EPRLF found itself helpless in the face of the fratricidal onslaught by the LTTE.",
    "Razeek was compelled to  witness the killing of his comrades, not by the enemy, but by members of a fellow militant movement. Instead of liberating his homeland he was compelled to find ways and means of self-preservation. At one point Razeek cornered by the tigers had no choice other than to take his chances with the traditional enemy the \u201cSinhala\u201d army. He surrendered to the Mullaitheevu army camp. This was perhaps the defining moment of his life.",
    "Thereafter he along with some others cooperated with the Sri Lankan  Army. Razeek was engaged  as a \u201cSpotter\u201d  to identify LTTE cadres when Operation Liberation was conducted in Vadamaratchy by the army in  May 1987. The Indo-Lanka Accord of July 1987 transformed the situation. There was peace.",
    "The fragile peace was shattered when war broke out between the Indian Army  and the LTTE in October 1987, With the war  against the tigers escalating , New Delhi propped up the EPRLF  as an alternative to the LTTE. The EPRLF took over the newly established North \u2013 East Provincial council in November 1988.. The EPRLF\u2019s  Annamalai Varadarajapperumal became the chief minister.",
    "Razeek a close confidante of Perumal was elevated in rank. He functioned for a while in an \u201cunofficial\u201d  auxiliary unit to the Indian Army. Later he became a regional commandant of the Civilian Volunteer Force (CVF) mobilised by the India aided North -Eastern provincial council administration. The CVF was also described as the Tamil National Army.",
    "The Indiam Army returned  in toto to India  in March 1990. Razeek continued to  function independently  in the east for some time but was forced to leave for India to avoid being killed by the LTTE.  Nothing much was heard of him till he surfaced in Colombo after  full-scale war broke out between the Armed forces and the LTTE again. Also the EPRLF leader and secretary  \u2013 general Kandasamy Padmanabha had been killed by the LTTE in Madras in June 1990.",
    "The  new EPRLF Secretary General Kandiah  Premachandran alias Suresh  was not willing to resurrect the military wing of the EPRLF again. Razeek however wanted to go on with his avowed life mission of fighting the tigers. So he entered into a deal with the Army Intelligence section and formed his own group. Initially it was considered a break away faction of the EPRLF. Soon it became clear that it was functionally independent despite having  links to the EPRLF.",
    "The group bearing the nomenclature of \u201cRazeek Group\u201d for public consumption began functioning in the Eastern Province particularly the Batticaloa district. Coopted as a unit of the National Auxiliary Force , the Razeek group obtained military training and functioned as an integral unit of the army while retaining autonomy of action.",
    "Razeek himself had a simple unambiguous approach towards the LTTE. Unlike some  other Tamil groups who aligned  themselves with the army on the one hand but  were  sympathetically inclined  towards the LTTE on the other, the Razeek group fought as an integral part of the Sri Lankan army while retaining operational autonomy.",
    "The group was inducted into the national auxiliary corps and designated as the ninth battalion of the Sri Lankan National Guards. The 250 strong unit was  trained in the North Central Province Infantry training school at Minneriya. Razeek himself underwent   an officers training course. He was  commissioned as a second lieutnenant but refused to accept formal appointment saying that he was entitled to rank of Major or at least Captain because of his seniority. After his death Razeek was posthumously promoted as Lieutenant.",
    "Soon the Razeek group  became the most determined Tamil group fighting the LTTE. There was neither compromise nor reluctance. Unlike other Tamil groups , hunting with hounds and running with rabbits, the  Razeek group fought a bitter and bloody campaign. It soon became the dominant Tamil entity in Batticaloa town.",
    "The Razeek group  entrenched itself firmly  in Batticaloa. Their main camp  then was in the huge mansion and sprawling property on lake road opposite the lagoon, that was at one time the residence of former Parliamentarian Sam Thambimuthu. Both he and his wife Kala were gunned down in 1990 by the LTTE at the Canadian High Commission gateway in Colombo.",
    "The Razeek group had a pervasive,dominant presence in the town and was  always on the alert for tiger infiltrators. As a result the LTTE found itself  unable to easily  penetrate the areas falling under Batticaloa Municipality. Razeek himself  boasted to journalists in Tamil that the tigers could not \u201cWag their tails\u201d (Vaalaatta  Aelaadhu) in Batticaloa, But fate decreed otherwise.  The tigers did  not merely wag  their tails  but pounced in a fatal leap.",
    "Ganeshkumar alias Razeek  had a craze for guns and motor cycles. On the fateful day of his death (29  May 1999) Razeek  had gone with some of his cadres to a garage and motor vehicles repairing unit called \u201cIvans\u2019 \u2018 in the heart of Batticaloa town. Run by a Batticaloa Burgher family it was situated on the Trincomalee Road Near the Central Bus Depot in an area called Thaandavan Veli.",
    "Razeek had gone to Ivans for the purpose of purchasing a motorcycle from a Muslim trader  named Mohammed Ali Thahir. There was also another motorcycle seized from a tiger cadre that was being repaired at Ivan\u2019s. There was absolutely no need for Razeek himself to attend personally to these tasks. But the motor cycle buff that he was,  Razeek did not want to delegate duties to others in this sphere.",
    "It was around 12. 30 noon when a youngster in his teens came cycling on the Trincomalee road. Razeek was then standing in the garage front compound and chatting to Thahir. His bodyguard Chandran Jeyakumar was a few yards away. Alongside Razeek was 27 year old Paramanathan Thayaparan alias Thaya his second in command. Further away was a double cab vehicle with four more armed cadres.",
    "The teenaged assassin suddenly cut in to the garage premises towards Razeek and jumped on him. The human bomb exploded. Razeek, Chandran, Thaheer and the killer were dead on the spot. Nine others including five of Razeek\u2019s cadres were injured. of them . Later Razeek\u2019s deputy Thaya too succumbed to his injuries in hospital. The tigers had struck again.",
    "The killing of 35 year old Razeek on 29 June 1999  was the first occasion on which the LTTE had  killed a leader of a rival Tamil group through the human bomb suicide attack method. As stated earlier the chief of  the \u201cRazeek Group \u201d  had acquired a name for himself as one who had dedicated himself wholeheartedly to the mission of fighting the tigers. But now the dreaded tiger hunter  had been hunted down by his quarry.",
    "A small group of journalists visiting  Batticaloa had  interviewed Razeek only a few days before he was killed. The confident Razeek had  then claimed proudly that in recent operations his men had killed 30 tigers. He  had lost 21 of his men. Razeek  also referred fondly to his phase of cooperation with the Indian Peace Keeping force(IPKF)  in the late eighties. He claimed to have hunted down and  killed 374 tigers then. When asked \u201cAre you scared the tigers will get you?\u201d Razeek had replied \u201cNo. it is a way of life. We have been in this game since 1983\u201d",
    "A detailed investigations  was launched  in Batticaloa to find out how the LTTE obtained intelligence concerning Razeek\u2019s movements. Preliminary investigations  revealed  that at least one of the employees at Ivans garage was a tiger informant.",
    "More importantly there was also  evidence that the group itself had been infiltrated by the LTTE. One of the cadres who had come with Razeek to the garage had excused himself after a while saying he was sick and got Razeek\u2019s permission to return to base. The   man never went back and was  suspected of  having tipped off the LTTE. Also a group of Razeek cadres had reportedly \u201cdeserted\u201d after the assassination. Subsequently a massive internal \u201ccleansing\u201d campaign  was undertaken. It was  supervised by the  group\u2019s acting head 33 year old Sivaguru Navaratnarajah alias \u201cGandhi\u201d.",
    "The man who had soldiered on in relentless pursuit  of the tigers was given a funeral with full military honours at Karaitheevu on May 30th 1999. The ceremony was presided over by Thurairatnam the  then EPRLF political head  for Batticaloa and Amparai districts. The military top brass of the region attended the funeral. Razik\u2019s coffin itself was wrapped in a Sri Lankan flag.",
    "A noteworthy feature was the conspicuous absence of public mourning for Razeek. The convulsions caused by his death within the group had prevented the cadres from organising  widespread demonstrations of mourning. As far as the ordinary people were concerned they did not seem saddened at all.",
    "The reason for this seemed obvious. Although Razeek was regarded in awe as a rare Tamil soul who fearlessly fought against the tigers there was an unsavoury side to his personality too. The EPRLF at one time was regarded as the least violent and most decent of the Tamil groups. The passage of time particularly in the case of its relationship vis a vis the LTTE had transformed that image. Razeek himself was both a creature and creator of the \u201cNew\u201d EPRLF.",
    "He acquired a reputation for ruthlessness during the IPKF period itself. He was no respecter of Human rights when it came to combatting the tigers. Also like many Tamil militants of Eastern origin, Razeek had  a sense of animus towards the Muslim people. It is alleged that Razik was responsible for the massacre of Muslim Policemen in 1990.",
    "After taking over Batticaloa in 1995, Razik began adopting very negative tactics in combatting the tigers. In a bid to outdo the LTTE in terror tactics,  Razeek built up a terrible and horrible reputation. It is said that he once dragged alive a suspected tiger cadre chained to his motorcycle for several miles along the road in full view of the public. There have been beheadings too. The group was notorious  for its torture methods when interrogating LTTE suspects.",
    "In addition Razeek began setting up a financial empire too. Massive amounts of money were extorted from the civilian population as taxes. Levies were imposed on almost every sector including farmers and businessmen.. Several businesses were set up and citizens compelled to patronise them A lucrative avenue of income was the monopoly exercised by the Razeek group in felling timber and transporting sand for building purposes.",
    "These negative attributes of Razeek made him very unpopular in the area. He was feared more than loved. In that context a public show of grief was definitely impossible.",
    "The death of Razeek who  was reputed for his relentless pursuit of tiger cadres in the east and the consequent decline of the Razeek group resulted in the creation of a vacuum in anti-LTTE activity in the east. This vacuum was filled some years later by the Pillayaan group.(ENDS)",
