    "Despite losing an early wicket, Kathryn Bryce emerged was undeterred and launched an attack during the Powerplay, striking two boundaries off Udeshika Prabodhani in an over. She dished out the same treat to Sugandika Kumari but the left-arm spinner had the last laugh by getting rid of the opposition skipper two balls later.",
    "Achini Kulasuriya struck in her first over and the last over of the Powerplay to leave Scotland reeling at 32/3.",

    "She needed only eight more balls to get to her half-century \u2013 the 10th of her T20I career \u2013 as Athapaththu (59* off 35 balls) kept the foot firmly on the accelerator with a massive boost to their net run rate in sight.",
    "Meanwhile, Vishmi Gunaratne played a supportive role with a composed unbeaten knock of 23 runs off 25 balls, as Sri Lanka cruised to victory with all 10 wickets intact and 59 balls to spare."
