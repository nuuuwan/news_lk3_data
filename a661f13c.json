    "The first publication of the \u2018Skills, Aspirations and Reintegration Challenges of Returned Migrant Workers\u2019 report was presented to Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment Secretary R.P. A. Wimalaweera, by YouLead Deputy Project Director Chrishan Pereira. Copies of the report were also presented to the Embassy of Switzerland in Sri Lanka Deputy Head of mission Raoul Imbach, and USAID Sri Lanka and the Maldives Acting Deputy Mission Director Ali Ezzatyar",
    "Others in the picture: SDC National Program Officer Eimackshan Emmanuel, Section Migration and Forced Displacement (SMFD) Senior National Program Officer Rangitha Balasuriya, USAID Economic Growth Office Deputy Director Micah Globerson, USAID Project Management Specialist Dr. Janaka Wijayasiri, IPS Research Fellow Dr. Bilesha Weeraratne, and SRMW Project Director Rukshan Lovell",
    "The first publication of the recently concluded migrant worker research study entitled, \u2018Skills, Aspirations and Reintegration Challenges of Returned Migrant Workers: Evidence from Selected Districts in Sri Lanka\u2019, was presented to Labour and Foreign Employment Ministry Secretary R.P.A. Wimalaweera by the Skilled and Resilient Migrant Workers (SRMW) project.",
    "The SRMW project is funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), within the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) YouLead initiative.",
    "Conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on behalf of the SRMW project, this study bridges existing empirical data gaps on returned migrant workers, with a focus on challenges to economic reintegration related to skills development and qualifications recognition. Primary data for the study was collected from a sample survey of returned migrant workers in the project\u2019s priority districts: Anuradhapura, Kandy, Kurunegala, Puttalam and Vavuniya, of which a majority were women migrant workers.",
    "Policymakers at the event were presented with an overview of the report followed by an in-depth discussion of implications by an eminent panel of experts, led by IPS Research Fellow Dr. Bilesha Weeraratne. Insights on skills development, self-employment and entrepreneurship, reintegration services and gender-based challenges were highlights of the discussion. The panel was comprised of Ministry of Education Skills Development Director Dasitha Niroshan, Women\u2019s Economic Rights and Media at the Women and Media Collective Director of Programs Dr. Sepali Kottegoda, Venture Frontier Sri Lanka Co-founder and Director Heminda Jayaweera, and Minister of Foreign Employment Advisor Padmini Ratnayake.",
    "Receiving the report, Ministry Secretary Wimalaweera said: \u201cWith many Sri Lankans migrating for work, identifying suitable and productive methods of reintegration upon their return also becomes a continuous requirement. The findings and recommendations of this report will be useful for future evidence-based policy improvement towards effective reintegration.\u201d",
    "Emphasising the role of the SRMW project within the Safe Labour Migration program, Embassy of Switzerland in Sri Lanka Deputy Head of mission Raoul Imbach said, \u201cSkilled resilience is a key focus of the Safe Labour Migration program initiated by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, which is now in its fourth phase. Through our funding of the SRMW project and its activities such as this research study, we continue to support the improvement and implementation of Sri Lanka\u2019s National Labour Migration Policy and empowerment of the country\u2019s migrant workers.\u201d",
    "Expressing USAID\u2019s commitment to empower Sri Lanka\u2019s migrant workers, USAID Sri Lanka and the Maldives Acting Deputy Mission Director Ali Ezzatyar, said \u201cAt a time when many Sri Lankans are seeking opportunities overseas, USAID wants to help minimise the negative impacts of their departure for both the migrants and the country, and ensure that when these workers return, they can reintegrate and utilise new skills and experiences obtained abroad to contribute to the development of Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Improving the resilience of Sri Lanka\u2019s migrant workers through skills development and recognition, guidance services and access to information are priorities of the SRMW project, and this research study marks the first of several of SRMW\u2019s policy related initiatives."
