    "Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Ltd. (SLICGL), the general insurance subsidiary of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. (SLIC), is entering a new phase of growth and innovation following its official segregation on Feb 1.",
    "Commenting on the outlook for SLICGL, Chandana L. Aluthgama, Group Chief Executive Officer, SLIC said, \u201cAfter over 62 years of successful operations, the mandated separation of the life and general insurance businesses enables us to be more focused in our business strategies and ensures improved efficiency and effectiveness when serving our customers. Understanding this critical pivot, we have adapted to regulatory requirements as well as market dynamics and initiated operational separation across segments in 2018.\u201d",
    "Priyantha Perera, Chief Operating Officer, SLICGL said, \u201cIn 2023, our performance significantly outpaced industry growth rates, securing top position in the motor market for the fifth consecutive year at 6% growth, which is over 10 times faster than the industry growth average of 0.5% for this motor segment. Moreover, despite initially being behind in the non-motor sector, we narrowed the gap significantly, reducing it to LKR 1.5 billion last year from LKR 3 billion, and expanding the segment at 27%, which is well above the industry growth average of 13%.\u201d",
    "With the segregation complete, SLICGL is poised to capitalize on emerging opportunities, particularly in medical and non-motor insurance products.",
    "Perera explained, \u201cWith the introduction of customized medical insurance options, we aim to address market needs and contribute to building a robust healthcare insurance market in Sri Lanka. For instance, understanding requirements among individuals who may not have access to corporate insurance, we introduced two medical policies early last year to ensure they and their families have access to quality healthcare through affordable insurance products.\u201d",
    "SLICGL is also working to expand services and leverage technology to differentiate customer experience, with significant investments in digital infrastructure and artificial intelligence.",
