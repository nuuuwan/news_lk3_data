  "original_body_lines": [
    "As per the recently issued gazette notification, the income tax payments can only be made using three methods.",
    "The methods are by depositing cash, depositing pay order or bank draft or by the use of Online Tax Payment Platform (OTPP).",
    "While previously tax payments may have been made by cheque, the recent gazette notification does not identify payments via this avenue as an accepted method.",
    "Accordingly, the income tax payments, including payment of taxes administrated under the Inland Revenue Department, will not be allowed to be made by cheque.",
    "However, the payment methods highlighted in the April 4 gazette only apply to the tax payments under the provisions of Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. That is for Corporate Income Tax, Personal Income Tax, Withholding Tax, Advance Personal Income Tax and Capital Gain Tax.",
    "The payments of other taxes such as Value Added Tax, Social Security Contribution Levy, Stamp Duty and others can continue to be paid by cheque."
