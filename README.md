*2024-12-02 11:20:14* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/அமைச்சர்களுக்கு-இனி-பங்களாக்கள்-வழங்கப்படாது/175-348099) · `ta`

தேர்தல் விஞ்ஞாபனத்திற்கு அமைய பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர்களுக்கான சலுகைகளை குறைக்கும் நடவடிக்கையில், அமைச்சர்களுக்கு அரச பங்களாக்களை ஒதுக்காது இருக்க அரசாங்கம் தீர்மானித்துள்ளதாக அமைச்சர் ஒருவர் நேற்று தெரிவித்தார்.

மேலும், எம்.பி.க்களுக்கு ஐந்தாண்டுகளுக்கு ஒருமுறை வழங்கப்படும் வரியில்லா வாகன அனுமதிகளும் ரத்து செய்யப்படும்.

கடந்த அரசாங்கங்களில் பதவி வகித்த அமைச்சர்களுக்கு ஒதுக்கப்பட்ட அரச பங்களாக்களை என்ன செய்வது என்பதை அரசாங்கம் தீர்மானிக்கும் என பாராளுமன்ற விவகாரங்களுக்குப் பொறுப்பான பொது பாதுகாப்பு அமைச்சர் ஆனந்த விஜேபால நேற்று டெய்லி மிரருக்கு தெரிவித்தார்.

"தற்போதைய அரசாங்கத்தின் எந்த அமைச்சருக்கும் இந்த வீடுகளை நாங்கள் ஒதுக்க மாட்டோம்," என்று அவர் கூறினார்.

வரியின்றி வாகனங்களை இறக்குமதி செய்வதற்கான அனுமதிப் பத்திரங்களுக்குப் பதிலாக, பிரிவைச் சேர்ந்த பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர்களுக்கு விலை குறைந்த வாகனங்கள் அரசாங்கத்தினால் வழங்கப்படும் என அமைச்சர் தெரிவித்தார்.

*2024-12-02 11:15:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/200204) · `ta`

பொதுமக்கள் மக்களாட்சியின் மீதான நம்பிக்கையை இழக்காத வகையில் அரசியல் கட்சிகள் செயல்படவேண்டும் என்பது மிக முக்கியம். தேசிய பட்டியலுக்கான உறுப்பினர்களை நியமிப்பதில் பிரதான கட்சிகள் எதிர்கொண்டுள்ள இந்த சிக்கல்கள் இலங்கையின் அரசியல் நிர்வாகம் எவ்வளவு மேம்பட வேண்டும் என்பதைப் பற்றிய கண்ணோட்டத்தையும் வெளிப்படுத்துகிறது. சர்ச்சையின் முடிவுகள் கட்சியின் எதிர்கால பயணத்தை மட்டுமே அன்றி பாராளுமன்றத்தில் எதிர்க்கட்சிகளின் செயற்பாடுகளை பலப்படுத்தக் கூடியவையாகவும் அமைய வேண்டும்.

### New chapter for Sri Lanka: We cannot give something out of nothing

The railways, historically designed for goods transport, must be reimagined to meet modern needs economically

The nation spoke and a new Government was elected. Now it’s time to unite and work collectively to pull ourselves out of the economic crisis we face. But in doing this, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. While rooting out corruption is critical, it is not the sole solution to achieving prosperity. To truly transform the country, we must prioritise efficiency and overhaul the sluggish State mechanism, reorganising the way in which it runs.

Let’s take Sri Lanka Railways for example. Each year, the State pumps approximately Rs. 57 billion into the railway system in 2024, while its annual revenue from ticket sales is only a mere Rs. 12 billion. A staggering Rs. 45 billion was lost to the State due to inefficiency.

The Central Bank forecasts the headline inflation to remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, but expects it to turn positive thereafter and gradually align with the targeted level of 5% over the medium term, aided by appropriate policy measures.

Sri Lanka’s path to economic recovery owes much to the commendable leadership of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and his dedicated team. Their focus on structural reforms and anti-corruption measures is laying the foundation for a more resilient and equitable economy.

Amid these transformative efforts, a thought-provoking question emerged on social media recently: Should Sri Lanka retain the traditional eight-hour workday or explore a shorter six-hour workday? This debate touches on broader concerns about labour productivity and its critical role in driving economic growth.

Labour productivity is a fundamental driver of economic progress, directly influencing GDP growth and national prosperity. According to the Solow Growth Model of Economics, long-term economic growth is fuelled by labour growth, capital accumulation, and technological advancements.

### Child’s guide to Central Bank’s new monetary policy instrument: Overnight Policy Rate

When the policy rate of the Central Bank is reduced, the banks immediately cut the deposit rates meaning that they are downward flexible

Since REPO bids should be below OPR and Reverse-REPO bids should be above OPR, they are synonymous with SDFR and SLFR, respectively. Since they should be around OPR, the earlier announced SDFR and SLFR become irrelevant. Also, commercial banks should fix their call rates around OPR. That is how call rates are manipulated by the Central Bank through rules and OPR practices

The rise of floating voters signifies a shift in the political landscape of Sri Lanka, where loyalty to political parties is no longer a given

Recent Presidential and Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka reveal a clear and growing trend: a significant portion of the electorate now comprises “floating voters.” These voters are characterised by their willingness to change political loyalties frequently, driven by a quest for the most suitable solutions to the nation’s issues. Unlike a party’s core supporters, their allegiance is not fixed, and they are open to shifting their vote based on the performance and vision of the political parties at any given time.

A publicly available, regularly monitored and updated strategic plan, where achieved outcomes or reasons for not meeting outcomes are truthfully told to the public, will change the mirage mentality to one of reality. Stating the truth however is paramount to make this happen as politically convenient untruths will be of no benefit to the people and the country and the strategic planning exercise will be a waste of time
