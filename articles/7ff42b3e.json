    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has sought a 6.8 percent tariff hike, spread uniformly across consumer groups, according to a public consultation document published by the regulator.",
    "The increase is sought mostly on account of higher demand forecast being met by thermal energy, the regulator said.",
    "There were also some work-in-progress and finance costs, including capital repayments and some penalty interest due to renewable energy suppliers.",
    "The CEB has proposed spreading the increase evenly across consumer groups.",
    "Sri Lanka has highly discriminatory pricing, with the regulator and utility picking winners and losers with wide gaps.",
    "Among the worst hit are houses with higher usage (domestic demand does go up in the night peak) and general purpose customers. However, hotels also use power in the night.",
    "Under the current pricing system, cross subsidizing consumers are permitted. (Colombo/Sept10/2025)"
