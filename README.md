### Canada to cut immigration numbers, government source says

Canada will sharply lower the number of immigrants it allows into the country for the first time in years, marking a notable shift in policy for the government as it tries to remain in power.

Canada will bring in 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027, down from 485,000 in 2024, according to a government source.

The number of temporary residents, meanwhile, will decrease by about 30,000 to around 300,000 in 2025, the source said.

Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers, but in recent years, the national debate around immigrants has shifted in part due to rising housing prices.

Many Canadians have been priced out of the housing market since interest rates started rising two years ago. At the same time, a huge influx of immigrants has pushed Canada’s population to record levels, further boosting housing demand and prices.

Sri Lanka: Former Minister Kanchana Vijayaratne criticizes government over Israel tourism threat.

Two suspects were arrested under terrorism investigation related to the alleged threat against Israeli tourists.

🟩

இலங்கையின் அறுகம் குடா பகுதியில் இஸ்ரேலிய சுற்றுலாப் பயணிகள் மீது தாக்குதல் நடாத்தப்படக்கூடிய அச்சுறுத்தல்கள் குறித்து ஒக்டோபர் 07 ஆம் திகதிக்கு முன்னர் தகவல் கிடைத்த போதிலும் தற்போதைய அரசாங்கம் அது தொடர்பில் நடவடிக்கை எடுக்காமல் இருந்தது குறித்து முன்னாள் அமைச்சர் காஞ்சன விஜேசேகர கவலை வெளியிட்டுள்ளார்.

எச்சரிக்கப்பட்ட தாக்குதல்கள் பற்றிய தகவல்கள் தொடர்பாக முன்னெடுக்கப்பட்ட நடவடிக்கைகள் குறித்து வெளிநாட்டு இராஜதந்திர அதிகாரிகளுக்கு அரசாங்கம் ஏன் விளக்கமளிக்கவில்லை என்று காஞ்சன தனது எக்ஸ் பக்கத்தில் கேள்வி எழுப்பியுள்ளார்.

"தேசிய பாதுகாப்புக்கு ஏற்படும் அச்சுறுத்தலை ஒருபோதும் சாதாரணமாக எடுத்துக் கொள்ளக்கூடாது, சுற்றுலா வருமானம் நாட்டின் மிக முக்கியமான வருமான ஆதாரங்களில் ஒன்றாகும்" என்று காஞ்சன விஜேசேகர கூறினார்.

He pointed out that if the government had had an advance information and explained it to diplomatic embassies, he could have prevented Sri Lanka's travel advice alert on the basis of precautionary measures taken.

The United States said for the first time on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that could mark a significant escalation in Russia’s war against its neighbor.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in Rome, said it would be “very, very serious” if the North Koreans were preparing to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, as Kyiv has alleged. But he said it remained to be seen what they would be doing there.

“There is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,” Austin told reporters, using North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Speaking to reporters later on Wednesday White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States believes at least 3,000 North Korean troops are undergoing training at three military bases in eastern Russia.

### Sri Lanka SOE container terminal to get tax exemptions as ‘special project’

*2024-10-24 09:13:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-soe-container-terminal-to-get-tax-exemptions-as-special-project-184708/) · `en`

ECONOMNYNEXT – A container terminal built by Sri Lanka Ports Authority has been named a ‘special project’ by the cabinet to give tax benefits Minister Vijitha Herath said.

Private terminals in the port are given tax benefits under a Strategic Development Project law.

The excessive length of tax breaks as well as exempting senior official’s companies from personal income tax under the SDP when people earning above 100,000 rupees are taxed has become a contentious issue.

“The International Monetary Fund has objected to benefits under the Strategic Development Act law,” Minister Herath said.

“This is not going under that process. It is going as a special project.”

The SDP had come under fire also for negotiated tax breaks, which allegedly leads to corruption as there are no fixed rules.

The East Terminal is now partially built and contracts for cranes have been awarded, a post-cabinet statement said.

“The other two jetties have been given some tax exemptions,” Minister Herath explained.

### AKD’s call for a ‘powerful’ government: Implications for political system

*2024-10-24 05:44:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-s-call-for-a-powerful-government-Implications-for-political-system/4-768355) · `en`

In his stump speech on the General Election campaign trail, President AKD has called for the voters to produce a “powerful” (“balavath”, “prabala”) government.

Interestingly, he did not call for a “strong” (shakthimath”) government which is conventionally the opposite of a “weak” one. Given where he’s coming from, that distinction and his choice of words should give us pause.

Sri Lanka, Ceylon at the time, was not only the first in Afro-Asia to have universal franchise but it was also the first in South Asia to evolve a two-party system. India which was independent a year before Ceylon, maintained what was defined in the political science literature as a ‘one-party dominant’ system until 1977. That was the party of Independence, the Congress party. The term ‘one-party dominant’ was minted to differentiate such countries from those which had a ‘one-party system’ be it Fascist (e.g., Spain’s Falange) or Communist.

The 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka Anura Kumara Dissanayake

One could not ask for a better market place than the recently staged Presidential election – 17.4 million consumers (voters), targeted essentially by four brands (though there were 38 Presidential candidates registered). Each brand had the stipulation of Rs. 1.8 billion within a two-month period. Given that Sri Lanka is an island nation, it was a ‘perfect market place’. All candidates had the freedom to travel, freedom to use any medium of communication. The candidate that secured the highest share was declared the winner. Let me pick up the key lessons for businesses.
