    "He took oaths before Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena following the commencement of the parliamentary proceedings at 9.30 a.m. today.",
    "On 09 August 2024, the Supreme Court determined that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya\u2019s (SJB) decision to expel then Galle District Member of Parliament Manusha Nanayakkara and the National List Member of Parliament Harin Fernando from the party is legally valid. As a result, the two Parliamentary seats became vacant.",
    "The Supreme Court declared this ruling while dismissing the petitions filed by Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkkara challenging the SJB\u2019s decision to remove them from their party membership.",
    "On July 18, 2023, the Working Committee of the SJB decided to expel party members Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara from the party.
