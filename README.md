NPP MP Nilanti Kothachi yesterday (21) said that the people have the right to believe in the truth or false.

Speaking at an event in Kalutara, he said that the people have the right to look at the adverse side of the government's good things and that the government will never prevent the democratic right.

"You have a full right to make any truth false and no false. That's your democratic right. You have the right to see the negative side when the government does something good. Moreover, you have the right to appreciate a leader, government, company or individual community when doing harmful actions, ‚Äùhe said.

He said it would take time to get the effect of an action and it was better to wait until the results came up before criticizing something.

He said that the NPP members had never lied during the election campaign to bring Anurakumara Dissanayake to the presidential post.

### Delhi students send bomb threat to their schools to delay exams

A bizarre revelation has emerged in the ongoing investigation into bomb threats sent to several schools in Delhi.

The Special Cell of Delhi Police has discovered that at least two schools in the Rohini district received threatening emails from their own students, who wanted to postpone exams due to lack of preparation.

‚ÄúAfter investigation by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, it was found that the emails were sent to both schools by two different students of the same school,‚Äù Delhi police said in a statement.

‚ÄúBoth students had sent this email to stop the exam because they were not prepared for the exam paper. Since both of them were students, they were counselled and then let off,‚Äù police added.

One of the schools that received bomb threats was Venkateshwar Global School, which received a threatening email a day after a mysterious blast occurred at the Rohini Prashant Vihar PVR Multiplex on November 28.

### Ministry assures quality of MOP fertilizer donated by Russia

The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands, and Irrigation has issued a statement assuring the quality of the Muriate of Potash (MOP) fertilizer stock donated by a Russian state-owned company.

The statement addresses concerns raised by farmers and farmer organizations regarding the color of the fertilizer.

After analyzing the composition of the imported stock and verifying other standards, it has been confirmed that the fertilizer meets the required quality standards.

The ministry explained that the color of the fertilizer is influenced by the mineral salts in the deposit. Specifically, the presence of iron oxide gives the fertilizer a red color, while its absence results in a white color. The variation in color does not affect the fertilizer‚Äôs functionality and provide the same amount of potassium, it said.

This clarification is based on findings from soil scientist Renuka de Silva, whose report confirmed that the fertilizer is safe and effective for use.

### Dynasties of Deceit: The Philippines‚Äô Curse

*2024-12-22 02:52:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dynasties-of-deceit-the-philippines-curse/) ¬∑ `en`

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, crafted in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution, was supposed to mark the dawn of a new democratic era. The ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., after decades of corruption, repression, and dynastic rule, was a victory for the Filipino people, or so they were told. Yet, the Constitution, supposedly a tool for dismantling the oppressive old order, contains a glaring, unimplemented clause: Article II, Section 26, which bans political dynasties. Nearly four decades later, this promise remains a cruel joke, the prohibition nothing more than a symbol of a nation shackled by its own feudal past. Political dynasties thrive unabated, and the Philippines remains trapped in a cycle of oligarchy, where power is passed down like a family heirloom, not earned through democratic means.

### Ronnie de Mel‚Äôs George Keyt Paintings

*2024-12-22 02:49:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ronnie-de-mels-george-keyt-paintings/) ¬∑ `en`

I first met Ronnie de Mel (1925-2024) less than six months before his passing. At the time, he was 98 years old and confined to a wheelchair, yet his memory and sharp intellect were as formidable as ever. The purpose of our initial meeting was to interview him for information about another former politician with whom he had worked somewhat closely in the legislature. De Mel hailed from a different era‚Äîthree or perhaps four generations before mine. Despite the age gap, his critical thinking and incisive responses often made more sense than those of many of his successors. In his most recent book Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha commented de Mel was ‚Äú‚Ä¶intellectually head and shoulders above all subsequent Finance Ministers‚Äù. It is no exaggeration to say that de Mel was one of the architects of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Open Economy, introduced in 1977. As Minister of Finance, he successfully balanced 11 consecutive budgets and was a trusted confidante of President J.R. Jayewardene.

### Sri Pada ‚Äì certainties, myths, memories

With the poya of December, the Sri Pada season is declared open. This announcement was made on Dec. 14 ‚Äì Unduvap Poya ‚Äì a week ago. As always, with seeing the press announcement, a rush of memories crowded my mind. They had to be shared. Personal but permissible, I expect.

Sri Pada, aka Adam‚Äôs Peak and Samanala Kanda, is the fifth tallest peak in Sri Lanka‚Äôs Hill Country at 2,243 m or 7, 359 ft. The mountain rises from its foothills grown commercially with tea, and soars as a conical shaped single rock whose peak now has been flattened to accommodate viewing areas and buildings, including a temple where the monks in charge live. It is under the religious purview of the Saman Devale in Ratnapura. Needless to mention is the fact that its fame is due to the footprint at the very summit, gold painted.

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of memoirs by LC Arulpragasam)

I need now to recount my sailing adventures, or shall we say, misadventures. Although I had never sailed before, I did not think twice before I shoved off on my own. On my first effort, with the wind at my back, I unfurled my sails in goose-wing style and was soon hurtling along at a whistling pace. I cannot describe the exhilaration of being one with the water and the wind, with the wind at my back and the gurgle of water in my wake. After about two hours, I reached the other side of the lake near Trevignano, just as the sun was setting.

Mahinda‚Äôs victory (in 2005) marked an inflection point. He did not abrogate the ceasefire agreement he had inherited, and even engaged in a round of negotiations with the LTTE. At the same time, he allowed the Sri Lankan military a freer rein. In December 2005, for instance, the navy retaliated to an LTTE bombing by attacking a residential area in the northern town of Mannar.

In 2006, the JVP, then in Mahinda‚Äôs alliance, filed a case in the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of an earlier merger of the Tamil-dominated North and East, effected in 1987. Fighting escalated and the ceasefire collapsed.

China accounted for more than half of Sri Lanka‚Äôs bilateral debt at the time of the 2022 economic crash, when Colombo ran out of foreign exchange to pay for essential imports such as food, fuel and medicines.

Its economy is recovering after receiving an International Monetary Fund rescue package and imposing austerity reforms aimed at repairing the government‚Äôs ruined finances.

Leftist Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.
