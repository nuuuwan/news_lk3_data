    "The approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received for the elimination of anomalies in pensions in the government service.",
    "Issuing a statement in this regard, the Department of Government Information (DGI) said that certain groups of pensioners have experienced anomalies in their pensions due to various policy decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers as well as the salary revisions carried out from time to time by the government.",
    "Accordingly, it has been observed that the government officers who retired from 01 January 2016 to 01 January 2020 have confronted this injustice and that relief can be bestowed for around 83,000 retired government officials by eliminating that salary anomaly, it added.",
