    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka firms are targeting to recover plastic packaging used in products in a phased program endorsed by the\u00a0 island\u2019s Ministry of Environment where almost 100 percent of waste will be recovered over five years, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.",
    "\u201cThis initiative is part of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model, which requires all stakeholders involved in generating plastic waste to take responsibility for recycling and minimising the use of plastic packaging,\u201d the Chamber said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThe implementation of this model aligns with global EPR legislation, which aims to mitigate the environmental risks associated with single-use plastic waste by holding plastic manufacturers, importers, and brand owners accountable for the end-of-life management of plastic packaging, and is a significant step forward in addressing Sri Lanka\u2019s escalating plastic waste management challenge.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Ceylon Cold Stores, a producer of beverages and ice cream, said it had recycled more than 300 metric tons of plastics in the past year and was looking for alternative packaging.",
    "Ceylon Cold Stores said it had invested 23 million rupees in recycling last year. Plastic bottle collection had increased 10 times to 311 metric tonnes from 39.9 million tonnes. (Colombo/July25/2023)"
