### Surprise defeat for far-right in France in Macron’s snap election gambit

*2024-07-08 11:25:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/surprise-defeat-for-far-right-in-france-in-macrons-snap-election-gambit-171206/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — President Emanuel Macron’s gamble in calling a snap poll somewhat paid off after a left-wing alliance secured the highest number of seats in the French parliament, effectively defeating an alliance led by the far-right National Rally.

The Economist reported that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN)-led bloc, which was widely anticipated to top the voting, will now end up in third place, securing 134 to 152 seats. However, this is still a major win for the once-fringe party which only held 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, indicating the mainstreaming of its hard-right ideology.

A left-wing alliance led by Jean-Luc Melenchon is projected to have secured 171-187 seats after what CNN has called tactical voting in Sunday’s second round election. CNN noted that France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority.

### Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

*2024-07-08 11:07:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/) · `en`

A pardon is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary ‘as an act of grace’. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an “action of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or conviction”. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons – one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons – one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

Some penal codes contain provisions that discriminate against women and girls, and poor enforcement of laws further contributes to abuses going unpunished.”

### Indian PM Modi makes first visit to ally Russia since start of Ukraine war

Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi’s importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports.

### A Child’s Guide To Debt & Restructuring: Country Driven To Economic Collapse Has Not Many Options

Aseni, the whiz kid has been alive to the debate over the debt situation of Sri Lanka. Despite her familiarity of the subject as a student of economics and finance, she says that she has not been able to comprehend many arguments presented by those who are pro or against the restructuring of the country’s debt. She turned to her Grandpa, Sarath Mahatthaya, a retired official of the Ministry of Finance, for help. The following is the interaction between the two on the issue.

Aseni: Grandpa, I have listened to the address of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to the nation last month and to the Parliament early this month over the success of his Government in reaching an agreement with bilateral creditors to restructure Sri Lanka’s external debt. He tagged this as ‘Good News’ drawing on terminology used by Bible writers. But his message was unclear to me. What was it?

### Worsening external deficit to improve fiscal deficit: Jumping from frying pan into the fire

*2024-07-08 00:31:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Worsening-external-deficit-to-improve-fiscal-deficit-Jumping-from-frying-pan-into-the-fire/4-763944) · `en`

Are we taking the right measures to address the debt problem?

After a disastrous handling of the economy during and in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, the then President was unceremoniously (and possibly justifiably) removed from office. But is the economy on the right track since then?

The relative stability of the economy since mid-2022 was broadly due to the following:

2. Increase in rainfall in mid-2022, which eased the power cuts. As the rainfall reduced towards the end of 2022, electricity tariff was increased sharply which reduced demand.

3. Halt of service of foreign debt which decreased foreign currency outflows.

4. Exorbitant increase in interest rates and depreciation of currency in mid-2022 which plummeted demand for imports and eased foreign currency outflows. While interest rates have fallen sharply in recent months, Rupee has also strengthened to an extent.

### Will environmentalists stall new 50MW Mannar wind power project?

Instead of protesting against an RE project, which will contribute to Sri Lanka’s much needed energy security and take us a step forward towards freedom from fossil fuels, why aren’t these protestors doing some real environmental work on the ground?

Recently a group of environmentalists and a religious leader approached the Supreme Court against a renewable energy project to come up in the country’s north.

Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Throughout its post-independence history, Sri Lanka has been a big consumer and a bad saver

The Central Bank alone had a foreign debt obligation of $ 6 billion, converting its foreign reserves to a net negative position of $ 2.5 billion. The country should repay all its foreign debt when it will become due, not merely the central government foreign debt. It would have been better had the President spoken of the total country foreign debt position as the Head of the State without confining himself to a small fraction of the central government debt

முதுபெரும் தமிழ் அரசியல் தலைவரும் திருகோணமலை மாவட்டத்தின் நீண்டகால பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினருமான இராஜவரோதயம் சம்பந்தன் 2024 ஜூன் 30 கொழும்பில் அமைதியாக இயற்கை எய்தினார். 90 வயதைக் கடந்த அவர் அண்மைக்காலமாக சுகவீனமுற்றிருந்தார். இராப்போசனத்துக்கு பிறகு  சூலமங்கலம் சகோதரிகள் இராஜலக்சுமியும் ஜெயலக்சுமியும் பாடிய ‘ கந்தசஷ்டி கவசம் ‘ பக்திப்பாடலை ஒலிநாடாவில்  கேட்டுக்கொண்டிருந்தபோது ஒரு வேதனை முனகலுடன் சம்பந்தன் நிலைகுலைந்தார். உடனடியாக லங்கா வைத்தியசாலைக்கு கூட்டிச்செல்லப்பட்ட அவர் அங்கு இரவு 11 மணியளவில் தனது இறுதி மூச்சைவிட்டார்.

பாலன் தேவராய சுவாமிகளினால் இயற்றப்பட்ட கந்தசஷ்டி கவசம் முருகப்பெருமானைப் போற்றும் பாடல்களைக் கொண்டது. சிவபெருமான் — பார்வதியின் இரண்டாவது மகனான முருகன் ‘ தமிழ்க்கடவுள் ‘ என்று போற்றப்படுகிறார்.  கந்தசஷ்டி கவசத்தைக் கேட்டுக்கொண்டிருந்தபோது அமைதியாக மரணமடைவது ஒரு இந்து பக்தனைப் பொறுத்தவரை உண்மையில் ஆசீர்வதிக்கப்பட்ட ஒரு மரணமாகும். மிகவும் ஆழமான மதநம்பிக்கையுடைய சம்பந்தனின் குலதெய்வம் திருகோணமலை பத்திரகாளி அம்மன்.
