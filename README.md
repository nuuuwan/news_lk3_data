Currently responsible religious leaders say that the group, including Sahran, is a maneuver for Gotabhaya Rajapakse to take over to this.

Gotabhaya Rajapakse's political mistakes are a different story. But if this is an attempt to call Gotabhaya Rajapakse a maneuver, it should be seen as a conspiracy to cover up these issues.. It is not acceptable that he was aware of this.

Meanwhile, 95 percent of the MPs would not have read the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sunday Attack.. You have to see who witnessed the Commission.

In a glass cage in a Moscow court stands Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov on Wednesday (April 24), a day after he was arrested at work for accepting large bribes.

The court remanded him in custody for two months and said Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties to receive property and services while working for the ministry of defense.

Ivanov, deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages.

The defense ministry, whose spending has spiraled since the start of the war, has made no comment.

Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu.
