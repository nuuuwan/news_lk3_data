  "original_body_lines": [
    "A Sri Lankan fisherman was injured in a petrol bomb attack by a suspected Indonesian fishing vessel on the high seas off the coast of Galle, Sri Lanka.",
    "The fisherman, who has not been named, was on board a multiday fishing trawler named Sachintha Putha when it collided with the foreign vessel on June 22.",
    "Following the collision, the men in the foreign vessel allegedly attacked the Sri Lankan trawler with a petrol bomb, which caused the fisherman to sustain burn injuries.",
    "The Sri Lanka Navy was alerted to the incident by the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. The Navy, at the directives of Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, made prompt arrangements to bring the wounded fisherman ashore.",
    "The Navy contacted the Bulk Carrier SPAR MIRA, which was sailing in the same sea area, and requested that they assist in the rescue of the fisherman. The Bulk Carrier responded to the Navy's request and retrieved the injured fisherman, bringing him on board. Instead of continuing its original course towards Singapore, the ship altered its route and sailed approximately 400 nautical miles to the southern sea area of Sri Lanka last evening.",
    "A Fast Attack Craft attached to the Southern Naval Command transferred the fisherman brought by SPAR MIRA\u2019 and took him to the Galle harbor, while administering first aid. The wounded fisherman was then rushed to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle for further medical attention.",
    "The Navy is currently investigating the incident, and they are working to identify the foreign vessel that attacked the trawler."
