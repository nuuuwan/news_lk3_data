    "IGP Deshabandu Tennekoon says it is premature to comment on whether Sirisena will be arrested",
    "Claims special security measures would be implemented to guarantee Sirisena\u2019s safety",
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to appear before the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) today to provide a statement to investigators regarding his recent contentious remarks concerning the Easter Sunday attack and its masterminds.",
    "On 22 March, Sirisena expressed his readiness to disclose the true masterminds behind the Easter Sunday terror attack of 2019 if directed by the Court. The former President claimed to personally possess this information.",
    "He asserted that he was informed of this information three weeks ago, expressing reluctance to disclose it publicly due to concerns for his safety and that of his family.",
    "According to Police Spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa, Sirisena has informed the Police he will appear before the CID today as requested.",
    "After the former President\u2019s controversial statement came to light on Friday, the Catholic Church urged the CID, the Ministry of Public Security, and all pertinent authorities to swiftly take action to apprehend Sirisena.",
    "Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Catholic Committee led by MP Kavinda Jayawardena also lodged a complaint with the Police on Saturday urging an impartial investigation to be launched into Sirisena\u2019s statement.",
    "In the latest development, Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has also directed the Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennekoon to promptly initiate an investigation into former President Sirisena\u2019s recent statement concerning the Easter Sunday bombings.",
    "Addressing the media yesterday, IGP Tennekoon stated that it was premature to determine whether Sirisena would be arrested, emphasising that initial investigators must ascertain the details of the information he wishes to convey. \u201cWe cannot arrest someone based on a comment broadcast in the media alone. We will obtain his statement and it will be investigated,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us see what he has to say. Let us look at this positively. What if he provides a good tip on the masterminds? Should we arrest him then as well?\u201d he asked.",
    "He noted that special security measures would be implemented following discussions with the Minister of Public Security to guarantee Sirisena\u2019s safety following his visit to the CID today."
