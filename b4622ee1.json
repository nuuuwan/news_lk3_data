    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s sports minister, Roshan Ranasinghe, was removed from his ministerial portfolios on Monday (27) after he accused President Ranil Wickramasinghe of trying to assassinate him.",
    "\u201cI am scared that I will be killed over my decisions on the cricket board,\u201d Ranasinghe told parliament on Monday morning ahead of a cabinet meeting. \u201cIf I am found dead, the president and his staff will be responsible.\u201d",
    "Earlier this month, Ranasinghe dismissed Sri Lanka Cricket board members and appointed an interim committee ostensibly due to the Sri Lanka cricket team\u2019s performance at the recently concluded ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup 2023 where they lost seven out of nine games.",
    "The decision led to Sri Lanka being suspended by the International Cricket Council, citing political interference. (Colombo/Nov27/2023)"
