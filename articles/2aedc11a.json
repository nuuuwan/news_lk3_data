    "Last week\u2019s presidential election was doubtless one of the most consequential in US history. Though the outcome was not predictable \u2013 most polls showed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump \u2013 with the benefit of hindsight one can say that the Democrats should have seen it coming. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be a slew of analyses and diagnoses claiming to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. Yet as Sri Lankan political analyst Rajni Gamage rightly put it in a recent tweet, such diagnoses are themselves problematic, and point to the biases of those making them.",
    "Depending on which side of the political spectrum you are, the Democrats lost because they pushed too hard to the left or right. In his statement on the election a day after results, Bernie Sanders argues that the party abandoned the working class \u2013 the same class that Joe Biden won over in 2020. This line, however, has been rejected by younger officials like Ritchie Torres, who in a tweet argues that the party swung too far to the left and did not do enough to pacify fears of anti-Semitism.",
    "Torres is one of two or three staunchly pro-Israeli Democratic politicians \u2013 on par with John Fetterman from Pennsylvania, a state that Harris lost \u2013 and his comments on the Israeli-Palestine War have been widely criticised. The War itself became a dealmaker: Michigan, which Biden won comfortably in 2020, went Trump\u2019s way after Arab-Americans, Palestinian-Americans, and Lebanese-Americans repeatedly tried and failed to get attention from the Democrats. Torres\u2019s argument, that the party empowered the far left to the extent of tolerating anti-Semitism, echoes similar claims made of the UK Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn. Yet it falls flat on the ground when one considers the extent to which the Democrats silenced if not ignored Muslim voices in battleground states.",
    "Sanders\u2019 statement has also been criticised, in particular considering that he polled less in his home state Vermont than did Harris. The argument that the Democratic Party \u201clost\u201d working class votes is only half-correct. True, Donald Trump effortlessly leveraged claims about illegal immigrants and inflation. True, Harris was not the most crisp and clear when it came to responding to criticisms that her party had not done enough for middle-class Americans. True, the Teamsters, one of the most influential trade unions in the US, broke with history by refusing to endorse a candidate in this election.",
    "And yet, the Democrats could easily have won their vote. Joe Biden based his presidency on an acknowledgement of the failures of neo-liberal globalisation and capitalism. For a party that had shifted more and more to the centre and then the right since 1992 \u2013 when Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush, then rebranded the party to appeal to Big Business. Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s National Security Advisor, authored a number of pieces in publications like Foreign Affairs outlining how globalisation had cost the American worker and how the administration had to refashion its economic policies to prioritise the working class. In that regard, the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act constituted the most pivotal set of changes in the US economy since Ronald Reagan and Trickle-Down Economics.",
    "But perhaps the problem wasn\u2019t so much the solution as what the solution led to. Yes, the US under Biden enacted these reforms, and yes, on paper at least, they promised to re-haul American manufacturing and the American worker. But as several economists pointed out, Biden\u2019s much lauded industrial policy \u2013 which led progressives and liberals alike to call him the most pro-worker US President since Franklin Roosevelt \u2013 led to a transfer of wealth to the financial sector: consider that US money wages between 2021 and 2024 rose by 18.5% while the S & P 500 rose by almost 65%. These discrepancies made it easier for the Trump campaign to claim that Biden was just as indifferent to workers as the Clintons. That Hillary Clinton ended up advising Harris didn\u2019t help the optics either.",
    "Speaking of the Clintons, it\u2019s fair to say that they share much of the responsibility \u2013 and the blame \u2013 for what the Democratic Party has become. Their policy of triangulation and squaring the circle \u2013 what came to be known as \u201cThird Way Centrism\u201d \u2013 gave the Democrats a sugar high in the late 1990s. For eight years, from 2008 to 2016, they encountered another sugar high under Barack Obama. Yet both Clinton and Obama rode into the scene as radicals and progressives, only to abscond after assuming the presidency.",
    "Obama particularly, as a young black lawmaker, had dined with the likes of the Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi and the great Edward Said. It is true that Benjamin Netanyahu did not see eye to eye with him. But then Obama and the security apparatus did all they could to shed the radicalism of his early years. The Obama years are remembered fondly by the liberals, yet what official narratives overlook are the disastrous foreign policy misadventures which only reinforced popular opposition to the US. There were laudable achievements on the foreign policy front \u2013 the Iran nuclear deal and the normalisation of relations with Cuba, for instance. But these were always doomed to be undone.",
    "Looking back, perhaps the biggest takeaway from this election is that the Democrats did not, or were unable to, galvanise on the momentum they got in 2021. It must be remembered that 2021 spelt out a specific moment in American political history. What Biden did more than anything was to show that the Democrats cared \u2013 about workers, about minorities, and about Muslims. Yet everything changed in the course of a year \u2013 specifically, from October 7, 2023. The Democratic establishment may have felt they could lose the Arab, Palestinian, and Lebanese votes without any major setback.",
    "But such assumptions are linear, somewhat conservative, and they no longer hold in a political environment that had already become severely polarised. While Kamala Harris tried to win Jewish votes while calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, they lost both communities to Trump \u2013 chunks of the Jewish vote, and parts of the Muslim vote. Trump has been criticised for encouraging Islamophobia in his ranks, but he spoke the truth when he asked why Arab Americans would vote for Harris when she was going around campaigning with the neocons of the Bush era, specifically Liz Cheney and her father. Tragically for Harris, her campaigners were more concerned about winning older moderates than younger radicals.",
    "Throughout the election, I understood many things, including the gaffes both Trump and, to a lesser extent, Harris uttered. Yet there was one thing I could never understand, and that was the seeming indifference to 45,000 plus Palestinian lives. The Democrats responded to Palestinian voices by shutting them out from their Convention. They failed to rally around Rashida Tlaib when she was smeared by one false accusation over another. They failed to stand up for international humanitarian law even as they eviscerated Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policies. I will never understand these contradictions. And I am not surprised that they cost the Democrats, and Kamala Harris. One only hopes that as they recoil from defeat, they will course-correct. But perhaps I am being too optimistic.",
