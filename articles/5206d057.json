    "Prof. Nimal Senanayake, the eminent neurophysician, in his major project to educate the public on common health problems, has put out another publication, the nineteenth in the series, in easy to understand Sinhala on a subject that baffles us and sometimes causes concern in our minds. This book titled \u201cSihina\u201d, deals with the mythology, physiology, psychology of dreams and its ramifications. Obviously it would capture the interest of, not only the general public, but also the medical fraternity, particularly, students, psychiatrists, psychologists, sleep specialists and of course the general practitioner who is called upon to manage a wide range of complains.",
    "As usual Nimal is spectacular in the very begining, he creates a vivid picture of Greek mythology that involves the God responsible for the overseeing of dreams, Hypnos, who grants the sleeper\u2019s wishes and also gives messages on important matters. The book makes reference to other philosophies and religions, including Buddhism, which have metaphysical notions about dreams. The importance of the psychology of dreams is highlighted by this historical sojourn.",
    "A very significant section is the description of the work of eminent psychiatrist and philosopher Sigmund Freud who resorted to psychoanalysis of dreams of his patients to arrive at a diagnosis. Freud has said \u201cdreams are the Royal road to the unconscious\u201d and he held that dreams reflected on the unfulfilled sexual desires. Senanayake further makes reference to another psychiatrist and philosopher Carl Jung a student of Freud but who had different views on dreams. Several other scientists who had different ideas are presented in order to show the relevance of dreams.",
    "Now the author turns his attention to an aspect that is very important, abnormalities in sleep. Narcolepsy is due to the disturbence of the sleep-awake cycle that may lead to abnormalities in the nervous system causing a need for excesive sleep. Though the affected person sleeps a lot he lacks sound sleep and may suffer from sleep deprivation. Another symptom these people may have is abnormal dream pattern. Other features are muscle weakness and halucinations. Author carefully supplies a description of each of these features and a scientific explanation for their occurence. This information could be very useful to students as well as practitioners.",
    "The differentiation of dream and hallucination also could be of value to the practitioner and student. Examples of types of halucinations are given. Further the description of supersticious believes and the way they could affect the mind and sleep could be relevant. As usual the author makes the narrative interesting by reference to great writers who have made use of such believes the theme of their suspense filled stories. He has chosen Guy de Maupassant\u2019s famous novel Horla, which shows how an apparently contented but lonely individual feels the presence of a mysterious being in the vicinity when he is about to fall asleep. This is not a dream but a halucination.",
    ".The so called \u2018nightmare\u2019 is explained with clarity that Senanayake characteristically achieves with economy of words. The word mare which now a days referes to a female horse in the medieval times meant a female demon who climbs on top of you and presses on your chest making breathing difficult ! That is the origin of the word \u2018nightmare. The importance of this experience is that it could indicate an underlying ailment such as depression, schizophrenia or post-traumatic stress disorder which may occure after a severe mental shock. Certain drugs and alcohol too could be a cause. Avoiding going early to bed due to the fear of nightmares itself could make the condition worse. The author gives a list of remedial measures in a comprehensive manner.",
    "Talking during sleep is explained and remedies are discussed. A worse condition could be sleep walking, this happens due to an attempt to wake up from deep sleep and end up trapped between sleep and awake states. Walking happens in sleep ! However the eyes are open and vission is clear, sleep walker may even run ! Or even drive a vehicle ! Commit murder ! Author in his characteristic manner tells us about famous poets and novelists who have employed sleep walking to convey strong emotion in their great works. Shakespere\u2019s Macbeth is an excellent example.",
    "Sometimes dreams could be the harbinger of great events of the future, author gives examples, Mark Twain sees in a dream his brothers death, Abraham Lincoln his own funeral. Author makes reference to several dreams and paranormal coincidences related to the Titanic ship disaster. Finally Senanayake discusses the possibilty of creating dreams and video recording them and mentions the progress made regarding this very interesting development.",
    "Prof Nimal senanayake in this thin volume has managed tell us everything we must know about dreams. The book is packed with useful information ranging from history to science of dreams. And dreams of elation and pathos.",
