    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s Medical Association has opposed the lowering of the age of consent from 16 to 14 years.",
    "\u201cIn a country where Healthy Sexual and Relationship Education is not being taught in schools, a child of 14 years who consents for sex is mostly unaware of the potential repercussions of the sexual act \u2013 i.e. early unwanted pregnancy, and exposure to sexually transmitted infections. Hence, the consent given, cannot be taken to imply informed consent,\u201d the SLMA said in a statement after the Minister of Justice called for the age of consent to be lowered.",
    "In Sri Lanka sexual education is woefully inadequate. Attempts to introduce comprehensive sexual education in the school curriculum have often been met with vocal opposition, mainly from the clergy who claim it damages Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018culture\u2019.",
    "\u201cWe, a conglomerate of medical professionals advocating for the rights of children of Sri Lanka, wish to express our gravest concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Penal Code section 363 and 364.",
    "The minimum age of sexual consent is the age at which someone is deemed capable of consenting to sexual activity. The objective of the minimum age of sexual consent is to protect adolescents from sexual abuse and from the consequences of early sexual activity on their rights and development.",
    "In the proposed amendment the age of consent for sex has been reduced to 14 years from the current age of 16 years.",
    "We vehemently object to this proposal for the following compelling reasons:",
    "1. It is our considered opinion, as corroborated by many scientific studies, that a child at 14 years is not cognitively mature to give informed consent for such an act as she does not have sufficient understanding.",
    "In a country where Healthy Sexual and Relationship Education is not being taught in schools, a child of 14 years who consents for sex is mostly unaware of the potential repercussions of the sexual act \u2013 i.e. early unwanted pregnancy, and exposure to sexually transmitted infections. Hence, the consent given, cannot be taken to imply informed consent.",
    "2. A child of 14 years is not developmentally mature both physically and emotionally to mother a baby she may give birth to, following the sexual act.",
    "3. Adolescent mothers and their offspring are high risk groups, both physically and emotionally, due to:",
    "\u2022 Complications of pregnancy leading to high maternal morbidity and mortality.",
    "\u2022 mental health problems due to depression and elevated emotional burden",
    "\u2022 the offspring being at greater risk due to suboptimal nurturing and physical, cognitive, and emotional problems.",
    "4. Early pregnancy and motherhood are well known to lead to school dropouts amongst adolescent girls. Sri Lanka increased the compulsory age of education up to 16 years in 2016. We take this as a very positive step. However, with the new amendment if a child becomes pregnant after consensual sex, what are the prospects of her pursuing her education? We pose the question as to whether a pregnant teenager will be allowed to pursue her education in the socio-cultural scenario and education system of Sri Lanka.",
    "5. For all other matters pertaining to consent in childhood the legal age is 18 years. i.e. consent for medical treatment, consent for medico-legal examination etc. Hence, we are puzzled and extremely disappointed as to why only the age for consent for sex has been reduced to 14 years.",
    "We note that in the proposed amendment the offender\u2019s age is mentioned as under 22 years. No consideration has been paid to the imbalance of power between two such parties concerned which again raises apprehension on the validity of the consent. Due to rapid personality growth the difference of emotional and cognitive maturity between a 14 and 22-year-old is immense. Hence, we believe that this proposed amendment is a retrograde step and that the current proviso should remain.",
    "While appreciating the positive steps taken towards gender neutralization pertaining to rape law we strongly urge, on behalf of children of Sri Lanka to immediately withdraw the proposed amendments to the Section 363 and 364 \u2013 Chapter 19 of the Penal Code."
