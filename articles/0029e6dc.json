  "original_title": "Behind closed doors: Real story of SCO Summit What whispers travelled amongst Xi, Putin, and Modi?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Xi, Putin and Modi\u2019s Strategic Dance Reshapes Asian Power Balance",
    "The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit may have appeared as just another diplomatic gathering on the surface. However, a closer examination reveals a complex web of strategic maneuvering between three of Asia\u2019s most influential leaders: China\u2019s Xi Jinping, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, and India\u2019s Narendra Modi.",
    "While official photographs showed polite handshakes and carefully worded joint statements, the real drama unfolded away from the cameras. In private meetings and informal discussions, these leaders were quietly reshaping the balance of power in Asia and beyond.",
    "Even before the first delegate arrived, each leader had already begun positioning their country for maximum advantage. The groundwork for what would transpire during the summit had been carefully laid months in advance.",
    "China, as the region\u2019s economic powerhouse, came with a clear agenda. President Xi Jinping aimed to strengthen his vision of a multipolar world \u2013 one where Western influence, particularly from the United States, would be significantly reduced. His strategy focused on promoting the SCO as a serious alternative to Western-dominated organizations like NATO.",
    "Russia\u2019s President Putin arrived with different but complementary objectives. Facing ongoing Western sanctions due to the Ukraine conflict, he desperately needed to demonstrate that Russia remained a relevant global power. Putin\u2019s primary goals were securing continued economic partnerships and gaining at least quiet support for Russia\u2019s military actions in Ukraine.",
    "Prime Minister Modi of India faced perhaps the most complex challenge. India has been trying to balance its traditional policy of non-alignment with its growing partnerships with Western nations, including its membership in the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan, and Australia. Modi needed to protect India\u2019s economic interests while avoiding commitments that might anger important allies on either side.",
    "While the public agenda covered predictable topics like fighting terrorism and improving regional trade, the most important discussions happened during bilateral meetings away from media attention.",
    "The much-discussed \u201cno-limits\u201d partnership between China and Russia was put to the test. Putin likely pressured Xi for greater economic support, including help in avoiding Western sanctions and continued access to essential goods and technology. In return, Xi may have sought greater Chinese influence in Central Asia, a region Russia has traditionally controlled.",
    "The ongoing war in Ukraine dominated their discussions. While Xi has avoided directly criticizing Russia\u2019s actions, he has continued purchasing discounted Russian energy, providing Putin with a crucial economic lifeline. This relationship gives China significant leverage over Russia\u2019s economy and foreign policy decisions.",
    "The long-standing border dispute between China and India in the Himalayas, while not officially on the agenda, undoubtedly influenced their conversations. Xi likely emphasized the benefits of stable relations between the two Asian giants, subtly encouraging India to reduce its cooperation with the United States.",
    "Trade imbalances and India\u2019s concerns about China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative were central topics. India has been suspicious of this massive infrastructure program, viewing it as a tool for Chinese influence. The question remains whether Xi offered any concessions on border issues in exchange for greater Indian participation in Chinese economic initiatives.",
    "India\u2019s continued purchase of Russian oil and weapons has caused tension with Western nations. Putin would have thanked Modi for India\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d of Russia\u2019s position while seeking assurances of continued trade and defense cooperation.",
    "Modi, while appreciating access to cheaper Russian energy, likely expressed India\u2019s concerns about global instability caused by the Ukraine conflict. The Indian leader may have even offered India\u2019s services as a potential mediator, while ensuring India\u2019s energy security needs continue to be met.",
    "The return of Donald Trump to the US presidency has added a new dimension to these Asian power dynamics. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach, with its emphasis on tariffs and unilateral action, has inadvertently pushed these three nations closer together.",
    "Trump\u2019s use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool has become a unifying factor for China, Russia, and India. While each country faces different economic impacts, they share a common political message: the United States has become an unreliable partner.",
    "China has responded with strategic patience, retaliating with its own tariffs while accelerating efforts to reduce dependence on foreign markets. President Xi is boosting domestic consumption and technological innovation while strengthening ties with Southeast Asian and European partners.",
    "For Russia, US tariffs have minimal direct economic impact since trade between the two countries is already limited. However, Trump\u2019s trade wars provide Putin with political advantages, creating divisions between the US and its allies. This allows Putin to position himself as an alternative to an unpredictable Washington.",
    "India faces the most direct challenge, with 50% US tariffs on many of its exports, imposed largely in retaliation for continued Russian oil purchases. Modi has responded by implementing domestic economic reforms while emphasizing India\u2019s \u201cmulti-alignment\u201d strategy \u2013 refusing to choose sides in global conflicts.",
    "The trio\u2019s responses to major international conflicts reveal their growing coordination:",
    "On Ukraine, Trump\u2019s desire for an immediate ceasefire is seen in Moscow as tacit support for Russian territorial gains. This has emboldened Putin to continue his war of attrition, confident he can outlast Western support for Ukraine.",
    "Regarding the Gaza conflict, Trump\u2019s strong support for Israel has been criticized internationally. This provides China and Russia with opportunities to present themselves as more balanced international actors, particularly in the Global South where both nations seek greater influence.",
    "The combined effect of these developments is creating a subtle but significant shift in global power dynamics. Trump\u2019s policies are not just challenging the existing international order; they are actively pushing countries like India toward closer cooperation with China and Russia.",
    "This does not mean a formal anti-Western alliance is forming immediately. Deep tensions remain between these nations, particularly the ongoing border disputes between China and India. However, it does signal the emergence of a more multipolar world where these three powers find common ground in resisting US dominance.",
    "For smaller nations like Sri Lanka, these shifting alliances create both opportunities and challenges. The emergence of alternative power centers provides more options for economic partnerships and development assistance. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, Russian energy partnerships, and Indian Ocean cooperation initiatives offer different paths for regional development.",
    "However, this new multipolar world also requires careful navigation. Small nations must avoid being forced to choose sides in an increasingly complex global environment. The key will be maintaining productive relationships with all major powers while protecting national interests and sovereignty.",
    "The real story of the recent SCO summit lies not in the official declarations but in the quiet understandings reached between three of the world\u2019s most powerful leaders. Their strategic calculations are reshaping Asian geopolitics and creating new alternatives to Western-dominated international structures.",
    "As these relationships continue to evolve, the world will be watching to see whether this growing cooperation leads to a more stable multipolar order or creates new sources of global tension. For now, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Narendra Modi appear to have found common cause in their response to an increasingly unpredictable United States under Donald Trump\u2019s leadership.",
    "The implications of their quiet agreements and shared strategic vision will likely influence international relations for years to come, marking a potential turning point in the post-Cold War global order.",
    "This analysis is based on careful observation of diplomatic patterns and public statements by the leaders involved. The author acknowledges that many details of private diplomatic conversations remain confidential.",
