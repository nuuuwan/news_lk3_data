### World beyond island borders

*2024-11-04 23:49:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/World-beyond-island-borders/4-768834) · `en`

Sri Lanka is an island. Such a geographical feature comes with good and bad. Physical isolation or not having a boundary shared with a neighbouring country gave us peace of mind on border conflicts. However, it did not prevent us from getting invaded by the nations with naval powers. Further, it allowed us to create unique cultural habits blended with the natural environment. We have our own Lepidoptera, birds, and flora and fauna. Free flow of people across the borders would have challenged our ethnic identities. In such a connected country, the competition among migrants for limited resources would have been high, causing tensions among people to win their fair share.

### President Anura - Nimal Lansa

*2024-11-04 23:39:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197905) · `ta`

Former MP Nimal Lansa accuses President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of deception, claiming he's not fulfilling campaign promises. He criticizes the current government's handling of corruption scandals and implementation of IMF programs.

🟩

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is deceiving people. Former parliamentarian Nimal Lansa said he was one of the speaking of the election platforms and a man who was sitting in the presidential seat.

He further stated at a public meeting held on Monday (4) in Katana area.

We are working to build a strong opposition party. It is unconventional that the winner has visited the Katana area for the failed party, not to Anuragumara Dissanayake.. Those who win the election should not think that they will win the next election. Success in the parliamentary election cannot be expected without fulfilling the promises made to the people.

The curse of seventy -five years, the people believed that the ministers had stolen, defrauded and corrupted.. But currently that hope has been lost. President Anura knows that the promises made on the election platform cannot be fulfilled.

### No change has been made by the government. False promises, people should not be fooled by false disguises

*2024-11-04 23:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197904) · `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



David Navaratnaraj warns against false promises. No real changes by government. Ranil Wickremesinghe supported, economy improved under him. Current campaign borrowing heavily. Police capable of handling crimes, no need for president intervention.

🟩

No change has been made by the government. David Navaratnaraj, who is contesting as the primary candidate in the UNP's elephant symbol in the Jaffna electoral district, said that the people should not be fooled by false promises and false disguises.

Yall. He said this during a media briefing held at the Media Center on Monday (4).

If he became president in 2005, he voted for Ranil Wickremesinghe and would not have been destroyed. Many people think he is furious. We do not think that politics is an error. It was because of the furious character that the country was restored from the economic downturn.

Today, many who have stood with Ranil Wickremesinghe have split for their own selfishness.Even the JVP continues to carry out the programs launched by Ranil Wickremesinghe. They were unable to carry out new jobs.

Egg prices, rice prices and coconut prices are high today. Ranil Wickremesinghe has now begun to rise again. The regime will go and topple within six months.

### President’s vision of transportation: A change agent or mere rhetoric?

The National People’s Power (NPP) party’s vision for transportation is “to create an efficient, sustainable, and accessible transportation system that enhances mobility for all citizens while promoting economic growth and environmental conservation”.

### Combination of experienced and new MPs should be in parliament – S.M. Marikkar

Says the SJB should have a strategy to get the support of those who voted for NPP due to anger with certain politicians and corrupt deals

Confirms there is no decision to change the SJB’s leadership

Claims Anura Kumara Government will also face similar repercussions like Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government if they have a parliament with immature politicians

Reveals poverty, education, housing and floods still need more attention to develop Colombo

I do not believe that there should always be experienced politicians in the parliament. There are two sides of the experienced politicians as some of them are capable of genuinely serving to fulfil people’s aspirations but others are capable of stealing public money. I think there should be a combination where experienced and budding politicians represent people at the parliament. Remember, we can’t rule a country with inexperienced parliamentarians

### “Cocoon” around heads of state: Is there one around President Anura Dissanayake already?

*2024-11-04 22:33:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Cocoon-around-heads-of-state-Is-there-one-around-President-Anura-Dissanayake-already/14-768828) · `en`

It is necessary to break this cocoon by appointing a council of economic advisers. The council must listen to the alternative perspectives specially based on research, empirical analysis and data. Then council members are required to submit an individual report in writing to the President based on which the President would have an enlightened discourse on the subject. The same principle of Continuous Improvement Process can be applied here by stopping the prevention of the flow of information to the top

The “cocoon” around heads of state refers to the insulating layer of advisors, staff, and bureaucrats who control access to the leader, sometimes filtering or distorting the flow of information. This phenomenon can prevent heads of state from receiving accurate, unfiltered information and limit their exposure to diverse perspectives. This is especially true when it comes to economic governance, the most crucial part of governance.

### The NPP: A Month in Power

*2024-11-04 15:41:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-npp-a-month-in-power/) · `en`

It has been a month since Anura Kumara Dissanayake assumed the presidency, a month since the NPP claimed its place in history as the first party from outside of the political establishment to win a presidential election in Sri Lanka. Two weeks from now, the NPP will face another election, this time parliamentary. Depending on the results it gets, we will know whether the people approve of the NPP’s actions over the last four weeks and if they want it to continue. The NPP’s call for a powerful government is, in itself, not alarming: no government can survive without a majority in parliament. Yet it will need to convince Sri Lankans that it is the party they need – the party not of power, but of change.

### WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?

We are convinced (or conditioned to believe,) that we are an under-developed country and are destined to ever remain so. Should it really be such? Importantly, what should we do to erase this patronizing and degrading label? This mental complex has led us to be a cynical, despondent people. The past seven decades of Independence have driven us into the depths of despair. The worst part of this is that we have so driven our thoughts, to make this fear to become our reality.

We have failed to utilize our potential – be it in climate, human resources or other “development criteria”. This clearly needs to change. Perhaps, we are not the cat’s whiskers, nor certainly are we everybody’s chronic “dog’s body”.

Motion of No Confidence in Government (Hansard of 1st September 1, 1953)

(Speech made by Dr. NM Perera published in his birth centenary memorial volume)

Dr. Perera:Before I deal with the subject, I want to say a word about the Hon. Prime Minister and his references to my good friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Bandaranaike). My friend the Prime Minister is not here. I hope that he has not had a recurrence of his affliction. Today while he was on the first part of his speech, he reminded me of the father; it was the same technique, the same type of personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I remember the last motion of No Confidence that we debated. I think it was moved just before the dissolution of Parliament, and it was one of the last debates which was attended by my good friend, the late Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake. He spoke in that debate and it was a tirade against my good friend the Leader of the Opposition.

The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 1987 was signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and myself as President on July 29, 1987. It was a Peace Treaty and brought Peace, till one group of the LTTE broke it in October 1987. India then had to oppose them till March 1990, when the Sri Lanka Government took over and this led to a bloody war with the LTTE which still continues (when this was written).

### Ukraine soldiers waiting for US election results

*2024-11-04 15:08:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197866) · `ta`

Ukrainian soldiers anxiously await US election results, hoping Kamala Harris will continue military aid. Donald Trump's presidency may limit support, potentially impacting Ukraine's war efforts against Russia.

🟩

Ukraine's International, who is cleaning the broken mirror of the outlet, knows that the future of his country is in the hands of American voters who are 5000 miles away.

We hope that a woman named Kamalahariis will win and help us.

This is the usual event in Jaboria.

"We are worried about the election results," he says. "We want to defeat the enemy."

The victory for Ukraine, which has the smallest opportunity to win the war, depends on the US support.

In this area, the Ukraine responded in 2023, hoping to remove the Russian occupants.

However, the situation of Ukraine has now become impossible to focus on focusing.

Bombs and missiles are attacking Ukraine cities.

Democratic candidate Kamala Haris has said that if he wins the election, military aid to Ukraine will continue, while his powers may be limited by the US Congress in the hands of the Republican Party.

If Donald Trump is again president, it is difficult for Ukraine to continue the current $ 50 billion military assistance.

### Who Can Better Walk the Talk? A Fourfold Strategy To Navigate Sri Lanka’s Political Landscape

“It is perfectly natural that in a revolution which affects, and is bound to affect, the deepest foundations of life and broadest mass of the population, not a single party, not a single government, no matter how close it may be to the people, can possibly embrace all aspects of life at once.” ~ V.I. Lenin

Immediately after its victory in the Presidential Election, the National Power of the People (NPP), led by the Marxist-Leninist JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), introduced what it calls the “tiniest cabinet ever,” consisting of just three ministers, including President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya. This minimalist governance model has drawn mixed reactions, coinciding with an immediate call for general elections to fill a full 225-member parliament. Many see this move as an attempt to solidify power before public support potentially wanes.

Democracy under threat, as Trump sows doubt on election integrity

President Ronald Reagan, “The Great Communicator” was famous for conceptualizing the American Dream, in a loose paraphrasing of the words enshrined in the Statue of Liberty.

Concluding his farewell speech in 1988, Reagan said, “I’ve spoken of the Shining City all my political life….But in my mind, it was a tall, proud city built on rocks, stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and heart to get here. That’s how I saw it, and see it still.

‘The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so free, that your very existence is an act of rebellion.’– Albert Camus

It is with great honor and profound admiration that I write this foreword for Interventions, the most recent publication of my mentor and friend, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka. As is often the case with Dr. Jayatilleka’s literacy works (one would even say ‘always’ the case), this anthology compels the reader to engage in an intellectual gymnastic that pushes the boundaries of conventional thinking -an exercise that he, himself, has excelled in since a very young age.

Despite this, several parties have voiced concerns, arguing that the proposed reduction does not sufficiently reflect CEB’s recent profitability. They contend that given the board’s financial performance over the past months, a more substantial tariff cut is warranted to provide meaningful relief to consumers.
