    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has invited the UK\u2019s former Paymaster General Francis Maude, who oversaw the creation of the Government Digital Service in 2011, to visit the country and share his insights on digitalisation with a view to boosting state revenue.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe told officials at a committee meeting on Wednesday July 12 that Sri Lanka\u2019s new revenue generation strategies draw inspiration from the UK, whose own methods have been \u201cgreatly refined and improved over time\u201d.",
    "\u201cThus, we must examine the latest systems and develop the necessary infrastructure accordingly. Proposed amendments to the Audit Act have been put forward to support this objective,\u201d a statement from the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) quoting Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cWe have extended an invitation to Mr. Francis Maude, who served under Prime Minister David Cameron and has substantial expertise in this area, to visit Sri Lanka and share his insights on sectoral reform,\u201d he said.",
    "President Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka must explore new avenues for increasing income tax revenues, as outlined in a report presented to him by a committee appointed to recommend revenue-generating strategies. The committee is chaired by State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.",
    "\u201cThis aspect has received significant attention within our parliament. It can be argued that the lack of parliamentary discussions in the past two or three years, along with a lack of interest in certain cases, has been a primary cause of the economic crisis. To address this, several inquiry committees on income tax and the fiscal situation have been established. It is within these activities that we should seek out these new approaches,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Speaking at the meeting, the president has highlighted the importance of financial discipline in nation-building and has also announced plans to promptly introduce formal measures to control public expenditure and generate new government revenue.",
    "The PMD statement said Wickremesinghe had stressed on the need to maximise the value of every rupee spent by the government, as currently, public expenditure \u201coften fails to achieve this objective\u201d.",
    "He expressed concern over not only the neglect of public revenue but also the unrestricted spending of public funds on non-beneficial activities, which has contributed to the economic crisis in the country, the statement said.",
    "According to the PMD, the committee\u2019s report encompasses recommendations aimed at establishing a structured framework to attain the revenue goals of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department. It also suggests the implementation of novel approaches to augment government revenue and the creation of a digital economic infrastructure to support these endeavours.",
    "The president has directed the State Minister Siyambalapitiya to engage in further discussions regarding these proposals and present them to the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Means and also called for an extensive media campaign to educate the public.",
    "Chair of the parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans Mahindananda Aluthgamage said at a meeting on July 06 that only 31,000 Sri Lankans out of some 500,000 persons with registered income tax files pay personal income tax while 328 registered limited companies out of 105,000 contribute to 82 percent of tax revenue.",
    "Aluthgamage said that regular discussions will be held with Sri Lanka Customs, the Excise Department and the IRD on providing facilities including a digital data system linking the three entities in a bid to increase state revenue.",
    "Only 31,000 out of 500,000 Sri Lankans pay income tax: parliament committeeSee more",
    "President Wickremesinghe said at Wednesday\u2019s meeting had called Sri Lanka\u2019s tax collection efforts \u201cimproper\u201d.",
    "\u201cIn the current economic crisis, a major concern is the improper collection of tax revenue. Some individuals and entities who are obligated to pay income tax fail to do so, leading to a significant shortfall. Additionally, there have been reports of the government experiencing delays in receiving complete tax revenue from customs, as well as similar accusations regarding excise duty,\u201d he was quoted as saying in the PMD statement.",
    "\u201cFurthermore, digitisation plays a crucial role in these endeavours. Those who oppose this transformation should consider stepping aside, as I intend to enforce digitisation within a designated timeframe. Any shortcomings that arise should be addressed promptly,\u201d he said.",
    "The president said that, when the British colonised Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then called, they had prioritised revenue collection and appointed revenue officers for this purpose. Under a unified administration, revenue officers and local officials, known as Mudaliyar (or Mudali), paid special attention to revenue collection. As a result, income did not decline, and it even increased with the development of tea, coconut, and rubber industries, said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cHowever, since the 1970s, revenue generation has been neglected, and it has been removed from the administrative agenda of the country. Not only has revenue been overlooked, but state funds have been spent without restraint,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka has been compelled to increase its tax revenue in the wake of the 2022 currency crisis, the worst in decades, and the subsequent agreement with the IMF over a 2.9 billion dollar extended fund facility. However, resistance to a hike in progressive personal income tax has been high, with many high-income earning professionals in the state sector holding a number of protests against the increase.",
    "Value added taxes were also raised to 15 percent from 8 percent last year. Another 2.5 percent cascading tax was imposed on top of VAT, the effect of which was estimated to be around 4.5 or more through the cascading effect.",
    "The IMF had reportedly asked the cash strapped Sri Lankan government to impose taxes on all who receive monthly income of above 41,667 rupees as a prior condition for the bailout, but",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration had instead imposed a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax on everyone who earns over 100,000 rupees a month.",
    "The IMF has defended the tax hike, arguing that creditors and investors will not support Sri Lanka because tax to GDP had fallen steeply. Taxes, including value added taxes were slashed in 2019 December to target a \u2018persistent output gap\u2019, after serial currency crises from flexible inflation targeting reduced growth.",
    "According to Commissioner General of Inland Revenue D R S Hapuarachchi, Sri Lanka has collected 11.93 billion rupees in advance personal income tax in March 2023, up from 3.1 billion rupees in January.",
    "In the first quarter 24,577 billion rupees were collected from APIT. A comparison with last year was not given.",
    "In January 3,106 million rupees was collected, in February 10,540 million rupees and 11,931 in March. (Colombo/Jul14/2023)"
