    "Former Minister of State for Finance Shehan Semasinghe has announced that he will not be contesting in the upcoming parliamentary elections.",
    "Issuing a statement, Semasinghe reflected on the country\u2019s economic challenges over the past year and his dedication to rebuilding the economy alongside former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, following the economic collapse.",
    "Semasinghe expressed his belief that once the country and its economy stabilize, the public would begin to appreciate the efforts and sacrifices made during the recovery process. He stated that the benefits of these efforts would ultimately reach the people, allowing them to better understand the trajectory of the country\u2019s economic recovery.",
    "However, the former state minister acknowledged his disappointment in the public\u2019s apparent lack of recognition of these efforts, which he believes was reflected in the outcome of 2024 presidential election. He noted that the people\u2019s rejection of the previous government\u2019s principled approach, which was built through considerable effort, played a pivotal role in his decision to withdraw from the upcoming election.",
    "Semasinghe was elected to the Parliament from the Anuradhapura District representing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in the 2020 General Election, where he garnered 119,878 votes, ranking fourth in the district."
