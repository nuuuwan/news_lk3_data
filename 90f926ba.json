  "original_body_lines": [
    "The focus of this two part article is former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) deputy military chief Kandiah Balasegaran alias \u201cBrigadier \u201cBalraj regarded as the finest commander the tigers ever had. Balraj was a much admired military tactician  reputed for leading from the front.He died of a heart attack fifteen years ago on 20 May 2008. The first part of this article published last week provided an outline of Balraj\u2019s early life and the course of events that led to his joining the LTTE. In this second part, the spotlight will be on the track record of the tiger military commander.",
    "After  receiving military training  in Tamil Nadu as part of the  ninth batch of tigers,  Balasegaran known by his nom de guerre Balraj returned home  to the Wanni in 1986. Having been inducted into the LTTE by the then Wanni commander Mahendrarajah alias Mahathaya, Balraj    was  first absorbed into Mahathaya\u2019s bodyguard unit. Gradually he  was utilised for regular combat also.",
    "Balraj made his mark first in  mid \u2013 1986 when he played an active role in taking over the Karadipokku junction in Kiinochchi in what was an abortive bid by Mahathaya to encircle the Kilinochhi military camp.",
    "Mahathaya was made deputy \u2013 leader of the LTTE in 1987 and moved to  Jaffna. However  he continued to be in overall charge of the Wanni. Jeyam, Suseelan and Paseelan were appointed as military commanders for the districts of Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu respectively.",
    "Balraj became Paseelan\u2019s deputy and functioned in the Mullaitheevu district. In a well-planned  ambushat Munthirikaikkulam, the tigers led by Passelan and Balraj killed 14 soldiers. Balraj  was stationed at the Manal Aaru \u2013 Weli \u2013 Oya region since he knew the terrain well.",
    "The Indo-Lanka accord of July 1987 brought about a temporary lull  Indian troops known as the Indian Peace Keeping Force(IPKF) were deployed in the North and East. The fragile peace  was shattered in October when fighting  erupted between the IPKF and the LTTE.",
    "The Indian Army launched \u201cOperation Pawan\u201d against the LTTE in Jaffna. Tiger cadres led by Paseelan with Balraj as his deputy  were hastily deployed in Jaffna to combat the IPKF. It was then that Balraj -armed with an RPG launcher-  demonstrated great courage by facing an advancing Battle tank in Koapay and inflicting damage.",
    "The war with the Indian army began  escalating. LTTE supremo Prabakharan, Mahathaya and other senior tiger leaders relocated to the Wanni. Prabakharan himself began camping out in the dense  Nithihaikkulam jungles of Mullaitheevu district.Lt. Col Navam was in overall charge of Prabakharan\u2019s security in particular and Mullaitheevu defences in general. Balraj functioned as Navam\u2019s deputy.",
    "It was then that Balraj began interacting closely with his leader Prabakharan. The LTTE numero uno who at one time was reluctant to induct Balraj into tiger folds due to his PLOTE past was now greatly impressed by his unassuming simplicity and quiet efficiency.",
    "When the IPKF launched \u201cOperation Checkmate\u201d in 1988  to capture Prabhakaran, Balraj played a key role in thwarting the mission by  taking on the Indian troops frontally. Several Gurkha soldiers were reportedly killed in the skirmish. It is said that Balraj was injured on three separate occasions in  combat against the IPKF.",
    "After the withdrawal of the Indian army the tiger leader moved back to Jaffna with his retinue. There had also been a policy change of sorts where the LTTE was now as far as possible encouraging cadre from a particular locality to take up leadership positions  in those areas.",
    "In keeping with this policy Balraj  the son of Wanni soil was made military commander for the Wanni in 1990. This was the opportunity Balraj had been waiting for to demonstrate his military acumen.",
    "The A \u2013 9 highway or Jaffna \u2013 Kandy road was then under the \u201cnominal\u201d control of the army from Vavuniya to Elephant Pass. The army had military camps in strategic points.",
    "The LTTE led by Balraj launched two attacks on the Kokavil and Mankulam camps and overran them. Later another attack was conducted against the Kilinochchi camp. Though it was not overrun the soldiers later evacuated and strengthened the Paranthan camp.",
    "These victories raised the LTTE\u2019s  stock. Balraj abecame known as a reputed military commander who  inspired and galvanized  tiger cadre by courageously leading them up front into the thick of battle.",
    "Another operation where Balraj proved his military prowess was the Elephant pass operation of 1991.This operation codenamed \u201cTharai \u2013 Kadal \u2013 Aahayam \u201d (Land \u2013 sea \u2013 Air )was  led by Mahathaya to lay siege to the Elephant pass base and overrun it.",
    "Balraj and his fighters  including Theepan  were tasked with the goal of penetrating the complex from the Kurinchatheevu sector.Balraj and his men delivered results by infiltrating through the lagoon and overrunning the military installation set up in the former guest house premises and retaining it till the operation was called off.. They destroyed it when withdrawing.The failure of other LTTE cadre to achieve their objectives led to overall failure of the operation. 673 LTTE cadre were killed.It was however a personal triumph for Balraj.",
    "The LTTE in 1991 formed its first infantry brigade It was named after Charles Anthony , Prabakharan\u2019s trusted deputy and close companion who died in Meesalai on July 15th 1983.Balraj was Prabakharan\u2019s choice to be the first special commander of Charles Anthony brigade. He served so until 1993.",
    "Apart from leading military assaults and offensives Balraj also excelled in strategic defence. He was mainly responsile for defeating, preventing, restricting or nullifying several military offensives by the armed forces.",
    "Some of these were \u201coperation Wanniwickrema\u201d in Vavuniya, \u201cOperation \u201dlightning\u201d in Manal aaru/Weli Oya, operation \u201cleap forward\u201d in Jaffna, , operation\u201d Yarl Devi \u201d in Kilaly /puloppalai and operation \u201cAgni Kheela\u201d in Elephant pass.",
    "Balraj and his deputy Theepan had to counter \u201cOperation Yarl Devi\u201dLaunched by the Army in the South of Jaffna peninsula in 1993. Balraj  was  seriously injured  in the fighting at Puloppalai. He sustained serious injuries on a leg when he was firing an RPG at a T \u2013 55 tank.",
    "The injury caused him to limp slightly when walking. Also the leg started paining when he walked for a long distance.",
    "Adele Balasingham, wife of the LTTE\u2019s ideologue  , Anton Balasingham, refers to  Balraj\u2019s injuries in her book, \u2018Will to Freedom\u2019,. Here is the excerpt \u2013 .",
    "\u201cA measure of Balraj\u2019s courage revealed itself to us when shrapnel smashed his right leg in the Yarl Devi battle of 1993. A decision not to amputate the limb was made and Balraj suffered excruciating pain of limb repair. Compounding his healing problems was unstable diabetes. After many months in bed and a great deal of pain, Balraj eventually walked again on his leg, but the injury left him with a permanent limp and a recurrent wound infection.\u201d",
    "\u201cNevertheless, he viewed his injury a insignificant compared with the suffering and sacrifices of his cadres and continued to function as a field commander in the warzone.\u201d",
    "The advent of Chandrika Kumaratunga as President in 1994 resulted in a ceasefire and peace talks. The truce broke in 1995 April and war broke out. Initially the Army launched operation \u201cleap Forward\u201d in the peninsula  and advanced in the Valigaamam region. The LTTE launched a counter offensive codenamed \u201ctiger leap\u201d. The army withdrew. Balraj played a pivotal role in this. However the Army soon launched \u201cOperation Riviresa\u201d resulting in the LTTE being compelled to withdraw from the Peninsula into the Wanni in 1996.",
    "It was in 1996 that Prabakharan gave Balraj his greatest military honour. He appointed Balraj as deputy \u2013 military commander. Prabakharan was the military commander of the LTTE. Thus Balraj became number two in the military hierarchy.But Balraj had to pay a \u201d price \u201d for the honour prior to receiving it.",
    "Balraj\u2019s one \u2013 time patron and benefactor Mahathaya had fallen out with Prabakharan . Prabakharan  then wanted to detain and interrogate his deputy \u2013 leader.Prabakharan sent three LTTE leaders to \u201carrest\u201d Mahathaya. They were Sornam, Soosai and Balraj. This was perhaps Prabakharan\u2019s perverse ruse to test Balraj\u2019s loyalty. Balraj had to act against Mahathaya to prove his loyalty to Prabakharan.",
    "This Balraj did. He went along with the others to apprehend the man who had given him his break and taken him under his wing.But then could he have refused to obey Prabakharan?",
    "Hundreds of LTTE cadre surrounded Mahathaya\u2019s place. Initially a young boy was sent to the house. He knocked on the door and rudely asked Mahathaya to accompany him. The LTTE deputy \u2013 leader gave a resounding slap and chased him away.",
    "Then Balraj himself went to Mahathaya\u2019s door. The deputy \u2013 leader was taken aback to find his former protegee entrusted with the task of arresting him. The fight went out of him.",
    "When Balraj said \u201cEngalode Vaango Annai\u201d (Come along with us elder brother) Mahathaya promptly agreed. He instructed his 40 odd bodyguards not to resist and asked Balraj to ensure that nothing happened to them. He then went meekly with Balraj. Ultimately Mahathaya was executed for alleged treason after a Kangaroo court found him guilty.",
    "The Mahathaya arrest was the \u201cAgneepariksha\u201d that Balraj had to endure to prove his loyalty to Prabakharan. This betrayal of Mahathaya was Balraj\u2019s stepping stone to greater success and recognition.",
    "The LTTE\u2019s new deputy \u2013 military commander began demonstrating his mettle in battle.",
    "On July 18th 1996 the LTTE overran the Mullaitheevu camp killing more than a 1000 soldiers. Balraj co-ordinated the operation codenamed \u201cOyatha Alaigal \u2013 1.\u201d",
    "A major  offensive Balraj failed to obstruct  was the first phase of \u201coperation Jayasikurui\u201din 1997 where the armed forces took Omanthai and Nedunkerny. Balraj was in overall charge of LTTE defences during Jayasikurui till the fall of Puliyankulam. Thereafter erstwhile eastern LTTE regional commander \u201cCol\u201d Karuna took over defence arrangements in tandem with \u201cCol\u201dTheepan.",
    "In February 1998 the LTTE attacked Kilinochchi in Oyatha Alaigal 2  The soldiers withdrew after incurring heavy losses. Balraj was in overall charge and  reportedly adopted psychological warfare as a military tactic. The timing of the attack coincided with Sri Lanka\u2019s 50th anniversary of Independence.",
    "Then came \u201cOyatha \u2013 Alaigal \u2013 3 in 1999 November when the LTTE in a series of co-ordinated offensives overran military camps in Oddusuddan. Karippattaimurippu, Mankulam, Kanagarayankulam, Puliyankulam etc.",
    "Most military gains of \u201cJayasikurui\u201d  accumulated over a period of 18 months were reversed in nine days.",
    "\u201cOyatha Alaigal\u201d or unceasing waves was an on going operation with more battles to follow in the Jaffna peninsula. The greatest of these was the lengthy series of operations to take the strategic military base in the Elephant pass isthmus.",
    "The key element in the LTTE\u2019s \u201cencircle and enfeeble\u201dstrategy was the interdiction of supplies along the A \u2013 9 highway between Eluthumattuvaal and Iyakkachchi / Elephant pass. The besieged Elephant pass garrison had to be \u201ccut off\u201d and isolated through a \u201ccut out\u201d.",
    "In a bid to prevent such an eventuality the armed forces had fortified a rectangular area extending from Thaalaiyaddy \u2013 Maruthankerny along the Vadamaratchy east coast of the peninsula up ro the Puthukkaadu juction on the Jaffna \u2013 Kandy road.",
    "This area known as the \u201cVathiraayan box\u201dincluded Vathirayan , Pullaa veli, Soranpatru and Maasaar. Thus Elephant pass was assured of continuous supply from Eluthumadduvaal in the hinterland as well as Thaalaiyaddi in the littoral.",
    "How the LTTE breached these impregnable defences amounted to a modern military miracle. It was Balraj\u2019s crowning achievement.",
    "In an ambhibean operation on March 26th 2000 , the sea tigers led by  \u201cCol\u201d Soosai succeeded in transporting 1200 cadre from the mainland coast to the peninsular coast.",
    "These cadre led by Balraj landed at Kudaarappu \u2013 Maamunai and then moved clandestinely into the interior by walking through the inland lagoon and marshy lands known as \u201ckandal\u201d.",
    "Army posts in Soranpatru and Maasaar were overrun and the tigers reached the A \u2013 9 road near Puthukkaadu junction.",
    "Thereafter the tigers led by Balraj moved up and set up positions at a place called Ithaavil near Pallai thus blocking military supplies to Iyakkachchi \u2013 Elephant pass.The next few weeks saw an intense battle where Balraj and his band of intrepid fighters held on to Ithaavil against formidable odds. There were many twists and turns but Balraj fought on stubbornly beating back attempt after attempt to dislodge him.",
    "After 24 days of fighting the army gave in. Elephant pass was abandoned on April 19th. The LTTE hoisted its flag ceremoniously on April 22nd.Balraj\u2019s incredible military feat was analysed and dissected in military manuals.",
    "The LTTE under Balraj had demonstrated that it could engage in offensive and defensive positional warfare in deep enemy territory and triumph against superior armed forces without air support.It was hailed as a paradigm shift in the conduct of \u201climited wars\u201d.",
    "On a personal note I was very eager to see Ithaavil when I visited the land of my birth in 2013  after 25  years of absence. We got down from our van at Itaavil on the A-9 highway. We could not leave the road and venture into the interior because the surrounding areas were inaccessible due to mines. The area was being de-mined then.",
    "A year after  the fall of Elephant pass came Balraj\u2019s finest accomplishment in defensive warfare. This  was the military resistance to \u201cOperation  Agnikheela\u201dlaunched by the Army  on April 24th 2001. The armed forces had moved out from the Kilaly \u2013 Eluthumattuvaal \u2013 Nagar Kovul FDL\u2019s in a bid to re- take Elephant pass.The LTTE inflicted heavy losses on the army.",
    "With the Elephant Pass  victory and the magnificient resistance displayed during \u201cOperation Agnkheela \u201d in retaining Elephant pass the LTTE deputy \u2013 military chief\u2019s reputation was further enhanced. Balraj became a larger than life legend.",
    "In  September 2001 when \u201cCol\u201d Shankar was killed in a landmine attack by the army\u2019s deep penetration unit (LRRP) a virtual state of emergency was declared by Prabakharan.",
    "Balraj was directed to coordinate a defence strategy to counter the DPU and prevent further attacks. Balraj was engaged in this when the ceasefire was promulgated on Feb 23rd 2002 .",
    "Balraj\u2019s health began deterioraing. He  had always been affected by  a \u201cheart condition\u201d and this began to worsen. In addition there were  diabetes and kidney complications.When the  ceasefire was in progress Balraj went to Singapore  in 2003 with two bodyguards for advanced medical treatment. He obtained heart surgery there. It was on his return that some military officers met him  at the Katunayake Airport. Details of this unusual friendly encounter were narrated in the first part of this article last week.",
    "Sadly for Balraj, trouble began brewing  on the domestic front too.In keeping with the LTTE policy of arranging marriages within the movement Balraj too had married a LTTE  woman fighter   Varathaa.She was a close relative of LTTE supremo  Prabhakaran who had personally arranged the marriage. Varathaa like Balraj had injured her leg in a battle. The couple had no children.",
    "Married life however was not a state of bliss. There was temperamental incompatibility and the couple had serious differences. At one stage the wife started \u201ccomplaining\u201d against Balraj in public places.This led to arguments and squabbles.",
    "Varathaa went to the LTTE police station and registered a complaint that Balraj had assaulted her.She also complained to the LTTE leader who was her kinsman.Prabakharan then intervened and admonished Balraj. He also separated the couple. This increased Balraj\u2019s misery.",
    "In a tragic twist Balraj\u2019s separated wife was stung by a russel\u2019s viper and died.Though separated , Varadhaa\u2019s death through snakebite caused inconsolable sorrow to Balraj.Apart from physical ill \u2013 health it is said that Balraj\u2019s emotional state declined considerably after his wife\u2019s death.",
    "Due to his worsening health Balraj began to pursue a comparatively , sedate life. He was involved as a lecturer and instructor at the LTTE\u2019s military academy for officers.",
    "Balraj taught military stratehy, planning and tactics. He also provided specialised training for the LTTE commandoes and special forces.He had earlier been a visiting instructor and demonstrator at various LTTE training camps. The recruits and conscripts liked being taught by Balraj.",
    "With increasing health issues, Balraj began to spend most of his time in a hospital in Puthukkudiyiruppu. But there was no way in which his services on the military front could end. The raising of the 59 division and its deployment in Manal Aaru / Weli Oya created fresh difficulties for the LTTE. Containing the armed forces in this strategically important terrain was of crucial importance.",
    "Once again Prabakharan turned to Balraj. Despite his ill \u2013 health Balraj began staying at te Frontlines for extended periods. This worsened his physical condition.Yet he would leave the hospital and undertake prolonged trips to the frontlines inspecting and supervising defences.",
    "Subsequently  senior LTTE commanders Sornam and Bhanu were sent to Manal aaru to help ease Balraj\u2019s burden.",
    "In May 2006 , a confident Balraj had stated publicly that the LTTE would win the final war. Balraj said then \u2013 \u201cThe Fourth Eelam War will be the final war, and a terrible war that will bring the long awaited liberation to our people and our homeland. We are certainly positioned to be victorious. The people are with us and our leader will lead us to victory.\u201d",
    "Things did   not turn out the way Balraj had predicted. Three years later in May 2009, the LTTE was  militarily defeated. The  final phase of the war was fought out in Balraj\u2019s  home turf  of Mullaitheevu district. Balraj was not alive then. He had died a year earlier. Balraj was receiving medical attention at a hospital in Puthukkudiyiruppu when he died of a cardiac seizure at about 2 p.m. on 20 May 2008.",
