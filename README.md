Sri Lanka is aiming to boost its economic growth to up to 6% in 2026, partly through record government capital expenditure, though delays in passing the budget could drag on its performance this year, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha Fernando said.

Sri Lanka recorded economic growth of 5% in 2024. That would likely slow to 4% to 4.5% this year, as delays in passing the budget slowed government spending, Fernando told Reuters in an interview.

“Next year ... we will need to go for 5 to 6% growth. We will aim for that,” he said. “In the long run, after five years, we target to maintain an average GDP growth that emerging countries are maintaining. That is around 6 to 7%.”

US President Donald Trump insisted Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not strike Qatar again, after an attack on Hamas last week that infuriated Washington’s Gulf ally.

“He won’t be hitting in Qatar,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, after Netanyahu failed to rule out further strikes during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem.

The U.S. State Department says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will head to Qatar after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. The visit announced Monday comes as the region is still reeling from Israel’s strike targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha.

The U.S. has sought to ease tensions between Israel and Qatar, two close American allies. Netanyahu and Rubio stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jerusalem and downplayed the furor that had, at least for a short time, taken the Trump administration aback.

### Hakeem calls out Govt.’s Israel foreign policy stance

Slams Govt. statement on Israel’s Qatar strikes as apathetic, one-sided, distorted

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader MP Rauff Hakeem yesterday accused the Government of shielding Israel in its foreign policy, saying the Foreign Ministry’s statement on the recent attack on Qatar downplayed Israeli aggression, ignored international law, and risked undermining Sri Lanka’s ties with key Gulf partners.

“At the time of Israel’s recent attack on Qatar, I was in Tehran, Iran, attending the World Islamic Solidarity Conference on Palestine, which was attended by representatives from more than 50 countries.

While returning from there, I came across a statement issued by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs following Israel’s attack on Qatar.

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry has demonstrated once again not just how incapable it is or distinguishing between an occupier and the occupied, or between an air attack and an incident, or even worse, between a mercenary behaviour and solidarity with victims.

In every constituency, every town should come from the heart to tell people what's the problem. It is not right to read and read it. Even if you write to US President Trump, he will climb the stage and read that this is the problem.

DMK, AIADMK. They say that I am busy opposing leader Vijay. Anna is the founder of the DMK. MGR Founder of AIADMK. Vijay is sleeping with them. Is it enough to put the image of the two on the platform?

I have great pride on Anna. There is nothing to blame in his rule. It was only after Anna came to politics that the history and literature of the Tamils ​​spoke on the political platform. That pride will join Anna. Don't talk about him for a half hour?

### North, East and West: Navigating  Sri Lanka’s compass in new world order

The IMF senior mission chief Peter Breuer, presenting the approval of the third review of Sri Lanka’s $ 2.9 b bailout (Source: Al Jazeera)

When the National People’s Power (NPP) Government assumed office in September 2024, it inherited more than a fragile economy and the hopes of a disillusioned citizenry. It also assumed responsibility for steering Sri Lanka through arguably the most significant moment of international recalibration since the end of the Cold War. The global order is shifting once again, with China and Russia presenting themselves as alternatives to Western dominance, and smaller states forced to reposition themselves in ways that are both delicate and strategic.

Signals of a profound reordering of the international system have been apparent for some time. Early indications of this impending shift can be, perhaps, traced to the rise of far-right nationalism and systemic dissatisfaction that emerged in many parts of the world over the past decade.

### Budget 2026 imperative: Making housing affordable through tax reform

By incentivising private homeownership through tax relief, the burden shifts from public provision to empowered individual ownership

Housing is a fundamental human need. Yet, for many Sri Lankans, the dream of owning a home remains elusive due to rising property prices, volatility of interest rates, and limited access to affordable financing. In this context, it is both timely and necessary for the Government of Sri Lanka to reintroduce housing loan interest as a qualifying payment relief under personal income tax—reviving a policy that once existed in the Sri Lankan income tax Law.

### M.H.M. Ashraff PC: Power of  education to transform communities

When history remembers leaders, it often lists their victories, their alliances, or their parliamentary debates. But the truest measure of a leader lies in the legacy that endures long after their voice has fallen silent. On 16 September 2025, the day which marks the 25th anniversary of the passing of M.H.M. Ashraff PC, that is the very question that begs a response.

For Ashraff, his enduring legacy was neither in the party he founded nor the speeches he delivered. Rather, it was in the institutions he envisioned and enabled, the most notable of such achievements being the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka (SEUSL). Education was, for him, more than a policy matter. It was the foundation of empowerment, the key to dignity, and the one tool capable of transforming the lives of entire communities. In establishing the SEUSL at Oluvil, he did not merely create a campus. He opened a doorway for thousands who had, until then, been denied access to opportunity.

The National Shoora Council (NSC) yesterday urged UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to facilitate the grant of full membership in the UN to Palestine and to suspend Israel from the UN until Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is surrendered to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in pursuance of the international

warrant issued by the ICC for the arrest of Israel’s PM. The following is the text of the letter dated 14 September 2025 addressed to the SG of the UN.

“We believe that by now, you are well aware of the despicable chain of unpardonable crimes being committed, for well over a hundred years, by the Zionist regime to destroy Palestine and its multi-religious people! What must have become more clear is that the ongoing cruel facets of genocide of the Palestinians are aimed at establishing a territorially expanding nuclear armed Zionist ethno-religious European colonial power in the Middle East.

AI won’t replace people. People who understand AI will replace people who don’t

Following my previous articles, many readers reached out with a specific request: explain AI and its impact in language everyone can understand. While AI has sparked widespread interest, the lack of accessible explanations has kept it in the ‘too complex to approach’ category for many, even among executives at major corporations. There’s no shame in acknowledging knowledge gaps; we’re not expected to master every emerging technology overnight. However, staying current with transformational forces isn’t optional in today’s business environment. This article addresses those requests by covering the fundamentals of AI, providing clarity on what it is, how it’s already reshaping our lives, and the vast opportunities it creates for those willing to engage with it.

### Real estate stocks gain from low interest rates as major land sales go through

The CSE recorded a downward trend yesterday due to profit-takings in select stocks, market analysts said.

Low interest rates significantly benefited the real estate sector, for instance. Recently Home Lands executed a major land acquisition at Thunmulla, while last week Prime Lands acquired a major land stretch at Bambalapitiya Station Road to the tune of Rs 3.5 billion, analysts added.

However, due to profit takings both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 257.01 points, while the S and P SL20 declined by 73.66 points. Turnover stood at Rs 4.1 billion with eight crossings.

Those crossings were reported in HNB, which crossed 880,000 shares to the tune of Rs 334 million and its shares traded at Rs 380, Pan Asia Bank 1.8 million shares crossed for Rs 107 million; its shares traded at Rs 57, Singer (Sri Lanka) 991,000 shares crossed for Rs 66.4 million; its shares traded at Rs 67, NTB 220,000 shares crossed for Rs 57.6 million; its shares sold at Rs 262.
