    "At present, political analysts are of the opinion that there is a school of thought that it\u2019s better for the country to allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue as the first citizen of the country for a few more years, because he has made essential goods in Sri Lanka freely available, and also put a full stop to queues at fuel and gas stations.\u00a0 But there are credibility issues with this government because this President hasn\u2019t yet got rid of many lawmakers who have had questionable track records",
    "Right now Sri Lanka is dependent on so many outside nations just to survive during the process of rebuilding its economy. It is at a time of great uncertainty that other nations are so interested in our natural harbours. Sri Lanka has been forced to cater to the interests of China and India on this matter which is connected to our geography. But if you just turn the pages of time, Singapore from virtually nothing has created for itself \u2018the world\u2019s busiest port\u2019. It\u2019s good if Sri Lanka can take a cue from Singapore as to how to become independent, and be counted in a world full of highly ambitious nations",
    "In less than two weeks time, Sri Lanka will celebrate its 76th National Independence Day, giving its citizens enough memories to ponder on what kind of \u2018independence\u2019 they\u2019ve enjoyed over the years.",
    "To begin with, we must ask ourselves the question whether we can afford to remain at home and relax on February 4th? If not, then we must take a quick look at the word \u2018independence\u2019, and see whether we can relate to it. Given the present situation in this island, the word independence would mean something - or more than that - to people who have the ability to migrate, of course in search of greener pastures. Those who have decided to stay behind or cannot find the means and ways to leave this country will have to consider how fruitful February 4 should be spent; especially if they are daily wage earners.",
    "People right now don\u2019t enjoy the independence to voice their grievances against the authoritative regime that\u2019s in power. Time and again we saw how civilians were arrested or dispersed when they gathered at public places and protested against this government. First there will be resistance, and then after some time the citizens of a country get used to the whip being cracked on them, even if what there are demanding is well within the framework of democracy and fairness. This regime promises growth in this country through this method of governance, and gives a hint that Sri Lanka would one day, akin to Singapore, stand up on its feet. The people of Singapore got used to the authoritative ways of governance by Lee KuanYew, the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore who held office from 1959-1990.",
    "Now, to be in power for 31 years is a long time.\u00a0 But it served well because Yew delivered and turned Singapore from an underdeveloped country to a fully developed rich nation. However, in the process of Singapore making a turnaround, its citizens were forced to experience hardships, and also embrace discipline. Yew always asked the question from potential foreign investors who stepped into the country and showed interest to invest in Singapore one initial question, \u201cWhat\u2019s there for Singapore, if we get into a deal with you\u201d. The equation was simple when Yew did business with the outside world; Singapore was the \u2018subject\u2019 of a business conversation and never the \u2018object\u2019.",
    "At present, political analysts are of the opinion that there is a school of thought that it\u2019s better for the country to allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue as the first citizen of the country for a few more years, because he has made essential goods in Sri Lanka freely available, and also put a full stop to queues at fuel and gas stations.\u00a0 But there are credibility issues with this government because this President hasn\u2019t yet got rid of many lawmakers who have had questionable track records.",
    "Sri Lankan\u2019s enjoy a freedom that doesn\u2019t serve the individual or the country. We see people who are still lazy to work and are dependent on politicians and government aid. It is in this backdrop that some citizens of this country are of the opinion that Wickremesinghe must continue in the hot seat of the President. But then, like, Yew, can Wickremesinghe put a full stop to corruption in politics and introduce legislation so that corrupt politicians can be arrested promptly? Like Singapore\u2019s renowned Prime Minister did, the next President must bring in a system, so that Ministers are paid well like in any other state sector job that demands professional qualifications; this would then minimise corruption. Not only the basic salaries, all earnings of Sri Lankan Ministers must be subject to tax \u2013 if this nation\u2019s rulers continue to believe that a government\u2019s earnings must largely be generated through taxes. Once this system is in order, politicians can be paid large salaries, but nothing should escape tax calculations.",
    "We do remember the days when our first female Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike reformed this economy by imposing strict regulations. If this writer remembers right, in the 1960s, there was a concept promoted by a certain business authority that \u2018a small family is worth gold\u2019. But no politician had the guts to propose \u2018birth control\u2019 because Sri Lanka is known to be a sensitive nation; especially in relation to the use of business and political slogans. Coming back to Yew, he recommended a family planning concept under the slogan \u2018stop at two\u2019 because he saw that if the country\u2019s growing population was not checked, it would have over burdened Singapore\u2019s developing economy. It would serve Sri Lanka well, if our leaders take a cue from Yew on this issue that is connected to the country\u2019s population.",
