    "Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Ratnayake, has ordered an arrest warrant for Jaffna District Independent Member of Parliament (MP) Archchuna Ramanathan. The warrant was issued yesterday during a hearing on an ongoing case related to a 2021 incident.",
    "The case involves allegations that the MP assaulted a person following a traffic accident on Baseline Road in Colombo.",
    "This development adds to the legal troubles faced by Dr. Ramanathan, who recently stirred controversy by occupying the opposition leader\u2019s traditional seat during the first session of Sri Lanka\u2019s 10th Parliament.",
    "Multiple complaints have been lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding controversial social media statements made by the first-time MP. Dr. Ramanathan is accused of asserting that the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka constitute a separate state and of expressing support for Velupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). These allegations have drawn widespread criticism and could lead to further legal action against the MP."
