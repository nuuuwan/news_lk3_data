  "original_body_lines": [
    "Dimuth Karunaratne has requested the national cricket selection committee to reconsider his request to step down as Sri Lanka's Test captain.",
    "Karunaratne had previously asked selectors to relieve him of captaincy ahead of the Ireland Test series earlier this year, but he was asked to continue in the role.",
    "Karunaratne reiterated his desire to pass on the captaincy following Sri Lanka's four-wicket loss to Pakistan in Galle on Thursday.",
    "\"After I made that request they asked me to continue if possible for a little longer. But I've told them after this series to reconsider my request, because I would really like to put my full focus on my batting, and support the team the best I can for the rest of ny career,\" Karunaratne said.",
    "\"There are a few guys in the team who are suitable to be captain, but it's not a decision that's up to me because it's a discussion that needs to be had with the selection committee.\"",
    "\"Our next Test series is in February next year, so there is a long enough time for a new captain to be appointed,\" Karunaratne added.",
    "Karunaratne has captained Sri Lanka in 29 Tests, and has seen a marked improvement in his batting stats since 2019, when he took over from Dinesh Chandimal."
