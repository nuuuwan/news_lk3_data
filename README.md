Farmers in the Anuradhapura District who cultivated lime are in a predicament for want of a remunerative market for their produce, while the price of lime has skyrocketed in urban areas due to the ongoing racket of the middleman.

“The wholesale purchase price of lime in Anuradhapura area is Rs. 50.00 per kilo, but the current market price is Rs. 2,000. Farmers are not harvesting their yield to avoid heavy losses. The yield is left under the trees. Other agricultural produce face a similar fate. The current market price of ginger is Rs. 4,000. A mechanism should be worked out to preserve lime and other agricultural produce that are abundant during the harvesting season for the off-season market.

This observation is widely shared among the public, who witness a multitude of crimes, including heinous acts against individuals or groups, such as the victims of the Easter Sunday Massacre, as well as pervasive corruption that has paralyzed the entire economy.
