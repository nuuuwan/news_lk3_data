### Sri Lanka bank interest rates edge up amid ‘ramrod anomaly’ in bills

*2025-09-22 06:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-bank-interest-rates-edge-up-amid-ramrod-anomaly-in-bills-241410/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s bank interest rates have continued to edge up after a rate cut in May 2025, amid a strong economic recovery made possible by the stability provided by the central bank through past deflationary policy as well as stable government policies.

According to central bank data the weighted average new fixed deposit rate fell to 6.62 percent in May and climbed to 6.85 percent in June and 6.90 percent in July.

However, banks are now mobilizing 12-month deposits at 7.75 percent and above to finance strong credit demand and an economic recovery.

The economic recovery may also have been helped by reduced government capex, which reduced domestic state borrowings and allowed private citizens to deploy resources to the most productive areas, bringing compounded long-term growth rather than bureaucratic spending.

The weighted average new lending rate climbed to 10.56 percent in April from 10.46 percent in March, fell to 10.28 percent in June, a month after the rate cut.

Success will require both Government and citizens to embrace a shared vision — supporting reforms, backing key sectors, and investing in the nation’s future

All Share Price Index growth: 10,119 points or 93% gain post Presidential election

Market PE stands at 9.2, highly undervalued compared to regional peers

To truly understand the story of a nation, one need not look further than the pulse of its stock exchange. It is a living, breathing entity that discounts the future, processes the present, and is invariably haunted by the ghosts of the past. For 16 tumultuous years, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has been the most honest narrator of Sri Lanka’s modern saga—a tale of euphoric triumph, devastating despair and now become the forward barometer of Sri Lanka’s economic rebirth.

In exactly one year since the Presidential elections, the ASPI has gained more than 90%, gaining 10,119 points from 10,966 to 21,085 as of 19 September 2025.

### Of awards, rewards and swards

*2025-09-22 02:57:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Of-awards-rewards-and-swards/4-781988) · `en`

I observed a surprise boom of “award ceremonies” showcasing truly deserving recipients and also “others.” I cannot tell with evidence whether one can pay and buy a prestigious award in Sri Lanka. I have politely declined to be involved as a keynote speaker or as the chief guest in several such “suspected” events. Today’s column is all about awards, rewards, and swards.

Since the digital space is rich with resources, it naturally draws the interested persons to hack the systems to gain an undue enrichment. Hence, hackers and modes of hacking are aplenty.3 Government institutions are hacked not only for money but also to embarrass the rulers through temporary stoppage of government activities. Hence, AKD Government which is bent on making a digital transformation of the Sri Lanka economy is correct in its action to setup an outfit that will monitor the work of the key institutions day and night and prevent cyber attackers from destroying the system

*2025-09-22 01:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225693) · `ta`

No final decision has been taken on the proposal against Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne. United People's Power District Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said that the final decision will be taken during a meeting with opposition leaders this week.

The actions of Speaker Jagath Wickremaratne are completely contrary to parliamentary principles and the basic aspects of democracy. He does not protect the democracy of Parliament and the rights of the opposition parties. He acts on behalf of the ruling party.

It is doubtful whether the Speaker is unaware of the power and responsibility of his post. Pimal Ratnayake is directing the Speaker.

The Speaker has ignored the no -confidence motion against Deputy Minister of Defense Aruna Jayasekara.

Various parties have urged the Speaker's unilateral action to bring a no -confidence motion against him.
