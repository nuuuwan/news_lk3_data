  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has two bills that it says could impact reconciliation and related issues in Sri Lanka and whose structures fall short of the island nation\u2019s international obligations.",
    "The bills in question are the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) bill, which is now before parliament, and the bill for the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka (proposed commission) that was gazetted on January 01.",
    "In a statement on Tuesday January 08, CPA said a consideration of the ONUR bill raises concerns on the role of the Office in \u201cassisting and guiding\u201d community level organisations in carrying out projects related to peace and reconciliation.",
    "\u201cThis is a concern in a context when victims have little or no confidence that the government has a genuine interest in forming a cohesive national unity policy. The bill should not be an excuse to legitimate and impose the government\u2019s narrative of reconciliation and should not be used as a tool to stamp out alternative narratives and undermine the voices of victims,\u201d the organisation said.",
    "The second proposal, the proposed commission, CPA said, also raises questions as to whether such a commission is required since successive governments of Sri Lanka have failed to implement the recommendations of past commissions.",
    "\u201cAs such, with Sri Lanka\u2019s history of commission fatigue and accountability deficit, this latest initiative holds little promise of addressing the demands of the victims,\u201d said CPA.",
    "CPA noted that nearly 15 years after the end of the war, Sri Lanka faces numerous challenges that have perpetuated the root causes of the conflict and impunity.",
    "\u201cCPA firmly believes that efforts towards reconciliation must address the demands of the victims and initiate reforms aimed at genuine reckoning with Sri Lanka\u2019s history. Both bills fail to address these concerns, and with it missing an opportunity at reconciliation, accountability and reform that is fundamental if Sri Lanka is to have lasting peace and stability,\u201d it said.",
    "The organisation said that both bills are being introduced at a time when concerns of ethnonationalism and land grabs are on the rise and could exacerbate triggers for conflict that threaten co-existence. It said the government should prioritise implementing confidence-building measures over subjecting victims and affected communities to more structures that merely add to the long list of commissions, committees and other state entities that make ambitious promises but fail to address the root causes of the conflict.",
    "\u201cCPA has consistently noted that Sri Lanka faces a crisis of accountability. The lack of genuine efforts at accountability resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) adopting several resolutions that recommends concrete action to secure justice for victims of human rights violations and economic crimes and address impunity.\u201d",
    "The statement further said that structures proposed by the two bills fall well short of Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations in terms of the UNHRC resolutions. The growing list of emblematic cases and numerous setback with accountability in Sri Lanka has strengthened calls for international accountability, it said, further exposing the lack of real commitment towards justice in the country.",
    "\u201cCPA also notes that these bills are introduced when Sri Lanka is to be discussed at the UNHRC in 2024 and that these and other measures are likely to be used by the government to convince the international community of some progress with reconciliation. This is far from the truth when Sri Lanka is facing heightened ethnonationalism, continuing human rights violations and exacerbating inequalities, with the response by the state seeing a crackdown on dissent, arbitrary arrests and detentions that raises questions of legality and due process and increasing militarisation.",
    "\u201cThe introduction of the Online Safety Bill, the Anti-Terrorism Bill and other measures are some examples where Sri Lanka\u2019s space for dissent is fast shrinking with fears of increasing authoritarian and militarized trends that erode the rule of law and threaten Sri Lanka\u2019s fragile peace. In such a context, CPA urges the government to withdraw these bills and initiate a process at genuine confidence building measures and reform that addresses the multiple challenges confronting Sri Lanka.\u201d (Colombo/Jan11/2024)"
