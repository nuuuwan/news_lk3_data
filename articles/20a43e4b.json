Turnover stood at Rs 2.14 billion with three crossings. Those crossings were reported in Citizens Development Business Finance, which crossed 1.49 million shares to the tune of Rs 305 million; its shares traded at Rs 205, JKH 460,000 shares crossed for Rs 91.4 million; its shares traded at Rs 198.25 and HNB 100,000 shares crossed for Rs 21.5 million; its shares sold at Rs 215.",
