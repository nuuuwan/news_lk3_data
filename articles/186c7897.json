    "The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party, in a letter to the Independent Television Network (ITN), accepted its invitation for its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to engage in a televised debate with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa today.",
    "NPP Executive Council member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, in response to ITN\u2019s offer to host the long-delayed economic debate between the two party leaders, stated that NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is prepared to participate in the debate.",
    "While thanking the channel for its offer, Dr. Jayatissa also requested ITN to inform the NPP of Premadasa\u2019s confirmation of attendance, as it is not a usual political dialogue but an already scheduled debate. He asked ITN to notify the NPP if Premadasa will attend the event on the designated date and time.",
    "However, at the time of writing, neither the SJB nor Premadasa had responded to ITN\u2019s offer.",
    "Earlier the SJB had presented several options for dates to the NPP and requested the party to pick one for the leader\u2019s debate.",
    "While the two political parties continued to tussle over organising the event, in response ITN Chairman Sudarshana Gunawardana, writing to both the SJB and NPP, offered to host the debate on the channel earlier this week.",
    "\u201cThe proposed debate between Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been scheduled for Thursday, 6 June. We have organised the debate to take place in our media company\u2019s HD studio on 6 June, starting at 10 p.m. and it will be broadcast live. We cordially invite you to participate in this debate,\u201d the letter read."
