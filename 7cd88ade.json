In addition to the American iHub in Batticaloa, the US Embassy has interactive American Spaces in Colombo, Kandy, Jaffna, and Matara.",
    "\u201cThe Batticaloa iHub, our fifth American Space in Sri Lanka, will be a key link to connect the Eastern Province with the United States, as well as to cultivate connections between young people across the entire island,\u201d said US Ambassador Julie Chung. \u201cAs we celebrate 75 years of bilateral relations this year, this space holds great promise for the youth and academic institutions in the region, fostering innovation, leadership, education, and collaboration. This will be a space where all people feel comfortable and inspired, underlining the enduring and robust partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "The Batticaloa iHub is designed to be a hub of intellectual engagement, providing access to a wide range of free-of-charge resources, including books, digital materials, multimedia content, and online databases.

The iHub also hosts a variety of free programs, workshops, and events focused on areas such as English language learning, entrepreneurship, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and American literature and history. These activities not only enhance participants\u2019 skills but also foster a deeper appreciation for the diversity of thought and ideas.",
