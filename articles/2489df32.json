    "A public teach-out on Sri Lanka\u2019s women\u2019s movements will be held on Saturday 15 June from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Colombo Public Library Auditorium.",
    "Initiated by Everystory Sri Lanka, a young feminist organisation using storytelling and knowledge sharing for advocacy, the event will feature trilingual interactive discussions, delving into the rich history of women\u2019s movements in Sri Lanka.",
    "Additionally, participants are encouraged to experience the unique human library, where participants can engage with women from different generations working on different interests who will share their memories, perspectives, and insights.",
    "Discussions will be conducted in all three languages: English at 2:15 p.m., Sinhala at 3:00 p.m., and Tamil at 3:45 p.m. All events are free to access, and no pre-registration is required.",
    "Everystory Sri Lanka said the event is open to friends and family as it is an opportunity to celebrate and learn about the powerful history of women\u2019s movements in Sri Lanka. There will also be a children\u2019s corner with a professional child-minder.",
    "Established in 2018, Everystory Sri Lanka\u2019s objective is to use creative practices, learning circles, and digital spaces to create inclusive and safe spaces for dialogue, for learning and unlearning, and work towards a more equal and equitable world.",
    "\u201cThe history of women\u2019s resistance, activism and participation in shaping Sri Lanka is not widely recorded or acknowledged. \u201cThe theme is titled as \u2018movements\u2019 to leave room for the histories and stories that may not be captured in some of the writings they have been able to find, and also because it\u2019s possible that there have been several movements,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
    "\u201cThis event gives an opportunity for the public to engage in relevant information in the form of public teach-outs. These sessions are conducted by knowledgeable individuals in the format of a lecture, followed by a discussion. It is an interactive two-way knowledge-sharing event with the opportunity for participants to learn, and ask questions,\u201d she added."
