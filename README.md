The World Bank has praised that Sri Lanka has done it, despite many countries in the world to show economic growth.. The country, which was a bankrupt in 2021, 2022 and 2023, has reached this situation today. The cost has increased and the costs have been reduced.

This was a new experience which I faced, and guidance was not available in textbooks. In today’s episode, I will talk about how I introduced two Japanese techniques successfully and how I had to manage the challenges that arose.

### Ranil’s special relationship with India and the peace process

*2025-09-13 11:49:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ranils-special-relationship-with-india-and-the-peace-process/) · `en`

Ranil gave a very special place towards relations with India. He obviously knew its political leaders and most of the important officials intimately. He knew a great deal about their background and not only of their politics. I was often surprised with his deep knowledge of Indian political alliances and even personal family relationships. He had visited many times in both north and south and had friends from Kerala to Bihar. He never missed, when in Delhi, paying a call on those who had become over time, his personal friends.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange revenue from tourism in August 2025 fell 8.2 percent from a year ago to 258.9 million US dollars, the central bank said, quoting tourism promotion authority data.

The revenue from tourism, which accounts for nearly 3 percent of the island nation’s economy, fell for the second straight month, despite an increase in the monthly tourist arrivals in both months, the data showed.

In July, the revenue fell 3 percent to 318.5 million US dollars compared to the same month in the previous year’s 328.3 million US dollars.

The tourist arrivals saw a jump of 20.4 percent to 198,235 in August and a rise of 6.6 percent to 200,244 in July, the official data showed.

However, the revenue for the first eight months up to end-August has seen a rise of 5.7 percent to 2.29 billion US dollars from a year ago.

Sri Lanka’s new government has aimed at an ambitious 5 billion US dollar revenue and a 3 million arrival target this year.

### From Opposition Stand To Government Policy: The NPP’s Reversal On PC Delimitation

*2025-09-13 10:56:49* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/from-opposition-stand-to-government-policy-the-npps-reversal-on-pc-delimitation/) · `en`

The trajectory of Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) on the question of Provincial Council (PC) elections underscores how political priorities shift with the assumption of state power. Once, as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the party spearheaded the rejection of delimitation. Today, with a commanding two-thirds majority in Parliament, the NPP has recommitted to the very process it once condemned—announcing at the United Nations Human Rights Council (OHCHR) today that PC elections will only be held once a new delimitation exercise is complete.

In 2017, the UNP–SLFP coalition amended the law to introduce a mixed electoral system for PCs. A Delimitation Committee led by K. Thavalingam was tasked with redrawing electoral boundaries.

The Matara Chief Magistrate’s Court has issued a warrant for the arrest of Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Lasantha Wickramasekara.

The order was issued when the case was called before Matara Chief Magistrate Chathura Dissanayake yesterday (12).

The warrant follows the chairman’s failure to appear in court in a case alleging that he threatened to kill National People’s Power Pradeshiya Sabha member and Attorney-at-Law Tharaka Nanayakkara.

A case has been filed against Wickramasekara under the Victims Protection Act for allegedly threatening Attorney-at-Law Nanayakkara, who contested the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha elections representing the National People’s Power.

When the case was taken up at the Matara Magistrate’s Court, the accused did not appear, said Ada Derana reporter.

During the court proceedings, the accused did not appear, and a legal representative informed the court of his ill health.

However, the warrant was issued due to the absence of his guarantors in court.

About the Author: Bhante Missaka Kamalasiri, a Buddhist monk of Sri Lankan origin, has spent decades exploring the Himalayan spiritual landscape. Far beyond the role of a traveler, he has immersed himself in spiritual practice and direct experience, guided by his teacher, Ananda Maitriya Mahasthavir. Drawing inspiration from the wisdom of the Himalayas, his work bridges culture, spirituality, and human understanding, reminiscent of the contributions of Alexandra David Neel and Paul Brunton.

In a conversation that meandered like the mountain trails he once walked, Bhante Missaka Kamalasiri reflected on the broader vision behind his book, Whispering Echoes of the Himalayas.
