ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Opposition leader has asked the government to give public sector jobs to 50,000 unemployed graduates, despite the country having a bloated state service sector, and an ongoing strike today by public servants demanding salary increases.

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said he had seen unemployed graduates striking on the road side during a visit to the North and East.

“Will they be given appointments? What is their future? Why are not hired for essential vacancies based on their qualifications, they are asking,” he said in parliament.

“In the North and East the requests made by them I am tabling. From the government side what is the governments plan? The unemployed graduates in my estimation is close to 50,000. There is such a number.

“They have got the light from our free education, and will they go straight to the unemployed line, is what I am asking?

Member of Parliament Rohini Kumari Kaviratne alleges that the government has appointed Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe as the Acting Attorney General, overlooking Senior Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena, despite her seniority and eligibility for the role, due to gender bias.

Furthermore, Kaviratne criticized the government, pointing out that it has been two weeks since the ‘Women Empowerment Act’ was passed in Parliament. She added that while the government introduces various acts to present a progressive image to the international community, their actions in recognizing and promoting women in positions of power have fallen short.

“I need to know on which basis that woman was overlooked and another person was appointed to act in the office”, she questioned in parliament.
