New York, June 11 (BBC) - Heinrich Klaasen hit a vital 46 as South Africa claimed a nervy four-run victory over Bangladesh that put them on the brink of securing a place in the T20 World Cup Super 8s.

A combination of the pitch, poor shot selection and good bowling from Bangladesh saw South Africa teetering on 23-4 after they won the toss, as Tanzim Hasan Sakib snaffled 3-18.

Klaasen hit three fours and two sixes in his 44-ball innings as he shared a 79-run partnership with the dependable David Miller to help South Africa recover to compile a defendable 113-6.

Bangladesh made a decent fist of the run chase and at 94-4 with three overs remaining were probably slight favourites.

However, when Kagiso Rabada took the key wicket of Towhid Hridoy for 37 the momentum swung back to the Proteas.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has made profits of 120.3 billion rupees, helped by a 20 billion forex gain and a lower interest bill, compared to 617 billion rupees when the currency collapsed in the previous year.

In 2022, CPC posted a loss of 617.5 billion rupees, with 529.4 billion rupees coming the rupee was busted through un-anchored policy operated by macroeconomists to enforce rate cuts and a failed attempt to float the currency with a surrender rule in place.

### Rise in flies poses risk of diarrhoea and contagious viral fever

Colombo, June 11 (Daily Mirror) - As floodwaters recede, the proliferation of flies has raised alarms among health authorities due to the increased risk of diarrhoea outbreaks and the spread of contagious viral fevers.

According to consultant Dr Deepal Perera, the abundance of organic matter in flooded areas accelerates the maturation of fly eggs, leading to a rapid increase in fly populations as floodwaters subside. These newly hatched flies, seeking food sources, often gravitate towards faeces, garbage, and contaminated surfaces, further exacerbating the health crisis.

“The consequences of the surge in fly populations are dire. Flies are notorious carriers of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses responsible for diarrheal diseases and viral fevers,” he pointed out.

“Contaminated food and water sources, when ingested, can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea (feeling an urge to vomit), and loose stools,” Dr Perera stated.

### Ransomware menace plaguing Sri Lankan businesses: Kaspersky

A total of 2,650 ransomware incidents have been detected and blocked by Kaspersky’s cybersecurity solutions for businesses in Sri Lanka from January to December 2023, it was revealed.

Experts from the global cybersecurity company insist on organisations, regardless of shape and size, to beef up their IT security posture as ransomware, especially the targeted type, continues to be a damaging menace for organisations in the region.

“The era of widespread mass attacks by encryptors on both individuals and businesses is gradually fading away. Instead, we are witnessing a shift towards organised groups that execute hacks involving data theft and encryption, commonly referred to as double extortion.

The rationale behind this evolution lies in the perpetrators’ ability to operate with greater efficiency, thereby enabling them to demand significantly higher ransom sums,” said  Fedor Sinitsyn, Lead Malware Analyst at Kaspersky.

### Sri Lanka should separate foreign policies from borrowing policies: Dr. Devarajan

A prominent economist stressed the need for Sri Lanka to separate its foreign policies from the borrowing policies, so it does not repeat the same mistakes that have resulted in it having to grapple with high cost of debt.

Citing the government’s decision in 2019 to reject the favourable loans from the US and Japan, to choose commercial loans from China, due to the country’s lenient stance over Sri Lanka’s human rights issue, former World Bank Acting Chief Dr. Shanta Devarajan noted the move was detrimental and added to the woes of the country.

“I think this was a big mistake because it mixed up the foreign policy objectives with the economic policy objectives. You always borrow from the cheapest lender, regardless of what your foreign relations are with that country. So, Sri Lanka should keep its borrowing policy separate from its foreign policy,” asserted Dr. Devarajan.

He added that some say it is impossible to make the separation but it is possible, as in the case of Taiwan and China.

### Range Bandara’s  “Loud Thinking” about Election Postponement Damages   Ranil’s Election Campaign in the Short Term.

*2024-06-11 00:54:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84130) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s political stage was enlivened last week by the solo performance of  United National Party (UNP) general -secretary Palitha Range Bandara. Addressing a media briefing on 28 May, the policeman turned politician came out with a suggestion that the presidential election due this year and the Parliamentary election scheduled for next year should be postponed while the terms of office for both should be extended by two more years. The former Puttalam district and ex-state minister wanted a resolution passed by Parliament to that effect and ratified by the people at a referendum.

The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country’s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis. Considerable progress  has been achieved by the  Wickremesinghe Govt to remedy the situation. A degree of economic stability has been established but more time is needed to ensure greater economic stability.

With this victory, South Africa has increased the chance of playing the Super 8 round in the 9th T20 World Cup.

It is worth noting that the two -day teams have failed the second team with the target of a very low total number.

Pakistan lost by 6 runs in response to 120 runs in the same stadium against India.

South Africa became the pride of the team that retained very little total number in the T20 World Cup after winning with Bangladesh. Earlier, India's 119 runs were the smallest number.

South Africa decided to bat first, which gave them difficulty again, losing six wickets in 20 overs and scoring only 113 runs.

In the match against the Netherlands, the total number of South Africa's leading quarries was 23 runs in the 5th over.

Emphatic. An election result that throws up no outright winners would not be normally described as that. But this was no normal election. It was an election for the democratic heart and soul of India. And, in this sense, the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, which left the BJP with less than a majority, were emphatic.

An emphatic rejection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s creeping authoritarianism, his and Home Minister Amit Shah’s two-man regime, and their divisive politics, anti-federal tendencies, and idea of “development” that lined the pockets of crony capitalists without improving the lives of the common people. An emphatic vote for political, social, and economic inclusion, for a more consultative government, and for the sanctity of the Constitution and the guarantees and protections written into it for all citizens.

The Supreme Court’s June 6 reversal of the order of President Maithripala Sirisena to grant a pardon to Jude Shramantha Jayamaha, who was sentenced to death over the Royal Park murder incident on July 1, 2005, was the second such action by the apex court within the last six months.

The court on January 17 quashed the clemency given by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been on death row over the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011.

Both rulings by the Supreme Court to quash the capital punishment given to Duminda Silva and Jude Shramantha Jayamaha were based on technicalities - meaning the President had failed to adhere to the proper legal procedures in granting the special Presidential Pardon.

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka is facing a health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which account for 89% of deaths, according to Health Secretary Dr. Palitha Mahipala.

The hardest hit are those aged 50 to 60, with four out of ten falling victim to NCDs.

“Each year, 60,000 Sri Lankans suffer strokes, resulting in 4,000 deaths and leaving thousands with serious health issues,” the health secretary underscored.

“Smoking is another major killer, causing 20,000 deaths annually,” he added.

To combat this, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is investing Rs 70 billion over the next five years. Their plan includes boosting primary health care and setting up five cardiac catheterization units across the island.
