    "President of the Government Surveyors\u2019 Association Duminda Undugoda stated that this trade union action was launched as a protest against the arbitrary actions of the Minister of Lands Harin Fernando and over several other demands including solutions to the issues pertaining to the physical and human resources of the Survey Department of Sri Lanka.",
