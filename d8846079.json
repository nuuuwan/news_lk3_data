    "\u2018Unknown\u2019 commitments reduce from 21 to 15 out of the 73 due by end-November",
    "The transparency in Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) program improved in November following the publication of several supporting documents with the 2024 budget, according to the latest update of Verit\u00e9 Research\u2019s \u2018IMF Tracker\u2019.",
    "The supporting documents have provided information on the progress of six commitments which were previously classified as \u2018unknown\u2019. Five of the commitments have now been reclassified as \u2018met\u2019 and one \u2013 the tax revenue target, as \u2018not met\u2019.",
    "Of the 73 commitments due by end-November, 12 are \u2018not met\u2019, 15 are classified as \u2018unknown\u2019, and 46 as \u2018met\u2019. Therefore, 63% of the commitments due by end November have been verifiably completed. This means, however, that Sri Lanka\u2019s overall performance remains less than impressive.",
    "The IMF board will vote tomorrow (12 December) on the disbursement of the program\u2019s second tranche of around $ 330 million, which was originally expected in September. IMF Tracker will be updated with the revised set of commitments and timeframes that are likely to emerge from the request for board approval to disburse the tranche.",
    "IMF Tracker is the first and only platform which has been tracking the 100 commitments identified at the start of Sri Lanka\u2019s 17th IMF program. It is available for the public on the website of Verit\u00e9 Research\u2019s manthri.lk platform at https://manthri.lk/en/imf_tracker."
