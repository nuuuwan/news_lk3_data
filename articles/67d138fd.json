    "Just like in Bangladesh, we witness the same pattern in Nepal. Unwise groups of youth, armed with social media channels and a distorted sense of justice, have manipulated the sentiments of entire communities, transforming moral outrage into instruments of disorder. At the conclusion of Bangladesh\u2019s upheavals, the country found Muhammad Yunus and a semblance of reconstruction. Nepal, in its own chaotic moment, now looks to a \u2018messiah\u2019 in former Chief Justice Sushila Karki.",
    "The so-called \u2018Gen-Z Movement,\u2019 which emerged after days of violent protests and consultations with the Chief of Army Staff, recommended Karki to lead the interim government. Their initial agenda includes the dissolution of Parliament, the formation of an interim administration, and comprehensive revisions to the decade-old Constitution. Representatives of the movement emphasised that her name had been proposed through online votes within their networks, a mechanism that, in its ambition, perfectly captures the illusion of participatory democracy in the digital era, even as it dangerously divorces decision-making from political prudence.",
    "The images that emerged from the streets of Kathmandu are seared into memory: former Prime Ministers stripped and paraded, political leaders\u2019 residences set ablaze, and government buildings reduced to ruins. The ostensible trigger\u2014a fleeting ban on social media platforms\u2014quickly morphed into a grotesque pageant of street vengeance. Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar, wife of former Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal, sustained severe burns when protesters set her house alight.",
    "Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife were beaten before cameras, and the nation witnessed the unfolding mayhem in real time via Instagram and X. The protests, led by Generation Z, began ostensibly as a campaign against corruption and social media restrictions but soon escalated into unmediated retribution, public humiliation, and mob rule. Moral fury, amplified through social media, cannot substitute for governance or revolutionary action; it generates chaos, raw and untempered.",
    "Nepal\u2019s historical record reveals a society perpetually perched on the edge of instability. From the monarchy\u2019s overthrow in 2008 to repeated constitutional crises, political upheaval has been a recurrent feature. Young Nepalese have long been marginalised by endemic corruption, nepotism, and economic stagnation. Their frustration is neither new nor unfounded. Yet, the mode of expression\u2014violent street eruptions, assaults on private citizens, and destruction of civic institutions\u2014reveals a generation more attuned to digital signalling than strategic political thinking. As James C. Scott observed, \u201cpublic acts of resistance are the tip of an iceberg of private grievances.\u201d In Nepal, this resonates with tragic irony: while the protests are spectacular, they lack the intellectual scaffolding necessary for lasting reform. The visible chaos masks an incapacity for disciplined, structured civic engagement.",
    "The role of social media in this generational turbulence cannot be overstated. Platforms such as Facebook, X, and Instagram, celebrated in the West as engines of freedom of expression, have acted as accelerants in contexts like Nepal. Western powers, insisting that digital liberties be \u201crespected,\u201d frequently overlook the fact that these tools, when exported to nations with fragile institutions, can destabilise society. Unlike in established democracies, where legal frameworks, media literacy campaigns, and accountable institutions moderate the impact of virality, in Nepal, social media created a feedback loop of outrage. Tweets, reels, and viral posts replaced dialogue, planning, and institutional oversight. The outcome was inevitable: moral indignation manifested as tangible destruction, exemplified by the torching of Nakkhu Central Jail and the release of thousands of inmates into an already fraying social fabric.",
    "Historically, revolutionary movements that produced durable change combined moral urgency with strategic intelligence. Hannah Arendt warned that \u201cpower and violence are opposites; where the one rules absolutely, the other is absent.\u201d In Kathmandu, the crowd wielded violence without authority: government offices burned, leaders were humiliated, yet no coherent political programme emerged to channel the energy constructively. Chaos is not power; spectacle is not reform. The streets of Kathmandu became a theatre of barbarism, not a laboratory for meaningful transformation.",
    "Antonio Gramsci\u2019s theory of hegemony and the role of \u201corganic intellectuals\u201d is instructive. He noted that societies in crisis produce \u201cmorbid symptoms\u201d when old orders collapse but no new leadership is ready to emerge. Nepal\u2019s Gen Z movement exemplifies this: the political elite had long lost legitimacy, but the young insurgents, despite their moral outrage, lacked the organisational and intellectual framework to propose coherent alternatives. They replaced strategy with chaos, reform with humiliation, and governance with digital validation. The result is a society in which moral authority is conflated with destructive power, producing not progress but disintegration.",
    "Alexis de Tocqueville provides another pertinent lens. He argued that democratic energy, unchecked by deliberation and institutions, is volatile and potentially destructive: \u201cIn a democracy, the people are both the most powerful and the most vulnerable; their energy can create freedom or chaos.\u201d In Nepal, it created chaos. The rage of the crowd, born of decades of nepotism, corruption, and youth unemployment, was real. Yet, channelled through the unregulated architecture of social media, it yielded immediate destruction and public degradation rather than structural reform. Stripping former leaders, assaulting public servants, and burning civic institutions were not political statements\u2014they were moral theatre masquerading as political action, barbarity mistaken for revolution.",
    "Everyday resistance further highlights the dilemma, as incremental, often invisible acts of defiance can produce more enduring change than spectacular uprisings. In Nepal, however, the spectacular violence overshadowed any prospect of sustained reform. The participants may have felt righteous, but without political intelligence, their actions were transient, leaving governance structures in shreds and citizens exposed. This embodies the \u201cGen Z illusion\u201d: the belief that moral indignation and digital virality suffice as instruments of political change.",
    "The consequences extend far beyond immediate destruction. Thousands of prisoners escaped from Nakkhu Central Jail, including juveniles, highlighting the state\u2019s failure to maintain order. Government offices, court records, and historical archives were obliterated. A society once bound by legal and civic frameworks now finds these pillars weakened, and social trust eroded. Social media, with its selective outrage and punitive display, has supplanted due process, turning justice into humiliation. Former Prime Ministers accused of corruption were stripped and paraded before any judicial examination\u2014social media acting as jury, judge, and executioner simultaneously.",
    "Freedom of expression, when taken to extremes, has morphed into a tool of social barbarism. Western insistence on \u201crespecting fundamental rights\u201d has exported digital liberties without the accompanying institutional infrastructure. The result: moral outrage weaponised, social cohesion fractured, and state authority eroded. The Nepalese experience illustrates how digital tools, unmediated by governance, can inflame human psychology to uncontrollable levels, producing what Arendt might term violence masquerading as power.",
    "Nepal\u2019s Gen Z movement is not revolutionary in the classical sense. It is an emotional, performative eruption, fuelled by outrage and frustration, yet devoid of the strategic foresight, institutional knowledge, and political acumen essential for genuine reform. To claim otherwise is to conflate destruction with progress. Stripping ministers, burning jails, humiliating political elites\u2014these are acts of vengeance, morally rationalised only in the imagination of a digital mob. They signal not the birth of democracy, but the collapse of civility.",
    "Mild praise for Sri Lanka\u2019s stability in a world marred by chaos and instability",
    "The minister just missed seeing the Rolls Royce picking us up for a sugar traders\u2019 lunch",
