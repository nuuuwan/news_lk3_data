    "Overall the big cap counters did well with Banks and PD shares.",
    "But most investors were down up to 30% on mid cap and penny shares depending on entry points.",
    "Overall the turnover levels were low on average 1.7b and in 2nd half below 1b mark compared to 2022 -3b and 2021-5b.",
    "2021 was the best for the market with low interest rates and high liquidity in the market.",
    "2022 was the worst with the country going through shortages, queues, Dollar shortage and finally the Government defaulting on loans.",
    "2023- Gaining IMF support, implementation of IMF conditions and reforms and stabilising the economy.",
    "As for the Government, most indicators have improved and work is in progress for the balance with lots of pain to the citizens.",
    "Due to the above, interest rates were very high close to 30% making it difficult for businesses and impacting the bottom line.",
    "Most of the money and investment went into high yield bonds, TB, FDs and debentures, making it difficult for the market to perform with attractive options on above and high margin costs to invest.",
    "Also, expected big buybacks and buyouts didn\u2019t happen during the year.",
    "3rd quarter GDP turned positive after 6-8 quarters of negative and 4th quarter looking good.",
    "If privatization happens of all entities dependent on the Government, massive amounts in trillions could be gained from sales proceeds, and that would increase efficiency and better service.",
    "Also, reduce the payroll from the Government coffers, reduce Government borrowing and interest payments, one of the highest expenses for the Government, i.e. salaries and interest payments.",
    "Once this is done corruption will automatically be reduced or eliminated.",
    "There won\u2019t be any appointments on political influence and getting tenders passed through influence.",
    "With low Interest rates money will flow back to the market and businesses will make better profits.",
    "With SOE sales and Listings market cap and turnover would increase exponentially.",
    "Mainly, banking undervalued. 5 to PBV, ISB write-back from excess provision, with economic recovery lower provisions in general",
    "Plantation- At current levels, discounted to earlier levels, tea prices from a peak of 1,500 dropped to 800 levels and now picking up to 1,200 and volumes also increasing",
    "Construction-after a relatively slower activity for the last 2 years, would improve with the economy",
    "Investment companies-With expected rise in the market would do well in the next few quarters.",
    "Another play to look forward will be SOE privatisation and spillover effect to existing companies and re rating. Example: Telco, Hospitals, Hotels, Insurance, Banks, utility Gas and renewables can see some new potential foreign buyers.",
    "Any winning Presidential candidate and Party has to continue the IMF reforms and there is no other way.",
    "Some might promise some changes like taxes but eventually they would have to give a proposal to the IMF to cover that amount from another increase.",
    "So overall there won\u2019t be a major change whoever comes to power.",
    "If the hard reforms are carried through like in India or Thailand we can come out of this mess and be sustainable and go on a growth and prosperity path for all.",
    "And not go to the IMF in the future and not dictated by anyone and be self disciplined.",
    "I believe Sri Lanka has so much potential and we can do it right.",
    "On the whole I expect it\u2019s time for CSE to reflect the true potential and renewed interest and be a place to make money in 2024 shifting from debt instruments and fixed income which gives lower returns at current rates and is still taxable.",
