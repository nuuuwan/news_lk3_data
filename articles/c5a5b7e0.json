    "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday declared martial law in an unannounced late night address broadcast live on YTN television, claiming he would eradicate \u201cshameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces\u201d.",
    "He did not cite any specific threat from the nuclear-armed North, however, instead focusing on his domestic political opponents.",
    "The surprise move sent shockwaves through the country, which had a series of authoritarian leaders early in its history but has been considered democratic since the 1980s. The Korean won was down sharply against the U.S. dollar.",
    "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, saying opposition parties have taken hostage of the parliamentary process to throw the country into a crisis.",
    "\u201cI declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order,\u201d Yoon said.",
    "He did not say in the address what specific measures will be taken. Yonhap news agency reported that the entrance to the parliament building was blocked.",
    "\u201cTanks, armored personnel carriers, and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country,\u201d Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, which has the majority in parliament, said in a livestream online. \u201cThe economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably. My fellow citizens, please come to the National Assembly.\u201d",
    "Yoon cited a motion by the country\u2019s opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, this week to impeach some of the country\u2019s top prosecutors and its rejection of a government budget proposal.",
    "South Korea\u2019s ministers on Monday protested the move by opposition DP last week to slash more than 4 trillion won from the government\u2019s budget proposal. Yoon said that action undermines the essential functioning of government administration."
