    "From star-gazing would-be astronauts to navel-gazing social anthropologists, we\u2019ve had a surfeit of rising stars and setting suns \u2013 er, sons \u2013 who\u2019ve promised more than they\u2019ve ever delivered. And they continue to take the public, the polity and the parliaments of which some of them are a part for a long ride round the galactic block to the edge of outer darkness",
    "This week was something special, celestially speaking. First there was the spectacular Perseid shower in the bewitching midnight watch and some hours after. Then there was a scintillating conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in the early morning midweek days that followed. And now there is the ongoing spectacle of political shooting stars of the past and present disporting themselves as if they\u2019d never heard of the principle of entropy. That all things must run down.",
    "In every respect, it is a show-stopper for a citizenry starving for bread and circuses under the more austere regime than most we are blessed with at present.",
    "Of course, the Perseids may have dazzled people all over the planet, as promised in the hype on social media. But here in Sri Lanka the meteorological outlook was predictably gloomy. Prospect: meteor showers. Reality: thunder showers. It was ever thus. Rain a spoiler something rotten. And this time, it\u2019s not cricket.",
    "Back up a bit. For those of you who came in late... a JVP Leader of the House \u2013 responding to a \u2018question\u2019 (pronounce it how you like) raised by those pesky SLPP types (who don\u2019t know when to call it quits) \u2013 tells parliament that a satellite launched into space on Sri Lanka\u2019s behalf by China\u2019s Xichang Space Centre at a cost of US$ 300 million in 2012 no longer exists. Then the Premier \u2018clarifies\u2019 (interpret it how you like) the issue by claiming that not only does the spacefarer owned by Board of Investment company Supreme SAT Ltd. exist, but it also brought in annual revenues to the tune of Rs. 20 billion a year on average between 2015 and the first half of 2023.",
    "It is well past high time that we the people, disappointed spectators of celestial sky shows",
    "and dismayed onlookers at political freak shows, call a halt to this \u2018Oh what a circus!\u2019 routine",
    "This prime ministerial contradiction \u2013 including the fact that it was Supreme SAT and not the Government of Sri Lanka (as the JVP et al. claimed then) that had invested some 12 million rupees between 2013 and 2014 \u2013 is further \u2018clarified\u2019 by another NPP stalwart now. That minister claims, rather than the PM cough up to her error, that the information provided by the BOI to be made public through parliament is, in fact, not factual. And that a full-scale investigation into the fiasco would be launched to address the \u2018questionable\u2019 goings-on all round.",
    "From the taxpayers\u2019 point of view, this is \u201cpanem et circenses\u201d (don\u2019t try to pronounce that). It is a show that has been going on since time out of mind, from the Romans to the Rajapaksas. And as much as the scintillating conjunction of Jupiter and Venus was clouded over by leaden skies favouring our blessed isle, along came two other planets to cast a pall over our present star-gazing prospects.",
    "On the one hand there was the scion of a \u2018royal family\u2019 of the past, swimming once again into our ken with a story we all thought had been buried under a pile of moon-dust. On the other there was the plebeian \u2018professorial type\u2019 of senior minister we are fortunate to have presiding over matters lunar-oriented, really, and adding her own pixillated sprinkling of fairy dust to the sordid tale.",
    "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a young man with the stars in his eyes launched a satellite into space on behalf of his serendipitously lost and found island nation. That he did so allegedly with our struggling taxpayers\u2019 bitterly-parted-with money is neither here nor there. And over the course of time, and in short order to boot, so was the satellite \u2013 it was lost and found to be neither here nor there.",
    "To cut a long story short, it was a tale with a twist, like Halley\u2019s Comet. But unlike that ghostly yet grand visitor from the depths of the far-flung provinces of our Solar System, \u201cChiChi\u2019s rocket\u201d \u2013 as the lost item was known \u2013 swung back into orbit in a shorter time than anyone had to say, \u201cHere she comes!\u201d backward in Mandarin Chinese.",
    "First, the satellite \u2013 or was it a rocket? \u2013 was launched into space for Sri Lanka and the Kingly-Clan regime by the Chinese [who, having conquered large swathes of the third planet through their ubiquitous Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) strategy, then set their sights on its only natural satellite: the Moon]. Then it went missing: the artificial satellite, that is, not that lunar orb! And stayed lost in the Oort Cloud or a space-side One Belt, One Road (OBOR) for twelve long years \u2013 a short span of time by cosmic standards, to be sure.",
    "It was found again by the Board of Investment (BOI). And lost again by the boys in red! In the brief moments between BOI records being broached open for public consumption and the lady doctor (not of the medical ilk but the merely anthropological) showing us how to do that \u201copen wide and say aaaah\u201d \u2013 and then putting her foot in the mouth \u2013 routine. Aargh.",
    "I don\u2019t know about you, dears, gentle readers and other lunatics, but I\u2019ve had just about enough of the no show. From star-gazing would-be astronauts to navel-gazing social anthropologists, we\u2019ve had a surfeit of rising stars and setting suns \u2013 er, sons \u2013 who\u2019ve promised more than they\u2019ve ever delivered. And they continue to take the public, the polity and the parliaments of which some of them are a part for a long ride round the galactic block to the edge of outer darkness.",
    "There is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth at more than 10/10ths cloud cover obstructing the view of the annual, heavenly sky fiesta.",
    "We languish in a limbo of political has-beens elbowing their way back into the spendthrift fifteen minutes of fame which they squandered while in power and aspirational would-be do-gooders who don\u2019t know their \u2018aahs!\u2019 from their L-boards.",
    "I say it is well past high time that we the people, disappointed spectators of celestial sky shows and dismayed onlookers at political freak shows, call a halt to this \u2018Oh what a circus!\u2019 routine with which we\u2019ve put up for longer \u2013 it seems \u2013 than the Perseids keep coming back.",
    "In the past we\u2019ve put up with a spectrum of lunatic piffle \u2013 from the damp squib of Yahapaalanaya despite its initial fizz and sparkle, to the blood moon stained propaganda of Zero Civilian Casualties, and let\u2019s not even mention Capitalism with a Human Face or Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour.",
    "Now we\u2019re still swimming in a sea of gamesmanship, one-upmanship, petty politicking, bureaucratic bungling, disinformation campaigns befuddling the polity, and politicos of all hues and shades protecting their own hide at the expense of \u2013 the truth be told \u2013 the public and national interests.",
    "When will we get to be like that astronomer who feels like \u201csome watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s not a satellite, shooting star or sad, sorry, sordid excuse for star-struck elected representatives with their eyes of the main chance to shaft political rivals (including, perhaps, contending colleagues in a coalition where the cracks are showing?)?",
    "Well, not until we get tough with the new kids on the political block, newbies though they may be being answerable to the public or tyros at governance. Also, not until we push the present powers that be to put away the tyrants of the past and their progeny who swindled nation, state, country, people and generations to come of their due share of national wealth. Plus, put them away where the Sun \u2013 and Moon \u2013 don\u2019t shine."
