    "Established in 1985 as the world\u2019s first chamber dedicated to empowering women, the WCIC remains committed to fostering female entrepreneurship, leadership, and professional development across Sri Lanka. This year\u2019s AGM, led by Chairperson Anoji De Silva and the 15-member Board, celebrated the Chamber\u2019s achievements during the 2023/24 term while setting the stage for future growth.",
    "During the event, the leadership team highlighted the WCIC\u2019s enduring commitment to creating sustainable businesses, advocating for women\u2019s participation in the economy, and breaking down barriers for female entrepreneurs.",
    "Over the past year, the Chamber has made significant strides, forging impactful partnerships with organisations such as the Centre for Private Enterprise (CIPE), OAV (German Asia Pacific Organisation), UNESCAP, Globally Cool, SAARC Chamber of Commerce, and USAID to name a few. These collaborations have provided vital support to women entrepreneurs, particularly in financial literacy, export readiness, and digital marketing.",
    "The WCIC made a notable stride in its efforts to spread the wings with the first provincial chapter being set up in the Northern Province.",
    "As part of the official proceedings, Gayani De Alwis was elected as the Chairperson for 2024-2025 and a new Board appointed. In her acceptance speech, she expressed deep gratitude to the WCIC\u2019s Founders and past Chairs for their visionary leadership, vowing to build on their legacy by growing membership, expanding reach, and empowering women entrepreneurs to build inclusive, sustainable businesses.",

These efforts have helped women gain qualifications in elder and child care, as well as launch their own businesses, contributing to sustainable livelihoods in the informal sector.

    "As the WCIC prepares to enter its 40th year, the Chamber is focused on continuing its advocacy for gender-inclusive workplaces, promoting businesses that are export-ready, and supporting women entrepreneurs in overcoming barriers to success. With a clear vision for the future, the WCIC is committed to driving positive change for women in business and contributing to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth."
