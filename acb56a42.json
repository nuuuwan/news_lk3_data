    "Supreme Court judge Til Prasad Shrestha ruled marriages of same-sex and non-traditional couples must be registered as \u201ctemporary\u201d until lawmakers come up with a new legal framework to uphold such unions permanently.",
    "In an interim ruling on 28 June, the judge ordered Nepal\u2019s government to set up a separate register of marriages for same-sex couples, who lawyers say will have the same rights as heterosexual partners.",
    "The court also asked opponents of its landmark order to file their objections within two weeks.",

    "In the rest of Asia, only Taiwan has legalised same-sex marriage.",
    "The ruling followed a petition submitted by LGBTQ+ activists last month to enforce existing rulings, dating back to 2007, that instructed the government to amend Nepalese legislation to recognise same-sex marriage for the sake of equal rights. Successive governments have so far failed to change the law.",
    "One of the petitioners, Pinky Gurung, a trans woman who heads Nepal\u2019s Blue Diamond Society gay rights group, called the latest verdict historic.",

    "A 2011 census estimated that 1,500 people identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or other diverse sexual or gender identities in Nepal, but activists have claimed the queer community actually consists of 2.5 million Nepalese in the country of 30 million.",

    "Western diplomats also hailed the ruling, which came during the global Pride month that celebrates LGBTQ+ people and their battle to overcome prejudice.",
    "\u201cAs we conclude Pride month, we are reminded that the freedom to marry means very little without the freedom to marry the person you love,\u201d said US ambassador Dean Thompson.",
    "\u201cNepal continues to demonstrate regional leadership in promoting the rights of LBGTIQA+ communities,\u201d said Australian ambassador Felicity Volk in a separate tweet.",
    "\u201cSame-sex marriage is against natural law, social norms and culture,\u201d tweeted Kamal Thapa, a former deputy prime minister and an influential politician in overwhelmingly Hindu Nepal.",
    "\u201cIf same-sex marriage is legalised it will lead to family confusion and social distortion,\u201d he claimed.",
    "Sujan Panta, a lawyer who advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, warned that many people \u201cin positions of power\u201d held similar beliefs.",
    "\u201cMajority of them still find same-sex marriage to be unnatural, but with this court order, Nepal took its first step toward legalising same-sex marriage,\u201d he said.",
    "In May, the supreme court ruled in favour of a same-sex couple who married legally in Germany but struggled to get their union recognised in Nepal. Judges called it a constitutional breach and ordered the government to act.",
