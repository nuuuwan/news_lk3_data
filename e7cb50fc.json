    "Party Leaders today approved a motion to appoint a select committee to ascertain whether the privileges of MPs have been violated by the actions of former members of the Election Commission and to make suitable recommendations.",
    "The Parliament media unit, which quoted Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera said party leaders approved the motion when they met Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene at the chair.",
    "It has also been decided to have a debate on the matter later in the day.",
    "The motion was initially handed over to the speaker by 14 members of Parliament on the pretext that the former members of the Elections Commission, N. G. Punchihewa, S. B. Divaratne, N. M. Mohammed, K. K. P Pathirana and P. S. M. Charles are accountable to the House as per provisions of article 104 B (3) of the constitution and that they have exercised their duties as interim members as per article 30 (4) of the 21st amendment to the constitution.",
    "It was reported that the main opposition party, the SJB has objected to the setting up of the committee, arguing that no one can interfere with the independent commissions. Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said his party opposed the move. (Yohan Perera)"
