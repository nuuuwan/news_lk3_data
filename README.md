### Sri Lanka to wrap up bond talks soon, seek to balance India and China ties

Sri Lanka will wrap up talks with international bondholders on its restructuring process in a few weeks, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on Tuesday, a major step for the island nation to emerge from its worst financial crisis in decades.

“Hopefully within a couple of weeks,” Sabry said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference in Singapore, when asked when the nation’s bond restructuring efforts with creditors will be finished.

“Towards the end of this month, officially, we are done and dusted with the restructuring process, then of course, in line with that, we need to start payment,” he said.

### Many Facets Of Madam Blavatsky: A Mystic? A Spy Or A Fraud?

*2024-07-08 17:21:37* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/many-facets-of-madam-blavatsky-a-mystic-a-spy-or-a-fraud/) · `en`

Madam Blavatsky’s name is not strange for Sri Lankans as one of the early stalwarts to aspire to the Buddhist resurgence in the late 19th century. In the backdrop of British-sponsored Missionary activities, her audacity to stand with the natives in a British colony illustrates her compassion for the Easterners who suffered under foreign subjugation. After the tragic end of the 1883 Kotahena riots, Blavatsky defended the Buddhists, when the colonial government tried to frame them to be the culprits. In an article she authored for “The Theosophist“, Blavatsky argued that the arrogant attitude of the Christian priests and their condescending remarks over Buddhism sparked the riots in 1883 and the following year she accompanied Col. Henry Olcott to London to report the grievances faced by the Sinhalese Buddhists to the Colonial Secretary.

### Appreciation For Lionel Fernando

*2024-07-08 17:10:33* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/appreciation-for-lionel-fernando/) · `en`

Lionel Fernando was more than a public servant; he was a beacon of humanity and national integration in Sri Lanka. As a top official who held numerous positions in public service, local government, and diplomacy, his career was a testament to his dedication to his country and its people. My admiration for Lionel began long before our personal encounters, rooted in his transformative tenure as the first Sinhala Government Agent in Jaffna during the 1970s. His service-oriented approach endeared him to the Tamil communities, illustrating his commitment to bridging ethnic divides and fostering unity.

Emerging from the shadowed theatre, they may step into the brilliance of newfound understanding. This light, a metaphor for the newly acquired wisdom casts brighter hue on the world around them. Anyone who leaves the screening of “Paradise” by Prasanna Vithanage will surely gaze upon the world with fresh, enlightened eyes.

With “Paradise,” Prasanna has transcended the boundaries of national cinema, venturing into transnational and global cinema in terms of themes, production, distribution, and audience reception. He challenges traditional notions of national cinema by emphasizing the fluid and dynamic nature of cultural identities and storytelling across borders. This is an accomplishment worth celebrating.

The island nation has already granted preliminary approval for Starlink to provide satellite-based internet services in the country, following a formal public consultation process. The move came after President Ranil Wickremesinghe met Musk in the sideline the 10th World Water Forum in Indonesia two months ago.

However, Sri Lanka’s TRC law has no provision to grant licence for a third party to operate telecommunication services.

The new amendment that will be presented in the parliament on Tuesday (09) will introduce infrastructure service licence, telecommunication service licence and cable landing station licence, State Technology Minister Kanaka Herath said.

“Starlink comes under the telecommunication service licence,” he told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Monday (08).
