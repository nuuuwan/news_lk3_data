If there is no kitchen, it will not be a perfect home, and how much of a home administration is important in the country's administration. We have seen a number of women in Sri Lankan political history. In that line, Srimao was the Prime Minister and Chandrika decorated the posts of the Prime Minister and the President.

Recently, Harini Amarasuriya was elected Prime Minister. In that order may many more may develop in the opposite period. It must be created by female leadership. I think parliament is the first step for such political female leadership.

So women have to promote in this field. I have entered an early stage of political entry as a contribution to me on that basis. It is in your hands that no longer grow up.

### Trump, Harris notch first statewide wins as polls close in US presidential race

*2024-11-06 08:29:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103194/trump-harris-notch-first-statewide-wins-as-polls-close-in-us-presidential-race) · `en`

Republican Donald Trump won 15 states in Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election while Democrat Kamala Harris captured seven states and Washington, D.C., Edison Research projected, but the contest remained undecided with critical battleground states unlikely to be called for hours or even days.

The early results were as anticipated, with the contest expected to come down to seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Opinion polls showed the rivals neck and neck in all seven going into Election Day.

As of 9:30 p.m. ET (0230 GMT on Wednesday), polls had closed in 41 states and Washington, D.C. Trump had 162 electoral votes to Harris’ 81 electoral votes, but both still had multiple paths to victory. A candidate needs a total of 270 votes in the state-by-state Electoral College to claim the presidency.

Decision Desk HQ projected Trump would win North Carolina, but other media outlets and Edison had yet to call the race.

The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (Drieberg’s Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets – smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

### Rethinking Central Bank independence in Sri Lanka’s development journey

Although an independent CBSL is intended to operate free from political interference, it remains heavily influenced by IMF directives, fostering dependency on IMF guidance

As Sri Lanka prepares for a new government post-14 November, it must carefully evaluate the extent of external influence on its economic policy. A critical question is whether Sri Lanka has already ceded too much control over its monetary and fiscal policy decisions to outside actors. Aligning national development goals of the new government will likely require greater coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, ensuring they operate in tandem to achieve shared objectives. The CBSL should retain the flexibility for strategic interventions that foster growth, development, and social welfare when needed

One of the greatest challenges for commercial leaders is balancing immediate needs with long-term growth strategies

Commercial leaders today are tasked with steering their organisations through increasingly unpredictable markets. Maintaining strategic focus while being agile is crucial for weathering sudden disruptions. Leaders must balance the long-term vision with the need to adapt swiftly to unforeseen challenges, requiring a deep understanding of market factors like consumer behaviour, competitor activity, and regulatory shifts. Regular reassessment of strategic objectives is key, and when market conditions change, quick pivots are critical.

Agility doesn’t mean losing sight of the long-term strategy; it enhances execution by empowering teams to make informed, real-time decisions. Scenario planning is essential for staying aligned with core goals while adjusting to evolving conditions. This blend of focus and agility helps organisations remain proactive and adaptable.

Earlier, the NPP was condemning the state intelligence agencies to get political mileage but now President Anura Kumara’s stance is different.
