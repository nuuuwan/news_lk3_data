    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s imports fell in November 2023 to 1,389 million US dollars from 1,610 million a month earlier amid lower incomes from remittances, official data showed.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s trade deficit also narrowed to 390 million US dollars in November from 683 million US dollars in October.",
    "Sri Lanka has a trade deficit because residents earn large volumes of dollars outside of the merchandise trade account, including through remittances, other services exports and tourism, which when spent triggers imports.",
    "Sri Lanka in November earned 384 million US dollars in remittances, down from 683 million US dollars in October, which will reduce the dollars available for imports.",
    "Earnings from exports, remittances and tourism was 1,741 million US dollars, 390 million US dollars above imports.",
    "The central bank said the value of imports fell as did the value of exports, while volumes were higher.",
    "Global commodity prices are easing as the US Fed tightens monetary policy.",
    "Foreign borrowings and foreign direct investments, invested domestically will also trigger imports.",
    "Sri Lanka has generally been repaying debt and private banks have also build up dollar balances as the central bank repaid dollar debt in rupees.",
    "Any external payments through the financial account will reduce the money available to spend and will cut imports.",
    "Sri Lanka has been largely repaying debt, which tends to reduce domestic investments and imports. If money is printed, the ability to repay foreign debt is lost.",
    "If money is printed by the central bank to cut rates, the liquidity will also trigger imports, and also pressure the exchange rate through forex shortages, if the currency is defended against the newly minted cash.",
    "The central bank has been operating largely deflationary open market operations allowing foreign reserves to be built or the central bank to settle its own debt. (Colombo/Dec31/2023)"
