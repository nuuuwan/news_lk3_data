    "A refreshing 31,557,600 seconds in 2025 are with us. The sparkling spirit of a new year invites us not only to have brand new thoughts but to convert them into grand actions. As usual, people tend to have New Year resolutions. My suggestion is to go beyond scant resolutions, to have specific reinforcements. As an appetiser for a productive new year, I would like to share twenty five thoughts for 2025 as essentials for excellence, especially with the Sri Lankan managers in mind.",
    "We all complain about lack of time. Even though there are seminars, workshops, trainings, and lectures on \u201ctime management,\u201d we really cannot manage time. It is finite and fixed. Instead, what we can do is to \u201cmanage ourselves\u201d in getting the best out of the given limited time. Only way to do that is to be efficient in our tasks. It involves minimising the wastages, reducing the defects, curtailing the deviations etc. Let us be efficient in the year 2025.",
    "Being efficient is not enough. We can efficiently climb a ladder placed against the wrong wall. Effectiveness is results related. It deals with the outputs and the outcomes. That is where we need to begin with the end in mind. The mistake we make sometimes is trying to be super-duper efficient, losing track of the larger goal. Let us be effective in the year 2025.",
    "As we know, empathy is getting into other\u2019s shoes and walking like them. In other words, it means having the ability to look at a problem or an issue from the other\u2019s frame of view. Sri Lankan managers and administrators can improve vastly on this. Rather than jumping to conclusions merely looking at one side of the story, a mature broad approach of being empathic is required. Let us be empathic in the year 2025.",
    "We need to be \u201ccorporate athletes\u201d in maintaining healthy mind-body balance. Energy flows out not by consuming more \u201cenergy drinks\u201d but committing to exercise regularly. Unfortunately, we see quite the contrary in the corporate world, where most of the things are remote-controlled. Finding quality time for physical exercises on a regular basis will be one sure cure for physical inactivity. Having a healthy dietary pattern, in opting to be fit than fat, is another vital need. Let us be energetic in the year 2025.",
    "Happy employees are productive employees. That is what the research says. Interestingly, that is why some enthusiastic enterprises have resorted to measure \u201claughs per hour.\u201d There are ground realities one cannot ignore. Either one has to find the work he/she loves to do or love the work he/she has to do. Having a positive approach to work is an absolute must. As Theodore Roosevelt said, \u201cdo what you can, with what you have, wherever you are.\u201d Let us be enthusiastic in the year 2025.",
    "\u201cDare to dream, dare to act, dare to fail, dare to succeed.\u201d So goes an old saying. Everything begins with envisioning. As Walt Disney said, if you can dream it, you can deliver it. Unfortunately, we see more \u201cday dreams\u201d in Sri Lankan workplaces, especially after lunch. The need for the hour is to be more growth-oriented in terms of working towards long term goals. Let us envision more in the year 2025.",
    "We need to enhance our knowledge and skills. With the internet as a vast ocean of knowledge offering a variety of informal learning approaches, learning has become a part and parcel of our lives. Unfortunately, we visit internet to find \u201cfigures\u201d instead of \u201cfacts and figures.\u201d Sharpening ourselves with cutting-edge knowledge is an absolute must in facing competition. As Socrates said a long time ago, we learn from \u201cthe womb to the tomb.\u201d Let us enhance ourselves in the year 2025.",
    "Employee engagement has already become a buzz word in the business circles. It captures the essence of employees\u2019 head, hands, and heart involvement in work. In brief, it captures affective (feeling), cognitive (thinking) and behavioural (acting) dimensions of an employee. We need to engage more in order to excel. Let us engage more in the year 2025.",
    "This is essentially about being creative, in thinking \u201cout of the box.\u201d It reminds me of what our veteran writer Kumaratunga Munidasa said a long time ago. \u201cA nation without innovation will not prosper, but will lie lamenting, being unable to beg.\u201d Innovation has paved the way for many a country to succeed in becoming globally competitive. Where are we with regard to innovation? How many new patents Sri Lankans register annually? Nanotechnology and Biotechnology can be sited as promising areas where innovation has begun to yield dividends. Let us explore in the year 2025.",
    "As Lao Tsu said a long time ago, great leaders are \u201cleader breeders.\u201d Such a transformation can only be possible through empowerment. It involves, on the one hand, delegation, assigning tasks to others to handle, whilst being accountable. On the other hand, it involves development. The fundamental mistake we make is to simply delegate tasks without developing the team. Let us empower in the year 2025.",
    "This is all about continuation. We start things with a big bang and discontinue half-way through. Sustainability has become a critical factor in the midst of business failures. Chaotic weather patterns across the globe are a grim reminder that eco-friendly practices of work need a lot more attention. What matters is not only profits and people, but the planet as well with an overarching purpose. Let us endure in the year 2025.",
    "In a rapidly changing well-connected world, we need to embrace best practices, and perhaps the \u201cnext\u201d practices. Take recruitment for example. Rather than having an interview by a panel of senior members who have no idea about what real interviewing is all about, the time has come to move towards professionalism. There are new techniques to conduct behavioural interviews. Required competencies to a job against actual competencies of a candidate can be accessed through a well-designed assessment centre. The starting point is to acknowledge the need to change in appropriately adapting the new practices. Let us embrace more in 2025.",
    "It is a broad term capturing the physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual facets of life. We need enrichment in a balanced manner on all above fronts. Sadly, but surely, what we see in the world is quite the contrary. There is an imbalance with the mad rush for material acquisition. As I saw in a poster somewhere, \u201cwe gain wealth by sacrificing our health and we regain health by spending our wealth.\u201d Let us enrich more in 2025.",
    "It refers to getting involved totally, with complete participation. It differs from engagement to the extent where you need to be holistic and be willing to capture the fullness of a situation. Half-hearted, half-baked approaches with shabbily completing tasks are quite opposites. The eastern term, mindfulness aptly captures what you need to do fully in living in the moment. Let us engross more in meaningful activities in 2025.",
    "When Nelson Mandela was released from 27 years of rigorous imprisonment, the first thing he did was to forgive his enemies. Then he said, \u201cReconciliation begins now.\u201d It invites us to forgive and forget. In brief, it refers to the erasing of negative memories. The sooner we erase the negative memories, yet retaining the lessons learnt, the better it is for us to experience inner freedom. Let us erase the past negativities in 2025.",
    "We need to continuously elevate our standards in order to stay competitive. It is voluntarily raising the bar. \u201cKaisen\u201d invites us to continuously improve in challenging our past performance and raising the targets for future performance. As the famous quote goes, \u201cAim for the sky and you\u2019ll reach the ceiling; Aim for the ceiling and you\u2019ll stay on the floor.\u201d Let us elevate ourselves in 2025.",
    "This is comparatively a subtle aspect. It deals with practicing values. The numerous stories we heard ranging from global credit crunch to Golden Key chaos, call for the need of ethicality. It is not achieving short-term gains \u201ceither by hook or by crook\u201d but something much deeper, grounded on solid principles. Ethics is difficult to define in a precise way. In a general sense, ethics is the code of moral principles and values that governs the behavours of a person or a group with respect to what is right or what is wrong. \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u201d says the golden rule of ethics. Let us emancipate in 2025.",
    "This is the logical extension of emancipation. You radiate \u201cpositive energy\u201d to energise and engage others. Leaders should enthrall their team members towards a clear purpose so that they become committed collaborators. It is the capacity to persuade others for a worthy cause. Let us immensely enthrall in 2025.",
    "There is a growing optimism about a better political culture with higher accountability at all levels, in moving beyond conventional power boundaries. Engulfing involves complete covering of something or someone. Integrity should engulf Sri Lankan institutions where corruption has been rampant, with a clean slate of transparency through professionalism. Let us positively engulf ourselves in 2025.",
    "I thought this is something we need especially in battling with multiple crises. Having positive vibrations of resilience is required at all fronts. It is to show the positive and constructive response with confidence to a challenging economic reality. It is also responding to VUCA 1.0 reality (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) with VUCA 2.0 (Vision, Understanding, Confidence and Agility). Let us exclaim our resilience, recovery, and revival in 2025.",
    "The world has shifted from VUCA to BANI as Jamais Cascio, an American anthropologist presented. Living in a world with BANI 1.0 illusions, (Brittle, Anxious, No-linear and Incomprehensible) we need BANI 2.0 ignitions (Bold, Assertive, Neutral, and Innovative) by individuals and institutions alike. Let us have such an endeavour in 2025.",
    "We need to exalt our mother Lanka. As an island of ingenuity, it is abundant with natural beauty and nurtured brains. With bright leadership, it can be brilliantly positioned. Let us exalt our beloved Sri Lanka through our words and deeds in 2025.",
    "\u201cThe secret of life is enjoying the passage of time\u201d, so said James Taylor. It may be a blissful road or a bumpy ride. The mindset of accepting reality as it is in facing life\u2019s challenges with confidence will enable us to enjoy life more. It is a choice in front of us to live one day at a time. We need to dream as if we will live for hundred years but need to live as if today is our last day. Let us enjoy the \u201croller coaster ride\u201d ahead of us in 2025.",
    "This is where \u201cpracticing what you preach\u201d and \u201cwalking the talk\u201d matter most. The whole nation awaits a new political culture where the leaders set themselves as an example of simplicity, transparency and integrity. When it happens, the standards become high for leaders at all levels. Rather than cursing the darkness of the absence of it, we need to light a candle in practicing our values in producing value. Let us exemplify ourselves in 2025.",
    "This is the culmination of all above Es. Excellence is all about being exceptionally good. When applied to enterprises, it involves exceptional achievements in a consistent manner. \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do; Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.\u201d So said Aristotle a long time ago, which has much relevance for today and tomorrow.",
    "The dawn of 2025 offers us another opportunity to have a fresh look at our lives. Embracing the twenty five thoughts for a terrific \u201ctwenty-twenty five\u201d will ensure the exceeding of expectations with excellence as essence. May 2025 will be a year of excellence for you, as an individual, as an interactive team member, as an institutional employee, all above as an integral player in an island of ingenuity. Let us excel in 2025.",
