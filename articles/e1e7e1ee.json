    "\u201cWe have around 30 ships that are still fighting their way away from the military vessels of the occupation forces trying to reach to the shores of Gaza. They are determined. They are motivated, and they are doing everything within their hand to be able to break this [siege] by early morning and to arrive together,\u201d he said.",

    "\u201cBy blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world. The flotilla embodied solidarity, compassion and the hope of relief for those under blockade,\u201d the Malaysian leader said on X.",

    "The interception of the flotilla and arrest of activists show that Israeli forces target \u201ceveryone who struggles against the oppression imposed by Israel\u201d, the ministry said.",
