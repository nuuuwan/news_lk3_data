    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe (centre), UNP General Secretray Palitha Range Bandara and\u00a0 UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena greet crowds at an election rally",
    "When some UNP seniors and party office-bearers met to discuss the situation\u00a0 Range Bandara in his capacity as Gen Secy was also present. Some of those present began to criticise Range and blame him\u00a0 for bringing the Government into disrepute. Ranil Wickremesinghe however intervened\u00a0 and put a stop to \u201cBandara baiting\u201d",
    "Even though Range Bandara\u2019s proposal was his personal point of view and only a suggestion, it was not perceived as such. Sections of the media and social media along with Opposition political parties treated it as an official Government announcement",
    "The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country\u2019s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis",
    "The Range Bandara proposal provided further ammunition to those critics\u00a0 of Ranil who opined that he would not hold a presidential election",
    "Many in the media expected an official statement to be issued by the Government distancing itself from Range Bandara\u2019s views",
    "Range Bandara had discussed\u00a0 his fears and concerns with Ranil\u00a0 Wickremesinghe and proposed that the elections be postponed and the\u00a0 presidential and Parliamentary terms be extended by two years at least.\u00a0 Ranil had responded by saying that he was committed to a presidential\u00a0 election followed by a Parliamentary poll",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s political stage was enlivened last week by the solo performance of United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara. Addressing a media briefing on May 28, the policeman-turned-politician came out with a suggestion that the presidential election due this year and the Parliamentary election scheduled for next year should be postponed while the terms of office for both should be extended by two more years. The former Puttalam district and ex-state minister wanted a resolution passed by Parliament to that effect and ratified by the people at a referendum.",
    "The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country\u2019s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis. Considerable progress has been achieved by the Wickremesinghe Government to remedy the situation. A degree of economic stability has been established but more time is needed to ensure greater economic stability.",
    "Presidential elections are due this year and parliamentary polls next year. These elections along with the election campaigns could affect the current momentum of economic recovery. The steady progress of economic growth could be disrupted. As such both elections should be postponed so as to continue with the journey towards greater economic stability and growth.",
    "The current terms of office of the President and Parliament should be extended by two more years for both. A proposal to this effect should be presented in Parliament as a resolution and passed by all political parties together and followed up by a referendum to get the people\u2019s support and endorsement.\u00a0 Thus the president and Government could continue unfettered for two more years and\u00a0 achieve economic stability for Sri Lanka.",
    "The above in essence was Range Bandara\u2019s suggestion as revealed to the media. Whatever the merits or otherwise of the proposal, it was obvious from the start that Palitha\u2019s project was a non-starter. In the first place, it was unclear as to whether\u00a0 he envisaged postponements and extensions of the terms of office were constitutionally feasible. Even if it were so, gaining two-thirds support in Parliament was hardly possible. Furthermore obtaining the people\u2019s endorsement at a referendum was virtually impossible.",
    "Range Bandara\u2019s suggestion was nothing new. The UNP Chairman and sole National List MP\u00a0 Vajira Abeywardena has been saying frequently that all political parties should get together and enable President Wickremesinghe to stay in power longer so that he could lead the country on the road to economic recovery. However, when the UNP Gen Secy stated the same sentiments in a more crystallised form, it was viewed differently and more definitively.",
    "Even though Range Bandara\u2019s proposal was his personal point of view and only a suggestion, it was not perceived as such. Sections of the media and social media along with Opposition political parties treated it as an official Government announcement.",
    "Moreover it was regarded or depicted as a concrete proposal of the UNP and not as an idea being floated by the party general secretary on his initiative.",
    "Furthermore the authenticity of\u00a0 Range Bandara\u2019s\u00a0 proposal was seriously doubted. It was seen as having emanated from President and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. Just as SLPP Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam\u2019s pronouncements and statements are laid at the door of Basil Rajapaksa, Range Bandara was suspected of being a mouthpiece for Ranil Wickremesinghe.The irrepressible leader of the TPA, Mano Ganesan stated openly that\u00a0 Range Bandara was \u2018his master\u2019s voice\u201d and that the \u201cmaster\u201d was none other than the president himself. The general impression was that Wickremesinghe after confirming earlier that the presidential poll will be held was now trying to scuttle it through the party secretary.",
    "So it was open season on Range Bandara and by extension Ranil Wickremesinghe.\u00a0 Various political parties opened fire. As was to be expected, there was strong criticism of\u00a0 Range Bandara\u2019s proposal. Vehement opposition to the proposal was expressed by many. Some even threatened to take to the streets and revive the \u201cAragalaya\u201d protests if the Government went ahead\u00a0 with the proposal. Few bothered to note that\u00a0 neither the President nor the Government had endorsed or approved Range Bandara\u2019s proposal openly or officially.",
    "A contributory factor to this state of affairs was the approach of Ranil Wickremesinghe himself. Everyone knew he was contesting the presidential elections and that an electoral campaign in his support was on. Yet Wickremesinghe had not officially announced that he was going to contest. When asked at media briefings he would evade giving a direct reply. Ranil would talk about the economy and avoid talking about elections.",
    "This\u00a0 seeming reluctance on the part of Ranil has enabled his opponents to attack him on two points. One was to allege that Ranil was afraid to face elections because he would lose and therefore will not contest polls. The other was to accuse Wickremesinghe of conspiring to put off the presidential elections and remain in power\u00a0 as president\u00a0 \u201cby hook or by crook\u201d.",
    "The Range Bandara proposal provided further ammunition to those critics of Ranil who opined that he would not hold a presidential election. Wickremesinghe was now attacked as plotting to avoid a presidential poll he was sure to lose by extending the presidential term through a referendum. What many of those subscribing to this allegation failed to take note of was the inherent contradiction in the charge. If Ranil was going to lose at a presidential poll then how could he win a referendum? If on the other hand Ranil could win a referendum then why can\u2019t he win a presidential election?",
    "While the Opposition parties were having a field day lambasting Range and Ranil on the one hand and re-iterating their commitment to electoral democracy on the other, the UNP itself was in an unenviable situation. Many in the party were themselves surprised by the proposal of the party general secretary. Some engaged in damage control.",
    "Chief among them was former Cabinet minister Ravi Karunanayake. It is an open secret in UNP circles that Ravi has been eyeing the Gen Secy post held by Range for long.\u00a0 \u201cIt was nothing but a personal statement by Range Bandara. This is not the decision of the President,\u201d Ravi Karunanayake told the \u201cDaily Mirror.\u201d Karunanayake asserted that the presidential election would be held as scheduled in October, followed by the general election.",
    "Many in the media expected an official statement to be issued by the Government distancing itself from Range Bandara\u2019s views. A press release from the President\u2019s media division was eagerly awaited. However in an unexpected twist, the official\u00a0 communique\u00a0 dated May 29th was issued by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena\u2019s media division. Here are a few\u00a0 relevant excerpts \u2013",
    "\u201cPrime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena emphatically said that the Presidential Election will be held this year in accordance with the constitutional provisions as already announced by the Elections Commission. He pointed out that the Election Commission has already made an announcement that the Presidential Election would be held between September 15 and October 17 this year.\u201d",
    "\u201cSpeaking to journalists after attending the inauguration of Martin Wickramasinghe\u2019s Life and Literature Section at the National Libraries Board in Colombo on May 29, he dismissed the suggestions about the postponement of the Presidential elections and General elections. The Prime Minister said it was wrong to make proposals that have not been discussed by the government or the ruling alliance at any time.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe government\u2019s stand on the election has already been announced. The Election Commission declared that the presidential election will be held in accordance with the provisions in the constitution. They have announced that it will be scheduled between the months of September and October. The government\u2019s stand on the election has already been announced, the Prime Minister said.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Prime Minister stated that after the presidential election, it will be the general election. He added that attention has been paid on holding provincial council and local government elections on the same day. \u201cSome people declare various things without responsibility. I am telling the countrymen that a democratic government or parliament will not allow the government to make sudden announcements about something that has not been discussed in any situation and to create unrest in the country irresponsibly,\u201d he said.\u201d",
    "In view of what had happened, there was a general expectation that the Wickremesinghe Governmentt would disassociate itself from Palitha Range Bandara. That has not happened. He was neither abandoned nor thrown to the wolves. Instead Range Bandara has proclaimed\u00a0 that he would convene a press conference on\u00a0 June 3rd and explain in detail the reasons behind his proposal. He is also scheduled to appear in several TV shows next week.",
    "When some UNP seniors and party office-bearers met to discuss the situation\u00a0 Range Bandara in his capacity as Gen Secy was also present. Some of those present began to criticise Range and blame him\u00a0 for bringing the Government into disrepute. Ranil Wickremesinghe however intervened\u00a0 and put a stop to \u201cBandara baiting\u201d. He said that the UNP Gen Secy had merely expressed his thoughts on the matter and made some suggestions personally. He (Range) had not stated those views were those of the Government or party. Therefore Range Bandara was entitled to his own opinion and none should criticize him stated Wickremesinghe.",
    "I was unable to\u00a0 speak directly with Palitha Range Bandara on this matter but was able to\u00a0 communicate with informed sources close to the UNP Gen Secy. According to these circles Range Bandara had been extremely worried that conducting the presidential and Parliament elections,one after the other, would take up too much time and\u00a0 transform the prevailing situation. \u201cElection fever\u201d would disrupt the current course of life for many weeks and even months. As such the on-going journey towards economic emancipation would be affected.",
    "Range Bandara had discussed\u00a0 his fears and concerns with Ranil Wickremesinghe and proposed that the elections be postponed and the presidential and Parliamentary terms be extended by two years at least. Ranil had responded by saying that he was committed to a presidential election followed by a Parliamentary poll. However Range Bandara could make his ideas on the matter public if he so desired. Stating your thoughts publicly\u00a0 would be a way to test political and public opinion on this issue , pointed out Ranil. The choice was left to Range.",
    "Hence Range Bandara had gone ahead and articulated his ideas openly. Even though Political party leaders and sections of the media have been critical, a few MPs are said to have quietly supported Range Bandara on this issue. Former Supreme Court Judge and Jaffna district Parliamentarian CV Wigneswaran has openly welcomed the suggestion made by Palitha.",
    "Notwithstanding the support in certain quarters for postponement of elections and extension of electoral terms, the people on the whole would be against the idea. If there are attempts to implement these ideas, the emergence of spontaneous mass protests cannot be ruled out. Besides in fairness to President Wickremesinghe, he too is keen on contesting and winning the presidential poll. In the final analysis, Range Bandara\u2019s \u201cloud thinking\u201d has proved that the Presidential election cannot be postponed.",
    "At the same time this distracting exercise has to some extent damaged Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s election campaign in the short term. Ranil\u2019s image has been somewhat tarnished and\u00a0 campaign dented at least\u00a0 for now. Also the plan to deplete the SJB of MPs through the campaign code named \u201cOperation Sajaba\u201d will be affected. MPs planning to cross over may have second thoughts now.",
    "However, this temporary setback can be\u00a0 overcome with the passage of time. Once it becomes obvious that Ranil has no intention of postponing elections and poll dates are announced the climate would change. Once Wickremesinghe\u2019s\u00a0 official election campaign\u00a0 gets underway in a big way the dynamics of electioneering would have a transforming effect. The Range Bandara affair would pale into insignificance.",
    "The\u00a0 loud thinking of Range Bandara about elections affecting the country\u2019s economic recovery are quite valid. The best way to address them is not to\u00a0 postpone polls but to ensure that the poll is won. What the supporters and allies of Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 could and should do is to conduct a\u00a0 powerful election campaign that would\u00a0 result in the incumbent president successfully tasting the fruits of victory."
