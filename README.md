### North, East and West: Navigating  Sri Lanka’s compass in new world order

*2025-09-16 02:46:46* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/North-East-and-West-Navigating-Sri-Lanka-s-compass-in-new-world-order/4-781707) · `en`

The IMF senior mission chief Peter Breuer, presenting the approval of the third review of Sri Lanka’s $ 2.9 b bailout (Source: Al Jazeera)

When the National People’s Power (NPP) Government assumed office in September 2024, it inherited more than a fragile economy and the hopes of a disillusioned citizenry. It also assumed responsibility for steering Sri Lanka through arguably the most significant moment of international recalibration since the end of the Cold War. The global order is shifting once again, with China and Russia presenting themselves as alternatives to Western dominance, and smaller states forced to reposition themselves in ways that are both delicate and strategic.

Signals of a profound reordering of the international system have been apparent for some time. Early indications of this impending shift can be, perhaps, traced to the rise of far-right nationalism and systemic dissatisfaction that emerged in many parts of the world over the past decade.

### Budget 2026 imperative: Making housing affordable through tax reform

*2025-09-16 02:36:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Budget-2026-imperative-Making-housing-affordable-through-tax-reform/4-781705) · `en`

By incentivising private homeownership through tax relief, the burden shifts from public provision to empowered individual ownership

Housing is a fundamental human need. Yet, for many Sri Lankans, the dream of owning a home remains elusive due to rising property prices, volatility of interest rates, and limited access to affordable financing. In this context, it is both timely and necessary for the Government of Sri Lanka to reintroduce housing loan interest as a qualifying payment relief under personal income tax—reviving a policy that once existed in the Sri Lankan income tax Law.

### M.H.M. Ashraff PC: Power of  education to transform communities

*2025-09-16 02:27:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/M-H-M-Ashraff-PC-Power-of-education-to-transform-communities/14-781704) · `en`

When history remembers leaders, it often lists their victories, their alliances, or their parliamentary debates. But the truest measure of a leader lies in the legacy that endures long after their voice has fallen silent. On 16 September 2025, the day which marks the 25th anniversary of the passing of M.H.M. Ashraff PC, that is the very question that begs a response.

For Ashraff, his enduring legacy was neither in the party he founded nor the speeches he delivered. Rather, it was in the institutions he envisioned and enabled, the most notable of such achievements being the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka (SEUSL). Education was, for him, more than a policy matter. It was the foundation of empowerment, the key to dignity, and the one tool capable of transforming the lives of entire communities. In establishing the SEUSL at Oluvil, he did not merely create a campus. He opened a doorway for thousands who had, until then, been denied access to opportunity.

The National Shoora Council (NSC) yesterday urged UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to facilitate the grant of full membership in the UN to Palestine and to suspend Israel from the UN until Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is surrendered to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in pursuance of the international

warrant issued by the ICC for the arrest of Israel’s PM. The following is the text of the letter dated 14 September 2025 addressed to the SG of the UN.

“We believe that by now, you are well aware of the despicable chain of unpardonable crimes being committed, for well over a hundred years, by the Zionist regime to destroy Palestine and its multi-religious people! What must have become more clear is that the ongoing cruel facets of genocide of the Palestinians are aimed at establishing a territorially expanding nuclear armed Zionist ethno-religious European colonial power in the Middle East.

### AI fundamentals: Demystifying technology that’s reshaping our world

*2025-09-16 02:18:45* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AI-fundamentals-Demystifying-technology-that-s-reshaping-our-world/4-781702) · `en`

AI won’t replace people. People who understand AI will replace people who don’t

Following my previous articles, many readers reached out with a specific request: explain AI and its impact in language everyone can understand. While AI has sparked widespread interest, the lack of accessible explanations has kept it in the ‘too complex to approach’ category for many, even among executives at major corporations. There’s no shame in acknowledging knowledge gaps; we’re not expected to master every emerging technology overnight. However, staying current with transformational forces isn’t optional in today’s business environment. This article addresses those requests by covering the fundamentals of AI, providing clarity on what it is, how it’s already reshaping our lives, and the vast opportunities it creates for those willing to engage with it.

China firmly opposes a U.S. demand that Group of Seven (G7) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries impose tariffs of 50 to 100 percent on China due to the country’s purchase of Russian oil, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said Monday.

In response to a media query, the spokesperson said China has always opposed trade and economic restrictions against China under the pretext of so-called “Russia-related” issues.

The U.S. attempt to coerce relevant parties into imposing “secondary tariffs” on China over its purchase of Russian oil is a typical act of unilateral bullying and economic coercion, the spokesperson noted.

Such a move seriously violates the consensus reached during a phone call between the two heads of state and could severely impact global trade and disrupt the stability of industrial and supply chains, the spokesperson added.

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has raised its world growth forecasts for the year since the June Global Economic Outlook (GEO) on better-than-expected incoming data for 2Q25, but expects world GDP to slow significantly this year, it said.

“There is now evidence of an underlying US slowdown in ‘hard’ economic data and positive surprises on eurozone growth have partly reflected US tariff front-running,” the ratings agency said.

Global growth is now forecast to be 2.4 percent in 2025, Fitch said.

This is up 0.2pp since June, but is a ‘sizeable’ slowdown from 2.9 percent last year and below trend.

China’s forecast has been raised to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent, the eurozone’s to 1.1 percent from 0.8 percent and the US’s to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent.

“There has been a reduction in uncertainty over US tariff policy after a flurry of announcements.
