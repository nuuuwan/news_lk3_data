  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Republicans, not satisfied with their recent electoral triumph, continue to vilify President Biden for the pardon of his son, Hunter. Wresting power from the Democrats has not satisfied their blood-lust; they now seek to disgrace Biden, dishonor him and destroy the legacy of one of the most decent and selfless presidents in history, with a first-term record second to none.",
    "A legacy of achievements, the results of which have only now begun to show in what is today the strongest economy in the world. An economy created of bipartisan legislative miracles which will endure for decades to come. Which the contemptible Trump will claim he personally built, on the first day of his office, in January 2025. Just as he claimed he built the booming economy he inherited from President Obama in 2017, only to criminally mismanage it to recession by the end of his first term.",
    "As he will in his second term. Trump is already admitting that he was lying when he promised to reduce grocery prices and inflation. Does anyone doubt that his other pie-in-the-sky campaign promises will prove to be similarly false? Remember the border wall to be paid by Mexico? Not all of us suffer from amnesia.",
    "I recently read about a similar repulsive act of political abuse committed by Republican politicians 70 years ago, to destroy the reputation and, in this case, ultimately cause the suicide of, another fine man, using the most potent weapon in the world \u2013 the love of a father for his son. Purely to destroy his reputation and gain political power.",
    "In the 1940s, the general public was becoming more aware of homosexuality, especially after Alfred Kynsey\u2019s bestseller on Sexual Behavior in the Human Male drew attention to the fact that same-sex experiences were not just common, but normal. Homosexuality, even same-sex marriages, are now legal in most intellectually enlightened countries. Though it continues to be treated with contempt, as a perversion (\u201cabomination\u201d) in some, usually religious, sectors in many of these developed nations, including the USA.",
    "Of course, there are primitive countries even today where homosexuality is a crime, liable for punishments up to and including the death penalty. Sri Lanka technically falls into this category of primitive nations. Strictly according to the Sri Lanka Penal Code of 1883, same-sex sexual activity is prohibited, and carries a maximum penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine. Fortunately, these laws are more honored in the breach; otherwise many of our eminent politicians would have been behind bars, along with their cronies and security personnel. Of course, they would have been granted shared cells, where they would have been able to continue to get their jollies at government expense.",
    "In the days of the \u201cRed Scare\u201d in the USA in the 1950s, homosexuality was linked to communism, as, according to now disgraced Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy, \u201chomosexuals had peculiar mental twists\u201d that made them \u201cunsafe risks susceptible to communism\u201d. Ironically, McCarthy was himself a homosexual.",
    "In 1947, the United States Park Police initiated a \u201cSex Perversion Elimination Program\u201d, a sting operation targeting gay men for arrest for homosexual solicitation. Generally, those arrested as a result of this Program, if they had no prior criminal record, were released with a night in jail and a fine.",
    "In June, 1953, a young man, Lester C. (Buddy) Hunt, Jr, was arrested for soliciting sex from an undercover male police officer, in Lafayette Square, Washington D.C. Buddy was the president of the student body at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He had no prior criminal record, so the charges were dismissed with a slap on the wrist.",
    "Buddy Hunt was also the son of Wyoming Democratic Senator, Lester C. Hunt. Hunt had an outstanding career in politics, working in the Wyoming state legislature as secretary of state, the state\u2019s first two-term governor and a most popular Senator from a traditionally Republican state.",
    "More importantly, in 1934, he had shown his love for his son by giving bone grafts to his then six-year-old son, Buddy to treat his bone cysts. A dentist by profession, Hunt had trouble standing by his dental chair after this selfless act of paternal love.",
    "Hunt had made an enemy of Joseph McCarthy, disgusted as he was at McCarthy\u2019s notorious anti-communist campaign and legally questionable tactics. At that time, Democrats held a razor-thin majority in the Senate. One of McCarthy\u2019s Republican allies in the Senate, Idaho Senator Herman Welker, saw an opportunity to eliminate this majority. Welker had Buddy Hunt\u2019s case re-opened, and made sure he was prosecuted. The Republican judge found him guilty of, as he put it, \u201cone of the most heinous crimes a man can commit\u201d. He had obviously not heard of crimes like rape and murder. For this \u201cmost heinous crime\u201d of homosexuality, the politically corrupted judge fined Buddy $100 and dismissed the case.",
    "The Republicans threatened Hunt that they would publicize this incident in the Senate. When Senator Hunt resisted, they threatened to blanket Wyoming with flyers about his son\u2019s homosexuality. Hunt gave in and resigned. The Republicans achieved their goal. They disgraced the reputation of a fine Senator and achieved majority in the Senate, as Wyoming\u2019s Republican Governor Rogers would appoint a Republican to replace Senator Hunt.",
    "The Republicans\u2019 \u201cwitch Hunt\u201d reached its cruel perfection when Senator Hunt committed suicide in his Washington DC office in 1954.",
    "70 Years later, we are now in the Trump era. Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. He immediately showed his love for his children in more substantial ways, which brought him only praise and devotion in Republican eyes.",
    "Trump dearly loves his daughter, Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump loved them so much that he gave them senior posts in the White House during his first presidential term; Ivanka as Senior Advisor and Director of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship (Ivanka had vast experience as a ladies\u2019 handbag saleswoman); and Jared, a real estate developer facing bankruptcy, as Senior White House Consultant, with the responsibility, inter alia, of Bringing Peace to the Middle East. He even loved Jared\u2019s father, Charles, so much that he pardoned him for crimes of tax evasion, witness intimidation and illegal campaign contributions, for which he had spent two years in prison.",
    "One of Trump\u2019s first acts as President-elect last month was to nominate this distinguished ex-con, Charles Kushner as the Ambassador of the United States to France. Trump\u2019s love for his children knows no bounds. Last Thursday, he announced the appointment of Fox News hostess and his son Don Jr\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, Kimberly Guilfoyle, as the US Ambassador to Greece.",
    "Trump also intends to pardon, \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of assuming power on January 20, 2025, the \u201cpatriots\u201d who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, as he loves them like his own children! His message to his supporters: \u201cIf you commit acts of violence on my behalf in the future, I will pardon you\u201d. A chilling precedent for all future presidents.",
    "Pardons, ambassadorships will be available, along with Trump Bibles, guitars, wristwatches, sneakers, even the latest Trump \u201cFight, Fight, Fight\u201d fragrance, a haunting aroma of blood, sweat and perfidy, at bargain-basement prices at the White House Gift Shop from January 21, 2025.",
    "Now the Republicans, even some Sri Trumpians, are up in their incredibly hypocritical arms about President Biden issuing a \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d for his son. Hunter had earlier been convicted of felony charges of tax evasion and gun related charge while he was a drug addict, crimes committed in 2018. The back taxes have been completely settled, the weapon was never used in the commission of a crime and Hunter has been sober for over five years.",
    "Biden had indeed lied at a time when justice was being administered constitutionally. However, justice will take a different guise when the Trump administration takes control. Instead of being released with a slap on the wrist, the regular punishment for these types of crimes, Hunter will be facing the maximum sentence of 17 years\u2019 imprisonment under the Justice Department to be headed by Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s nominees for Attorney General and Director, FBI, respectively, who have both vowed to pursue diligently Trump\u2019s threats of retribution.",
    "Extracts from President Biden\u2019s December 1 statement explains his reason for this rare instance of being forced to deviate from the truth:",
    "\u201cToday, I signed a pardon for my son, Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision making, and I kept my word even as I watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. \u2026People brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form\u2026.or were late for paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions.",
    "\u201cNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong\u2026.In trying to break Hunter, they are trying to break me \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.",
    "\u201cFor my entire career, I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They\u2019ll be fair-minded. And here\u2019s the truth. I believe in the justice system\u2026I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\u2026.I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision\u201d.",
    "There is another currently ongoing instance of love, this time the love of a mother for her son, which will surely bring tears to your eyes.",
    "Pete Hegseth is Trump\u2019s choice for one of the top jobs in his cabinet. The Defense Secretary is not just the head of the largest bureaucracy, probably in the world, with nearly three million employees worldwide and an annual budget of $850 billion. The Defense Secretary is also the key link between the presidency and the uniformed military, including the nuclear chain of command.",
    "Hegseth, 44, a war veteran of two tours in Cuba and Iraq, had led a platoon of 35 soldiers in Iraq. He is currently a weekend television presenter with Fox News, and has no administrative experience whatsoever. An alcoholic with a police record of numerous drunken sexual assaults, he recently had an intervention with his employer, Fox News, for being drunk on his program \u2013 which starts at 6 a.m. Hegseth flaunts a white supremacist tattoo, considers war crimes such as torture, including waterboarding, justified under certain circumstances, and believes that women have no role to play in military combat. Hegseth has vowed to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to win this coveted job, so long as he enjoys Trump\u2019s confidence.",
    "When his mommy, Penelope Hegseth, heard of her darling son\u2019s nomination to one of the most powerful jobs in the nation, she sprang to his aid with an outpouring of love, rivaling that of legendary Sojourner Truth, the first African-American mother to fight for, and win, her son\u2019s freedom from slavery; the first time an African-American prevailed in court against a white man. Penelope prays her maternal love will similarly have her totally unqualified, misogynistic, racist, alcoholic, sexual predator son confirmed to one of the most powerful, complex jobs in the world.",
    "Mommy went on Fox TV, pleading that her son was a \u201cchanged man\u201d; she called Senators, begging for their confirmation. She responded in the negative to a question from a Senator if a breathalyzer test would be required at the entrance to the White House Situation Room, insisting that her darling Pete had undergone a recent epiphany and has promised not to touch alcohol, if he gets the job. In any event, she vowed she that will be right there by his side to help him with the nuclear football, the briefcase which has the launch codes for nuclear weapons, if he ever fell off the wagon.",
    "Although there have been whispers of dissonance among some Republican Senators, chances are they will all fall in line with Trump\u2019s choices. In the end, few, if any of them will dare go against the Fuhrer.",
    "Every one of Trump\u2019s terrifyingly controversial and unqualified cabinet nominations is a test. A test to ensure that every single Republican member of the House, every single Republican Senator bends to his will with unquestioning fealty. A test that establishes his dominance over his party, arming him with the absolute power to carry out his stated dictatorial policies without any of the guard rails provided in the constitution. From the first day of his presidency.",
