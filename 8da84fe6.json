  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s 2024 budget which did not contain the usual plethora of secretly hatched \u2018black box\u2019 taxes, also did not have a retrospective or \u2018revenge tax\u2019 on bonds to undermine rule of law as called for by some interventionists.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself told parliament that a new tax was being contemplated on bond buyers who prevented a freeze of a g-sec market like in Ghana, helping reduce money printing, though at high rates, since a deliberate default on rupee bonds was feared.",
    "\u201cAny tax measure of that nature would have to be retrospective in basis,\u201d Advisor to the Finance Ministry Deshal de Mel told a post-budget seminar organized by the central bank.",
    "\u201cWe have to make a change to the taxability of an instrument that at the time of transaction was a different tax regime.",
    "\u201cOur track record in terms of retrospective taxes has not been ideal. We have the surcharge on corporate income tax from 2022, and then before that you had the super gains tax.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka imposed several revenge or punitive taxes in a 2015 budget called a \u2018super gains tax\u2019 supposedly on \u2018ill gotten gains\u2019 and followed up with a similar one later, despite the country trying to attract private investment.",
    "In 2023 several urban intellectuals called for a \u2018revenge tax\u2019 on primary dealers and other bond buyers who stood to make large profits later, from buying bonds at high yields in an uncertain environment.",
    "Some critics say the call for revenge taxes on bond buyers show that Sri Lanka\u2019s post-independence decline, lack of policy stability, nationalism and bad governance is largely due to an illiberal urban intelligentsia which is egging on politicians to unleash the coercive power of the state upon unarmed citizens through ad hoc, arbitrary action.",
    "High yields of around 20 percent were seen in bonds in previous currency crises. But in previous currency crises triggered by mis-targeted rates, banks were large buyers of bonds.",
    "When rates fell, the capital gains helped off-set some of the losses from bad loans of banks in previous currency crises.",
    "However, this time, banks also stayed off the bond market, with some also staying off bills, pushing up yields leaving only some insurance companies, non-bank primary dealers and their clients as buyers.",
    "Pension fund managers also have ethical constraints on buying bonds which are destined to default.",
    "\u201cIn general, I think any kind of retrospective measure is detrimental to the investment environment,\u201d de Mel explained.",
    "\u201cCertainty and clarity is important in any investment decision. So any measure that is retrospective is contrary to those principles.",
    "\u201cI think that was one of the reasons why there was reluctance to go down that road.\u201d",
    "The International Monetary Fund in a governance diagnostic report also warned against retrospective taxes shortly before the budget saying they reduced the \u201cpredictability of the tax system with detrimental effects on long-term investment.\u201d",
    "Retrospective taxes and ad hoc tax changes of any kind undermines rule of law and governance.",
    "\u201cNothing distinguishes more clearly conditions in a free country from those in a country under arbitrary government than the observance in the former of the great principles known as the Rule of Law,\u201d explains economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek.",
    "\u201cStripped of all technicalities this means that government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand \u2013 rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers in given circumstances, and to plan one\u2019s individual affairs on the basis of this knowledge.",
    "\u201cAlthough this ideal can never be perfectly achieved, since legislators as well as those to whom the administration of the law is entrusted are fallible men, the essential point, that the discretion left to the executive organs wielding coercive power should be reduced as much as possible, is clear enough.",
    "\u201cWhile every law restricts individual freedom to some extent by altering the means which people may use in the pursuit of their aims, under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action.\u201d",
    "Rule of law \u201cmeans, in the first place, the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of prerogative, or even of wide discretionary authority on the part of government,\u201d explains British constitutional theorist A V Dicey.",
    "The IMF said both retrospective taxes and repeated tax amnesties undermined the system.",
    "\u201cPolicy makers have introduced repeated tax amnesties while imposing additional tax, sometimes retrospectively, on compliant taxpayers,\u201d the IMF said in a governance diagnostic report.",
    "\u201cSuch a system undermines the trust of taxpayers, reduces predictability of the tax system with detrimental effects on long-term investment, distorts decisions, and complicates administration.\u201d",
    "Primary dealers are already taxed at 30 percent on all business income. (Colombo/Nov15/2023)"
