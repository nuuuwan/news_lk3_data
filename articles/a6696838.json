    "Colombo, Feb 12 (Daily Mirror) - The country does not require the services of professionals from these health trade unions, as there is a preference for the private sector to handle these hospital services, Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) president Dr. Rukshan Bellana said today while comenting on the scheduled island-wide strike by health sector trade unions, except doctors.",
    "Addresing the media, he said that the country's health sector solely requires professionals in the medical, nurses' and necessary administrative staff, to effectively operate a state hospital. He proposed outsourcing services such as laboratory services, asserting that this approach could lead to a threefold reduction in expenses.",
    "\"I have never witnessed president Ravi Kumudesh of the Federation of Health Professionals working in a hospital. Has anyone observed him actively engaged in any work? While many of us spend our entire day working in hospitals, Kumudesh appears to frequently remain on the road,\" Dr. Bellana charged.",
    "During the media briefing, Dr. Bellana requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe to bring the Medical Supplies Division (MSD), Drug Regulatory Authority, and State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) under his purview.",
    "Moreover, he urged for these institutions to be placed under the Presidential Secretariat for better control and management.",
