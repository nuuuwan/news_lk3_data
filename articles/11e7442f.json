    "The Public Health Inspectors\u2019 Union has reassured the public that there is no need for undue concern regarding imported coconut oil.",
    "Commenting regarding the rising suspicions surrounding the safety and quality of coconut oil entering Sri Lanka, the Chairman of the Public Health Inspectors\u2019 Union Upul Rohana said: \u201cWhen coconut oil is imported to Sri Lanka, a special inspection is conducted by food inspectors from the Food Control Unit at Sri Lanka Customs. Imported RBD (Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized) oil can be sold as regular coconut oil, provided it adheres to the standards set by the 1987 directives under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980. There is no legal obstacle to its sale.\u201d",
    "Mr Rohana emphasized that, in addition to customs inspections, the Public Health Inspectors conduct regular checks on coconut oil available in stores, both locally produced and imported.",
    "\u201cRandom sampling and testing are done by public health inspectors. Sometimes we detect aflatoxins in both local and imported coconut oil, and in such cases, we take legal action and remove the affected products from the market,\u201d he explained.",
    "He also noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic production of coconut oil is insufficient to meet demand, which is why imports are necessary. \u201cThe public should not be alarmed. Imported coconut oil, as long as it complies with current standards, is safe for consumption,\u201d Rohana stated, urging consumers not to succumb to unnecessary fears.",
    "However, concerns have been raised by the All Ceylon Traditional Coconut Oil Producers\u2019 Association, which alleges that a racket is operating, selling imported oil\u2014claimed to be toxic\u2014as locally produced coconut oil."
