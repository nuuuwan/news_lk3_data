    "Sri Lankan elections exemplify the famous Dickensian paradox in the opening line in \u2018A tale of two cities\u2019. In the present instance, it is the best of times because the government has become concerned about the public and is going hell for leather to grant them some relief; it is the worst of times because the people are well aware that relief is ephemeral, and the run-up to the upcoming presidential election is only an interval in hell, as it were.",
    "Going by the pledges that the main presidential candidates are currently making, one wishes the Constitution could be changed to accommodate all of them as Presidents to serve on a rotational basis, with steps being taken to implement their election promises. If that could be done, Sri Lanka would become a First World country overnight.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe promises to rebuild the economy, develop the education sector and enable Sri Lanka to compete with the developed world; Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa pledges to strengthen the economy, take action against the corrupt, bring taxes down to affordable levels, create employment opportunities and usher in social justice; JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has undertaken to rid the country of bribery and corruption, develop the economy and overhaul the education system to make it compare with the best in the world. Former Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says he will be guided by Arahant Mahinda\u2019s advice to King Devanampiya Tissa. So, if they took turns to rule us, and implement their pro-people programmes, what a prosperous and happy nation we would become!",
    "President Wickremesinghe has also promised a river for Jaffna. He did so at a ceremony to mark the opening of the Thalaiyady Seawater Desalination Plant, as part of the Jaffna-Kilinochchi Water Supply Project, on Friday. Interestingly, on the same day, a British lawyer and environmental activist made international headlines by swearing a legal oath on a river as a juror in a London court; Paul Powlesland swore on a phial of water from River Roding when he attended a court in east London.",
    "President Wickremesinghe\u2019s pledge is to implement the \u2018River for Jaffna\u2019 project, which has been shelved for six decades or so. Successive governments have only paid lip service to this proposed project, which is believed to be capable of addressing Jaffna\u2019s water woes by storing freshwater in the lagoons in the area. Going by their forgetfulness, it looks as if their leaders had drunk from the mythical river, Lethe. It is heartening that President Wickremesinghe has evinced a keen interest in reviving the long-forgotten project, albeit for political reasons, and one can only hope that other presidential candidates will also publicly undertake to implement it so that whoever wins, action will be taken to address Jaffna\u2019s water problem. Similarly, a national policy should be formulated on rainwater harvesting in all parts of the country to ease the country\u2019s increasing water stress.",
    "Meanwhile, it will be impossible for the presidential candidates to carry out any of their much-publicised promises unless the economy is put back on an even keel. Worryingly, the presidential election has distracted the focus of not only politicians but also the public from the need to consolidate what has been gained on the economic front and help the country come out of the current crisis once and for all. Traditional, divisive, clientelist politics has taken precedence over the economic crisis management to the point of making one wonder if the outcome of the next presidential election will derail the ongoing economic recovery programme, with the winner of the presidency opting for even more populist measures to win the next general election, which is expected to follow in quick succession.",
    "What needs to be prioritised over everything else at the upcoming presidential election is the economic recovery programme, which alone will help the country avert a descent into what we experienced in 2022; that was a foretaste of what it would be like to languish in an economic hell. It is hoped that the \u2018promising\u2019 presidential candidates and voters will be mindful of this fact.",
