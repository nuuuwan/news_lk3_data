  "original_body_lines": [
    "Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident, the U.S military said.",
    "Both pilots were recovered alive, with one suffering minor injuries, but the incident underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become after a year of ongoing attacks on shipping by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area.",
    "The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was.",
    "\u201cThe guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18, which was flying off the USS Harry S. Truman,\u201d Central Command said in a statement.",
    "The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.",
    "Israel\u2019s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn\u2019t distinguish between combatants and civilians.",
    "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
    "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran."
