  "original_body_lines": [
    "The second leg of the peace process and something which the LTTE always considered of the highest priority, and reiterated at the talks, was the rapid rehabilitation and development of the conflict-affected areas \u2013 mainly the Northern and Eastern Provinces. This consisted of eight districts of the 25 in the country. Since the conflict had inevitably spilled over the boundaries of the eight districts, it became necessary to also bring in what was called the adjacent districts of Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Moneragala. Some of these were earlier referred to as \u2018border villages\u2019 but since it was necessary to have a neutral term instead of accepting territorial borders, the term \u2018adjacent district\u2019 was being increasingly used in the documentation.",
    "The organizational structure to handle work connected with relief, rehabilitation and reconciliation came under the purview of the prime minister directly through the office of the commissioner-general for the coordination of the Triple-R program. There had been a national framework for the Three-R\u2019s prepared during the time of the previous government starting around 1999. Ranil decided to adopt this framework for his accelerated program of restoration of the conflict-affected areas. I was appointed the commissioner-general of the office for the Triple-R and once again, as in 1983, was not only holder of such a title but was also given authority to plan, organize and monitor programs of all the ministries and provincial and district authorities whose normal work involved elements of relief, rehabilitation and reconciliation.",
    "Ranil also created three new ministries to cover in addition to resettlement of IDPs (internally displaced persons) and refugees, Eastern Province Development and the Vanni. There was inevitably some overlap and one of my functions of coordination was to sort out the problems caused thereby. Being secretary to the prime minister gave me the necessary authority to do so. The work of the commissioner-general was quite heavy as anything serious that developed within the rather large area of its mandate would finally find its way up to me; but I found it very fulfilling.",
    "We defined relief as being the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance to the almost one million persons who had been internally displaced during the years of conflict. The IDPs used to be generally referred to as refugees, a term which in fact technically only applies to those who had left Sri Lanka seeking asylum in countries abroad. In fact, we concerned ourselves about the refugees too who must have numbered around half a million in several of the developed countries. I was particularly interested in the 66,000 Tamil refugees who had remained for several years in camps in southern India and were awaiting a chance to return home now that peace had been restored. UNHCR was doing a superb job as regards the IDPs and had stretched its mandate and resources to the maximum to protect and assist this most vulnerable group which the long war had spawned.",
    "I raised a staff virtually overnight bringing together once again, as I had done in 1983, proven and trusted senior officials. Many of them had to be Tamil since consultation with field level personnel had to be in that language. Also it required the necessary contact to be established with persons of the LTTE who were also learning to handle administrative and developmental functions in their area which covered about 6,000 square kilometers in the Vanni region of the north. I was able to bring on board Dr A S Kunasingham and Dr A Ambalavanar as two expert advisors. Three commissioners of high quality were brought in \u2013 Maj Gen Devinda Kalupahana to be in charge of reconciliation; S Sivanandan for strategic planning & implementation and W A S Perera, a newly retired secretary of the government familiar with defence matters and rehabilitation for institutional capacity building.",
    "Of them Sivanandan had been with me both in Ampara and Galle during my government agent days and later on in essential services. Various other senior retired staff were brought in as the organization grew and as the occasion demanded. We offered good remuneration since these were senior retired officers but the jobs were on very short-term contracts. As I frequently told them, the prime minister\u2019s idea was for us to do a `holding operation\u2019 until the Interim Administration, which the LTTE were preparing for, as the beginning of the Federal Unit, came into being. I believe that much of the success that came our way and our ability to work with such cordiality with the LTTE \u2013 counterparts was that we both understood that the Triple R organization was only performing a \u2018trusteeship\u2019 function. We would go out of existence as soon as the Interim Administration developed its capacity for effective management.",
    "The support from foreign agencies in our effort was tremendous. The UNDP helped in providing consultants,46 vehicles, computers, funds for institutional capacity building and disseminating information. UNHCR and UNICEF too were similarly helpful. The entire donor community of nations as represented in Colombo through their embassies came around to support a cause they were vitally interested in and the overall impression was upbeat with things looking good, even at times euphoric.",
    "The Tokyo Donor meeting in the middle of 2003 was organized by the Japanese with their customary skill and organizational brilliance. It was superbly chaired by Ambassador Akashi and Ranil, Koizumi, the PM of Japan, and Richard Armitage, the Deputy Secretary of State of the US representing Gen Colin Powell, made the opening speeches. Delegations from 52 donor countries and international agencies made up the assemblage who had before them for their consideration, both the Regaining Sri Lanka document and the Basic Needs Assessments for Rehabilitation and Development of the conflict-affected areas.",
    "The US was one of the co-chairs of the meeting and the donor consortium which carried the process forward. In addition to Richard Armitage, who represented the US, the other co-chairs were Akashi of Japan, Vidar Helgesson of Norway and Chris Patten of the EU. Pledges of money in grant and loan aid were made at the end of the meeting. We were all pleasantly surprised that the total support reached the record sum of US$ 4.5 billion to be disbursed over a period of four years. Japan itself pledged US$1,000 million and the multi-laterals \u2013 the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank close to a billion each. The balance billion and a half were made up of over 20 bilateral donors.",
    "Ranil had achieved through his strenuous advocacy something which no other leader of Sri Lanka had done. His concern was whether we could absorb this massive quantum of assistance with the existing institutional capacity we possessed. About two-thirds of the aid was to go to the south for projects directly related to the alleviation of poverty. The other one-third was for the north-east to help rehabilitate the conflict damaged economy. But one of the conditions the donors insisted on was that disbursement of aid would be tied in some way to progress on the peace front. This was understandable from the donor\u2019s point of view since they did not want to see their tax-payers money being once again wasted through a destructive war.",
    "We became operational in June 2002 and by the end of 2003 there was a fair amount of work completed. More than 50 per cent of the IDPs were back in their homes helped through an elaborate scheme of personal livelihood assistance which we devised; around 10 per cent of the 1.5 million anti-personal mines strewn in the north and east during the war had been cleared with a target of total elimination by the year 2006. This project, which involved nine international NGOs, from the well-known Halo Trust to one which had the interesting name of the Humpty Dumpty Institute, not only promoted mine clearing, but assisted mine victims with prosthetics, provided children and women with mine risk education and also took on board the issue of advocacy for the banning of anti-personnel mines as a weapon of warfare.",
    "At the UN General Assembly meeting in November 2002, Ranil went on record for Sri Lanka\u2019s early accession to the Ottawa (mine ban) Treaty. What was most satisfying for me through all this was that the number of civilian victims of mines \u2013 mainly women and children \u2013 had fallen over the one and a half years from an average of 15-20 a month to a low of five to seven a month.",
    "Rehabilitation of the road transport system which was in a deplorable state as a result of war damage and neglect over many years needed much time, money and effort. Contractors for the road work and rebuilding of hundreds of culverts and bridges were unavailable. Yet in a few short months, the arterial 90 kilometre highway between Vavuniya and Jaffna was completed and thousands began using this daily. The A9 road became the main link with the north after a gap of at least 12 years. An important link whose absence had divided north from south for many years was established and in the first flush of this newly found freedom thousands of Sinhalese Buddhists found it possible to visit and worship at the important temple on the island of Nagadipa off the Jaffna Peninsula.",
    "My own visit to Jaffna one of my first official stations back in 1954 was heart breaking. The Residency in the Old Park where I had lived with the Sri Kantha\u2019s was in ruins. The Kachcheri, where I had done my cadetship and learnt Tamil, looked like something out of an album of Dresden after the allied bombing. The branches of large trees were emerging from the windows of what had been the room at the front I had shared with the office assistant Mr Nadarajah. Sarath Fonseka, the military commander of Jaffna who entertained us to tea in the Pallali base camp told me that according to his figures, Jaffna was losing population. I thought he was right for the heart seemed to have been plucked out of the fine city I had known. I left Jaffna that evening in the middle of 2002, sad and dispirited but more than ever convinced that we should never be at war again with our own people.",
    "Our Triple-R group was also responsible for the action, plan for reconciliation. This was largely Devinda Kalupahana\u2019s\u2019 work, It was constructed through intensive discussions with civil, society organizations in the field and most of the major southern stakeholders participated in the enterprise. Unfortunately we could not get the LTTE completely on board and this remained yet to be accomplished.",
    "How Ranil found the time for all the paper work that came to him was a mystery to me. Perhaps, he did this late into the night and combined it with his wide reading. But he could relax and do something entirely different on the weekends. He was very conscientious about dealing with papers and had a phenomenal ability to recall letters he had only glanced at, or conversations on the move. Occasionally he would refer when burdened with many things on his mind to \u2018that thing\u2019 and only those really close to him like Dayaratne, and Sandra Perera and Naufel Rahman, who had worked for him as secretary when he was leader of the opposition, would know what it was all about. They would unerringly know, and find the \u2018thing\u2019 for him.",
    "Ranil had a great many people to meet on an average day in office \u2013 many of them from abroad \u2013 and found it convenient to be appropriately attired in smart jacket and tie from Monday to Friday. I suspect also that it was to keep himself reasonably comfortable in the intense cold that the always too high air-conditioning made of his conference room. On Saturday, in line with the modern trend, he would totally relax and dress down. It was then open-necked or designer T-shirt and uncreased slacks, with a pair of \u2018pumps\u2019 on his feet.",
    "He loved going to Bentota in preference to using his official Nuwara Eliya residence \u2018The Lodge\u2019, because the air there was warm and dry and helpful to the sinus condition he was sometimes bothered with. After a while we took over, as an adjunct to the prime minister\u2019s secretariat, two small virtually unused cottages on the spit of land near the Bentota Beach Hotel and made this an austere retreat. Once in a way, he used to have \u2018Camp David\u2019 style meetings with his local staff there and exceptionally with particular foreign delegations.",
