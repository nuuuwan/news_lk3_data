    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee was quoted at 310/315 to the US dollar in the mid-morning trade, Wednesday dealers said, as an ad hoc peg wobbled after two months of one sided interventions amid deflationary policy.",
    "Under the ad hoc peg arrangement, called the flexible exchange rate, which is neither a clean float nor a hard peg, the central bank has not sold any dollars in April or May, amid weak credit, data shows.",
    "The arrangement can induce panic and uncertainty in the market due to changing short term demand, even if overall policy is not inflationary, analysts say.",
    "Sri Lanka is getting budget support loans from the IMF which can also pressure the currency, if the central bank does not mop up converted rupees when it purchases dollars and is unwilling to sell the dollars, analysts have said.",
    "The market depth is then limited to bank net open positions.",
    "Treasury bills were hardly quoted, ahead of an auction Wednesday. Bond yields were steady.",
    "A bond maturing on 15.09.2027 was quoted at 22.70/22.90 up from 22.70/85 percent a day earlier.",
    "A bond maturing on 15.05.2026 was quoted at 23.80/24.10 percent steady from 23.90/24.05 on",
    "A bond maturing on 01.05.2025 was quoed at 25.90/26.20 down from at 26.00/25 percent. (Colombo/June14/2023)"
