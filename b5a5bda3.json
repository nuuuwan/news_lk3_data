  "original_body_lines": [
    "Litro Gas Lanka, the country\u2019s national provider of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), recently successfully conducted the conclusion of its impactful school awareness initiative, \u2018Heta Surakina Ape Lamai.\u2019 This comprehensive program, designed to promote the safe use of LPG in households amongst school children, marked its grand finale after reaching 264 schools across the country.",
    "The primary goal of \u2018Heta Surakina Ape Lamai\u2019 was to elevate awareness and instil a culture of safe LPG usage among students, ultimately influencing their families. The grand finale was held with the participation of Ministers Sagala Ratnayaka and Shehan Semasinghe, public officials, Litro Chairman, management and staff, principals, teachers, students, and parents.",
    "Speaking at the event, Litro Gas Chairman Muditha Peiris said: \u201cWe are very pleased to see the successful completion of this program. This is not merely a brand-building exercise; it is to raise awareness more broadly about the safe use of LPG to empower local households. We thank everybody who enthusiastically participated in this initiative.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, he thanked the Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor to the President Sagala Rathnayaka for trusting his expertise to take over Litro at a turbulent time and turning around the organisation from ailing to thriving: \u201cOver 4 million households, amounting to 85% of the market share, use LPG daily. There are 70 stoves lit every second even as we speak. We are committed to empowering the lives of these LPG users through safe and continued supply,\u201d he added.",
    "Beyond educating students about LPG and its advantages, the program sought to empower young minds with a sense of responsibility for their family\u2019s well-being and a fundamental understanding of safety, energy, and energy dynamics. By imparting knowledge at a grassroots level, Litro Gas Lanka aims to create informed and secure family units.",
    "On behalf of the winners of the grand finale in an impromptu and emotional message, Dileesha Damayanthi, a teacher from Thanamalwila National School, thanked Litro Gas for providing a rural college such as theirs the platform and opportunity to shine: \u201cWe are very grateful for the opportunity to participate, broaden our knowledge as well as to win valuable prizes. Despite limited resources, students prepared for this competition with great enthusiasm. This initiative has been successful in creating advocates from among the community, for the community.\u201d",
    "In an effort to motivate active engagement and honour the students\u2019 dedicated efforts, the program offered a range of rewards and prizes. Among the awardees were Thanamalwila National School, celebrated as the overall winner, while Horana Royal College secured the runners-up position. Notably, seven provincial level teams achieved victory, and ten individuals were recognised for their exceptional oratory skills at the all-island level.",
    "Litro Gas Lanka\u2019s school awareness program stands as a commendable effort in promoting the safe use of LPG among students. By reaching students from all districts and incentivising participation, the program not only heightened safety awareness but also nurtured responsible behaviours among the younger generation, setting the stage for a safer and more informed society. This grand finale marks the culmination of a series of initiatives that underscore Litro Gas Lanka\u2019s commitment to fostering positive change through education and awareness."
