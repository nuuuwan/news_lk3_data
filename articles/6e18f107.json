    "Parliament, April 2 (Daily Mirror)- The Ways and Means Committee has requested the Customs to handover the names of importers, who have earned undue profits last year, to the Inland Revenue Department so that they could be taxed, the Chairman of the Committee Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.",
    "MP Ranawaka told a media briefing in Parliament that the Inland Revenue Department will charge 36 percent of their income as taxes.",
    "\u201cSome of the importers have\u00a0 started companies temporarily to import essential items and then fraudulently changed over to other companies,\u201d the MP added.",
    "Member of the Ways and Means Committee MP Dayasiri Jayasekera said some have registered companies on the names of their family members and have evaded paying Value Added Tax (VAT).",
