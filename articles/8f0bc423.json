    "NPP/JVP Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake has assured Sri Lanka\u2019s business community that his party will prevent any further collapse of the present economy.Speaking at the NPP Business Forum held at Monarch Imperial in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte last Tuesday, Dissanayake said that the party\u2019s consensus with the people is to stabilise, strengthen, and advance the economy.",
    "Commenting on concerns about rivals attempting to create fear and panic about an economic downturn if the NPP comes to power, Dissanayake said the party\u2019s first promise is to prevent any further collapse of the existing economic situation.",
    "The event was attended by a large number of Sri Lankan business people from both within the country and abroad, as well as foreign investors, professionals, academics, and other stakeholders.",
    "Dissanayake said that for the first time in the country\u2019s history, the economy is at the centre of political and election debates.",
    "He remarked that the economic collapse has compelled both citizens and political forces to engage in a meaningful discussion about economic issues. He said in response, the NPP is now presenting its economic policies for public review ahead of the election.",
    "Among those who attended the NPP forum included D. Samson and Sons Ltd. Emeritus Chairperson Desamanya Nandadasa Rajapaksa, John Keells Holdings PLC Chairperson Krishan Balendra, Desamanya Sohli Captain, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairperson Duminda Hulangamuwa, National Chamber of Commerce President Deepal Nelson, Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs President Thushira Radella, Sri Lanka United National Businesses Alliance Chairperson Tania Abeysundara, Hiran Cooray of Jetwing Symphony/Lighthouse Hotel PLC and many other business leaders.",
    "For the first time in this election, economic issues are at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds. In the past, elections have often revolved around topics such as war, race, or religion. However, certain right-wing factions are spreading false fears about another economic collapse, which is causing unnecessary turbulence in the stock market. Contrary to these claims, the NPP is set to take power for the first time, and we are committed to making careful economic decisions to ensure stability and progress. We will not allow the economy to collapse as it did under the leadership of Gotabaya.",
    "There is ongoing debate regarding the role of the Central Bank. We strongly support its independence, which has been eroded by political interference over the past two decades. While we respect the independence of the Central Bank, we also believe it must play a role in national development and support fiscal policy. Monetary policy alone cannot sustain the economy\u2014it must align with the country\u2019s broader growth objectives, but not be used for political ends. We guarantee to safeguard this independence.",
    "The debate over the future of SOEs is critical. We recognize the strategic importance of SOEs in sectors such as energy, telecommunications, and banking. We have a clear plan outlining which entities to retain and which to privatize. Additionally, we will ensure that a robust regulatory body is in place to guarantee fair prices and high-quality essential goods. This is a fundamental responsibility of the government.",
    "There have been baseless rumors suggesting we will take over private property. Let me be clear: we are not following in the footsteps of Saradiel. (Robin Hood)This issue should not even be a topic of discussion in the 21st century. We respect the distinct roles of the government and the private sector. Our government will support private entrepreneurship, making business owners and factory operators the engine of the economy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is stifled by red tape, outdated laws, and corruption. We will work to remove these obstacles, enabling businesses to thrive and compete in the global value chain. Despite decades of talk about liberalizing the economy, we have never implemented a comprehensive national development plan. Inconsistent policies have left investors uncertain. Meanwhile, while countries like South Korea made significant progress, we remain stuck with just $12 billion in exports and a GDP per capita of $3,800.",
    "Economic decisions must be grounded in data, analysis, and predictions. Yet, our country continues to rely on superstition when making business decisions. The global economy will advance based on informed choices, and we will provide the necessary market data to identify growth opportunities. Our administration will not expand the state apparatus for political purposes but will focus on addressing critical gaps in education and healthcare. By streamlining government services, we will ensure businesses receive the support they need to grow.",
    "We also understand the challenges facing MSMEs, many of which collapsed during recent crises. Rebuilding existing businesses is more effective than starting new ones from scratch. We will address the current issues with the Parate Law and implement relief measures, as well as establish a development banking system to help businesses recover.",
    "The latest advances in knowledge and technology are being developed abroad, and we will send 200 of Sri Lanka\u2019s top students to leading global universities. They will return with the expertise needed to support local industries. At the same time, we will invest in education, building human capital to meet both domestic and global skill demands.",
    "The future of the global economy will be driven by technological innovation, and this is why we will invest in research and development. We have a dedicated policy to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, crucial for Sri Lanka\u2019s growth.",
    "We will revitalize our diplomatic services to seek out new markets and partnerships, providing Sri Lankan businesses with expanded opportunities on the global stage.",
    "We are committed to lowering energy costs by one-third within a few years, as energy will play a crucial role in our competitive future. The global shift toward renewable energy is undeniable, and Sri Lanka has ten times the renewable energy capacity it currently utilizes. We will invite private investment to develop this sector further.",
    "To advance our economy, we need foreign direct investment (FDI). Despite claims of a liberalized economy, political leaders have failed to attract significant FDI since 1977, with only $22 billion accrued, while Vietnam brings in $22 billion annually. We will actively pursue FDI for capital, technology, and market access, providing similar benefits to local investors as well.",
    "We do not expect even a glass of water from you. Your desire to see this nation develop aligns with our commitment to responsible governance. For the first time, let\u2019s create a country where the needs of the government and the private sector are united. Together, we can form an alliance that drives Sri Lanka\u2019s future success.",
