  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a press conference held today (28) at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) party\u2019s headquarters, former MP Udaya Gammanpila challenged Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath to substantiate the allegations of misconduct against retired judge S.I. Alwis.",
    "Retired High Court Judge Alwis had chaired an investigative committee appointed to probe the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka.",
    "Gammanpila questioned the credibility of the accusations made by Minister Herath, calling for transparency in the discourse surrounding the retired judge. He asserted, \u201cAnyone can make accusations, but if an accusation is made, it must be proven with evidence. That\u2019s why I challenged Minister Vijitha Herath to present evidence of Judge Alwis\u2019s alleged misconduct at the next government press conference.\u201d",
    "He further criticized the government\u2019s stance on the committee\u2019s findings, highlighting a lack of response to the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya\u2019s concerns regarding the Alwis committee report.",
    "\u201cThe government, especially its media spokesperson, has yet to address the specific content of the Alwis committee report, which we made public on the 21 October. Instead, they focus on discrediting committee members,\u201d Gammanpila added.",
    "Gammanpila further stated: \u201cMinister Vijitha Herath has been accused of drunk driving, and questions have been raised about a significant building project in Narahenpita. Who can\u2019t make accusations? But they require proof.\u201d",
    "With another Cabinet press conference scheduled for tomorrow, Gammanpila urged journalists to question Minister Herath for clarity on the evidence supporting these claims. He alleged that dismissing the committee\u2019s findings by tarnishing its members\u2019 reputations has become \u201cthe policy and practice of the government."
