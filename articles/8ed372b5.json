  "original_body_lines": [
    "From 2004 to 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s FDI journey has been a mix of bold ambition, uneven execution, and political shifts",
    "When Sri Lanka opened its economy in 1977, the vision was to turn a small island into a nimble hub for global trade. But it\u2019s in the past two decades that the country\u2019s foreign investment story has been most dramatic \u2014 and, at times, most controversial.",
    "From the cranes of Colombo to the wind farms of the North, each chapter since 2004 has been marked by big bets, bold champions, and sometimes bitter debates over the price of ambition.",
    "The early 2010s marked Colombo\u2019s leap into the big-ship era. The Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) \u2014 a joint venture between China Merchants Port Holdings and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) \u2014 opened in 2013 under a 35-year build-operate-transfer deal. It gave Colombo South Harbour the capacity to handle the world\u2019s largest vessels, cementing the port\u2019s status as South Asia\u2019s top transshipment hub.",
    "Further south, Hambantota Port became the most talked-about infrastructure deal in the nation\u2019s modern history. Conceived under President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a second deep-water port, it struggled to attract traffic. In 2017, amid mounting debt, the unity government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe leased it to China Merchants Port for $ 1.12 billion on a 99-year term. Which perhaps was not a sensible move considering the length of the lease and the extent of land that was incorporated in the lease. For some, it was a lifeline; for others, a warning about debt and sovereignty.",
    "Another key concession was the Colombo West International Terminal (WCT) agreement signed in 2021 \u2014 majority owned by India\u2019s Adani Ports & SEZalongside John Keells Holdings and SLPA. This marked the first Indian-led port development in Sri Lanka, signalling a diversification of strategic partners.",
    "Foreign investment wasn\u2019t just about cranes and containers. In 2014, Hong Kong\u2019s Shangri-La Group opened its Hambantota resort and followed with the One Galle Face mixed-use development in Colombo \u2014 a combined $ 800 million commitment. At the time, it was the largest foreign investment in Sri Lanka\u2019s leisure and property sectors, signalling confidence in tourism and urban redevelopment.",
    "The most ambitious urban project, however, is Port City Colombo \u2014 a 269-hectare reclamation by China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). Launched during Xi Jinping\u2019s 2014 visit, its reclaimed land was completed by 2019.",
    "This project would have been complete well ahead of 2019 if the Yahapalanaya government led by Prime Minister Rani Wickremesinghe did not oppose the continuation of the project. This also caused the Government to pay damages for stalling the project.",
    "In 2021, Parliament created the Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC), giving the site its own investment regime and signalling the intent to position it as a regional financial and services hub.",
    "While ports and towers dominated headlines, telecoms quietly became Sri Lanka\u2019s largest continuous foreign investment sector. Malaysia\u2019s Dialog Axiata has invested more than $ 3 billion since the mid-2000s, rolling out 3G, 4G, and preparing for 5G networks.",
    "In 2018, Hong Kong\u2019s CK Hutchison merged Hutch with UAE-owned Etisalat Lanka, creating a stronger third mobile player. These moves have given Sri Lanka one of South Asia\u2019s most competitive and affordable telecom markets \u2014 a foundation for the country\u2019s growing digital services exports.",
    "Even amid megaproject glamour, the quiet workhorses of Sri Lanka\u2019s export economy remain its export processing zones (EPZs). The apparel sector, with significant foreign joint ventures, dominates these zones \u2014 particularly Katunayake, Biyagama, and Koggala.",
    "Brands like Brandix and MAS Holdings have used FDI partnerships to move up the value chain, building \u201cgreen\u201d factories and design capabilities, keeping Sri Lanka\u2019s products competitive even as labour costs rise.",
    "In the early 2020s, Sri Lanka began courting large-scale renewable energy projects, aiming to tap wind corridors in the North and solar potential across the island. A flagship initiative was the 2022\u20132023 partnership agreements with Adani Green Energy for wind power in Mannar and Pooneryn.",
    "These projects reflected a shift from infrastructure-heavy FDI to investments in energy security and climate resilience. They also underscored the importance of clear, bankable contracts to attract long-term private capital into the power sector.",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa (President, 2005\u20132015): Political architect of Hambantota Port and Port City Colombo, with an emphasis on Chinese capital and infrastructure megaprojects.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe (Prime Minister during key deals, later President): Negotiated the Hambantota lease and facilitated agreements to diversify Colombo port investment partners. Which perhaps was not a sensible move considering the length of the lease and the extent of land that was incorporated in the lease.",
    "Board of Investment (BOI): The country\u2019s investment promotion agency, instrumental in facilitating approvals for large projects across manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure.",
    "Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC): Established in 2021 to govern the Port City\u2019s special economic zone, a structural innovation in Sri Lanka\u2019s investment framework.",
    "Corporate champions: China Merchants Port, CHEC/China Harbour, Adani Ports & SEZ, John Keells Holdings, Dialog Axiata, Shangri-La Group \u2014 all have left visible footprints on Sri Lanka\u2019s economic landscape.",
    "The numbers show how fragile FDI flows have been. In 2018, inflows topped $ 1.6 billion. By 2023, after the Easter 2019 attacks, COVID-19, and the 2022 debt crisis, they had fallen to $ 730 million.",
    "In 2023, under an IMF Extended Fund Facility, the Government embarked on reforms aimed at stabilising the currency, restructuring state-owned enterprises, and improving the investment climate. The Board of Investment reported early signs of recovery in project approvals, but reaching the regional benchmark of 2\u20133% of GDP in FDI will require consistent policy delivery.",
    "1.Execution at Colombo West International Terminal \u2014 on-time delivery and operational performance will set the tone for future port concessions.",
    "2.Anchor tenants at Port City \u2014 law firms, BPM providers, and financial services players will test whether the SEZ\u2019s incentives are credible.",
    "3.Transparent renewable energy agreements \u2014 essential to unlock the multi-billion-dollar clean energy pipeline.",
    "4.Digital infrastructure scaling \u2014 5G rollout and fibre expansion will determine if Sri Lanka can grow its IT/BPM exports.",
    "5.Policy continuity \u2014 perhaps the single biggest determinant of whether investors see Sri Lanka as an opportunity or a risk.",
    "From 2004 to 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s FDI journey has been a mix of bold ambition, uneven execution, and political shifts. The physical landmarks \u2014 from deep-water ports to luxury towers \u2014 are visible to all. The less visible but equally vital story is whether the country can now offer investors what they prize most: stability, transparency, and fair returns.",
    "If it can, the next decade could be less about singular megaprojects and more about a steady flow of capital into a diversified, resilient economy.",
    "Katunayake and Biyagama EPZ expansions \u2013 Apparel sector continues to attract joint ventures, reinforcing Sri Lanka\u2019s export manufacturing base.",
    "Dialog Axiata network upgrades \u2013 Malaysian-owned Dialog invests steadily in 3G and network expansion.",
    "2010 \u2013 Hambantota Port Phase I opens \u2013 Built with Chinese financing; designed as a second deep-water port.",
    "2011 \u2013 Phase II of Hambantota Port begins \u2013 Expanding berths and facilities.",
    "2013 \u2013 Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) opens \u2013 Chinese joint venture with SLPA; first terminal in South Asia to handle mega container ships.",
