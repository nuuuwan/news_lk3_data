  "original_body_lines": [
    "An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission team concluded its visit to Sri Lanka recently, acknowledging the country\u2019s progress under its economic reform programme but cautioning that the road ahead remains fraught with challenges.",
    "While growth has exceeded expectations and inflation is stabilising, the IMF stressed that Sri Lanka must deepen reforms \u2013 particularly in taxation, debt management, and governance to secure long-term stability amid global uncertainties.",
    "The IMF noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s economy grew by 4.8% year-on-year in Q1 2025, surpassing projections. Inflation has eased to -1.1%, and foreign reserves have climbed to $6 billion. However, the mission warned that looming threats including potential export tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and trade uncertainties demand unwavering commitment to fiscal discipline.",
    "\u201cThe hard-won gains are fragile,\u201d said Evan Papageorgiou, IMF Mission Chief for Sri Lanka. \u201cNow is not the time to ease up. Without sustained reforms, the recovery could stall.",
    "The IMF insists on expanding the tax base, tightening compliance, and limiting exemptions to meet fiscal targets. The 2026 budget must lock in revenue-raising measures to achieve a primary surplus of 2.3% of GDP \u2013 a non-negotiable benchmark for debt sustainability.",
    "Energy Pricing: Cost-reflective utility pricing must stay to prevent fiscal drains",
    "Debt Restructuring: Finalizing agreements with remaining creditors is urgent to restore investor confidence.",
    "Central Bank Independence: No monetary financing of deficits, stricter oversight of state banks, and continued forex reserve buildup are critical.",
    "The IMF reiterated that anti-corruption measures, trade liberalization, and reforms to boost competitiveness cannot be delayed. \u201cHalf-measures won\u2019t suffice,\u201d the report implied, urging faster progress on laws regulating state enterprises, public procurement, and debt management.",
    "The IMF will formally assess Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in the fifth review of its $3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) while no date is set for it.",
