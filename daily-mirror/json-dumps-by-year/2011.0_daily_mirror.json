        "body": "As 2011 draws to a close what more can symbolize the uncertainty of 2012 than the future of North Korea under a young and inexperienced new leader Although none can say with certainty what the morrow will bring guessing what the secretive states future will be under 28yearold Kim JongUn has become a tougher exercise than setting the colours on a Rubiks Cube The appointment of Kim JongUn who is being hailed by North Koreas statecontrolled media as the supreme leader of the party state and army may smack of nepotism but it speaks of a political truth In a country where capitalist ideology and liberal political views are branded as evil communism survives in traditional values which do not see a son succeeding a father as an aberration Besides in a country where the leader builds up a cult surrounding him only a successor picked by him has the ability to ensure the nations cohesion Kim Jong Il who died on December 17 was such a cult figure that he was called the Dear Leader by the people who turned up in their tens of thousands at the funeral on December 28 They cried and defied the biting snow as they lined up along Pyongyangs streets Some described the severe weather as the natures way of expressing its grief and the snow fall as tears An engineer explained the heart attack that killed the Dear Leader saying that just as the most used part of the machine would wear out fast the dear leaders heart which overworked in pouring out love and care for his people wore out fast The soul does not die or does not depart the Koreans say Cynics may say that the scenes of a nation plunged into a state of mourning were a statemedia stunt or a stagemanaged drama Whatever it is the scenes belied the claims in the Western media only weeks ago that the country was on the verge of another famine similar to the one that killed hundreds of thousands of people two decades ago The fact that famine or hardship has not brought about a peoples revolt in North Korea perhaps indicates the communist states Orwellian grip on the people or Kim JongIls popularity or even the traditionalminded peoples resolve to resign themselves to their fate Maybe it is the mixture of all However Kim Jong Il was not a demon as the West tried to portray him The Wests demonisation of North Korea and its leaders dates back to the Cold War days The hate campaign was largely due to the Wests determination to stop the spread of communism especially to countries that had just freed themselves from the yoke of colonialism in the later 1940s and in the 1950s The hatecampaign was more severe against Kim IlSung revered by his people as the Great Leader because he succeeded in making communisms benefits reach the people in the northern parts of Korea which came under the influence of Soviet Union soon after World War II had ended The southern part came under the US control Kim IlSung a hero in the freedom fight against Japanese imperialism sought to unite Korea He had the cooperation of the Soviets but his pacifist moves were spurned by the United States compelling him to invade the south a move that triggered the fouryear Korean War Though the war ended in 1953 with an armistice the parties are yet to formally end hostilities Thus North Korea officially is at war with South Korea and the United States Kim IlSung remained in power till 1994 During his rule he saw the Soviet Union crumbling and communism being dismissed as a failed ideology Yet North Korea braving famine and natural disasters has survived to become a nuclearpower state Kim IlSung balanced his foreign policy in such a way that he remained a friend of the Soviet Union and China even after the two communist giants parted ways in the 1960s After the collapse of the Soviet Union China became North Koreas main ally Feeling the economic crunch Kim JongIl who succeeded his father in 1994 sought to bolster the countrys coffers through secret arms deals Missile and nuclear weapons technology were traded to sustain staterun programmes especially the food distribution to as many as 16 million in a country of 24million people It is said that Pakistan and Iran owed their missile capabilities to technology bought or obtained from North Korea which demonstrated its nuclear weapons capability by carrying out a test in 2009 The nuclear test has helped North Korea built up deterrent against any military adventure especially by the United States and South Korea It came a year after sixparty talks involving the US China Russia Japan and the two Koreas collapsed largely due to the US failure to honour commitments reached during the previous phases of the talks The US accused North Korea however of trying to get aid by nuclear blackmail It is against such a backdrop that Kim JongUn takes over North Korea According to BBCs World Affairs Editor John Simpson the young leader is guided by his uncle Chang Songtaek a senior general who is married to Kim JongIls sister This means North Korea will continue to be proChina North Korea is Chinas only strategic ally in the region where Beijing feels it is surrounded by US bases and countries which have signed defence pacts with the US The strategic alliance between North Korea and China and the USSouth Korea response to it have virtually buried moves to unite the two Koreas under what was once known as Sunshine policy initiated by former South Korean president Kim Dae Jung Besides China is a major or perhaps only foreign investor in North Korea and in recent years Chinese investment in North Korea has seen a sharp increase In other words the survival of North Korea under its new leader also rests on the balance of power in East Asia"

        "body": "The conservation of the 363yearold Taj Mahal the jewel among Indian monuments and one of the most visited world heritage sites has yet again come under a cloud following reports of structural instability Doubts have been raised about the strength of its foundation and the Supreme Court after taking suo motu notice of the reports has directed the Archaeological Survey of India ASI to investigate the matter The governments reply that the Taj Mahal is stable in plan and also elevation is partly reassuring However it would be unfortunate if the issue were allowed to rest with this since the longevity of the monument is not the only concern What the recent controversy spotlights is the need for transparency in heritage management and the efforts needed to achieve excellence in conservation The Taj Mahal is precious not only because it is a onemonument industry that attracts 35 million visitors every year This illumined tomb built over 17 years by Shah Jahan the Mughal emperor with its pictureperfect geometry exquisitely ornamented facades and innovative Mughal gardens is an exemplar of Indian design and craftsmanship Its history and archaeology are yet to be fully uncovered Given the Taj Mahals riverfront location and the periodic fluctuation in water levels continuous monitoring of the structure is imperative In the past the ASI often consulted premier institutions such as the Central Building Research Institute Roorkee However it appears that the most recent of the structural studies was conducted about six years ago Without waiting for any court directive or public pressure investigations must be updated regularly and the findings published This is the way to enhance conservation Attention thus far has been mostly on the buildings and not on the gardens around which are integral to the design of the monument It has been remarked by a scholar that what we have today in the gardens of the Taj Mahal is a postcolonial interpretation of a colonial intervention in a Mughal garden What is needed is a sensitive recreation of the original landscape based on a careful archaeobotanical survey In addition even if a fully functional restoration of the water works system that was originally designed to support the Mughal gardens is not possible the physical structures should be conserved and presented For this purpose the ASI which is spread thin would do well to seek counsel and collaboration from the best expertise wherever it is available In this 150th year of the ASIs establishment there is no excuse for not raising the conservation of Indias most celebrated heritage site to the highest international standards The Hindu"

        "headline": "Asian Century New Cold War Sri Lankas foreign policy in the new Super Region",
        "body": "By Dr Harinda Vidanage The global political terrain is undergoing a massive transformation most of the transformatory features were witnessed in 2011 There is a definite shift in the Washington doctrine on how the USA perceives the world influenced by a significant economic crisis at home decline of Europe the upheavals in Arab States shifts in theatres of battles to the more visible rise of China and its repercussions The term Asian Century is now a buzz word in many international policy or intellectual forums that focus on the location of global power and the ways and means of new power diffusion What is driving the enthusiasm for understanding new Asia from the right to the left in political spectrum has been the emergence of China and India as global powers but more importantly the emergence of a super region the combines the Indian and Pacific ocean geopolitics The story of China rising the transformation of power from hard to soft or the integration of hard power and soft power in the context of smart power are now becoming more and more open in the public discourse The top most influential political scientist in Washington Joseph Nye and the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both talk more and more about smart and soft power the former being the inventor of the term and the later trying to convince that is the new policy vision of the waning super power The term soft power and smart power are just not used in the context of American politics it is used by Indian scholars policy makers politicians think tanks and same by the Chinese All these terms and concepts signify the way Asia has become a significant power bloc in the world and maybe the decider of all global political futures in time to come Hillary Clinton in an Op Ed piece of October 2011 Foreign Policy Magazine wrote future of politics will be decided in Asia not Afghanistan or Iraq and stressing United States will be right at the center of the action Francis Fukuyama claims that the US foreign policy focus should now look beyond Middle East towards Asia as the stratagem of geo politics has to be devised around the developments in the new super region of IndPacific Indian and Pacific Oceans This article is focused on opportunities challenges to the future of Sri Lankan foreign policy given these new future projections of global power alignments Some of these alignments are already taking place with Chinese moves of soft hard and smart power initiatives from massive investments in East Africa Middle East Central Asia South Asia and to East Asia The Chinese presence has become more and more apparent and open and it seems the Chinese charm offensive is becoming less of charm and more obvious The response to this is the American initiatives of strengthening its alliances with India Australia Japan Vietnam and even reaching out to the largest democratic Muslim State Indonesia Hillary Clintons 2011 visit calendar will give a person a solid idea of where American interests are with multiple visits to central Asian South Asian East Asia and Pacific rim states and President Obamas highlevel visits to India Indonesia and Australian clearly outlines that the necklace of pearls is not the only alliance that the IndPacific region will see in its futures Obama administrations first distinguished guest was Manmohan Singh a couple of years ago and in a significant speech to Australian Parliament in November 2011 Obama said I have directed my national security team to make our presence and mission in the Asia Pacific a top priority As a result reductions in US defense spending will not I repeat will not come at the expense of the Asia Pacific If one starts connecting the dots of both American and Chinese interest in the Indian ocean and Pacific ocean a pattern will emerge which will be defining both the futures of US foreign policy and Chinese foreign policy In 2011 a five year research initiative was launched by the China Institute of International Studies CIIS which is the research arm of the Chinese foreign Ministry titled Assessment of Chinas neighboring security environment in the next decade The purpose as outlined in the initiative clearly claims that the region will heat up with geo political issues and China should be prepared to respond Thus the research has been launched as a five year plan to prepare China both diplomatically and strategically for any such challenge Coming back to Sri Lanka our foreign policy initiatives currently are more or less preoccupied with trying to tactically out play the so called Western pressures a hyper charged ideological view point of the nationalist political mindset and trying to woo in new friends who has the ability to outmanoeuvre Western influence Such outbidding is necessary for regimes of small nations to grapple with immediate problems But by exclusively focusing on a narrow stretch of the current battleground one is compromising the foresight or future projection capabilities needed for a robust foreign policy decisionmaking It is like preparing for battle in a theatre which will radically alter in a short time span thus rendering Sri Lanka unprepared unmatched and easily outflanked by any interest party As we are consistently overlooking strategic focus for a tactical sense of global relations These short term tactics are easily sellable in any public media outlet and can be made a justifiable public discourse using a simple but power stand against ForeignWestern intimidation and National Security Sri Lanka sits in a vital space of geo strategic importance in the dawn of the Asian century but we are witnessing the creation of two alliances of power a Chinese dominance in one side of the axis and an American dominated Indian Australian Japanese backed on the other There is a definite potential for a new cold war which is far more complicated that the 20th century Cold War as this will be a loose alliance based on interests rather than a tussle between two political ideologies of distinct world views Thus stakes are high complications are inherent and diplomatic navigation will be beyond a mere mine field it will have many IEDs to cope with The emergence of this new alliance will probably try to distinguish their political ideology as pro democratic such as India Australia Japan Vs more centralized governance led by China which will include Pakistan Burma North Korea even Singapore Though again there cant be clear lines of distinction drawn a major point of departure will be the working of democracy In this context Sri Lanka should soon understand the working of soft and smart power which will enable us to evolve a foreign policy which will not necessary tie us either one of the alliances For Sri Lanka cordial relations with China are virtual life line for development but friendly relations with India in a way defines our existence Thus it is an ideal time to reach out to a third strand of foreign policy which has been a strength in the past a new or resuscitation of a Non Aligned movement or Non Aligned initiative as there will be many other states which will like this Non Aligned position Sri Lanka can benefit from both these new power alliances and there are states which may not enter either of them such as South Korea Malaysia and Thailand South Korea though an ardent ally of USA is not the best friend of Japan and in the case of a Korean unification the threat Japan will face is far grave than China On the other hand Korea will not favour to be in the Chinese camp This is merely an example for the argument Evolving a new Non Alignment policy and quickly making that a foreign policy vision will enhance the current regimes aspiration of Sri Lankas becoming of a hub The hub will work well if it can attract all and if not will be just a beachhead for who it perceives as friendly 2012 should probably be Sri Lankas opportunity to look forward and find our place in the Asian century before an element of the Asian century puts us in place we dont want to be handicapped from the start do we Dr Vidanage is a Fulbright Scholar in Residence at

        "headline": "Tamil National Alliance AND LLRC",
        "body": "Whatever one may think of the LLRC and NORAD reports it is incontrovertible that two of the three major players in the last stage of the Sri Lankan conflict have undertaken and undergone a preliminary audit of sortsthe Sri Lankan state and the Norwegians while the third and the second in importance has not and not even thought to There has been no equivalent from within the Tamil civil society or the Tamil nationalist movement While they continue to raise what each side may feel are legitimate issues and grievances in the soft polemics and manoeuvring between the TNA and the Government over their dialogue and participation in the Parliamentary Select Committee the TNAs increasing strident rejection of the LLRC report is altogether another matter of a different order Distressingly it permits the discrediting of more moderate and legitimate issues and concerns that the TNA may be raising Thus the TNAs rejectionism may work to permit the rejection of the TNA as peace partner Most sadly it forestalls the possibility of a proreform coalition of a crossethnic crossparty character which can support the implementation of the LLRC framework as the report terms it That framework is a minimum programme for the reconstruction of Sri Lankan consciousness and citizenship along the lines of civic republican nationhood It is also arguably the Sri Lankan reading most congruent with what we may term the Asian reformist or Asian Realist perspective of the Lankan situation The TNA has seen the LLRC reports alleged negatives as outweighing the positives What is particularly noteworthy and lamentable is that regards the absence in the LLRC Report of a call for independent accountability hearings into the last stage of the war and the corporate conduct of the Lankan armed forces as distinct from inquiries into episodes of excess and criminality as a lapse that outweighs the Reports acknowledgement of Tamil grievances the identification of policy measures that gave rise to them and the need to redress those grievances fairly as contained in the segments on Grievances of the Tamil Community The Historical Background relating to MajorityMinority relationships in Sri Lanka and The Different Phases in the Narrative of Tamil Grievances Thus for the TNA today the issue of broadgauge accountability is of a higher priority than the long standing deeprooted sociopolitical grievances of the Tamils I venture to suggest that had Appapillai Amirthalingam andor Neelan Tiruchelvam been alive they would not have rejected but would have constructively engaged with and leveraged the LLRC report I wish there were a more delicately diplomatic way of putting this but there isnt The call for an international investigation into the last stages of the war by anyone such the bulk of the Tamil Diaspora Tamil civil society and the Tamil National Alliance TNAwho did not and still does not condemn the LTTEs crimes and atrocities internal executions and secret prisons child soldiers and fratricidal murders terrorism and totalitarianism is as if most of German society did not criticise the Nazis and Auschwitz even after WW 2 ended and called instead for an international inquiry into the firebombing of Dresden by the Allies No such inquiry will be countenanced by any Sri Lankan administration nor would any Asian administration cooperate with any similar inquiry in their cases Indeed the advocates of such an inquiry would be hard put to name a single administration anywhere in the world including in the West which has or would agree to a similar venture in the matter of their own wars and armed forces Sri Lanka remaining quintessentially a democracy in an increasingly democratic world it is the untrammelled right of any political party or individual to reject the LLRC reports conclusion that individual instances of probable crimes and human rights violations should be independently investigated but that there was no evidence of systemic systematic traducing of international humanitarian law However any political party that does so must also balance the exigencies of external or parochial constituency pressure with the larger delegitimisation that results from crossing such a thick red line not only of national security and core strategic interest but of the broad and basic social consensus The issue of an international mechanism on accountability for the last stages of the war is the dividing line that defines the mainstream from the fringe and in a more existential sense the inner from the outer It constitutes the perimeter of the polity While it is perfectly legitimate to call for such an inquiry it would be far more correct and realistic to emulate the example of Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith who represents that institution which has been the most successful in history in the matter of combining the universal with the particular the global with the national His Eminence having just provided an example of soft power as countervailing force has pointed to the unfinished tasks of building a durable peace welcomed the LLRC Report and its potential and urged its expeditious and determined implementation The authentically concerned liberal or progressive reformer whose motivation is the opening or widening of space and pushing forward of process rather than of denunciatory posturing extends a qualified support to the LLRC findings and recommendations urging a compressed time bound action plan and monitoring rather than damning it out of hand and calling instead for an international inquiry Those who adopt a rejectionist stance towards the LLRC Report run the risk of reducing their political capital as serious ie responsible moderate peace partners They also risk the heightening of perception or misperception of themselves as an agency of external nonSri Lankan interests in a Cold war against the country What this activates is a push factor which functions contrary to the pull factor which must necessarily prevail if political dialogue ethnic reconciliation and nationbuilding are to succeed What lies at the heart of the difficult dialogue between the TNA and the GoSL It is a problem within the collective unconscious as Carl Jung would have it of the two undergirding communities The Sinhalese for their part must recognise that at least from the 1980s the ethnic question has been externalised as repeatedly pointed out at the time by Mervyn de Silva in the Lanka Guardian and that in the globalised 21st century which is an Information Age insisting on the purely internal is pure delusion Similarly the Tamils must realise that there is a contradiction between on the one hand their legitimate desire to be treated as equal citizens with an irreducible minimum of political and cultural space and on the other to be negotiated with as if they were representatives of anothertheir own country or a nation recognised by the world community It is impossible to urge on the one hand equal treatment as Sri Lankan citizens and moderate autonomy as a socioculturally and historically distinct community calling for a reform of the Sri Lankan state and its policies so as to permit such incorporation and on the other hand to regard oneself as a protostate in equal relationship to the Sri Lankan state which is a legitimate political unit in the interstate system The Tamils may regard themselves as a nation hence Tamil National Alliance but this is unshared and unlikely to be shared It is by no means recognised as such within the international community The Tamils are not even recognised as a nonsovereign nation under foreignalienexternal annexation and occupation The TNA does not represent a separate polity or political unit equal to the Sri Lankan state It represents a political subunit a subpolity a periphery or a unit which is striving to engage with and must certainly be engaged by the much larger part so as to constitute and cohere into a better more equitable open and capacious whole"

        "body": "Two events in as many weeks and the Maldives has been making news both on the home front and in the global arena for reasons that had been better left untouched Coming as they did after the successful SAARC Summit in the southern Addu City these developments have the potential to become a major political and poll issue ahead of the presidential elections of 2013 if the current trends remain unreversed The first incident flowed from the SAARC Summit itself Forgetting that Pakistan too was an Islamic State religious fundamentalists in Addu ransacked the SAARC memorial erected by Islamabad for depicting what they claimed were idolatrous unIslamic symbols Customary as Pakistani memorials have mostly been this one carried a bust of Mohammed Ali Jinnah and the nations flag At the foot of the pedestal were reliefs of archaeological finds from the Indus Valley Civilisation sites in the country Fundamentalists first in Addu and later in the political capital of Male claimed that a relief motif represented the Buddha They burnt the whole monument one night and took away the rest It is as yet unclear if their protests were only over the presence of a perceived representation of Lord Buddha who is worshipped in many of the SAARC membernations or it also related to Jinnahs bust as worshipping fellowhumans was also banned in Islam It was possibly not without reason that subsequent to the destruction and disappearance of the Jinnah statue fundamentalists also targeted the Sri Lankan monument a replica of the nations Lion emblem Investigators have to find out if this attack had anything to do with the Buddhist character of Sri Lanka or was aimed at defusing the embarrassment flowing from the earlier attack on another Islamic Republic where again fundamentalism and religious extremism were thriving targeting not just the immediate neighbourhood but the rest of the world at large In contemporary context Pakistan along with neighbouring Afghanistan are considered the global capitals of fundamentalism from where Maldivian groups are perceived as deriving their strength In Pakistan unlike the other two nations certain State agencies are believed to be aiding abetting and funding fundamentalist efforts and for carrying the message to the rest of South Asia and outside too Thus the contradiction in the fundamentalist attack on the Pakistan monument was palpable A full month after the SAARC Summit local media reported that the Nepalese monument for SAARC too has been stolen They quoted officials to say that the theft had taken place when the police on guard duty were in between shifts With three such desecrations the authorities if is said were considering the wisdom of shifting all SAARC monuments to a central place in Addu and providing 24hour police security Unifaith character and flogging The fundamentalists got another shot in the arm not long after when the visiting UN Human Rights Council UNHRC chief Navaneethan Pillay questioned Maldives unifaith character that did not accept nonMuslims as citizens Addressing the Peoples Majlis or Parliament only a week after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh became the first overseas dignitary to do so Pillay also questioned the Maldivian law on flogging of women describing it as inhumane and violating of international commitments by the nation She called for a national debate Since Pillays visit local media has come up with a belated news report citing a lower court ruling that growing beard was close to being a religious obligation for males in the country According to the daily Haveeru Magistrate Ibrahim Hussein in Maafushi Kaaf atoll had overturned a Department of Penitentiary and Rehabilitation Services DPRS regulation that instructs its male employees to shave their beards The DPRS has since challenged the ruling as the magisterial verdict of March 2 has held that the regulation contradicts with Islamic principles and cannot be made in a 100 per cent Muslim country such as Maldives Though wholly unexpected and possibly taken aback after the monumentburning the Government of President Mohammed Nasheed did not lose much time in expressing regret to the Governments of Pakistan and Sri Lanka It also arrested two persons for the desecration of the Pakistani monument The public postures of rival political parties however surprised many President Nasheeds Maldivian Democratic Party MDP was not as unequivocal as the rest It was only to be expected under the circumstances and also given his proliberal attitude and public image but individual MPs did declare that there was no question of permitting the practice of other religions in the country The Opposition parties at one stage seemed to be competing with one another in expressing their solidarity with the Islamic forces Fundamentalist Adhaalath Party AP which had left the Government only recently over religious issues wanted Customs officials who had cleared the banned monument into the country sued A section of the Progressive Party of Maldives PPM founded recently by those owing allegiance to former President Maumoon Gayoom was shriller Undiluted as yet a party leader described the two arrested persons as national heroes and wanted PPM to defend their casecause Other parties including the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party DRP with Thasmeen Ali a former runningmate of Gayoom in the 2008 presidential race could not be seen as being left far behind Some of them including a section in Gayooms PPM sought to draw a distinction between fundamentalism and modernday issues of sovereignty in this regard arguing that installation ofidolatorous monuments and statues challenged the sovereign right of the Maldivian State including Parliament to frame a Constitution and laws that reflected the peoples sentiments and enforce them too Pillays utterances which she repeated at a news conference in Male revived the argument even more as political parties felt uncomfortable about commenting unfavourably an issue involving fellow nations like Pakistan and Sri Lanka To them the former was an Islamic nation as Maldives and the latter the closest neighbour and economic partner too Unacknowledged they were also concerned about possible retaliation in Sri Lanka where a large number of Maldivians reside for work studies or medical care or use as a transitpoint to travel to the rest of the world wwworfonlineorg The writer is a Senior Fellow at Observer Research Foundation"

its report It says The Commission was conscious of the fact that the remit of the Commission required it to report on matters that may have taken place during the period between 21st February 2002 and 19th May 2009 At the same time it also recognised that the causes underlying the grievances of different communities had its genesis in the period prior to the time frame referred to in the Warrant The Commission accordingly provided a degree of flexibility to the representers in this regard It is apprehensible if some institution or some government which is supportive of the 2002 ceasefire agreement between the UNF government and the LTTE is to take pains to find out the reasons for the failure of that agreement However here what might be the motive of a government led by parties that were dead against the ceasefire agreement and therefore prayed for the failure of it when it seeks to examine the factors that had contributed to the fizzling of the agreement One year before the appointment of the LLRC and hard on the heels of the conclusion of the war on May 26 2009 President Rajapaksa and the UN Secretary General BanKiMoon issued a joint statement which said at its tail end The SecretaryGeneral underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law The Government will take measures to address those grievances One may infer that the LLRC was an upshot of that agreement about the accountability issue in respect of the war However the Government never attributed the appointment of the Commission to the joint communiqu issued with the UN Secretary General presumably due to the nationalistic pride of many leaders of the Government They showed it as one of their own concepts Whatever it might be the UN seems to have taken the LLRC as President keeping his word to the UN Secretary General Now that the final report of the Commission has been out 17 months after the institution of the Commission in spite of its original term being six months many seem to have instantly expressed their readymade responses without going deep into the report which runs into 388 pages Many apparently have anticipated a verdict on some particular incidents such as the famous white flag incident where three prominent LTTE leaders were said to have been shot dead after they surrendered with white flags to the troops during the last days of the war Since there are no such verdicts in the report they seem to have opted to reject outright the report despite its many serious recommendations to the Government such as the one to probe the incidents where some LTTE leaders allegedly went missing after being taken away by the troops Despite its State Colour in many places the Commission report is no doubt an indepth research paper on the ethnic issue and it strongly recommends the implementation of meaningful devolution of power with a view to resolve the ethnic problem Here are some of the relevant excerpts To this end there should be no room for triumphalism The Commission takes the view that the root causes of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka lies in the failure of successive governments to address the genuine grievances of the Tamil people A political solution is imperative to address the causes of the conflict To this end a political settlement based on devolution must address the ethnic problem as well as other serious problems that threaten the democratic institutions It is also imperative that the lessons learnt from the shortcomings in the functioning of the Provincial Councils system be taken into account in devising an appropriate system of devolution that addresses the needs of the people An additional mechanism that may be considered is the possibility of establishing a Second Chamber comprising representatives from the provinces The challenge now before the government is to implement the recommendations of its own Commission especially those on the investigations into the incidents of disappearances of persons and the devolution of power It is a challenge when considering the report of a similar committee the All Party Representative Committee APRC that recommended greater devolution before the last Presidential Election had gone missing AMID THE FESTIVITY LET US NOT MISS THE REALITY By MSMAyub LLRCAN

        "body": "A war that began with lies damn lies and weapons of mass deception is supposed to have ended with another heap of lies Lest we forget the eightyearandninemonth long US military and neocolonialist presence in Iraq was based on fictitious claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and that it had links with the 911 attacks These claims made repeatedly by the then US President George W Bush and the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair who came to be known as the US presidents lapdog were dressed up in false evidence and specialeffect dramas They included the then US Secretary of State Collin Powels powerpoint presentation at the UN Security Council purportedly showing Saddam Husseins mobile labs for WMDs and Blairs sexedup dossier which was later found to be a part of a thesis of an Egyptian student rather than any facts based on intelligence It is no big secret today that the Iraq war was preconceived Prizewinning journalist Bob Woodward in his book Plan of Attack says one of the first duties President Bush entrusted the then Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld with was to prepare a plan to invade Iraq President Bush after a National Security Council meeting takes Don Rumsfeld aside collars him physically and takes him into a little cubbyhole room and closes the door and says What have you got in terms of plans for Iraq What is the status of the war plan I want you to get on it I want you to keep it secret Woodward says in his book The war was part of a grand plan aimed at extending US military dominance to all parts of the globe Known as the Project for the New American Century PNAC this plan authored by hardline neoconservatives who are proZionist and procapitalist or proone percent as the greedy Wall Street elite are known today was a blueprint for military conquests of Middle Eastern nations that posed a threat to USIsraeli interests In retrospect the PNAC stamp is not only evident in the invasion of Iraq but also in the Libyan war and probably in the ongoing moves against Syria and Iran The United States spent more than one trillion dollars on the war and sacrificed more than 4800 soldiers What has been a loss to the US public or the economy was a gain to war profiteers such as the then Vice President Dick Cheneys Halliburton and other war industry giants like General Electric and Bechtel But little is spoken about the one million plus Iraqis who died as a result of the war or about the war crimes committed by US troops especially in Falluja where the alleged use of depleted uranium or other secret weapons is being blamed for a high number of births of deformed children Also not mentioned in the Western corporate media were the shame of Abu Ghraib sex torture and the horror of Haditha where scores of civilians were killed in a manner that would rank Bushs Marines with Hitlers Nazi forces True Saddam Hussein was a tyrant who should have been ousted long before the US invasion in March 2003 When the Iraqis rebelled against him in the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991 the US pretended to be supporting them but later allowed him to massacre them This was because the US felt there was little space for a puppet government if the revolution had succeeded But ten years later there was a PNAC plan along with a hawkish president to effect regime change in the oilrich country The plan ensured that Washington had full control of events not only during the war and occupation but also after the war Yes full control is the name of the game and the ground reality today Will the US after making so vast an investment and so colossal a human sacrifice withdraw from Iraq and let neighbouring Iran fill the vacuum The Americans have not withdrawn from Iraq although President Obama brags that he has fulfilled his campaign promise But what he does not say is that he took three years to do it instead of 16 months as he promised It appears that the game of deception continues Even the socalled troop withdrawal is also a charade because Obama has kept behind a massive diplomatic force in Baghdad and other key cities where US oil interests are at stake Well the Americans appear to have set a world record for posting the largest number of diplomats in one embassy more than 16000 A few of them are diplomats in the professional or conventional sense of the word some of them are military experts who will be monitoring the security situation and neighbouring Iran but most of them will be private security officers or mercenaries like Raymond Davis the CIA operative who shot dead two Pakistani youths in Lahore early this year and got away Perhaps the lesson learnt in Pakistan during the Davis affair has prompted the State Department to give these mercenaries a diplomatic label so that they would be spared jail when they kill Iraqis or commit any crime in Iraq So the claim that the Americans have withdrawn leaving behind some 150 troops to train Iraqi forces may be technically correct on paper but in reality it is not Besides thousands of American troops are stationed in Kuwait on the border with Iraq ready to be deployed when the need arises while the Central Command set up in Qatar is yet to be dismantled and Bahrain hosts the US Fifth Fleet Such a monstrous military presence in the troubled region is of course to protect the US economic and strategic interests with the main focus being Iraqs oil sector which has virtually fallen into the hands of US and Western oil giants Then there is also the need to check Irans rising military power in the region Reports indicate that while the West has been trying to stop Iran from making nuclear weapons the Islamic Republic has acquired advanced cyberwar capabilities to bring down drones and hack into spy satellites Though Irans achievements have caused alarm in western capitals and in Israel the US feels they are all the more reason to maintain a heavy military presence in the region But what is more disturbing for peacestarved Iraqis and peaceloving people in the rest of the world are fears of Iraq plunging into a sectarian hellhole Already Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki a Shiite has read the riot act to the Sunni Vice President Tariq alHashimi who has fled the capital and found refuge in the autonomous Kurdistan region The main charge against the Vice President is that he ran a death squad The political tension has the potential to spark sectarian clashes with regional implications Perhaps Saudi Arabia Turkey Iran and even Syria could be drawn into the conflict Yesterdays deadly bomb blasts perhaps portended the beginning of it"

        "body": "The United Nations since the collapse of Soviet Russia USSR and the end of cold war was more or less functioning as an arm of United States of America During the last 20 years this situation prevailed at the UN climate Change negotiations as well Climate Change threatens all living species on earth The climate negotiations started way back in 1990 and climate talks continued for a 20 year period across 17 climate summits without any significant progress The United States of America was at the center of the climate negotiations as it was the main culprit contributing to climate change Although the US is home to only 4 percent of the worlds population the United States has been responsible for 29 percent of carbon emissions over the past 150 years This is three times as much as Chinas contribution On average each person in the US emitted 720 tons of CO2 per year from 1960 to 2005 That is almost 14 times Indias per capita emissions 55 times Sri Lankas per capita emissions and ninety times the per capita emissions of the people of Kenya during the same period Even today the emission of an average American is about 27 times that of a Sri Lanka Despite having only a 4 percent of global population America was the worlds largest carbon emitter till 2006 and is still the second highest CO2 emitter in the world next to China which has 20 percent of the world population The principle agreed at the very beginning of the climate change negotiations is common but differentiated responsibility This means that all countries need to act to mitigate climate change but certain countries have a greater responsibility Why is this When the carbon in fossil fuels is released to the atmosphere while burning the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere increases When carbon concentration increases the global temperature increases If the global temperature increase is to be limited to 2 degrees centigrade against preindustrial levels then the total amount that can be emitted needs to be limited This limit is called the carbon budget As there is a limitation the issue of equity emerges If it is a limited volume that can be emitted then all should have a fair share of it The developed countries had been burning fossil fuels and releasing carbon for a longer period than the developing countries and even at present the per capita emission level of developed countries is very high Hence the developing countries should be allowed to occupy a larger share of the remaining carbon space over developed countries That is why the developed countries have a greater responsibility to mitigate Being the largest emitter the US is the country that should lead the mitigation process from the front Unfortunately it is not country that has a track record for fairness and justice and is the biggest climate terrorist in the world The United Nations has tried to curb this specific nation for the last 20 years In 1997 the UN managed to tame America and convince them that they should take aggressive measures to reduce their carbon emissions by 17 percent during the period 20082012 against their 1997 level However the expectations were short lived as Gorge W Bush withdrew from Kyoto Protocol even before the start of the commitment period Instead of reducing their emissions level by 17 percent as agreed at Kyoto the US continued to increase its level by a further 5 percent by 2007 On the other hand the 4th Assessment report of the IPCC published in 2007 highlighted that the US should reduce its carbon emissions by 3050 percent by 2020 against its 2007 level if humankind is to limit global warming to 2 degrees centigrade and thereby have fighting chance for survival It is clear that the US is robbing the carbon space of developing countries in direct violation of UN climate change decisions Fortunately due to the financial crisis that occurred in the US it could not further increase its emissions level since 2007 Now the US is using its veto power to avoid taking decisions at climate change conferences This veto power is vested in them not due to being a member of Security Council of the UN but due to being the largest polluter in the world The developing world during this period continued their efforts and tried to negotiate with US at the UN conferences to protect their environmental space without much success UN had a last try to get the commitment of US to agree to emission reduction target at the recently concluded Durban climate conference The United States blocked these moves and undermined progressive countries from taking action The US played the quiet man role at the Durban summit and refused to commit to set dates for legally binding emissions reduction targets Contdon Page 16 Towards a UN without US ContdFrom Page 8 An extraordinary move was needed to prevent a climate catastrophe At Durban the European Union together with the Alliance of Small Island States Aosis the Least Developed Countries LDCs and some other developing countries who are vulnerable to climate change tried their best to get a result at Durban The emerging economies of Brazil and the host South Africa supported the move Canada which should have reduced its emissions by 6 percent against its 1990 level has by 2009 increased its emissions by 20 percent and acted contrary to what was agreed at Kyoto Canada had no other option but to speak against a Kyoto second commitment period and to take most of the heat at the Durban conference on behalf of US as the US was barely visible at the negotiating table Without the active participation of America the climate talks reached its official deadline without any conclusion It was clear then that UN climate talks cannot proceed any further with US It was the time to think of a UN without US The developing world led by China and India took the bold decision of addressing the issue of climate change without the worlds biggest polluter the US at the expense of climate justice Finally thirtysix hours after the climate change conference official closing time the developing countries together with the EU agreed to ignore US and to proceed towards climate compatible development At the end a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon even though the major polluters US Japan Canada and Russia were not participating Further all developing countries led by China and India agreed to work towards a legally binding targets though they will miss the opportunity to have fair share of carbon emissions forever The European Union will place its current emissioncutting pledges inside the legallybinding Kyoto Protocol a key demand of developing countries Talks on a new legal deal covering all countries will begin next year and end by 2015 coming into effect by 2020 Management of a fund for climate aid to poor countries has also been agreed though how to raise the money has not Is this a win for America At a glance it is so however in the long run it is defeat for US as it got geopolitically isolated on climate in Durban Isolating the US does not mean giving them power but significantly suggests that the rest of the world can move without them The US was demolishing the climate talks and continuing the blame game by pointing fingers at China and India For America its an immense failure of leadership and loss of prestige as a leader in global attempts to deal with catastrophic global warming President Barak Obama proved once again that for America Change No they cant It is now clear that there is no future for America without a change Compromise made by the developing countries is not a weakness but it is going to be their strength The developing world has realized that their development path is no more laid along emitting more and more carbon by burning fossil fuels In the future the developing world will establish not the fossil fuel infrastructure but climate compatible infrastructure The developing world will no more follow the footsteps of the developed world but bypass the fossil fuel route and will be pioneering the technologies of the new era China has already started that and others will soon follow Step by step it will become a battle between the US and the rest of the world where the weaker opponent will undoubtedly be the US Imposing sanctions on the US compelling it to mitigate climate change may be a reality in the years to come Durban is not the end but a beginning of a new era of climate talks"

pattern At last the aircraft made a perfect touchdown at its destination the airport in DurbanSouth Africa Durban always reminds me of Mahatma Gandhi About hundred and fifty years ago the British colonials brought Indian indentured labourers to South Africa for sugar cane plantation work Gandhi was a practicing lawyer who subsequently ventured into politics using nonviolence as a novel tool to deal against violent western imperialism Presently in Durban South Africa a new form of nonviolence movement is under way It is the crusade against global warming perpetrated by the same violent western imperialism in the name of development The latest Climate Change Conference or COP 17 was held in DurbanSouth Africa It is one of the BASIC countries in which others are emerging super powers Brazil China and India Playing host to the Summit Conference South Africa which leads fifty six countries of the Arabian Union is now a key player in Climate Change deliberations Once been a neglected and exploited continent Africa is now rapidly growing at a rate of six percent surpassing its former conquerors and exploiters such as North America and Europe and it is presently open towards China India and Asia at large It is common knowledge that our planet is getting warmer and warmer endangering the very existence of its living beings What makes it so and who could be held responsible for it Human beings have achieved their so called development over the years as a result of burning fossil fuels such as gas oil or coal Eighty percent of present day activities depend on fossil fuels without which the global economy may crunch and vanish However the negative effect of burning fossil fuel is that it releases carbon dioxide and other gases resulting in global warming The United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization WMO were instrumental in formulating the Intergovernmental Panel Committee on Climate Change IPCCC in 1988 as a new independent scientific body Having studied matters related to climate changes and global warming patterns with their causes and effects the IPCCC published its first assessment report in 1990 Based on that report the United Nations framework convention on climate change UNFCCC was established Its final text of the agreement was adopted in United Nations headquarters New York in May 1992 and the Convention was opened for signatures at Rio Earth Summit in June 1992 The next Earth Summit Rio 20 Plus is scheduled to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012 In this regard it is interesting to note that although the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 it was activated only in September 2005 According to IPCCC assessments the global warming should be restricted to two degrees centigrade and the emission of carbon di oxide should also be curtailed to a level below 450 ppm if we are to prevent the planet from heading towards a catastrophic environmental disaster at 5050 probabilities It also has been warned that beyond 2 degree Centigrade bio carbon hidden underneath icecaps Thermo frost would be released causing serious problems to the atmosphere In the wake of these alarming findings the Kyoto Protocol having identified 39 most developed or polluted countries as being high emitting countries wanted them to cut their emission level collectively by 5 percent with respect to 1990 emission level However as a concessional measure it was proposed that the relevant countries be allowed to adhere to the stipulated emission cut levels only after the first commitment or transition period beginning from 2008 and ending in 2012 Joint implementation Emission Trading and Clean Development Mechanism are the three mechanisms been included in the first commitment period The joint implementation was assigned to industrialized countries whilst the emission trading was assigned to West and the former Soviet Federation countries The under developed and developing countries were to make clean energy and conservation efforts avoiding fossil fuels and they were made eligible to get emission trading permits from Annexure 1 countries That was how the Carbon Trading was initiated At the Summit it was noted that for the bargaining purposes of the industrialized countries various intergovernmental bodies such as the least developed countries LDC the small island nations and the tropical forest associations were been formed Also the other intergovernmental organizations like G77 China African Union Arab League and SAARAC countries were seen playing a significant political maneuvering at the climate discussions Adaptation and mitigation were identified as two processes to meet the challenges of climate change related issues Accordingly Technological Transfers Capacity Building and formation of climate green fund was suggested and ratified Many discussions took place and COP meetings held Having identified many matters related the crisis experiences ideas and information related to cyclones floods droughts sea level risings earth quacks spread of vector bone diseases and extinction of bio diversity etc were exchanged However the root cause for the problem remained unresolved Burning fossil fuels has increased many folds Since 1990 the emission level has risen by fifty percent It had been 8309 million tons in 1990 whilst 12493 million tons in 2009 Also the intensity and the frequency of environmental disasters have increased significantly However there had been no way of preventing any further addition of fossil fuel As I entered the conference venue in Durban I noticed that the atmosphere prevailed there was less enthusiastic than what we experienced at Bali 2007 Poznan 2008 and Copenhagen 2009 In view of the Fukushima disaster it seemed that everybody was playing safe by keeping silent about the use of Nuke as an alternate energy It was obvious that due to the economic crisis prevailing in countries in Europe and North America they were only interested in more growth and not in any unpopular austerity measures So in order to continue with their burning of fossil fuels they had no alternative than to defer the problem perhaps to be solved by the next generation A scientist who was much concerned about the impending calamity at the conference clearly spelt out that the future generation is our generation and that disastrous two degree centigrade increase may happen in 2035 He further said that if we are not going to cut our emission level by 2015 we will be faced with very serious environmental problems in 2030 A calculation showed that in order to put the environment in order for at least forty percent probability all the coal plants in the world should be shut down by 2030 The million dollar question is as to who is going to cut their emissions The United States and Canada backed out from the Kyoto Protocol manifesting the fact that their AngloSaxon arrogance is far from over It is a pity that the United Nations Organization and other world bodies are being incapacitated from imposing any sanctions against these countries for their crime against humanity The so called developed countries shamefully relocate their pollution in free trade zones and export zones in developing countries and adding insult to injury the former ask the latter to cut their emissions Under these circumstances it is quite natural for the least developed and developing countries to fault the developed countries for their carbon debts and agitate for their right to develop I observed two emerging trends in Durban The first is that North America getting increasingly marginalized by Europe and the other is China and India embroiled each other in many issues coming forward with new proposals The Chinese presence in Bali Poznan or even Copenhagen was hardly noticed However the presence of China is now getting increasingly noticed especially due to its possession of the most cost effective renewable energy technology solar and wind and more importantly its sound financial position required for implementation of its plans When China proposed emission cuts to be made effective from 2020 the developed countries excluding European Union raised objections to it However they finally settled down for a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol and accordingly go in for mandatory agreements in 2015 By that time I hope China India Brazil South Africa and Indonesia would be able to lead climate discussions with the progressive support from the European countries Since Asia is now moving and shaping the new world it is high time it leads the sustainable development and green growth whilst imposing green sanctions against the USA and Canada This double dip global economic crisis may end up creating a new sustainable future if we were to fulfill our historical responsibility"

        "body": "The report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission LLRC was presented by the government to Parliament last Friday The government has opened its magic box which it claimed had answers to all the accusations that were levelled against it during the twoandahalf year period since the end of the war However this has been exposed before society as just an empty box that could not perform any tricks The only trump card the government held as an answer to the international accusations regarding the conduct of the security forces during the war was the LLRC What the government expected from the LLRC was not to learn any lessons or for reconciliation but to create a strong reply to the international community Setting up such commissions after the end of civil wars is not a novel experience The Truth and Reconciliation Commission established after the end of the civil war in South Africa was one such commission This commission was not an answer to the international community instead it was a means of discovering ways to minimize animosity and erase mistrust However the LLRC was set up to show the world that a local mechanism exists for the process of accountability This was a counter measure to the threat faced by the government of an international mechanism being set up with the direct involvement of the UN or the International Human Rights Council In such a situation compiling an incomplete report that merely brushes the surface of a civil war that existed for more than three decades is a very risky move Incomplete conclusions and incomplete proposals that are arrived based on incomplete information would complicate the issue further In such a situation the stand the government took stating the Darusman commission report was unilateral would have no validity It is no coincidence that such pathetic destinies are met when answers not solutions for issues are sought not for exploration examination and implementation but to please or deceive others The Commission showed inadequate qualities from its inception The commission was not assigned to review the separatism that was active militarily for more than 30 years or local factors and historical conditions that influenced its birth On the other hand the commission did not have as its objective to review the contributions from neighbouring India towards the activities of separatist forces The commission had to review only incidents that occurred during the period from the signing of the ceasefire agreement to the end of the war Here too they were expected just to scratch the surface without going into the depth of socioeconomicpolitical factors that influenced the war There were accusations that the functioning of the commission from May 2010 to May 2011 did not create opportunities for a broad section of the masses to express their views There were charges that sufficient time was not given when evidence was recorded from the people in the North and the East and certain political groups affiliated to the government threatened those who came forward to give evidence before the commission The government has not been able to establish civil administration in the North The commission of the government too has not realized this situation or it has been careful not to embarrass the government by exposing it The commission that has made a very meek suggestion of investigating the EPDP a faction of the government is insensitive to the governments political pressure applied in suppressing the public opinion in the North and denying political rights to other parties The commission expresses its satisfaction for the withdrawal of emergency regulations but does recognise that this act has been nullified due to the continuation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act PTA As the commission has made the period of war its field of inquiry it like a man walking with closed eyes at noon avoids suggesting any solutions for issues of the disappeared and those who are detained under the PTA As such it is futile to judge or consider proposals of the report as good or bad ones For the commission has been unable not only to find solutions for the challenging task of reconciliation between communities which it was named for but has not even been able to question acts that hinder reconciliation process such as the undemocratic administration of the government and nonestablishment of good governance Most of the recommendations of the commissions are what the government should have done before According to todays expression they are expired goods The government should contain the risk of marketing expired goods internationally and locally This is the challenge the government will have to face when the report is presented as an answer"

        "body": "It was a political case both by the critics of the Government within and sections of the international community that the LLRC was not aimed at or empowered to address accountability issues in terms of war crimes The absence of a military experts on the panel should have made clear that a tactical understanding of the ground situation at any given hour in a fastpaced war at times was impossible for the commission to comprehend for it to draw conclusions In the final analysis the Commission has sought to distance the political leadership and the military command from what was alleged to be a deliberate policybased elimination of Tamil civilians It has expressed inability to fix responsibility but has conceded that there had been considerable civilian casualties and that the retaliation by the armed forces might have been excessive in some cases Such findings however limited in their scope should fly on the Governments persistent claims to a zerocasualty war It might have been the latters intent but did not necessarily translate into reality If nothing else the LLRCs observations about possible wrongdoing in individual cases should argue that the armed forces was not as professional as certified Otherwise there would be more to answer for The LLRCs suggestion for the Government to further probe individual cases of the kind including those relating to disappearances implies an internal probe by the armed forces possibly in the form of courtmartials after due investigation It would be pertinent to find out if the 70008000 courtmartialled cases when jailed Sarath Fonseka was the commander of the armed forces related to the incidents brought to the LLRC Yet there is truth in the Commissions findings that the armed forces deliberately went slow if only to avoid civilian casualties In the concluding weeks and months of Eelam War IV the Government did create a nowar zone announceorder discontinuance of heavy artillery and airpower and declared a fortnightlong ceasefire As nations that prodded Sri Lanka into these the international community should be comparing their past notes where the cause for their demands too would have been pencilled in The military view and civilian understanding of reconstruction theories of such nature elsewhere are different from the unanimity often occurring in contemporary Sri Lanka or in any other nation that feels similarly beleaguered This applies as much to assessment of warsituations as postwar developments like the one evidenced when the US military attach in their Colombo Embassy brought out at an international conference some time ago The threeman Darussman Report commissioned by UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon is similarly inadequate in fixing responsibility for the civilian deaths The report has sought further probe in the matter The decision of the TNA nearer home and a host of international human rights groups to present their case if any before the LLRC may have denied them an opportunity whatever be their reservations otherwise While mandated to probe the runup to the ethnic wars and violence the LLRC has discussed the continuance of paramilitaries in the postwar era too This may be considered a part of the commissions study of reconciliation issues but has stopped mostly at that By naming the EPDP the commission has shown that Robert Blake the US Assistant Secretary of State was not alone in his assessment Symbolism to read meaningful even if not wholly effective should be unrestrained Rather than holding that the Sri Lankan State owed an apology to the Tamil people for the deliberate wrongdoings of the political leadership the LLRC has found it adequate to ask the political parties to tender a collective apology to the people at large The suggestion for the Government to consider compensation payment likewise should have commenced with the victims of Pogrom83 if not their early counterparts In tabling the LLRC Report before Parliament Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva promised that the armed forces would be withdrawn from community life and decisionmaking at those levels He was unclear if at all about the need for withdrawing the armed forces to their barracks though there may be justification for continuing with their existing camps in erstwhile war zones and elsewhere in the country For the lessons from the LLRC to be effective the Government needs to do more in terms of the Report and beyond The silence thus on the Commissions recommendation for delinking the police force from the charge of the Defence Ministry stands out At the same time the suggestion for creating branches of the AttorneyGenerals office in Provincial capitals to speed up legal advice for the police could extend to cover other departments if only aimed at capacitybuilding Implied otherwise in the LLRCs recommendation in this regard could be decentralisation not devolution of powers to the Provinces Reconciliation was at the core of LLRCs work but by not talking about it in political and administrative terms the Commission may have pushed the ball back to the Government even without playing it It rests there what with the Government continuing to hold talks with the TNA on the one hand and pushing for a PSC at the same time"

warning from such opinion makers Words of Channa and Anura were a red alert made me raise the antenna The message heard is loud and clear This government with a 23 majority is performing poorly to that elected in 2005 without a majority on whose success the war was won in 2009 rewarded with overwhelming gratitude with election victories coming up to 2011 due to the smart footwork of the 2005

government it is sliding ominously towards the passive negative gradient enthusiasm for the UPFA is gone but it has not worked its way to the UNP Where it will float time will only tell The search embarked was to find reasons for the fault line Answer came easy those wearing UNP underwear carry forward UNP policies dressed in UPFA overalls with their loyalists in tow leaving the party policies out in the cold There are no monitors in the class to check on them The old left left in the party is left to sounds alone Rumblings among the microscopic nationalist forces in the government are not taken seriously their days in the government are numbered for their own sustainability Last time there were 41 JVP members to keep vigil on a minority government Those who made a dent in the UNP by leaving are presently damaging MR fatally What the UNP is incapable of doing from their home run is happening from an unforeseen inside track Those whom MR took over deceptively from the UNP have openly taken over his party UNP still stands detested having not gained mileage on UPFA unconscious imitation of its image with an inverted U turn to the far right UPFA can push forward a UNP agenda more effectively since it is not sold as a handicraft of Sri Kotha Regaining Sri Lanka gains more distance on a UPFA track and carries with it the same fallout The blame is thrust on UNP turncoats presently in political or administrative garb now holding key positions Both budgets after 2009 elections did not give the distressed a whiff of relief while receiving subdued encores from commercial chambers Rajapaksa understandably finds crossovers with their undivided personal loyalty to him trustworthier than his party men They have no other to turn to for the moment He believes they are more efficient and effective rightly or wrongly UNP policies with high spending mega projects mimicked like the failed Commonwealth Games bid does not attract the UPFA electorate There is nothing in it for the people as worthless as the Suriyakanda stadium The Rajapaksa regime has made life better for the rural sector that was the backbone of the old SLFP Understanding the rural mind MR concentrates on their welfare and gains goodwill often lost on the crossovers of many who hold the office key to the economy President for convenience allows them to manage the government and involves himself too late to make rectification The prevailing corruption monumental waste and extravaganza directly stares in the face of the executive with loose talk making it still worse Its Karus Karumaya if called upon to lead the UNP He stands stronger if he breaks away and forms his own front like the late Gamini and Lalith for much of the UNP will follow the pied piper Those who wont join the UNP like the JVP or the Fonseka few will find him more acceptable Many in the present government from the UNP at the appropriate moment may do a Karu Jayasuriya the reverse somersault Most of all to many who voted for MR UNP is a prohibited word But a new name can conjure appeal So maybe its better for Jayasuriya to lose his party stakes Does Jayasuriya have the energy fire and dynamism shown by the DUNF of Gamini and Lalith Without the party machinery can he invent a new vehicle His decision to accept a portfolio under MR haunts him for life Unless Jayasuriya gives leadership to the Opposition more will join the MR administration The moment the candidature of Jayasuriya was mooted Ranil became a caricature in the UNP Defeats at elections and relentless defections makes it impossible for Wickreme singhe to stage a comeback He is graceful in adversity Strength to Jayasuriyas dormant muscle will come from latent foreign sources determined to bring the Rajapaksas down for winning the war in the way they achieved it Handling of the LLRC recommendations is to the government like insulin is to a diabetic It needs adroit tact MR may well resort to doing what he knows best raise the cry of foreign interventions and wave the patriotic flag to rally the people In his stead is the role of a proved achiever This might attract the tide that is turning away from him"

ethnic based hate and violence women who have suffered on any basis of reckoning be it loss of a husband of children of security of person as a woman or just the simple factor of the inability to provide a home to ones family and more importantly the general fear syndrome of having lived through the war for three decades To apportion responsibility for the war is of secondary importance although the reconciliation process must necessarily take cognizance of this aspect objectively in order to build the necessary bridges for reconciliation through restorative justice and avoid being retributive While the measures referred to above focuses on the North East it would be amiss if the trauma faced by rest of the country particularly those living in the villages bordering the North and East are ignored The ordeal of speculating about an unseen enemy with the power to subject a population en masse to terror attacks is immense By the end of the war it became possible to distinguish between the terrorist and the Tamil people who themselves were for most of the time victims of an extraordinary situation and has created an unimaginable amount of empathy for the ethnic minority communities The information that gradually seeped in about the untold suffering that the minorities had faced had such an impact on the rest of the country that a spontaneous peace constituency has sprung up without the need for initiating any awareness programs Many polls conducted to assess the mood of the South towards reconciliation and cohabitation support this assumption The Presidents Address at the UN The President in his speech at the General Assembly on the 23rd of September 2010 stated The entire focus of the nation is now on building a lasting peace healing wounds ensuring economic prosperity and guaranteeing the rights of the whole nation to live in harmony to fulfil these aspirations economic development and political reconciliation must go hand in hand Towards this end the constitution which appropriately reflects the aspirations of our people will evolve with full participation of all stakeholders Among them the challenges we face the greatest is healing the wounds of the recent past This statement reflects the ideology as well as intent of the President to address the reconciliation rehabilitation and reconstruction processes comprehensively using a multi pronged approach not only in the North and the East but in the entirety of the country Why then are we not hearing the bells of joy ringing in the North and East Where have the missteps been Many reasons are available a few are discussed below Past Experiments at Resolution of the Ethnic Conflict A Saga of Failure The conventional strategy to heal the wounds of the past and establish healthy trends in interpersonal relationships would be to adopt well tested techniques of negotiation used in conflict resolution Direct negotiation or the use of independent intermediary or intermediaries has been the options used in situations similar to the Sri Lankan case To make the process acceptable negotiations cannot be entirely a government initiative but must be a multi pronged one with a well structured format arrived at by consensual agreement by all the participating parties Sri Lanka has experimented at resolution of the nations long standing ethnic conflict through many avenues direct negotiations between the government and the political parties representing nonminority interests through international mediation as in the case of the Thimpu talks through external facilitators as with the Norwegians through the process of Parliamentary Select Committee All Party Conference used twice and lastly the LLRC Commission the last two specially mandated by the governments of the time the past and the present While awaiting the publication by the government of the LLRC Report submitted to the President the political decision makers are once again experimenting with the process of using a Parliamentary Select Committee to search for ways and means of achieving peaceful cohabitation within a plural society So far the processes that have been experimented with have failed for several reasons Primarily because the political will to settle the problem has never been unequivocally conveyed to the public to ensure the creation of an appropriate environment for confidence and consensus building measures to take root The premise for the resolution of the problem has been an ever shifting platform consistency in attitudes and approach being volatile from the beginning post 56 to date Within this confusing paradigm the overall approach becomes most controversial when the question is posed as to whether there is an ethnic problem at all now that the war is over sometimes the subject of discrimination as a major contributing factor to the ethnic problem is considered merely as perceptions and not as a fundamental concern Yet another hurdle continues to be the persistent dilemma as to how much to concede for devolution raising once again the question of the inherent rights of minorities citizens of the country In the past experiments in negotiations for resolution of the ethnic problem what made matters more complex was the failure by all the negotiating parties to understand the basic principles of compromise of give and take in a negotiation process It is a given factor that in a shared responsibility to find solutions no one party can expect to secure 100 of their demands and concessions are a must if the process is to work It is simply a question of take some give some Another drawback has been that once decisions were arrived at it should have been understood that all participating persons equals in decision making were jointly bound to uphold the decisions taken However many times in the past the governments have time and again rescinded from implementing successfully concluded agreements under various pressures political and religious This is only possible when the concept of equal partners is merely a theoretical position and the government takes shelter within its authoritative role taking the mantle as the only effective decision maker This failure to abide by the concept of equal partners as well as the obligation to uphold negotiated agreements have been a constant feature in all the past and present attempts at resolving the ethnic problemHitherto the prevalence of a mood of combat rather than compromise and conciliation has wrecked many a well worked out process a major failing not only of the government but also of the minorities as well During the height of the ethnic war what contributed to over extension by the Tamil terrorists was the confidence they placed on combat to the total neglect of compromise With the conclusion of the war this is no longer a relevant factor The major impediment to success continues to be the difficulty to come to terms over substantive matters For example the government is reluctant to implement police and land powers and the North East merger provided for in the 13th Amendment while the Tamil parties remain adamant to have these constitutional provisions operational The government is in deniaI of its constitutional obligations In fairness to the majority it must be stated that there is a serious fear that the North East merger will lead to a loss of a large portion of the coastline affecting the security of the rest of the country as well as make the majority increasingly insular crammed up in a small area of the land mass On the other hand the insistence by the minorities on the merger projects a non conciliatory approach especially in view of the fact that the principle of merger can be worked out by making use of the clause in the 13th Amendment that permit two or more provincial councils to work together This can be considered a soft alternative to the merger Since this has been a persistent demand from the outset the TNA seems to find it difficult to give up on this even as a compromise gesture If despite this option the TNA continues with the request for a merger then suspicions arise of sinister motives behind such a demand Having put an end to terrorism there is a strong claim made by the establishment that development of the economy will bring about integration and peace and that in the post conflict scenario negotiation will not be necessary because there is now nothing or nobody to negotiate with This point of view will not be helpful in confidence building The governments pedestrian attitude to constitutionalism does not help in confidencebuilding either as there is a growing fear that all agreements are susceptible to reversal by the government at any given time The possibility remains real with the governments steam roller majority in parliament that can be used at any given time The alternate strategy sought in home grown solutions adds further to the impermanence of any agreement as there remains scope for fresh home grown solutions to emerge from time to time Another dimension to the already complex situation is the appeal by the minorities to the international community to support their cause which quite naturally is looked upon as intimidation by the government as well as intrusion into the domestic matters by outsiders By pursuing such options the minorities alienate themselves as loyalty to ones country is questioned Such choices create suspicion and hostility while what is required is to build trust To be continued"

        "body": "Rich countries seldom compromise their national interests for the greater good of the world at large This was the moral of the Durban climate summit which ended achieving only a postponement Political scientist Harold Laski once said A state divided into a small number of rich and a large number of poor will always develop a government manipulated by the rich to protect the amenities represented by their property By extension the saying also applies at the international level We could say a world divided into a small number of rich nations and a large number of poor ones will inherit a system which is manipulated by the rich to protect their wealthamassing instruments at the cost of misery to the poor One such rich nation that epitomizes this saying is Canada On Monday Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol virtually killing it Though the treaty is not the best of instruments to control the global temperature rises and their adverse impacts it is regarded as a stepping stone to a comprehensive climate deal Canada said on Monday that it was unable to meet the Kyoto limits on greenhouse gas emissions or buy carbon credits arguing that noncompliance with the treaty would mean that it would have to pay a 14 billion fine or every Canadian would have to bear an additional financial burden of 1600 dollars But the announcement dealt a death blow to the Kyoto Protocol as it encourages other polluters to consider similar exits from the antiglobal warming treaty which in any case expires at the end of next year In other words Canada is not prepared to sacrifice its economic growth or wealth amassing process at the cost of adhering to the Kyoto deal Compliance with the treaty will hurt Canadas booming oil sands sector which is the countrys largest greenhouse gas emitter Canadas Environment Minister Peter Kent said the withdrawal allowed his country to continue to create jobs and growth and avoid paying a 14 billion fine for not meeting the treatys emission targets The justification exposes Canadas moral nakedness The withdrawal from the treaty came as no shock to those who are aware of Canadas ultra nationalist or neoconservative foreign policy Overtly Canada appears to be championing human rights promoting democracy and opening its doors to those who flee alleged persecution in their home countries But its record tells a different story its complicity in imperialist crimes Canada contributed troops to George W Bushs invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq and joined in the bombing raids on Libya Its hands are stained with the blood of more than a million civilians killed in the three conflicts Besides Canada under its present Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a staunch supporter of the Zionist state of Israel and vehemently opposes a solution to the Palestinian question based on justice and fair play With a major polluter putting self or 35 million Canadians before the wellbeing of the 6 billion 965 million comprising the rest of the world people it is hardly surprising that the Durban climate talks produced only an agreement on a future agreement Ministers and experts from nearly 200 countries on Sunday could only agree to a 2015 deadline for a new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol Needless to say environmentalists and climate scientists slammed the Durban talks as a tragic failure and accused the politicians of putting the planet on the fast track to doom although optimists hailed the outcome saying that for the first time three major polluters China the United States and India had agreed to negotiate legallybinding emissions limits under a new treaty Like Canada on Monday the US had also dealt a killer punch to the Kyoto Treaty That was when the Bush administration in 2001 under pressure from the industrial lobby threw out the treaty which the previous Bill Clinton administration had agreed to ratify The Bush administration however said it would not ratify a onesided deal that gave bigtime polluters such as China India and Brazil a free pass Such undercurrents continued to plague climate talks and were visible at Durban too with the European Union pulling in one direction while the US Canada China Russia Brazil and India pulled in another direction In this tug o war the poor developing countries which are the worst hit by climate change tried to pull the talks in the right direction but failed The undercurrents at Durban were that no deal was greater than the economic interests of the developed world or rapidly developing countries such as China and India In other words the industrialized nations would continue to pollute the environment while paying lipservice to measures aimed at keeping the global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius in the coming years The developed world has caused enough damage to the environment They became rich by plundering the poor nations resources and causing harm to the environment The best climate deal is one that also ensures a fair distribution of the global wealth The existing carbon quota system is probably one such method whereby the rich nations which use up their carbon quota fast can buy unused quotas from the poor at a decent price However it needs to be further streamlined so that it would not lead to corrupt leaders in poor countries making fast bucks through underhand deals with rich countries by agreeing not to industrialize their countries The poor nations can become rich only if they are allowed to make maximum use of their resources through industrialization instead of selling their minerals for a pittance to the rich nations and buying the finished product from them at an exorbitant price This is why diamondrich Ivory Coast uraniumrich Niger and oilrich Angola are still poor What Africa needs is not aid but a fair deal whereby the poor African nations will get a fair price for their agricultural produce and industrial goods in the world market which is now manipulated by rich nations by means of farmer subsidies and high import standards No climate deal should pose a hindrance to poor nations prosperity or industrialization Ecological balance is intricately linked to a balance in the income distribution of the world If this does not happen doomsday will not be far away possibly in the coming year as predicted in an ancient Mayan tablet"

being invested in improving the road network in the country Successive governments and policy makers have attached high priority to infrastructure development especially the road sector as a prerequisite for development Despite these improvements the unfortunate public still waste hours on the road to reach their intended destinations or simply to cross the road Once you are on the road you will see all modes of transport from a bullock cart to a container carrier plying at any time of the day A commuter or a bystander would hardly be able to distinguish between busy shopping hours and school openingclosing times Anytime is a peak or rush hour and all seem to be on the road at all times Most private vehicles including my own carry a single occupant plying at the fastest possible speed while frequently changing lanes to gain a few seconds advantage over the vehicle in front A motorist can patiently wait for two minutes for the change of signal at a junction but can hardly allow two seconds for the vehicle in front to move Many horns will start blasting There is little road and traffic discipline that is observed these days with a free for all situations Those who are expected to be law makers are often on the front line of law breakers When VIPs are on the road let alone vehicles from container downwards to a bicycle and bystanders even the safety of an animal would be left in Gods hands Of course they must rush to the legislative assembly as another piece of law for the benefit of the masses they represent cannot be delayed even by a few minutes Some vehicles and riders carrying the badge of Police would crisscross not even sparing those ignorant souls walking across the pedestrian crossings Is that the right term considering number of lives lost on socalled kaha ira thereby setting an example to other motorists the way they should drive in a traffic jam Fortunately we have some police officers who are tough with traffic offenders while they are on duty and join the very same category while they are off duty All this colossal investment on roads has not done much to improve safe and convenient travel traffic congestion road safety and passenger convenience Is this the final fruits of development we are heading for I have two concerns First I agree that road network improvement is necessary but is it sufficient Second while we may have promoted the right prerequisite the issue remains whether we have got hold of the right end of the stick We see all around us a vast rapid improvement in the road infrastructure The amount of funds earmarked for Highways would only be second to that for Defence in the 2012 Budget Yet city transport has become a nightmare To quote from Prof Kumarage Our administrators need to realize that planting trees along highways and making roads oneway while being bold city beautification initiatives fall short of ensuring the sustainability of transport in the city I see the need for a combination of three elements for the improvement of transport facilities Improvements in road infrastructure and availability of adequate number and types of vehicles are two of them This is the hardware part of transport network The hardware part is well attended and visible and is probably the showpiece But we have to add the essential third element governance of transport and traffic to achieve the right result I would loosely call this the software part or the soft side of the overall issue This is a governance or management issue Having said that let me elaborate on what I would describe as the missing elements of this software First responsible authorities or managers of the road network matter a lot These roads are a property of different road development and Local Authorities depending on their type The sign boards pardon me not the billboards prominently displaying the smiling faces of peoples servants posted on the roadside would indicate an idea of who manages them We as tax payers vehicle owners commuters service providers telecom water electricity etc and cargo distributors are the beneficiaries of the road networks We have to seek the permission of authorities I am hesitant to use the term mercy for new constructions or changes to a building If your wall is destroyed for a road expansion or if your child falls into a pit on the pavement or if your vehicle topples over a pothole or even if you disappear in a drain on a rainy day the responsible authorities are not responsible You have to blame yourself You are not only the loser but also the culprit This is due to lack of participation and consultation between stakeholders and road authorities Managers do not consult the beneficiaries they pay little or no attention to the needs and grievances of pedestrians residents and other beneficiaries This is outside the hardware part of road development but an essential part of the missing software in the equation Second roads are often related to vehicles again as a piece of hardware but not to vehicle users which is the software part The priority goes for the vehicles In constructing rehabilitating or widening the infrastructure the main concern and consideration is for the vehicles The result is that little or no concern is paid for shoulders pavements parking bays drains environment among others Although I am not an admirer of the British Colonial Rule I appreciate the engineering wisdom demonstrated in road construction by the British The road network built across the country including estate roads and rail tracks are living evidence for the British engineering skills Unfortunately some recently built or rehabilitated roads highways have been subject to serious land erosion problems I attribute this to the lack of concern shown for the soft side of road construction Third there is hardly any attention paid to the maintenance of road infrastructure built at high cost In my opinion maintenance needs regular examinations and vigilance in addition to attending to repairs Many of us often mix up repairs with maintenance We attend to repairs after damage is caused to the road surface but hardly pay attention to routine damage preventive maintenance Technical knowhow funds and arrangements are rarely in place when it comes to maintenance which seems to receive the least attention by the authorities Due consideration is needed to be given for maintenance during as well as after the design and implementation stage of a road project A frequent sight you and I observe as road users is breaking or digging up a newly constructed road and leaving it unattended for days if not for weeks This is probably to provide electricity telecom or water connection to a resident across the road No doubt this must be done Well it could be aligned with road construction avoiding inconvenience an eye sore and additional expenditure It is not a question of technology hardware but lack of coordination a part of the software as defined above To reiterate investment in highways and transport development is necessary but not sufficient for ensuring smooth traffic and transport operations I have outlined above the missing elements in this regard focusing on management aspects representing the software side of the system It is never too late to fill the equation with the missing software part to ensure the impact of transport and highways on national development and welfare of the public"

        "body": "Two things have escaped the general discussion on the highway The first is the cost and the debt repayment over the next 2030 years that given the considerable cost overruns of 100 percent the delays in getting the highway completed and subsequent maintenance costs will continue over the years The return on the tolls seemed to be encouraging initially and it is hoped that this revenue stream will continue to cushion some of the expenditure that the state has borne and will continue to bear for the operation of the Wonder Gateway The second and the more important from the perspective of civil society in a democratic state is the lack of acknowledgement of the contribution made to the construction of the Expressway by an estimated 1338 families who were displaced by its construction and others who though not physically displaced lost their agricultural land where they cultivated paddy tea rubber or cinnamon or their commercial properties There were also about 550 households that were indirectly affected and these included workers on the land and in the enterprises that had to close down or relocate and others who had to manage the discomforts of construction rock blasting dust unexpected flooding and loss of common amenities etc These people were by and large willing contributors to the greater good but their contribution has not been publicly acknowledged Despite discomfort to themselves they recognised the role that the expressway was supposed to play in the countrys development and bought into the idea that it will be a catalyst for economic growth in the South that will in turn bring work opportunities for the poor For their part the Road Development Authority RDA the implementing agency also made some effort to understand the stress of disruption and involuntary displacement and working within the ADBs safeguard strategies and Sri Lankas own National Involuntary Resettlement Policy aimed to compensate and minimise the negative impacts The final trace deliberately avoided highly populated areas though at considerable cost to the environment and to agriculture The innovative institution of the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Committees LARC at a local level helped bring about fairer compensation calculations for lost homes agricultural land and business enterprises and on average doubled the legal compensation entitlement paid under the Land Acquisition Act No 9 of 1950 the existing state instrument for acquiring land for public purposes The impacts of the involuntary displacement and resettlement were both positive and negative Many families improved the quality of their houses but were unhappy that they had lost their green environment and quiet rural setting the loss of shade and coolness and the loss of access to fruit and produce bearing trees Poorer households and those who had only user rights to their land were able to acquire new homes and land title The Road Development Authority and local government institutions dealt with the land scarcity and rising prices by setting up and developing thirty two resettlement sites Forty percent of the people who were displaced got land and built houses on these sites The RDA provided the infrastructure eg water supply electricity internal roads and drainage though not at a consistent pace or evenly across sites However many of the sites were selected in consultation with the displaced people and were located in close proximity to the affected villages resulting in minimal social disruption though close proximity to the highway construction caused some unanticipated problems of noise and vibration The final outcomes came after a traumatic period of disruption when most displaced families had to live in unsatisfactory temporary accommodation and experienced considerable anxiety It was particularly bad for families with young children or older people needing care and for families going through critical lifecycle events Older children were particularly traumatised and there are several stories of young people dropping out of school and not being able to sit for public examinations The main losers from the displacement and resettlement were largely the rural middle class who had left behind either newly built houses or ancestral homes that had been in the family for generations Older people also found relocation difficult In many of the families elderly parents lived with their children either in their own houses or in their childrens homes Resettlement often resulted in a rearrangement of these living arrangements with the traditional extended families breaking into multiple nuclear unitsSeveral households saw a downturn in incomes because they lost either agricultural land or enterprises or because their access to employment was disrupted or lost Many of the enterprises that were lost or disrupted were small informal businesses such as small groceries and hardware shops or homebased enterprises many carried out by women There is no doubt that the E01 is an important milestone in the history of Sri Lanka and that it will bring benefits to a number of people After the initial years of traumatic temporary displacement some of the people who were affected by the highway construction were able to get back on their feet and build better Others are still struggling The writer is Director of the Centre for Poverty Analysis"

        "body": "We congratulate those concerned for successfully continuing with the transformation of the company which we believe was initiated by us We wish to assert that our term as Managing Agent of Kurunegala Plantations Ltd unlike the post 2004 period was beset with problems created by the then Government Mrs CBM There was always the threat of the company in the State and for the most part we had to contend with a hostile and uncooperative Board of Directors of KPL So when performance is judged these factors need to be kept in mind In the article referred to there is an observation by the writer of that article that Kurunegala Plantations was initially a state owned company and privatized in 1992 in expectance of profits and less redundancy on government fiscals It needs to be mentioned at this point that Kurunegala Plantations Ltd at the time and subsequently continued to remain as a public entity in the form of a state owned company and only its management was placed in the hands of the private sector The writer then quotes Mr Nillegoda the CEO of KPA as saying the plantation was under the private sector for nearly 14 years and had depicted a continuous downfall in its output Owing to the conditions the company was reorganized by the government in 2005 Thee onwards the plantation indicated a gradual growth with a new record of increasing profit every year This is a misleading statement and for that matter almost everything else stated in the said article relating to the period in which the company was under our management The facts are as follows LH plantations Pvt Ltd was entrusted with the task of functioning as the Managing Agent of the state owned plantation company Kurunegala Plantations Pvt Ltd In 1992 and performed this task till 2004 Successfully meeting all criteria set down by the Government to qualify for a further extension of its management contract During this period it needs to be emphasized the company under our management lost 1131 or 7415 Hectares of its entire land holding An analysis of crop performance during the period and all other criteria need necessarily have to take this factor into serious consideration as the land host comprised of the most fertile sections of the plantation We will not go into specifies but the following facts would place the whole issue in its proper perspective 1 There most definitely was no continuous down fall in its output as stated On the contrary corps The results of employing best possible cultivation practices under the circumstances fluctuated during the period Quite in line with the annual weather patterns This is a phenomenon observed in all plantations A fact that all experienced planters would subscribe to the degree of fluctuation would naturally differ from estate to estate depending on the moisture conservation and other beneficial cultivation practices adopted The crop harvested in our final year of management 2004 was 15 greater than that of year 2002 Similarly the crop in year 2000 was 38 higher than that of 1998 while the crop in 2002 a year of serve drought fell to 75 of 2001 2 During its 12 year of operations under private management not 14 years as stated in the article the company achieved profitability in 11 years the only exception being in the year 2000 when despite a substantial increase in the crop by 30 a loss was sustained owing to chronically depressed prices throughout that year as a result of ill conceived import of palm oil into the country Kurunegala Plantations Ltd upto the time of privatization of the state plantation companies was only one of two companies out of 23 State plantations companies to have recorded continuous profits from the time state plantations were handed over for private management 3 All employees of Kurunegala Plantations Ltd were paid a share of profits during 9 years of our management 4 During the period under our management an aggregate sum of Rs 101 m was paid by the company to the Treasury by was of lease rentals 5 With regard to certain other observations made elsewhere in the article a The company operated during this entire period within a single overdraft facility of Rs 25m for working capital and met all capital and land development costs exceeding Rs 254m entirely from the internal generation of funds This included new planting annually Selected areas of land and the maintenance of under planted areas up to maturity b New projects products and crops were introduced during our period to maximize the earning potential of the company These included the cultivation for the first time of Cinnamon and Sunflower on estates owned by Kurunegala Plantations Ltd and other crops such as Rambuttan Banana Pineapple etc A timber saw mil was set up on Narammala Estate to saw senile coconut trees for rafters and a nutrition and well received dessert termed Nata de Coco was introduced to the food shelves of Sri Lanka for the first time Moreover what we achieved during the period of our management was for the most part achieved in an environment far from conducive to proper and effective management A situation the present management has been fortunate not to experience We are sincerely pleased with the continued prosperity of Kurunegala Plantations Ltd and wish all success to the company Mr Nillegoda CEO and all those employed at KPC"

head in Afghanistan The Taliban were prompt in distancing themselves from the carnage at the religious ceremonies where the Shiites mourned the martyrdom of Imam Hussein grandson of Prophet Muhammad 14 centuries ago Incidentally Imam Hussein is revered by both the Shiites and the Sunnis and his martyrdom at the hands of a despot started the Shiite stream in Islam If the Taliban were not responsible for Tuesdays Kabul bomb blast who is Just because the Taliban say they did not do it one cannot remove them from the list of suspects But there can be other suspects the foreign intelligence groups for instance Of course the puppet regime in Kabul blamed Pakistans intelligence service If only the regime had turned the searchlight inwards it could have seen others especially the imperialists the Americans and the Brits The imperialists should be suspect number one for their track record shows that they are masters at creating discord and enmity among communities Britains divideandrule policy favoured one community over another during the colonial period The fact that this policy helped the imperialists to continue their plunder is well documented though the subject is less talked about in Western discourses today Why go to the colonial period even recent events show the imperialists have adopted the sameold policy for the sameold goal In Iraq where the Sunnis and Shiites had lived peacefully for centuries the arrival of the US and British occupying forces plunged the country into a bloody sectarian war Before the 2003 invasion the Sunnis and the Shiites lived in harmony and intermarriage was common Even during the early days of resistance to the US occupation the Shiites and the Sunnis worked in tandem to free their country from foreign occupation But the unity which was a major threat to the US occupation force was shattered when a highly revered Shiite shrine in the Iraqi city of Samarra was bombed in February 2006 The occupation force blamed alQaeda backed Sunni extremists for the attack The Samarra bomb was followed by a series of bomb blasts in Sunni areas The occupation force put the blame for those on the Shiite extremists Within months these terror attacks and counter attacks turned Iraq into a hell hole of sectarianism Many Iraqis however believed that foreign intelligence units the CIA Mossad and MI 6 were responsible for fanning sectarianism They point to an incident that took place in September 2005 in Basra In this incident two British mercenaries clad in Arab dishdasha were arrested by the local police who found bombmaking material in the boot of their car The two mercenaries were taken to a safe location by a Shiite militia group for interrogation for they were certain that the Brits were behind a number of bomb attacks in Basra and elsewhere Within hours British forces backed by six tanks attacked the secret prison and freed the two mercenaries Besides this incident reports in the webbased Iraqi media gave details about how the foreign intelligence units set up remotecontrolled bombs in vehicles taken into custody In one incident a pickup truck was detained by foreign troops at a checkpoint and the owner was asked to come the following day with the necessary documents to their camp to prove his ownership His licence was also taken The next day when he went to the camp the authorities gave him the vehicle but told him to collect his licence from a nearby Iraqi police station Little did he know that the vehicle had been set up with a remotecontrolled bomb to be blasted when he reached the police station Such incidents had been ruining Iraq until US President Barack Obama decided to end all military operations there in preparation for a final withdrawal at the end of this month Today once again the SunniShiite intermarriages are happening with the Iraqi government encouraging them with cash incentives But the sectarian monster that has Iraq emerged in Afghanistan on Tuesday giving an added dimension to the war Until Tuesday the Afghan war had only two dimensions For the occupying USled NATO forces it was a war on terror For the majority Pashtun people who support the Taliban their war was against foreign occupation As far as the war on terror is concerned the United States has got its pound of flesh and more In other words besides eliminating alQaeda leader Osama bin Laden the main suspect in the 911 terror attacks Washington has bombed Afghanistan to its hearts content killing tens of thousands of Afghans several times more than the number killed in the 911 attacks But the US cannot leave Afghanistan without a proper plan It does not want the Taliban to capture Kabul and kill President Hamid Karzai the way the Taliban killed President Najibullah in 1996 Yet President Obama has taken a decision to leave The drawdown is said to begin in 2014 It is in this context that the sectarian violence makes strategic sense If it spreads the Americans and the Karzai regime may blame Iran for helping the Shiites to carry out terror attacks on Sunni targets though the Afghan Shiites may not be involved in such attacks The Sunnis will be made to believe that the Shiites are responsible for the attacks and forced to side with the USled NATO force The support of Afghan Sunnis a majority of whom sympathise with the Taliban will shore up Karzai who was seen bowing his head over and over before US Secretary State Hillary Clinton and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at this weeks Bonn conference Needless to say the bowing symbolized not only his gratitude but also his servitude to the West Sectarian violence it appears may help Kabul to win the hearts and minds of proTaliban Sunnis"

        "body": "Instead of being comfortable with the most common and simple answer that Sri Lankans live under a repressive regime which I think as unhelpful misleading and even counterproductive we could think about three broad reasons for the wide pessimism of any radical change in the status quo First is the growing disjuncture between the comparatively high literacy rates access to information and formal democratic freedoms with countries and the apparent decline in peoples participation in political dissent Second the political parties and civil society groups that give voice and leadership to dissent seems to be far removed from the aspirations of the people Third these leaders seem to take granted of the peoples awareness of critical issues frustrations with the ruling regime and enthusiasm for radical change of the status quo Many of these leaders seem to be less interested in selfcriticism of their political ideologies and tactics and lack the will to accommodate change The crisis of the Arab world was precipitated by the global economic crises and the severity of the austerity measures imposed by governments to address the crises The people of the Middle East lost their faith in and tolerance of the authoritarian and dictatorial governments that used national security progress religion xenophobia nepotism patronage economic and military force to control them At the same time in the more developed countries the citizenry began to tire of their governments endless jockeying for strategic position in the world of geopolitics and of their own conspicuous consumption The glories of past military victories no longer served to maintain the power and popular legitimacy of the state When the population turned against the state and state leaders were helpless they too were abandoned by the external forces that once supported them These external forces are now busy rebranding their credentials among the population as champions of human rights and democracy and taking control of the economic opportunities these countries offer The protestors come from diverse backgrounds and are focused on a wide range of rights They once thought it would be impossible to achieve them without a radical change in the ruling regime of their respective countries Although there were a few prominent personalities who gave leadership to these movements none of them supports one clear aspirant who is seeking to take power The protests clearly targeted the economic policies and the political agenda of regime change but no movement has clearly voiced a specific economic or political program to realize its demands The notion of Arab Spring originates from the term springtime of nations used to describe revolutionary upheavals in Europe during mid1800s is somewhat misleading because it makes us think that task of the protest movements is complete It was the promise of rebirth of a new society that made the term Arab Spring It took decades for France to enjoy spring Louise Napoleon won free elections in 1848 following the overthrow of monarchy and it took 32 years for democracy after Prague Spring in 1968 Many Sri Lankas have been waiting for Spring since 1977 elections The current chaos in the Arab world has to do with the fact that despite the fall of their leaders many fundamental questions remain unanswered Is there a clear road map for the future Is there easy ways out the current financial crisis and austerity measures Citizens do not like experimentation but clarity It seems the Arab world is now on its way to a very long winter which could turn out to be a long spring for neoliberal institutions the super powers the wealthy and the extremists who generally prey on the miseries other others These forces could easily remake the Arab world according to the very image that the protesters despised Yet the Arab protesters demonstrated the courage and persistence until they realized their immediate objectivesSri Lanka Spring is not a grassroots movement Rather it seems to be imposed from above under the leadership of the United National Party which remains largely disconnected from the masses and has for many years failed to put its own house in order Ranil Wickremesinghes refusal to relinquish leadership of the party despite losing nearly 20 elections and facing rejection by his own party members makes the public even more fearful of the consequences of yet another UNP government than they are of the ruling regime The general public doubts Mr Wickremesinghes commitment to justice for Fonseka because of the partys ambivalent relationship with the general the UNPs failure to maintain the momentum of the movement to secure Fonsekas release The UNP cannot build a broad coalition because it is selective of the issues that it is interested in and its allies For example it is silent about the privatization of university system and has consistently demanded an immediate political settlement to the ethnic crisis Nor it has clear alternatives solutions to these issues UNPs take on Fonsekas heroism against the LTTE is not nuanced enough to mobilize people across different ethnic divide Placing Fonseka as the central focus of protests is insufficient convince all ethnic groups to equally revolt against the government The lesson we are learning from UNP politics today is that authoritarianism cannot be fought with authoritarianism Politics of protest are in vain unless they immediately translate into politics of hope The Arab Spring involves the work of hundreds of civil society organizations both domestic and international In Sri Lanka however the civil society organizations are not a part of the antigovernment protests organized by the political parties not only because they are suppressed by the state but are urban based entities without a mass following Civil society organizations are silent about Fonseka The fragmentation and territorial battles between these organizations do not allow them to coalesce around a national purpose or agenda Groundviews"

tool contradict the very notion of democracy that the West purports to uphold To do so at a price in cutting off aid is also absolutely immoral Such moves are not about promoting liberal values or broader democratic norms but are attempts to market an ideology call it a liberal ideology Democracy is all about reflecting the will of a given group of people and certainly not a superimposition of any ideology In a democratic framework if change is needed it is the insiders who must agitate for change It is perfectly acceptable for outsiders to voice their opinion on issues that might be of interest or of concern to them Indeed there are times when such outside voices can be essential for a countrys overall wellbeing and sense of direction One does not hesitate to welcome a candid exchange of views and constructive dialogue through a variety of platforms including the media In his keynote address at the inaugural National Conference on Reconciliation held on 24 November Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa presented what is perhaps the governments position on the issue when he said It is evident that cultural norms differ from country to country People living in the United States of America or Australia or Canada or the United Kingdom or any other country have no proper understanding of the ground situation in Sri Lanka nor do they understand our current cultural context It is not for outsiders to impose their values or their judgments on Sri Lanka Whether donor sanctions should be imposed on countries that do not adhere to a set of mostly moral values of the donor country is certainly questionable It is simply undemocratic for a foreign entity to seek to impose its ways on others less affluent and powerful This explains why some African states have reacted strongly to British Prime Minister David Camerons threat to withhold aid from countries that do not reform legislation banning homosexuality Tanzania whose main donor is Britain has unequivocally stated that the West has gone too far with its aid strings by trying to enforce practices that contravene the countrys culture and religious values Ghana has said that it is willing to forego aid rather than pass laws allowing a practice that is frowned upon by the majority of its citizens The point is that it is not simply a question of whether or not homosexuality should be decriminalised but more a question of whether foreign aid should be used as a tool to coerce a sovereign state to change its laws Should the press for change not come from within David Cameron explaining his stance on the issue of aid and homosexuality in an interview with BBC Ones Andrew Marr show in Perth Western Australia on 30 October said This is an issue where we are pushing for movement we are prepared to put some money behind what we believe Is it not wrong for the British Prime Minister to seek to impose such beliefs on other countries and to dictate terms to them This was a question I posed to John Rankin the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka whom I interviewed for the Daily Mirror Rankin first clarified that the British Prime Ministers comments are not applicable to Sri Lanka given its status as a middleincome earner and the reference was for aid that comes under the General Budget Support category of the UKs Department for International Development DFID The High Commissioner said No I dont think that it is wrong to promote our values through aid This is money of UK taxpayers and we seek in our foreign policy to encourage all countries to promote and respect fundamental human rightsIs Britain through aid trying to market its own ideology Rankin stated I would say that it is for individual countries to make their own decisions in this area and we cannot determine what other governments do But in our foreign policy we try to support human rights and values and I make no apology for that Indeed it is for each government and its people to decide upon the laws that it should adopt An imposed democracy is a good example of an oxymoron and it is wrong for a foreign country to impose its ways on others through aid or even otherwise Money from DFIDs General Budget Support is aimed at poverty reduction in some of the worlds poorest countries the vast majority of them being African and some Asian The people of these countries are in dire need of financial assistance to help them overcome poverty and it is simply immoral for wealthier nations to throw them into more abysmal waters by tying aid to issues such as gay rights It has even been argued that this really isnt about human rights but about finding pretexts to slash foreign aid due to the European financial crisis But irrespective of whether or not this is the case and quite apart from Camerons patronising tone the British Prime Ministers statement has actually served to undermine the gay rights movement in Africa At a time when even ones own elected government is being urged to refrain from imposing values on its citizenry how can it be reasonable or acceptable for a foreign government to seek to impose its values by threatening to cut off aid to countries which do not listen to them By Ayesha Zuhair"

        "body": "The Pakistani governments outburst against yet another violation of the countrys territorial integrity and sovereignty has become all too familiar The people of Pakistan have seen and heard enough of the theatrics So when Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani slammed the NATO attack on two Pakistani military check posts on the border with Afghanistan on November 25 the words failed to assure the people This is a grave infringement of Pakistans sovereignty the Prime Minister thundered and proceeded to take some measures seemingly aimed at punishing NATO for killing 28 Pakistani soldiers at the check posts But in effect the government measures including the move to shut the vital supply route to Afghanistan and the closure of the Shamshi airbase from where the United States military launched its unmanned drone attacks appear to be cosmetic or a political stunt aimed at an angry populace The people of Pakistan where antiAmerican sentiments run high were shocked to know that the unprovoked attack lasted for two hours even though Pakistani forces had contacted NATO and pleaded to stop the fire By no means is Islamabad on the war path or armtwisting Washington If so it should have taken the drastic decision to withdraw from Americas war on terror in which some 9000 Pakistani soldiers have died That such a policy shift is not forthcoming is an indication that there is room for reconciliation though Gilani warned the United States that business as usual will not be there Pakistan cannot take this drastic decision as the choice before it is not between what is good and what is bad for the country and its people but what is least harmful from among all the disadvantageous options Given this unfortunate position which Islamabad has been dragged into by the US the initial angry response often turns out be a gun with blank cartridges Take for instance the Raymond Davis incident which created a major uproar in Pakistan Government leaders thundered and roared that the culprit a CIA mercenary would be dealt with under Pakistani law for killing two youths in broad daylight on a Lahore street in January this year Washington demanded the release of the killer claiming he enjoyed diplomatic immunity though evidence indicated he was not a diplomat The people urged the government not to bow to US pressure But the government relented and released Davis after working out a 24 million dollar compensation package for the victims families Only the then foreign minister Ahmed Shah Qureshi had the courage to oppose the compromise He quit the government in disgust If this was not bad enough worse even was the US Special Forces raid on the Abbottabad hideout of alQaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May Again Pakistani leaders cried foul saying it was a blatant violation of the countrys sovereignty and an apparently embarrassed military vowed not to share intelligence with the US But before the blood that was spilled at Abbottabad dried relations between the two countries were back to normal The present crisis will also wither away though the Pakistani leaders still appear to be seething with anger If the anger is genuine what should come forth is not empty rhetoric or ineffective measures but a decision to withdraw from the war on terror After all it is not Pakistans war Besides Pakistan could say that since bin Laden had been done away with and the conflict in Afghanistan is now largely an internal civil war it is time for all foreign forces to leave But NATOs 150000strong military presence in postbin Laden Afghanistan smacks of an ulterior motive connected to the US geopolitical interests Initially it was a pipeline to carry Central Asian oil across Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea port of Karachi that was thought to be the cause for the prolonged US stay But China appears to have pipped the US at the post in the Central Asian pipeline game This setback may be the reason behind the gradual US troop drawdown that is to begin in 2014 This withdrawal is conditional upon Afghanistan remaining a US neocolonial outpost so that Washington can maintain military bases there to check China Russia and Iran China which shares a border with Afghanistan is not unaware that the US has surrounded it Recently the US opened a military base in Darwin Australia to counter Chinas growing power in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean region Incidentally there is life for Pakistan in this power game between the US and China Many Pakistani strategists have begun to openly advocate a defence alliance with China to counter any military threats from the US in the event Islamabad withdraws from the war on terror China has condemned last Saturdays attack One wonders whether Pakistan has the courage to pull out of the war on terror and tell the US that the proTaliban militancy within Pakistan is a matter for Pakistan to handle not for outside force Signs have however already appeared that Pakistan may blink One indication was in the visit of a highlevel United Arab Emirates delegation led by Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed AlNahyan The mission was aimed at reconciliation between Pakistan and the US Incidentally the UAE is the lessee of Pakistans Shamsi airbase from where the US launches its drone attacks which have killed more civilians than miscreants Media reports said Sheikh alNahyans visit was aimed also at persuading Pakistan to reverse its eviction orders on the US troops operating from the airbase near Qeutta in Balochistan But the UAE minister denied that the Shamsi airbase issue had figured in the talks with Pakistani leaders If Pakistan insists that it is serious and its anger is real then will it at least keep the supply route shut for three months or until NATO feels the pinch"

do are the lowest and those who do not wash properly neither clean nor proper and that they do not bow to foreigners As Norwegians did the dirty on us we must ask who wrote the report which publications they read and whom they interviewed An examination of this gives a list of those in the forefront of subverting our sovereignty and misinterpreting us to foreigners And the misleading apologetic report is the outcome And I personally know the major institutions and the persons involved having written about the latter in two books published by two leading Western academic publishers But before discussing the official Norwegian intervention we should mention a littleknown unofficial intervention namely by the Norwegian academic Johan Galtung I have come across the man academically Once we both gave keynote addresses to the World Futures Federation and a few weeks ago at another global conference in a Greek resort In a very pretentious interview with Al Jazeera he boasted how he wanted to bring peace by nearly dividing Sri Lanka but failed he implied it was his greatest failure The two authors of the current report come from the Christian Michelsen Institute CMI in Bergen Norway and the School of Oriental and African Studies SOAS in London Several decades ago I gave a lecture at the former This was a time when tiny Norway did not have pseudoimperial ambitions and not the huge oil funds it now has Later as a Visiting Professor at the Universities of Trondheim and Oslo I helped Prof Wenke Barth Eide of the latter inaugurated development studies in Norway on the basis of equal academic relations between Norway and the Third World Equality was lost in recent Norwegian postures Interestingly Eides husband Asbjorn was head of the Peace Institute PRIO while their son Espen is Defence Minister now in charge of war matters especially terrorism War is peace peace is war Sponsoring LTTE terrorism was a major export commodity of Norway SOAS perhaps the largest and oldest institution for Asian studies was actually started with inputs from Rhys Davids and Martino De Zilva Wickremasinghe both key members of our Royal Asiatic Society A former Ceylon civil servant Davids set up the Pali Text Society in London with the help of 96 Sinhalese monks and became Professor of Pali in London Wickramasinghe was Reader in Tamil and Telugu in London and Lecturer in Sinhalese and Head of the Dravidian Department at SOAS Since then SOAS has seen at least up to the 1970s several Sri Lankans getting PhDs there But by our shortsightedness that inflow has ceased closing a vital window to the world But this report is not by the section of SOAS dealing with Asian civilisation but with development studies for which knowledge of Sri Lankan culture is not required as was the case for British civil servants like Davids earlier Development studies origin was the University of Sussex where I was on the staff but left to return to Sri Lanka after writing articles in their journal such as Development thinking as cultural neocolonialism My intention was that I should help develop independent thinking in Sri Lanka only to realize decades later that many Lankan social scientists were gobbled up in the pseudointellectual web of wellpaying antinational foreign funded NGOs If the background of the two authors of the report is a key window to its contents then more so are the authorities they cite and those they interview Let us begin with politicians They have interviewed Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga under whom the NorwegianLTTE sponsored CFA was signed No interview with Mahinda Rajapaksa who called the CFA bluff No interview with JVP and JHU who opposed it very vocally But they have interviewed the LTTE front in Oslo Rajah Balasingham calling him a Tamil representative in Oslo equating the LTTE with all Tamils But there is one Milinda Morogoda clearly Milinda Moragoda another Norway and CFA supporter He had got nearly Rs 12 billion rupees from Norway the report notes Harim Peiris Chandrikas spokesman during the period was interviewed They have interviewed Norwegians Solheim Helgesen Westborg HanssenBauer and Bondevik all wellknown government buccaneers who desecrated us Westborg as a tappedphone conversation reveals was the villain who smuggled high level telecommunication equipment for the LTTE Westborg when he was

had no effect Frydenlund then studying Buddhism and Sri Lanka was at the conference She is now at PRIO Peace Research Institute Oslo and her bias is seen from the PRIO site where she gives particular attention to those Buddhist monks who have expressed support for the peace process and talks of War and Buddhism in Sri Lanka a contradiction Decades ago when we thought Norway was a friendly country my wife did a research in reverse anthropology at Frydenlunds same PRIO studying native Norwegian women working in the Third World The result the more Norwegian women interacted with developing countries the more prejudiced they became Finding that my wife had academic links then to Norway then Minister Hameed got her appointed to the World View board of Arne Fjrtoft Soon she resigned after a Norwegian newspaper quoted the unknown Fjrtoft stating that in Sri Lanka he was as wellknown as the Buddha and Marx This arrogance was a continued thread in Norwegian interventions Jehan Perera Kumar Rupesinghe and Norbert Ropers were all interviewed The report mentions that Kumar Rupesinghe received the most Norwegian funding for the Norwegian peace process Ropers who through his Berghoff Foundation wanted our Armed Forces depleted and brought under the control of NGOs was later deported FORUT whose Director had been deported for refusing to fly the Sri Lankan flag is interviewed Sahadevan brought as an expert to the Colombo University from the Jawaharlal Nehru University is interviewed Just before the end of the war he went on international TV condemning Sri Lanka Sahadevans antiSri Lanka views are a contrast to his predecessor Urmila Phadnis who was fond of Sri Lanka Those quoted in the report include Marga who had earlier welcomed the Indian intervention Sunil Bastian an advocate of federalism Berkwitz who wrote that the late Venerable Soma who had lived in Australia had resisted the global intervention Jonathan Spencer who at a recent lecture at ICES implied that Sri Lanka should not have got Independence Niloufer de Mel who wrote of our forces buildup to defeat the LTTE as militarisation Mark Duffield is quoted on the tsunami but not his contribution to the previous critical report on Kumar Rupesinghes then International Alert where Duffield said that foreign funded NGOs were privatizing foreign policy in Sri Lanka The report cites Uyangoda who in writing had advocated separatism It quotes Unmaking the Nation the book sponsored by Kumari Jayawardena which made the claim that Anuradhapura was discovered for us only by foreigners and that the Mahavamsa was an imagined history Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu is quoted but not his statements questioning the need for sovereignty Bradman Weerakoon is cited Several of these had links with ICES whose director was sent away for advocating armed intervention in the country All those who wrote pointing out the perfidy of the Norwegians are not quoted While they were advocating different solutions for Sri Lanka the restrictive Norwegian Constitution demands that its head of State should be a Lutheran Christian and that all its officials should know Norwegian Not quoted are those who spoke at our conference in Oslo namely Chalk from the Rand Corporation Stewart Bell of the National Post Paul Harris Asoka Bandarage Mahindapala Ranjith Soysa Douglas Wickramaratne and myself Not quoted are the numerous commentators who criticized the Norwegian exercise such as SL Gunasekera Gomin Dayasiri and very many others Missing notably is the book by Kingsley de Silva where after careful research the whole basis of the Norwegian intervention which assumes a fictitious traditional homeland of the Tamils is totally debunked Excluded are the books published by Western academic presses challenging and exposing the mistruths of their key informants one by Bandarage and two by me Missing are the published detailed instructions of the foreign funded NGOs on how to brainwash the entire Sri Lanka spectrum from politicians to government officials to academics The report says tellingly working on conflict sometimes amounted to trying to buy peace and that Norwegians were dispersing largesse in order to buy peace often quite lavishly to galvanize support for the peace process In short they were giving huge bribes to support the CFA And the numbers are astounding compared to the very meager resources academic institutions in Sri Lanka get The extent of the bribes is seen when during the period of the CFA most aid of Norway the report notes went to Conflict prevention and resolution peace and security and Government and civil society read NGOs Of the NGOs Milinda Moragoda got Rs 12 billion rupees and the two outfits of Kumar Rupesinghe AntiWar Front got Rs 203 million while his Foundation for Coexistence got Rs 683 million a total of nearly Rs 1 billion for Rupesinghe Moragoda was seen during the CFA in talks with soldiers It will be interesting to see whether he carried to them the downsize the Army slogan of Berghof part of the NGO agenda Rupesinghe after getting nearly Rs 1 billion from the Norwegians and after the report mentioned the amount he got is now ungrateful and critical of them The meeting of Rupesinghes AntiWar Front which was against military action was attacked publicly by angry citizens His subsequent Foundation for Coexistence had no strategic use because it was the LTTE who prevented coexistence and now after the elimination of the LTTE people live peacefully Another beneficiary of Norway the National Peace Council which was advocating PTOMS which would have given even greater powers to the LTTE than the CFA did now says the CFA contributed to ending the war It forgets the illegal courts police force and other elements of a separate state which the army had to get rid of at great cost The Norwegian report adds Donors close relations with a small group of Colombobased NGOs weakened the popular legitimacy of civil society An obvious fact if they had only followed their earlier report on International Alert which warned of the unpopularity of NGOs in Sri Lanka They did not learn their lesson neither did we as these NGOs like colonial missionaries are still allowed to sing for their large supper to fit their donors foreign requirements Others would call them foreign spies"

under their areas of specialty The days programme was divided into sessions and the first session was chaired by terrorism expert Prof Rohan Gunaratna head of ICPVTR Singapore He asked his two panelists Former Attorney General Mohan Peiris and MP Prof Rajiva Wijesingha on Promise and potential for reconciliation challenges and opportunity Session two was on economic development in the reconciliation process and the contribution of the public and private sectors The occasion saw a leading apparel manufacturer Brandix speak of their experience in the East while a few of the public servants spoke of their efforts Reconciliation through economic development Private sector participation General Manager Brandix East Theordore Gunasekara Speaking on his companys experience when they first moved to Punani in Batticaloa to open a factory their main aim was to give a chance to those who had none while testing the ground for future factories They made use of the tax holiday and initially employed 100 youth from the area with great difficulty Since most of the persons could not read write and attend school they were forced to rewrite their selection criteria Now the factory that employees a total of 500 persons has proven to be a success story They set up a training centre to teach young girls to operate a sewing machine and before they did so they had to break the ice and bring all the communities living in disharmony to accept individuals outside their caste and ethnicity They had to instill in them the values of working as a team and principles to reach high efficiency and smooth functioning of the factory once it started Mr Gunasekara said He said that they went to IDP camps in search of employees and thousands of interviews before meeting persons who had the potential to be trained He said when they overcame the manpower hunt they were faced with yet another difficulty of providing power to their factory which he was thankful to the Government for bringing a special grid to Batticaloa and covering the factory necessities during the trying times Sri Lankas approach to reconciliation using restorative justice Vs retributive justice Former Attorney General and Special Advisor to the Cabinet of Ministers Mohan Peiris Speaking on transitional justice he said that in the global trend and broad sense it means to recover from a period of violence It is essential to develop a home grown solution to the problems that started in our home land he added Transitional justice is a range of responses available for use in societies which have gone through a period of violence One has to retrace it to the African continent and globally it is said that transitional justice is to be linked to the value of dignity or humanity it is a shift from confrontation to mediation and reconciliation he further stated According to him transitional justice could be a mix and match of restorative and retributive justice The entire concept is the essence of being humane quite similar to the quality Maithree described in Buddhism which we have great faith in This is restorative justice As you see the concept is as wide as ever for the essence of being humane Mr Peiris noted According to him the International Centre for Transitional Justice ICTJ points to truth commissions security sector reforms and memorialization reforms as a few options in delivering transitional justice that are not mutually exclusive Do we use them alternately or do we mix them up when we talk of reconciliation Mr Peiris questioned Speaking of the efforts to reintegrate excombatants he asked whether we can be purely restorative Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan gave another meaning to transitional justice which is similar to the LLRC report on the root of law He said that the Government considered the idea of Kofi Annan who said that the full range of coming to terms with a legacy of large scale abuses was to serve justice reconciliation and accountability Kofi Annan at the time recognized a need for a locally tailored mechanism for human rights violations He said the UN is now looking for nationally led strategies for accountability and reconciliation If this was relevant then it is equally relevant now Mr Peiris emphasized Transitional justice options should not be selected by the people of this country more to do with outsiders expectations more than what is required by ground Mr Peiris said He said that a home grown mechanism to make sure that it works is the right and prudent way to locate peace building efforts on the sovereignty of the people We looked at comparative experiences from Argentina South Africa Cambodia and Sierra Leon we found that prosecutions alone would not heal the wounds of the past Mr Peiris highlighted The country had to balance the criminal trials which are retributive in nature Therefore he goes on to say that Transitional justice is a mix of both restorative and retributive justice From whatever angle we looked at it there are four pillars of international norms in structuring a home grown mechanism of international legal principles such as the right to know right to justice right to justice and remedy and recurrence He said the ideal model perceived incorporated all those principles into the Lesssons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission LLRC or the mandate of the LLRC They focus on concerns that were real to people at that moment reflect on the past and learn from the recent history to assure an era of peace and harmony amongst the people He said they cannot discount other restorative mechanisms such as the National Action Plan for the Protection of Human Rights The country confirmed and fully endorsed to give greater impetus to international peace and formulate a national action plan to improve all areas and targets of five years which is an initiative to protect human rights The National Action Plan commenced in 2009 and passed by the cabinet will be available at Government departments in a short while Speaking of its manifesto he said there was a clear commitment to promote and protect a strong HR culture He added that the LLRC and the national action plan were not the only stories of transitional justice in the post conflict period caring for the IDPs and the process of resettlement are also a part of restorative justice Its about reconciliation and promoting reconciliation work of the govt Member of Parliament Prof Rajiva Wijesingha Starting his speech Prof Wijesingha said that Talking about reconciliation one should talk about love and charity Pointing to the Buddhist principle Metta he said that we see an excess of self righteousness in the context of retributive and restorative justice Punishment required and many who are guilty of manifold death were forced into action Prof Rajiva stated We should stress on ensuring to come to terms with what happened to their loved ones in some cases the search extends to the last decade he noted Many complaints are for means of clarification not punishment but understanding and support he added It is not to say that prima facie cases are not to be looked at but not to be persuaded on cases of manipulated evidence he pointed out LLRC is spot on and the Government has not done enough Why are those tasks of fulfilling not detailed I hope the recommendations the LLRC make help us better Prof Wijesingha opined It was claimed two years ago that the resettlement programme will be delayed but the resettlement of IDPs now remains complete It was also claimed that we would hold back reintegrating the former LTTE cadres The Government didnt hold back they rehabilitated all but now a few remain at the rehabilitation centres he stressed I do not blame the Tamil National Alliance TNA for making allegations that more than 200000 IDPs remain to be resettled Government has not replied to the TNAs allegations We should have replied to it at Parliament and outside Positive actions need to be communicated and transferred Prof Wijesingha emphasized National Savings Bank told us in Parliament that they opened many branches in the North and when asked how many were situated outside Jaffna they said none he recalled Speaking of the post conflict planning he said that the country and the civil administration was faced with a situation new to them and the representatives of the public didnt have plans for their people They did not have experience of the planning process and as a result although the North and East have many new bridges there werent half that number of decent bridges to get to them he added Then addressing the issue of militarization in the North Prof Wijesingha said that it was only natural that military personnel were offered responsibilities of civil administration since they were more efficient than the public servants as they knew how to work under contingency He said that an ambassador asked him why they appointed a military man as the resettlement commissioner and the reason behind it was his efficiency when compared to the previous person who did not make the most in his role Therefore he stressed the need for bilingual and trilingual training technology and language development and engagement in joint projects He also stressed on the importance of a coherent education system with creative teachers and competent administrators enhanced by character and personality development as well as skills and tertiary training in management and entrepreneurship and community development to get rid of the culture of dependency The public sector has no role to play other than promoting the skills and capacities of the people while helping those who have suffered and most of all help people realize their own potential Jaffna GA Imelda Sukumar Reconciliation is the way forward for the post conflict Sri Lanka And the Jaffna district has 15 divisional secretariat divisions with 1405 villages comprising of 614577 persons The GAs office has been instrumental in rebuilding divisional secretariats and circuit bungalows We have realized the importance of capacity building and diversity building programmes to bring the youth together and get them to interact with each other imprinting in them the concept of cross culture and multi culturalism Emerging reconciliation initiatives in the North by the Security Forces Conflict is an unavoidable situation in life peace is the most complex concept in human history in that endeavour the Government is doing its best to augment the process of long term sustainable peace We are trying to change our image from that a fighter to that of a protector Gen Hathurusinghe said Security Force Commander Jaffna Gen Mahinda Hathurusinghe This is a trying task for which the security forces are willing to work hard he said The security forces he pointed out were the most organized arm of administration when compared to the war battered civil administration in the Jaffna district Speaking of their various initiatives he said that they developed a committee system to work together with the public assisting them in their endeavours like rebuilding houses using the manpower within the security forces and at times they went ahead and found means to donate money to buy the necessary raw materials for the houses that needed to be rebuilt Speaking of the livelihood support he said that every inch of the sea was returned to the public without any restriction of a high security zone to engage in fisheries as their main source of income Meanwhile speaking of their other livelihood promoting initiatives he said they completed 232 home gardening projects while providing machinery for back yard poultry and cattle farming The stigma in the Jaffna district in terms of caste differences rides high and the public refrained from donating blood to one another at a time The security forces took it upon themselves to donate the required amount of blood and now we can proudly say that our blood is in you Gen Hathurusinghe said He applauded the efforts of the Jaffna Hospital staff and despite their shortcomings they work without labour strikes and the security forces help with medical camps from time to time to ease the pressure on the hospital Special projects are established to look into childrens welfare in the area as a result of which construction of playgrounds and nurseries were implemented We encourage the ex combatants to take up livelihood initiatives such as crab farming and aloe Vera cultivation We have also laid special emphasis on rebuilding schools and religious places of worship he added The responsibility of Media in reconciliation was the topic handled Former Uthayan Editor Noel Nadesan Media is equally responsible for reconciliation The media was used by both sides considering the role it could have played in saving the lives of the people The emerging pattern points to pluralism in the English media while the Tamil media is self destructing if not boasting the Eelam dream Journalists applied pressure that did not please political parties easily if not coerced But the behaviour of the Tamil media is not responsible for it it denied its duty towards the public and the masses that were heavily dependant upon them The media that was expected to be critical played god to the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam They should have stayed critical but they failed to see the reality I dont know whether they were convicted by the LTTE he argued Questioning the Tamil medias inkling towards the LTTE he said it did not question the actions and repercussions of the decisions made by the LTTE during the last stage of the war Why did the Tamil media mislead the Tamil community saying that the LTTE will rise when they were being defeated time after time he questioned Also he questions why they didnt question the LTTE strategies to assassinate all the Tamil militants and leaders ethnic cleansing of Muslims from north and most importantly the killing of Rajiv Gandhi which was also easily justified by the media It is a shame to say that the Tamil media did not question why youth were sacrificed for the glory of one man We lost the cause since we refused to look beyond violence We abandoned the innocents and we lost all our credible leaders he said Should we blame the businessmen or journalists or the Tamil community for failing Finally he said it was depressing for me to criticize the Tamil media which Im a part of"

        "body": "The only significant milestone in the 20 yearslong UN Climate Change negotiations was the Kyoto Protocol KP signed in 1997 The first commitment period of the KP for Green House Emissions reduction is coming to an end by the end of 2012 next year The steps relating to the post Kyoto commitment period need to be discussed and finalized at the upcoming United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 17th Conference of Parties UNFCCC COP 17 being held from 27th Nov to 9th December 2011 in Durban South Africa The Sri Lankan delegation for this UN conference will be led by Anura Priyadarshana Yapa Minister of Environmental Affairs Patali Champika Ranawaka Minister of Power Energy and Mahinda Amaraweera Minister of Disaster Management The major distinction between the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention is that while the Convention encouraged industrialized countries to stabilize GHG emissions the protocol commits them to do so Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of Green House Gas GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity their historical responsibility the protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol was that it set binding targets for 37 industrialized countries also known as Annex 1 parties for reducing greenhouse gas GHG emissions The percentage of emissions of Annex I Parties is 637 of the total global emissions The percentage reduction of the Kyoto binding targets is an average of 5 against 1990 levels of those countries This target is to be achieved during 20082012 period The Protocol was ratified and entered into force only in February 2005 with not less than 55 countries including Annex I countries which accounted in total for at least 55 of the total carbon dioxide emissions Under the Treaty countries must meet their targets primarily through national measures However the Kyoto Protocol offered them an additional means of meeting their targets by way of three marketbased mechanisms The Kyoto mechanisms were Emissions trading known as the carbon market Clean development mechanism CDM and Joint implementation JI Out of the 37 industrialized countries the United States of America the biggest carbon emitter in the world refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol As a result the USA has become the major culprit in the world carrying the world towards climate catastrophe By 2009 the Annex I countries which signed the Kyoto Protocol managed to reduce their carbon emissions level by 15 against their 1990 levels On the other hand the main carbon emitter the USA which was the Annex I country which did not sign the protocol increased its emissions by 7 in 2009 against its 1990 level Under protocol the US was supposed to reduce its carbon emissions by 7 during the period from 20082012 The resultant average emissions reductions made by all Annex I countries including US was 5 in 2009 against their 1990 level Does this indicate that the Annex I countries are on target to avoid climate catastrophe despite the hindrances created by the USA Unfortunately the answer is no So what is going to happen after the Kyoto Protocols first commitment period which terminates at the end of 2012 The Bali Action Plan established an Ad Hoc Working Group on further Commitments for Annex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol The working group should have aim to complete its work and have its results adopted by the UNFCCC in time to ensure that there is no gap between the first and second commitment periods After five and a half years of negotiations the working group reflected only on country positions and their concerns but did not resolve them most notably the central issue of the second commitment period The negotiations have reached a deadend and further progress is not possible without clarity on overarching political decisions The developed countries should have had a higher level of commitment and political will to achieve mitigation targets and need to ensure the continuation of climate related marketbased mechanisms especially the clean development mechanism However reaching consensus for a second commitment period by the beginning of 2013 does not appear achievable and smooth continuity of the Kyoto Protocol beyond the end of 2012 is an unlikely event Some developed countries have already declared that they will not take mitigation commitments under the Kyoto Protocol in a second commitment period The negative approach of USA and the never ending carbon emissions growth in the developing world which increased its carbon emissions by 130 in 2009 against its 1990 levels has led the Annex I countries to this unfortunate nonbinding situation The Kyoto Protocol in its current form is out of date Delegates from nearly 200 countries meet in Durban South Africa from November 28th onwards for major climate talks However these talks will deliver neither an extension of the Kyoto commitment period with updated binding targets nor a second commitment period nor a new mechanism to mitigate climate change It is likely that the existing Kyoto targets for the 200812 period may be merely extended for a couple of years Kyoto can still survive only for regular reporting of emissions market mechanisms that allow emissions trading and compliance Many of the provisions can still function without new targets The UNled climate talks wanted an agreement from all big polluting nations on stronger emissions curbs amidst soaring greenhouse gas emissions and a string of weather disasters across the globe Some countries now say a new deal will not be in place until after 2020 The most likely outcome would be only a modest step toward a broader deal to cut greenhouse gas pollution to fight climate change Scientists say global pledges to curb carbon pollution wont prevent the planet heating up beyond two degrees Celsius a threshold scientists say risks wilder weather crop failures melting ice caps and major floods This will increase the stress on the poor and they will be struggling for survival under catastrophic climatic conditions in the near future Manmade climate change results in 2 million premature deaths worldwide every year and threatens water and food security especially among those bottom 3 billion A sustainable future based on the continued extraction of coal oil and gas in the businessasusual mode will not be possible because of both resource depletion and environmental damages Evidently these are not great problems for decision makers and powerbrokers around the planet They are happy to maintain the existing statusquo for selfgain alone and as such the world after 20 years of never ending talk fests has shamed itself by literally paying only lipservice to a globe threatening crisis"

        "body": "Targeting future leaders across the globe For nearly three decades the UK Governments most prestigious funding programme for international postgraduate students the Chevening Scholarship Scheme has provided over 30000 scholarships for potential future leaders from around the world In Sri Lanka and the Maldives some 100 scholars have been recipients of this funding scheme since its launch in 1984 With applications for 20122013 now open the Daily Mirror spoke to Robbie Bulloch Britains Deputy High Commissioner in Sri Lanka and Tony Reilly OBE the British Councils Country Director for Sri Lanka to find out more about the Chevening award as well as the new Cambridge Commonwealth Trust Scholarship Programme The British Chevening awards target highcalibre graduates and graduands with relevant work experience across a broad range of fields which are in line with the UK Governments international priorities such as public policy law engineering and IT Recipients of the award have the full cost of their tuition fees maintenance and airfare looked after in the expectation that scholars will make a positive contribution to their home countries upon their return Deputy High Commissioner Robbie Bulloch explained We want people who will go on to become leaders in their respective fields and as such we target high potential candidates who can demonstrate a potential to become influential persons capable of shaping the future of the country It is a very generous award because it not only pays for your studies at a top UK university and enables you to live there for one year but it actually allows you to enjoy the cultural experience of living in the UK As Bulloch acknowledged a number of lawyers have been successful in securing the scholarship in Sri Lanka in recent years because they have stood out in the application process and the important role that they play in terms of promoting democracy and advancing the rule of law However the vast majority of scholarships which cost 1500018000 per student per year have been awarded to professionals from a variety of other fields he pointed out This includes people involved in policymaking the police peacebuilding and other areas that are seen as priorities by the UK Government We dont want to limit it to one field or another it could be someone from the government an NGO or even the private sector but a key consideration is the applicants ability to demonstrate how their studies will be beneficial to the future of Sri Lanka Bulloch said When asked whether Sri Lankas recently acquired status as a middleincome earner has had an impact on the funding available for scholarships the Deputy High Commissioner stated that the Chevening awards still focused on developing countries We try to target countries that we think will benefit the most Even though Sri Lanka has moved into middleincome status much work remains to be done in terms of development and democracy and the opportunities available for students here are probably not the same as they would be in Italy or France We see that following a prolonged period of conflict there is still a long way to go in all the sectors So we still see Sri Lanka as a priority for British support Tony Reilly Country Director British Council explained that their role was to manage the Chevening programme for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO globally Its a highly competitive application process in all the countries Ive been working I was last in Iraq where we had 800 applications for 10 awards Similarly in Sri Lanka last year we received hundreds of applications for four awards The Chevening has a great reputation and people know that if youve been a Chevening scholar youre probably going places Reilly said From my experience in other countries I can say that were always on the lookout for people as future leaders and we would alert them to the Chevening scholarship But the actual application process shortlisting and interviewing is very rigorous transparent and competitive he reflected A Chevening scholar joins the global Chevening community which offers tremendous opportunities for networking In Sri Lanka an alumni association which is run by past scholars has just been formalised and the British High Commission and British Council who are keen to stay in touch with Chevening alumni are very supportive of the network Among the prominent Chevening Alumni is Sri Lankas incumbent Chief Justice Dr Shirani Bandaranayake the first female to hold this post who won the award in 1989 Interestingly the awards have seen a commendable gender balance among recipients in Sri Lanka At the beginning it was skewed in favour of males and I think that was something our colleagues were alerted to Now there is a gender balance of 5050 and in the last few years weve seen more females than males winning the award Reilly said This year the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust awards are also being launched and as such there will be a dual application process According to Reilly if candidates are interested in the Cambridge scholarship they need to first secure an offer from the University of Cambridge and they would have to move swiftly to do that because Cambridge tries to complete their application process by the beginning of December While the Chevening awards covers a wide array of subjects funding offered through the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust Fund does specify the areas of study namely human rights conflict prevention development studies and governancepublic administration For those interested in applying the British Councils Country Director has some useful advice Be clear about your ambitions and have milestones towards achieving them Either on their own or with our support do some research into the course youd like to follow You need to match your interested area of study with the university that has a strong reputation Often we find people who come to the interview and have not really thought it through The people who stand out are those who can clearly articulate what and why they want to study and where they see themselves in the future Adds Bulloch What we do want is to assess whether the candidate is likely to return with an education that will be beneficial for Sri Lankas development and we will look favourably upon those areas which fit within the broad remit of the British FCOs objectives and covers a broad area including trade climate change migration development and conflict prevention For the Chevening scholarship application process the deadline is January 15 2012 Those interested in applying for the award can visit the British High Commission website and the British Council website for details"

Egyptians the Syrians too dreamed of democratic freedom that would allow them to elect and reject governments Their hardwon independence from the French colonialists has been usurped by the militarybacked Baath Party regime which has been ruling Syria for nearly five decades Each time they had risen up in the past they were crushed More than 10000 Syrians were butchered by the Baathist regime in a brutal crackdown of dissent in 1982 Undeterred the Syrian revolutionary spirit has lived on and once again resurfaced with a greater force to deal a death knell to the Bashar alAssad government which like the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi fails to read the reality and believes that sheer brutal force would deliver it from the present crisis The reality however is that the regime is losing its grip The trumps the regime is holding are fast becoming ineffective The military one of the trumps is cracking with thousands of Sunni Muslim soldiers defecting Their defection has turned the people uprising into a nascent armed rebellion that is assuming a sectarian nature with the countrys majority Sunni Muslims backing the revolution while the minority Alawites who make up about 11 per cent of the population and hold the plum positions in the government and the military back the regime In a way the uprising in Syria is not only about bringing democracy but also about ending the tyranny of the minority Alawites who the Sunni Muslims say are not Muslims because of their belief that Ali the soninlaw of Prophet Muhammad is Godincarnate but sections of the Shiite Islam leadership have for political reasons accommodated them The second trump card of the Syrian regime is the moral support it gets from Russia and China Diplomatic behaviour of both China and Russia which vetoed a UN Security Council resolution against Syria recently speaks of their untrustworthiness as allies When it came to the crunch they abandoned Iraq and Libya and have gone along with the Western nations in slapping economic sanctions on Iran Syria is relatively a small fry A little pressure from the West is enough for Russia and China to relent because for them trade with the West matters more than an ally in the developing world Syrias next trump perhaps the biggest is Iran If the Assad regime falls and a Sunnidominated government comes to power with proWestern and proSaudi credentials Iran will be in a major disadvantageous position On the contrary if it withdraws its support to the Assad regime and backs the democracy movement just as the Turks have done then at least it can have a line of communications with the revolutionary forces on the basis that both have a common enemy in Israel For Iran a friendly regime in Damascus is vital especially in view of threats of an attack on its nuclear facilities by Israel and the United States The proIranian Shiite militant group Hezbollah acts as an extension of the Iranian military on Lebanons border with Israel If Israel attacks Iran Hezbollah will attack northern Israel This possibility stands as a deterrent against any Israeli attack on Iran If Iran does not have a friendly regime in Damascus its ability to arm and sustain Hezbollah will be severely curtailed On Monday Hezbollah described the turmoil in Syria as part of an international conspiracy targeting Damascus for its support for Arab and Muslim resistance movements in the region Two weeks ago Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel and the US that a war against Iran and Syria would lead to an allout regional conflict They should understand that a war on Iran and Syria will not remain in Iranian and Syrian territory but it will engulf the whole region and there is no escaping this reality he said One cannot dismiss the Hezbollah statement as mere rhetoric If foreign intervention comes to Syria it will trigger a regionwide conflict which may take years to end It is in this context that questions arise as to the wisdom of the efforts of the Arab League under Saudi Arabian pressure to put the crisis in Syria on the Libyan track The irony is that half the Arab League countries have no democracy and their rulers act like viceroys of the West In preparation for a Libyastyle intervention the West has apparently handpicked a few Syrian dissidents including those residing abroad to form a Syrian National Council The next step could be the imposition of a nofly zone over Syria or a humanitarian passage as France has suggested Any violation of these measures will trigger foreign intervention with UN blessings and lead to the setting up of a proWestern Syrian regime much to the dismay of the people who fought for democracy and freedom However the West needs to take heed of the developments in Egypt The people in the Arab world are more astute today than they were during the past when the colonialists came as liberators and looted the resources The Iraqis for instance are smart enough to tell the Americans thank you very much for helping us to get rid of Saddam Hussein you may leave our country now The masses in the Arab world know that their democracy cry and the blood they shed are not to replace one wolf with another with a sheeps clothing In Egypt the people are rising up again because they see the military council that assumed power upon the ouster of dictator Hosni Mubarak has been consolidating its power They want real change No half measures are acceptable So it will be in Syria and other Arab countries"

        "body": "In the realm of international relations Games Theory refers two speeding cars on a collision course One must swerve Otherwise both drivers will die As they started the game they were determined not to swerve When the two cars approached the crashing point sanity prevailed and one of the two or both swerved The situation applies to the crisis over Irans nuclear programme While Iran travels alone in its car its opponents car is loaded with hawks from the United States Britain and Israel They are cheered on by some western nations while the side referee the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA makes all the wrong decisions and finds fault with Iran In this oneminnowagainstmanygiants game Iran appears to have emerged unscathed though the threat of an attack is not over yet Just a week before the IAEA released its report a document which Iran says was prepared at the behest of the US and its western allies media reports revealed Britain was placing its forces on military preparedness in anticipation of a possible USIsraeli attack on Iran A report in Britains Guardian newspaper said hawks in the US were likely to seize on the IAEA report An attack on Iran has become a hot campaign issue in the Republican Party With the exception of Ron Paul all the other major Republican contenders support a military attack on Irans nuclear sites A month before the IAEA report was released the United States announced an alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador in Washington The US claim that Iran was behind the plot was probably aimed at scuttling moves in the direction of an IranSaudi Arabia thaw in relations which soured after Wikileaks revelations last year that Saudi Arabia had urged the US to attack Iran to halt its nuclear programme These reports along with Israels war rhetoric indicated that the attack on Iran was imminent now that the western powers have achieved their objective in Libya But the hawks appear to have chickened out like the driver who swerved Its largely because Iran is not Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya The wests modus operandi for regime change in a target country is to first befriend an opposition group within that country support it militarily and financially and then send in troops In Afghanistan the invaders ally was the Northern Alliance in Iraq the Kurds and the Shiite opposition and in Libya the National Transition Council But in Iran the US could not find a partner It failed dismally in its attempt to convert the postelection demonstrators into a formidable antiregime ally In desperation the regimechangers in the US are hanging on to Iranian dissident group Mujahideen Khalq though it is on the State Departments list of terrorist organisations This group has hardly any following within Iran These regimechangers also backed the Jundallah another terrorist group on the State Department list but Iran has crushed this group which operated in the countrys Sunnidominated Baluchi region Last year the groups leadership were arrested and publicly executed for their role in a series of terror attacks So the Wests regimechange modus operandi that worked in Iraq Afghanistan and Libya will not work in Iran Besides Iran has over the years developed its arms industry with Irans Revolutionary Guards playing a lead role Iran has developed missiles that can reach Israel while its cyber war capabilities are a cause for concern for the US and Israel Two recent incidents must surely have added to these concerns One was the hacking of computer systems in Israels defence and intelligence establishments Israeli officials suspect an Iranian hand behind the hacking perhaps in retaliation for the Stuxnet virus that sabotaged computer systems at Irans key nuclear plants last year The other incident a more serious one was Hezbollahs jamming of a hitech Israeli drone that flew over Lebanon last month The incident took place as reports said Israel in parallel with airstrikes was planning to launch a cyber war against Irans electric grid Internet and mobilephone networks A report in Lebanons Daily Star said the mysterious disappearance of the pilotless Israeli reconnaissance plane had raised speculation that the proIranian Shiitemilitant group Hezbollah had found a way of electronically jamming and disabling drones In a 2006 incident that vouched for Hezbollahs Iransupplied fire power the militant group fired a surfacetosea missile to neutralise an Israeli naval craft that was attacking Southern Lebanon If Israel or the United States attacks Iran Hezbollah has warned it will retaliate So unlike Iraq Afghanistan and Libya Iran has friends although the Islamic Republic cannot rely on the verbal friendship of China and Russia two big powers whose track records in the case of Iraq and Libya speak of their untrustworthiness Thus a regime change in Iran is inconceivable Neither is an attack on Iran because such an attack is sure to invite a powerful response that may set the entire Middle East on fire Another factor that rules out an attack on Iran is next years US Presidential election President Barack Obama is not so nave as to give his nod for an attack that is likely to send oil prices soaring at a time when the US and Europe are in an economic quagmire Such a decision will only invite a humiliating defeat for him at 2012 November election With an invasion or an attack out of the question those who seek to punish Iran for pursuing a nuclear programme which Teheran insists is for peaceful purposes are concentrating on acts of sabotage and assassination A number Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed or wounded in terror acts carried out by Iranian criminals working for Israel Some reports said last Saturdays blast which killed Irans top missile expert was an Israelisponsored act of terror though Iran insists it was an accident at an ammunition dump In the meantime the US Israel and their Western allies depend on the IAEA to introduce more economic sanctions on Iran"

        "body": "Before May 2009 over half a million people had been displaced largely in eastern province while still another good number of Tamils living in South Indian IDP camps The war resulted in over 100000 people killed or missing statistically over the 26 years of war tens of thousands disabled or critically injured The economic cost of the conflict has been measured by various scholars which amounted hundreds of billion rupees Two years after the war its victims are still to recover The article is written emphasising the importance of psychosocial interventions in the post conflict north and east of Sri Lanka One may wonder governments appalling silence and objections to promote psychosocial interventions in post conflict north and east Government vehemently rejected psychosocial interventions of INGOs after end of war branding them as soft core activities but Government proffered hard core activities such as road development livelihood promotion infrastructure development and housing construction While the Government may have its own justifications to prefer hardcore activities who can neglect the importance of psychosocial interventions in any post warconflictdisaster context in the world Post tsunami period in Sri Lanka saw lot of psychosocial interventions supporting victims across the affected north east and south of the country During this time some INGOs were criticized for selecting soft core activities all the time Some would say that in the post war conflict in Sri Lanka the importance of psychosocial interventions was diluted due to relatively little impression post tsunami psychosocial interventions had on victims While it needs comprehensive studies to measure the effectiveness or failures of these interventions in post tsunami period no body can relate whatever the failures if there was any of psychosocial interventions carried out during post tsunami period to post war period Psychosocial interventions can mean an intervention using primarily psychological or social methods for the treatment and or rehabilitation of a mental disorder or substantial psychosocial distress This includes psychotherapy counselling activities with families and psycho educational treatments rehabilitation activities from less to more structured activities such as leisure and socializing activities interpersonal and social skills training occupational activities or vocational training sheltered employment activities and provision of social support Psychosocial interventions exclude intake interviews assessment and follow up psychopharmacology appointments The start of psychosocial interventions in the world can be traced back to the very start of humans when they started to help each other Although psychosocial interventions mean much more than mutual support the very core of these interventions lie on mutual support At psychological level the interventions relate cognition emotion and behaviour levels and at social level the interventions deal with environment culture economies tradition spirituality and interpersonal relationships with family community and wider society Therefore it can be stated that in Sri Lanka a strong tradition of psychosocial support has prevailed from the time immemorial For example as a collectivist Eastern culture Sri Lankans have shared the habit of consoling and being with bereaved ones when some body dies The neighbours cook food and other needs for the bereaved family The community does not leave the bereaved family until the deceased person is buried or cremated A communal meal is prepared for the community on the 07th day 03rd month and so on These are all examples of strong psychosocial interventions our cultures have been tied with for centuries But in the present context when thousands of people have been killed another thousands disabled and thousands live in memories of these killed missing or disabled loved ones the much needed psychological interventions have been prevented In the context of about 90000 widows living in north and east they experience sudden changes of family structures and family roles as many families have now become women headed families contrary to earlier prominent patriarchal culture The very breakdown of traditional family composition is itself a great source of shock for many especially relatively young widows and small children One of the growing trends in the field of psychosocial interventions is the need to customise western developed concepts into local cultures and local settings This has been an accusation levelled against psychosocial interventions which need to be addrssed as a priority concern when psychosocial interventions are designed for Sri Lanka For the moment across the north and east there is handful of doctors priests civil society organizations civil society activists academics and other professionals informally supporting victims who are in need of psychosocial interventions Therefore lets now form a social discussion of this important area of intervention for the sake of thousands of victims of war and strugglers to rebuild their lives in the post war context in north and east and rest of Sri Lanka Groundviews"

        "body": "One would be surprised if it were stated that addiction to alcohol and cigarettes can be considered as a mental illness We see people who consume alcohol daily in public and some who do it on the sly It is the same with cigarettes There are social drinkers It is only a handful who understand the long term consequences of such addictions and refrain from them altogether The main reason is that Addiction to Alcohol cigarettes and drugs like heroin and Ganja stems from mental stress which may lead to mental illness It is common to take medication for illness and from time immemorial people have got used to consuming alcohol for various illnesses as well But alcohol cannot be considered as medicine Alcohol consumption is considered deadly in Medical terms This is an illness which is inherited and runs in families If you are one of them who process the gene by the courtsey of inheritance then the way you react to alcohol is very different to others As one would not know if you have the gene one could sought to symptoms which one experience subsequent to consumption of alcohol Lets look at some of these The symptoms start to surface after the first consumption The nerves are stimulated and the craving for more and more alcohol cigarettesdrugs begins The inability to control the urge is the mental illness These symptoms vary from person to person If it is a first time drinker he or she will be impatient until the next opportunity to drink This impatience causes them to plot and find ways and means of getting another drink getting to together with friends in secret there are also those who will stay in a smoke zone just to inhale the fumes Such behavior can be considered as symptoms The symptoms of long term alcohol addicts and drug addicts are different from the above They have strong cravings and complain of body aches and pains if they refrain from alcohol The symptoms can include loss of appetite loss of sleep tremors in hands and feet These symptoms interfere with their daily routine This is known as Alcohol Dependency syndrome Alcohol causes changes in the body inner systems which manifests externally as symptoms Blood and alcohol concentration levels of an alcohol addict is higher Thus this contributes to differences in the functions of the brain and the body The blood and alcohol concentration levels of a person who consumes alcohol daily are maintained at these higher levels to which the body gets adapted Refraining from alcohol for a day or few hours causes the blood alcohol concentration level to decrease This leads to craving for more alcohol at frequent intervals and such persons conveniently make it an excuse to drink in order to do any work They feel that alcohol enables them to work and most go to extremes to prove this point Alcohol addiction is a social problem It can be considered as a genetic illness as well However the complications occurring due to it can be prevented by certain therapeutic interventions The mental aspect of this illness can be controlled Remedial action has to be taken for the trauma downfall of the family which arises in families of such people For example if we look at a person who has been addicted to alcohol or drugs for the last 10 years starting the addiction at 17 years such a person has to seek medical attention This addiction can cause much trauma to his family and friends Medical Science has remedies for such people and that is why it is important for them to consult a psychiatrist in this regard When it comes to treating an alcohol addicted hisher cooperation is vital because initial treatment has to commence as a inward patient in a hospital which is to detoxify the patient with medication The second step is aversion therapy A drug which enables the alcohol craving to decrease is introduced A side effect of this is that it stimulates body function The patients gains a healthy appetite and his feeling of laziness disappears If the patient takes continuous treatment for at least three months after this initial therapy he can come back to normal There are some minor treatment side effects experienced by some patients like dizziness and nausea but these side effects usually disappear in a couple of hours or a day These minor side effects should not become a barrier for anyone to seek treatment which once done and continued would ensure that person a lifetime of happiness Some steps can be taken to help reluctant alcohol dependant patients to seek medical treatment The patient has to be mentally prepared before the visit It has to be emphasized how important he or she is to the family and the benefits of overcoming this problem which will not only solve the persons problem but the entire families trauma recover from downfall etc Once the patient is taken to the doctor the doctor will be able to start the relevant treatment A patient with loss of appetite will regain his appetite and this alone can stimulate him to continue with the treatment Treatment for the above can be sought on Fridays at the clinic in Peradeniya Hospital The clinic commences at 800am Anyone who finds it hard to access the above should meet a Psychiatrist from any of the hospitals in the country and take treatment"

        "body": "By Achalie Kumarage As acknowledged by experts privatization of stateowned enterprises is one of the most radical policy developments of the last quarter century It became a trend that gathered momentum in Sri Lanka after 1989 following the liberalizing of the economy Today the consequences of the trend have formed a common notion within the country that privatization is the panacea for ills of state enterprises Disproving the common notion some state enterprises have come forth quite competitively against the private sector even outdoing them Kurunegala Plantations Limited an entity under the Ministry of Coconut Development and Janatha Estate Development sets a fine example to prove this regard by winning two national awards at the National Agribusiness Awards 2011 Competing shoulder to shoulder against the private sector Kurunegala Plantations won the awards National second Runner Up in Agri Business and the gold award for the Large Category Producer Plantations The gold Award in the National category in the awards ceremony was won by Watawala Plantation PLC while the 1st Runner up was Lucky Lanka Milk Processing Co Ltd Following the achievement the CEO of the plantation SK Nillegoda told the Daily Mirror Privatization is no panacea for ills of State Enterprises but right management is We have proved in no uncertain terms that the State Sector too can compete with the private plantation companies or even outdo them managing the Plantation Companies with outstanding success State ownedagainst privatization The most intriguing fact about Kurunegala plantations is that it was initially a public entity which was privatized in 1992 in expectance of profits and less redundancy on the government fiscals The plantation said Mr Nillegoda was under the private sector for nearly 14 years and had depicted a continuous down fall in its output Owing to the conditions the company was reacquired by the government in 2005 There onwards the plantation indicated a gradual growth with a new record of increasing profit every year Consisting of 10 provincial estates of 5327 hectares the plantation owns seven estates in Kurunegala District two in Gampaha and one in Anuradhapura District with a work force of 1499 employees The main agri products of the plantation are coconut rubber and other diversified intercrops like cocoa pineapple duriyan and mango In recent times one do not come across a lot of public enterprises from which the government benefits In such a status quo the public owned company contributed to the treasury instead of being a constraint The plantation contributed to the treasury Rs40 million for year 2010 totalling to Rs100 million from 2007 to 2010 Mr Nillegoda revealed Stand out of the rest We are quite different from an ordinary plantation company in the country said Mr Nillegoda The company has been able to maintain a recorded highest income every year more than what it earned the previous year since 2005 According to Mr Nillegoda before 2005 was a contrast to after 2005 where the state appointed Management Board of the plantation accepted a challenge The journey since then has not been a cakewalk The Company was operating on Bank Overdrafts at the time of State takeover of the management in 2005 Insufficient Cash flow limited most important maintenance schedules management practices on ReUnder Planting Programs on Company owned Estates We accepted the challenge of managing the Company as a selffinancing and a viable entity Moreover this situation had created a thoroughly demoralized and frustrated set of employees who had very poor aspirations of their future These were major challenges initially faced by us he said Giving reasons as to why they are not just another plantation the CEO said The true potential of the Company was identified which resulted in improved performance after the state took over The trend of progress should be considered a rare achievement in the Plantation Sector The plantation has not been stagnating in the same state after 2005 For their quick recovery and rapid progress they have adopted special strategies which have enabled the company to flourish in quite a short period A few mentioned are Optimization of usage of resources Optimizing land productivity through diversification and employee productivity improvement by performance based incentive schemes and continuous training and development of employees Also adoption of new technology scientific agricultural practices and constant monitoring and evaluation has contributed the Company to reach up to the standards today Challenges before the plantation sector As the market prices of agri products fluctuate every now and then especially the local producers face crisis At one point they have to face the competition when imported agri goods are brought in to the country Cultivating coconuts a daily consumable product and rubber add more seriousness to the challenges Mr Nillegoda brought into attention a few of the challenges the sector has faced today In my opinion the highly unpredictable price fluctuations of products and prevailing unfavourable weather conditions are the key challenges faced by plantations On top of that recently emerged pest and diseases with limited compatibility to controleradication are another threat for increasing the output every year The scarcity of labour is another issue as identified by the CEO There is an acute shortage and a growing scarcity of skilled and semiskilled labourers such as Pickers Huskers Curers Tappers etc exists There are two main issues for the current situation which are poor replacement of labourers by youngsters and aging of present workforce The labour shortage would definitely become a pressing issue of the sector in the near future Mr Nillegoda said Contribution to the nation nThe Coconut estates belonging to Kurunegala Plantations Limited are managed as model coconut plantations nKurunegala Plantations Limited has become one of the main producers of high quality seed nuts to cater to the national requirement of coconut seedlings nThe Company has established new varieties of coconuts in collaboration with the Coconut Research Institute to enhance the production of seed nuts from these new varieties Kurunegala Plantations in the near future intends to explore foreign markets apart from their diversified contribution and supply to the local market"

        "body": "Sri Lanka was the focus last week both locally and internationally due to a bill being passed in parliament The revival of the underperforming enterprises and underutilized assets bill now holds an important place in the law and its implementation The bill was presented as one which was urgent and thus prevented anyone going to court to seek redress if he had one Why such an urgency The urgency was to target certain individuals politically Certain actions should be taken against underperforming enterprises It is necessary for the future development of the country Underperforming enterprises and underutilized assets could be defined as enterprises which are loss making and not utilizing assets 100 percent The act does not state the measuring index used to identify this The Greater Colombo Investment Commission or the Investment Board paragraph 29 of business undertakings Acquisition act and the Companies Special provisions law clearly states that the underperforming act is not relevant Also under the constitution chapter 157 clearly gives protection to foreign businessmen companies who invest here The underperforming and unutilized assets act violates both these two acts There are many enterprises which were profit making The Sevanagala sugar factory which comes under the Daya Group of Companies was running at a loss of 149 million when he purchased it Within a short period of time he was able to turn around this factory and at present is earning a profit of Rs 200 million The governments argument is that this factory was purchased at a very low price the numbers of workers have been reduced the production of sugar has not reached its expected targets and the factory was solely manufacturing spirits When Daya Gamage purchased this factory in 2001 it is true there were bids high than that of his But none of the other bidders was able to meet the financial obligations Private organizations do not carry out business like state institutions where there are large numbers of employees and most of them are paid salaries for doing nothing To make a 145 million loss making enterprise to a profit making 200 million venture it is a wellknown fact that private organizations will reduce the number of employees to make it profitable The reason for not reaching the expected target of sugar production was though the factory administration was transferred the land was legally transferred only in June 2011 For the past nine years when sugar cane has not been grown not reaching the expected target is understood by any one When you do not possess the land to distribute to the farmers to grow sugar cane how can a Sugar producing businessman produce sugar It could have considered true and reasonable if after two years of transferring the land if the targeted sugar was not manufactured With all these obstacles in place Daya Gamage has now been able to pay Rs4000 for a tonne of sugar cane while the price for a tonne os sugar cane in 2002 was only Rs1200 If this company was getting income by producing molasses the investment board could have taken action to rectify this It is unjustifiable after taking over these assets to make these allegations Pelawatte Sugar Company at the end of March 2011 had made a profit of Rs857 million and also settled dues to around 2 billion payable to employees banks and the income tax department This year the company expects to produce 30000 tonnes of sugar and the following year they expect to increase it to around 40000 metric tonnes The 5700 investors in the Ceylinco Leisure Company or the Ceylinco Tower are in a situation where they risk losing their investments This building belongs to the Ceylinco Homes Company and 55 per cent of the shares belong to Ceylinco Shri Ram Some 5700 investors had invested deposits in the Ceylinco Shri Ram and before the takeover the company had been valued at nine billion rupees The company was sold for six billion rupees and a plan was made to settle the 5700 investors After the takeover it will be the responsibility of the government to pay back the depositors and might turn out to be a dream for the investors of getting their money back Lanka Tractors was purchased in 1993 by private businessman Daya Wettasinghe a close relative of the Rajapaksas The property and assets were not transferred for the past 17 years and when legal proceedings were initiated in the Colombo Commercial Court it ruled that Rs 385 million be paid as damages up to 2003 due to the nonrelease of property and assets The government appealed against this decision and the case was heard before the current Chief Justice Dr Shirani Banadaranayake who rejected the appeal and the payment of Rs385 million was reaffirmed on 30th March 2010 The reason for this company to incur losses was due not because of the activities of this businessman but the actions of the government The government has disrespected the judiciary by not acting on the decision given by the courts It is an offence which is punishable under chapter 105 of the constitution and is liable to a jail term of 7 years with hard labour In addition a court case is pending with regard to the Hilton hotel and in a few days a judgment is expected to be delivered by the courts It is ironic that while the government is acting to take over underperforming private sector enterprises no decision has been taken with regard to stateowned underperforming enterprises Last year 106 state owned enterprises suffered losses to the tune of Rs619383 million and the biggest unutilized asset in South Asia belongs to Sri Lanka which is the Hambantota Harbour In addition the Kantale and Higurana Sugar Factories have continued to suffer losses for the past 17 years Mihin Lanka has incurred losses of up to Rs6810 million In addition under the COPE commission the Lanka Puthra Bank was established solely for village entrepreneurs The bank which has given out loans the nonrecovery percentage though alarming has been considered as very minute In 2007 the budget presented by his President Mahinda Rajapaksa allocated Rs1000 million to revive garment factories that had been shut down Out of this allocation Rs750 million was given to Tri Star Apparel garments and up to now not even five cents have been repaid to the government According to the reports presented by the COPE commission loans were given to Bettans amounted to Rs2501 million United Fisheries Thrift and loan cooperative Society Rs71 million Tissa weva hotels Rs42 million Crescent Buttons Manufacturing PVT Ltd Rs39 million and another Rs2322 million to another 16 enterprises Where money is freely given to close associates of the Rajapaksa regime when 106 state owned enterprises are suffering losses and huge sums of peoples money is being spent on projects which have no value it is laughable when the government is taking over 37 enterprises for the sake of development The end result of this act and the persons who will get these companies are left to be seen The prospective investors will be decided solely by the Rajapaksas"

        "body": "Pawns of Peace Norwegian peace efforts in Sri Lanka have been the subject of heated debate and controversy ever since they became public in December 1999 This debate has spawned many different stories about Norways involvement in Sri Lanka some of them very critical The evaluation entitled Pawns of Peace which is presented in Oslo today attempts to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of Norways role as a mediator as well as a ceasefire monitor and aid donor from 1997 and 2009 Based on a combination of interviews with key protagonists and archival research at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs our report provides a detailed narrative of the rise and fall of the peace process and it draws conclusions and lessons about Norways involvement The report criticizes several aspects of this involvement but it also underscores that the tragic story of Sri Lankas peace process and the resumption of war that followed was no more about the Norwegians failing than it was about the government winning and the LTTE losing Norway made mistakes and its intermediate successes the ceasefire the Oslo Declaration the joint mechanism for tsunami aid PTOMS proved ephemeral but it is unlikely that a different mediator or a fundamentally different type of intervention would have had an altogether more positive impact After all the structural characteristics of Sri Lankas minority conflict its political system the nature of the LTTE and shifts in the international context were of determining importance for how the conflict and the peace process evolved By Jonathan Goodhand and Bart Klem and Gunnar Sorbo The peace process reproduced rather than transformed underlying structural obstacles to conflict resolution It failed to induce fundamental changes in the disposition of the State and antistate formations in Sri Lanka and to some extent it caused a further entrenchment of positions The hurting stalemate which led to the Ceasefire Agreement initial peace talks and a period of no warno peace was followed by an escalating shadow war and finally open hostilities ending in the defeat of the LTTE in May 2009 Many factors contributed to this train of events but the following were crucial First both the government and the LTTE entered into the peace process while staying committed to their cause That is not to say they were not genuine in exploring a political solution but neither party made any significant shift in how they defined that political outcome there was an incommensurable gap between what the south would countenance a unitary state with limited devolution and the LTTE demanded a separate state in all but name Second peace efforts were constrained by structural features of the Sri Lankan State and politics The conflict is understood here as being rooted in processes of incomplete state formation which led to competing ethnonationalist projects Conflicts over territory are particularly resistant to negotiated settlements Several features of Sri Lankan politics made the challenge even harder including dynastic and interparty rivalries patronage politics and nationalist mobilization which resisted state reform and foreign interference Third the window of opportunity for a negotiated settlement was only a short one and based upon a unique constellation of domestic and international factors including a hurting stalemate leading to an acceptance by both sides of a measure of military and political parity a Western oriented government and multifaceted international backing for negotiations These factors were to change relatively quickly Perhaps most importantly the 2004 split in the LTTE shifted the military balance decisively in the governments favour This decreased incentives for substantive concessions by both sides Policies associated with the war on terror rather than concerns for the specificities of the Sri Lankan case undermined the potential for LTTE transformation and increased the isolation of Norway as the sole state conduit to the organisation Fourth there were important changes in the international positioning of the Sri Lankan government The effort led by the United National Front UNF government to internationalize the peace process through security guarantees donor funding and politically sensitive economic reforms sparked a Sinhalanationalist backlash This contributed to the emergence of a nationalistoriented administration with a commitment to a more hard line position towards the LTTE and greater scepticism towards Western involvement The new administration constructed its own version of an international safety net by drawing on the financial support and diplomatic cover of Asian powers This allowed the Rajapaksa government to pursue an ultimately successful military solution to the conflict As a weak soft power mediator Norway was not in a position to counter or transform these dynamics In the absence of a strategic road map or a robust network of international actors the peace process failed to lock the parties into irreversible concessions and commitments To some extent this can be attributed to limitations of Norways ownership model which provided both parties with the space to avoid core political issues while continuing to pursue incompatible goals Many of the constraints identified above were not amenable to external mediation and it should be recognized that all actors were operating in an environment of great turbulence and with incomplete information However different courses of action by Norway might have mitigated some of these problems First a stronger understanding of the domestic context particularly an appreciation of the material and symbolic effects of external intervention would have helped the team to predict many of the dynamics sparked off by the peace process Second the rather passive ownershipbased model left Norway open to instrumentalization and this could have been addressed by placing stronger parameters and minimal conditions on the Norwegian involvement from the beginning Third a careful monitoring of such parameters should probably have led to Norway withdrawing from its roles as mediator and monitor at an earlier stage Groundviews Norways experience in Sri Lanka yields some broader lessons for peacebuilding elsewhere 1 Peace processes produce unforeseen and unintended consequences Mediators need to consider the potential costs of their actions Applying of a consequentialist ethic and precautionary principles are required including benefitharm analysis and the careful and continuous weighing of possible scenarios and outcomes 2 There is a need to think about the balance between hard and soft power Norways approach may be suitable to bring parties into negotiations but harder forms of leverage may be required to reach and implement a settlement Even so as shown by the Sri Lankan experience hard power deployed by external actors cannot override domestic political dynamics when the constituency for peace is weak or limited Norway should avoid situations where it is a weak and isolated mediator with limited and inconsistent international backing This means placing more attention on multilateralizing peace processes by building links to and borrowing the leverage of other more powerful actors and coalitions 3 There is a strong rationale for an ownership approach but this does not negate the need for clear parameters of engagement Without sacrificing the basic idea of ownership there is a need for mediators to attach firm conditions to their involvement including the right to engage with all parties deemed to be relevant preserve public communication channels to speak out against malpractices or defend either the process or themselves and maintain or acquire leverage in relation to the parties 4 Aid may play a supportive role in peace processes but cannot short circuit complex political processes Aid cannot be a substitute for politics Moreover poorly conceived aid has the potential to destabilize fragile political settlements In Sri Lanka at one end of the spectrum working on conflict sometimes amounted to trying to buy peace At the other end economic reforms were based on a simplistic understanding of the relationship between economic efficiency growth and peace It is in the middle ground between these two positions that aid is most likely to play a supportive role in the pursuit of peace This necessarily involves a more modest but conflict sensitive role for aid in the context of peace processes 5 Norway played several roles in Sri Lanka not all of them easily compatible with one another these included diplomatic broker arbiter of the ceasefire and humanitarian and development funder Norways experience in Sri Lanka underlines that when multiple roles are combined there is a need to develop a more robust strategic framework which optimizes synergies and complementarities between them Otherwise tensions and trade offs are more likely particularly in the context of an unconditional ownership approach and a flimsy international framework 6 Norway has usually been a mediator in conflicts between a state and nonstate actor based on an approach of evenhandedness and addressing issues of asymmetry The Sri Lankan case highlights the difficulties of following such an approach in the context of the war on terror This suggests a need for careful reflection on whether it is possible for Norway to square the circle of showing a united front with other international players on countering terrorism whilst attempting to talk with terrorists in order to bring peace 7 The Sri Lankan peace process reflects broader global changes It began as an experiment in liberal peacebuilding and ended as a result of a very different Asian model of conflict resolution Building on Westphalian notions of sovereignty and noninterference a strong developmental state the military crushing of the terrorism and the prevalence of order over dissent or political change this model may serve as an inspiration for other countries in the region This global eastward shift may have farreaching implications for the possibilities of Norwegianstyle mediation in the future"

the stage for a legal wrangle that longed for more than one hour in the House In his remarks he tried to drive home the point that the bill was unconstitutional and therefore it should be shelved Subsequently UNP MPs Palitha Range Bandara Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe Karu Jayasuriya Ajith Perera Dayasiri Jayasekara and Joseph Michael Perera joined the chorus interpreting the provisions of the bill in terms of the Constitution and the parliamentary standing orders They questioned not only the morality of the bill but also the legality of it They said that the bill if passed would definitely violate the fundamental rights of individuals guaranteed in the Constitution One cannot rule out the fact that the UNP has special interests in its efforts to reverse the bill in the House without allowing it to be debated Out of the 37 companies listed in the Bill one is Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd belonging to the partys Ampara district organizer Daya Gamage Therefore the UNP could have seen the bill as an attempt to politically victimize its party member After the opposition MPs aired out their views on the new bill cited by them as a draconian piece of legislation Leader of the House Nimal Siripala de Silva was the first to counter the UNP In his opening remarks he shifted his focus away from the contents of the bill and made it a debate to the parameters of power between the Legislature and the judiciary He admitted that the Supreme Court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the bill was constitutional or not The Supreme Court has determined that the bill is constitutional Therefore we cannot accept the arguments put forward by the opposition Also we cannot stop our work in Parliament merely because of pending court cases Parliament has the supreme authority in this case Parliament represents peoples mandate he said His ideas were widely asserted by his colleagues such as Petroleum Minister Susil Premajayantha The arguments and counter arguments based on sharp legal points compelled the Speaker to suspend the sittings for half an hour I will suspend the sittings for half an hour and announce whether the debate can be taken up or not he said The House resumed days business at 340pm as anticipated the Speaker gave the go ahead for the debate on the bill He reasoned his ruling among others to the matter that the Cabinet had decided the bill as something urgently needed in the national interests of the country Subsequently the debate kicked off in the wellattended chamber of the House Equally filled was the public gallery with school children and the owners and employees of some of the business ventures to be acquired under the bill Main among those who joined the debate was Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa who took more than one hour to explain the circumstances that led to the introduction of this bill and the purpose of it Refuting allegations that the bill was drafted in a hurry he said that thorough studies were done into the affairs of the companies listed for acquisition Referring to reports on each of them the Minister said that some of them had been closed down years back and their owners had not paid compensations to their employees even The debate took an emotional form when the Minister started referring to Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd By the time proprietor of the company Daya Gamage was listening to the debate in the public gallery whereas his wife Anoma Gamage was gathering points as a UNP MP Initially I did not intend to talk about Sevenagala Sugar Industries Ltd because of my personal friendship with Daya Gamage Also I did not want to do it in the presence of Mr Gamages wife sitting in the opposition at the moment Minister Rajapaksa said Visibly nerved by Mr Rajapaksas remarks Mrs Gamage said You better speak Then we can counter it with proper information Otherwise it will be misleading Despite repeated denials by Mrs Gamage the Minister charged that the company had been incurring losses Also he charged that the management of the company had failed to honour the agreement signed with the government when it was privatized Government benchers maintained pin drop silence when Mr Rajapaksa made his remarks Yet there were indecent behaviour by them when opposition MPs tried to counteract Mr Rajapaksa After Mr Rajapaksa JVP parliamentary group leader grabbed the attention of the House through time tested and pointed presentation of facts for and against the provision of the bill For him the manner in which these ventures were privatized was flawed in many ways Assets were not properly valuated and the tender procedures violated when privatizing them from time to time in the past Yet Mr Dissanayake blew a frontal attack on the present government acting in a duplicitous attempt to take over them even without giving a fair share of hearing to their owners Here a moral issue is involved Also he was the only member to draw parallels between this bill and other urgent bills introduced in the past On other occasions where urgent bills were introduced aggrieved parties were given a chance to appeal against their cases Here no such chance exists The bill has listed the companies to be acquired Once the bill is passed aggrieved parties cannot go to court Is this reasonable he asked At the end of the day the bill was passed with a majority of 76 votes All the opposition parties the religious dignitaries the chambers of commerce and civil society activists were not in favour of the bill By Kelum Bandara"

of an opinion piece or two only when the summit is on Even at summits the SAARC solidarity or camaraderie is largely confined to photoops The ground reality speaks of one of rivalry mutual mistrust or apathy The neverending IndiaPakistan wrangling needless to say is a major contributory factor that has stunted SAARC Charges that one country is aiding and abetting terrorism in the others territory are rampant with India pointing to the 2006 Mumbai attacks and the troubles in Kashmir while Islamabad links New Delhi with a simmering separatism in Baluschistan Apart from Kashmir the two countries are fighting a proxy war in Afghanistan One needs not go into the details of the muchdiscussed topic of how the IndiaPakistan rivalries have affected SAARC But take the relations between other SAARC

said Bangladesh had thwarted a European Union attempt to grant beneficial import conditions to Pakistani textile makers as an aid measure following Pakistans devastating floods last year Under WTO

topic of discussions on Wednesday between the officials of the two countries at the Addu islands on the sidelines of the SAARC foreign ministers meeting Bangladeshis officials indicated that they may withdraw the objection while Pakistans Foreign Minister Hina Rabbbani Khar called it an accident Of course we are very concerned about it We have been told by them that it was at best an accident she told Reuters But rarely does the spirit of giveandtake that is seen at SAARC summits manifests when leaders return to their capitals where decisions are made on nationalinterest basis rather than each

favoured nations status to visitors from SAARC member states although one of the objectives of SAARC is to improve peopletopeople contacts It was only after India objected that Sri Lanka relented and made concessions This years summits theme Building Bridges is perhaps an admission of the existence of widening gaps in relations between member states SAARC has tremendous potential for solidaritybased growth But the regions healthy 6 percent GDP growth with India recording 97 Sri Lanka 8 Bhutan 74 Bangladesh 58 the Maldives 48 Nepal 46 Pakistan 44 and Afghanistan 34 is hardly attributable to SAARCbased factors The much talked about South Asia Free Trade Area SAFTA which was signed in 2004 and became operational in 2006 has not made much progress though the member states are expected to adopt a zero customs duty policy by next year Trade among SAARC nations accounts for only 5 percent of the aggregate trade At the Addu summit yesterday Indias enthusiasm for trade liberalization in keeping with SAFTA was not evident in other memberstates This is largely because they still fear that India will gobble up the economies of smaller states if full liberalization of trade comes into effect As a result SAARC which is essentially an economic union remains largely ineffective unable to achieve its main objective raising the living standards of its people through economic cooperation With the European Union in crisis over debt problems involving Greece Italy and other countries a big question looms over the concept of regional integration a politically vogue concept in the 1970s and 1980s The formation of SAARC was largely a reaction to the success of the European Commission and the Association of the South East Asian Nations in that era rather than a product of much research and thought But today with the World Trade Organisation governing trade the concept of regional economic integration is losing its appeal This does not mean SAARC is obsolete or bound to crash It can move ahead but it needs to be pragmatic rather than idealistic It should identify its capabilities handicaps and the extent to which each memberstate can compromise and then set its goals aimed at economic development rather than living in a fools paradise with the dream of zero custom duties and total liberalization of trade"

        "body": "The Committees report examines the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights between September 2010 and August 2011 It contains information gathered during the Committees mission to the region which took place from 21 to 28 July The mission included the Committees first ever visit to an occupied Palestinian territory namely to the Gaza Strip as well as meetings in Jordan The Committee was provided with a wide range of views regarding Israeli practices affecting the human rights situation in the occupied territories Invitations were extended to Palestinian Israeli and Syrian victims witnesses and nongovernmental organizations and support was made available to facilitate their appearance before the Committee Documentation and other materials submitted to the Committee were reviewed in the process of preparing this years report The overarching observation of the Special Committee following its visit to the Gaza Strip is that Israels blockade continues to amount to a collective punishment of the civilian population despite limited relaxation of the blockade This collective punishment is having a grave impact on the children of Gaza Israelienforced restrictions on the freedom of movement within Gaza and restrictions on the importation of materials necessary to reconstruct houses schools and other infrastructure destroyed by operation Cast Lead constitute further serious concerns that were emphasized during the Committees visit to Gaza The Special Committee received extensive testimony regarding the high prevalence of physical and mental health problems that have resulted from Israels blockade Organizations working on health issues stressed that there have been increases in the incidence of high blood pressure cancers and other physical ailments while psychological conditions such as depression conversation disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder are widespread The Committee saw that much of the devastation of infrastructure that occurred during Israels operation Cast Lead remains Witnesses informed the Committee that reconstruction is constrained since Israels blockade impedes the importation of materials The Committee was informed that 51000 civilians lost their homes during Israels operation Cast Lead Committee members were disturbed by testimony that Israel enforces its restrictions on movement on the borders of Gaza through the use of live fire The members were dismayed to learn that 17 Palestinian children were killed in live fire incidents in 2010 Furthermore witnesses noted that Israels socalled buffer zone excludes around 35 per cent of Gazas land territory from agricultural use and that such restrictions extend to Gazas fishing territory While the Oslo Agreement allotted 20 nautical miles of maritime area to Palestine Israel has reduced this to 3 nautical miles These restrictions have greatly diminished Gazas agricultural and fisheries industries Two telling statistics are that fishermens catches fell by around 50 per cent between 2008 and 2009 and 92 per cent of Gazas fisherman now live in poverty The Special Committee received extensive information on the grave impact that Israels blockade is having on children in Gaza Frequent direct exposure to violence including being victims of such violence a general feeling of helplessness and lack of opportunities obstruction of the right to education and rapidly deteriorating physical and mental health constitute the most immediate concerns These could result in consequences that may become vastly problematic in the future Some of the statistics that witnesses provided are indicative 75 per cent of children at the age of nine months are aneamic 13 per cent of children under five suffer from malnutrition and 25 per cent of children do not eat breakfast Deficiencies in critical vitamins and minerals are diminishing childrens capacity for learning In addition the Committee was told of 20 instances within the past year when Israeli authorities have denied Palestinian children the possibility to travel outside of Gaza to receive necessary medical treatment The expulsion of children to areas away from their homes was mentioned by witnesses In one such instance a three year old child died while awaiting permission to travel The Committee was informed that 17684 dunums of land were confiscated between August 2010 and June 2011 Witnesses gave particular attention to Israels increasingly vigorous confiscation of land in the Jordan Valley The Committee was also reminded that Israel persists with the construction of the Wall in defiance of the 2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice The Committee received accounts of violence being perpetrated by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their homes crops and mosques Not only did witnesses report that Israeli settlers perpetrate violence against Palestinians with near impunity but the Committee also heard consistent allegations of cooperation between Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers on committing violence against Palestinians and their properties In line with the General Assemblys request and while welcoming the recent exchange of prisoners the Committee gave particular attention to the situation of Palestinians in Israeli prisons Witnesses raised serious concerns related to the legal status of such prisoners the lack of family visits access to proper medical care conditions and treatment during detention concerns particular to female detainees access to education for detainees and longterm detention without charges One victim explained to the Committee his experience of being detained for two full years without having been charged under the socalled administrative detention In addition the Committees attention was drawn to a new policy of continuing to imprison Palestinians at the conclusion of their sentences under the designation of illegitimate fighter status as well as a new Israeli law allowing for the detention of any Palestinian who has previously been detained The Committee was unable to travel to the Syrian Arab Republic this year However the members were able to engage with victims in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights by way of teleconference Unfortunately the testimony received indicated that Israel has not changed its policies and practices of concern in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights Specific concerns raised included discrimination against Syrians with respect to access to water and the resultant negative impacts on Syrian agriculture in the occupied Golan Heights the continuing policy of inhibiting Syrian families from visiting their relatives outside of the occupied Golan Heights Israels construction of a wall to cordon off the occupied Golan Heights incidents of excessive use of force by Israeli security forces against Syrians and poor conditions of detention for Syrian detainees held by Israel The following are the key recommendations to Israel in the Special Committees report Lift the siege of Gaza Ensure a regular and adequate supply of food medicines and other basic supplies and services in line with Security Council resolution 1860 and increase the capacities of Israeli crossing points for cargo and commercial goods Clarify restrictions on the freedom of movement within Gaza and ensure that Israeli security forces and the population of Gaza are informed of such restrictions Israeli security forces should never enforce such restrictions through the use of live fire Desist from confiscating further land in the West Bank and develop and implement a plan to return land that has been confiscated In this connection cease the demolition of Palestinian houses and provide appropriate compensation to Palestinians who have had homes demolished Desist from the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory and to dismantle settlements previously built Take effective measures to end violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers This must include informing Israeli security forces in the West Bank of their legal responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians and their property from violence Ensure the humane treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails With regard to the people in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights Facilitate visits for Syrians in the occupied Golan with family members in other parts of Syrian territory"

        "body": "On this basis an average of 7 persons die due to road accidents every day about 16 persons are seriously injured and 34 persons receive minor injuries In recent years from 2005 onwards there has been a considerable reduction in damage only accidents according to statistics This reduction is no reason to rejoice this drop is due to new insurance procedures in vogue where damage only accidents are settled directly through Insurers without being repored to Police Stations According to sources from the University of Moratuwa road accidents cost the country in the range of Rs25 billion and traffic congestion costs the country around Rs35 billion or more A study by the University of Moratuwa shows the risk factor of a Sri Lankan facing death on our roads has doubled from 1977 to 2005 The risk of the next generation could be trebled by 2020 unless we take remedial measures In 1977 the risk factor on roads was 1 death to 116 whereas by 2005 it was 1 death to 51 normal deaths and by the year 2020 it may well be 1 death to 25 normal deaths Traditionally over the years Pedestrians remained the highest category of victims of road accidents in Sri Lanka as in most developing countries They will continue to be vulnerable until the roads are structured by means of traffic calming and segregation measures by way of design features to enhance their safety In developed countries the pattern is totally different where drivers and passengers form the highest category of those killed in road accidents Pedestrians are not significant due to numerous reasons such as respect for pedestrians rights segregation of pedestrians from moving vehicles inbuilt safety features and higher order compliance of road rules by drivers Sri Lanka similar to other Asian countries such as Singapore Malaysia Taipei and China Motorcycles now forms the largest fleet of motorized vehicle segment and ranks also as the category most vulnerable among road victims To arrive at a logical conclusion on involvement one must consider the distances travelled and the number of vehicles in each category in operation rather than the number involved in fatalities because it could be argued that there are more cars than busses On the other hand if the number of buses and cars are the same by reason of the fact that the bus travels more than a car in a year and it is larger in size it may be more exposed to fatalities or accidents Hence vehicle kilo metres travelled by each category and the operational fleet is the most accurate measurement to determine the ranking of most dangerous category Statistically the most involved categories in road fatalities in the year 2010 are Motor cyclists 722 Busses 392 Three Wheelers 227 Vans 212 Cars 157 Dual Purpose vehicles 122 Pedal cycles 59 Tractors 52 Jeeps 43 Containers 27 Land Vehicles 09 Hit and Run 89 Comparison of 2009 fatalities does not make any significant difference with those of 2010 To an outsider respect and compliance with traffic regulations as well as enforcement of traffic laws is an index of respect for the Rule of Law in a society The main objective of traffic law enforcement is to make road use safer and more efficient The overall objective of traffic law enforcement and traffic regulations is primarily to serve as a deterrent for drivers from committing traffic offences It is primarily meant to increase road users perception of the risk of being apprehended and its dreaded consequences Effective Law Enforcement does not mean maximizing the number of infringement notices issued to motorists Much of todays enforcement regrettably is directed towards maximizing infringement notices and not directed towards the overall objectiveIf traffic law enforcement is to be effective all citizens must be Equal Before the Law Today certain strata of our society seem to be above the law and the society in general has very little respect for the law so in such a scenario effective law enforcement seems doubly difficult in the foreseeable future Traffic Law Enforcement needs to be directed more intensely on offences which have a direct bearing on road accidents such as excessive speeding overtaking dangerously aggressive driving misuse of horn turning or changing direction without signals driving without due consideration for others driving after alcohol and failing to stop at crossings and signals In the enforcement arena the police should implement the compulsory wearing of seat belts for front seat passengers and on expressways in the rear as well this law unfortunately was in abeyance since 1994 Effective Police presence and patrolling in marked and unmarked police vehicles using high tech equipment such as automatic fixed speed cameras and use of calibrated speedo meters in unmarked police cars would have a profound effect on driver behaviour For the time being engaging traffic officers in mufti armed with radio communication sets to detect moving violations would bring about a similar impact on road behaviour Research shows benefits of speed reduction are particularly high where pedestrians are concerned the probability of pedestrian fatality reduces by about 80 per cent at impact speed of 80 Kmh or above to less than 10 per cent at 30 Kmh If speed enforcement is to be effective by whatever measures adopted it needs to be uniformly spread out for the day and must be intensive Road safety should no longer be the domain of the Police alone all those responsible for road construction and management have an equal responsibility If those in the business of insurance along with professional advertising marketing should support the efforts of the Police enforcement and road safety strategies by offering the necessary resources the benefits will be substantial and enormous to the insurers in the longer term The writer is Former Deputy Inspector General of Police By Camillus R Abeygoonewardena"

        "body": "Amidst British Prime Minster David Camerons statement at the CHOGM on the issue of states treating homosexuality as a crime it brings up an interesting debacle as to what exactly its the legal position in Sri Lanka Section 365A of the Penal Code under the heading Unnatural Offences used to cite the following Any male person who in public or private commits or is a party to the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male shall be guilty of an offence This was termed Acts of gross indecency between male persons This section was further amended by Act No22 of 1995 and termed Acts of gross indecency between persons the amendments brought being that male person was replaced with any person and the punishment for the offence which was initially imprisonment for up to two years a fine or both which has now been amended adding that when the offence is committed by a person over 18 years on any person under 16 years of age that up to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment may be imposed with a fine and also compensation for any injuries Thus it can be understood that the law of Sri Lanka since 1995 provides for criminalizing homosexual and lesbian activities both in private or public even if consensual and the amendments in 1995 suggest that the impact of the offence is graver than that it was earlier judging by the higher penalty that is now imposed Interestingly as per sources there have not been any convictions made on the above laws up to now suggesting that the law is not in force It may be termed by some a dead law that which is not enforced nevertheless legally valid A certain minister had commented that this is something that has been given to us by colonialism It begs the question whether such a practice can be so brought within like the practice of speaking English or playing cricket I would like to think that there is something more than mere imposition leading to Sri Lankan gay activity but of course exactly what factors lead to a change in sexual orientation be it biological psychological or sociological I cannot comment it being beyond my learning The stance of religions has been against gay activity In the 1990s attempts to decriminalize gay activity was met with staunch resistance from Christian and Muslim activists The reason for such would be moral religious grounds Law is influenced by morals This is the area of Natural Law as defined by some as to do what is Natural to man according to his instincts The terming of the offence as Unnatural Offences suggest the basis of gay activity being thought of as illegal is clearly due to reasons based on religious grounds and anthropological grounds which consider such as unnatural However how far can a state regulate such activity Public indecency can be one thing is it however possible to criminalize activities of consenting adults For example in Sri Lanka we have certain prohibited degrees of marriage based on biological as well as moral grounds What then would be the basis for the prohibition of consensual same sex adult activity One may say a religious basis But unlike the near universal consensus on marriage prohibition on such grounds we must understand that the grounds against gay activity are not as strong It would thus seem this would be an unwarranted intervention on the private lives of human beings One must not compare Sri Lanka with western ideals where gay marriage gay adoption publicly gay politicians are fully part and parcel of daytoday life The only logic for Sri Lanka to maintain its status quo on being antigay is then the much harped upon culture and ideals of decency that we so proudly deem to possess Despite the lack of laws enforcement there is to an extent a branch of social justice at practice where gay activity is somewhat condemned Even though the Law is inactive it can be understood that society carries out a policing duty with this regard Sadly however then society is playing a game of double standards Do we not know the activities that take place in the coastal areas of our country concerning beach boys and male clients from here and abroad Is private gay activity incorrect when Colombos high society seems quite happy to enjoy entertainment from seemingly gay based shows Article 12 of the Sri Lankan Constitution provides for equality before the law The Law provides for an offence but policy dictates otherwise It seems therefore Sri Lanka is entirely confused as to the position we should adopt on gay activity legally socially and morally and it just maybe some persecute the wrong sector of the so called criminals or perverts It is high time the government takes up this issue and clarifies a proper stance for the future"

        "body": "Speech by Minister of Justice Rauff Hakeem on the Report of the International Law Commission at its sixtythird session Immunity of State Officials from Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction The delegation of Sri Lanka extends its sincere appreciation to the Special Rapporteur on the topic Immunity of State officials from Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction Mr Roman Kolodkin for his comprehensive Second and Third Reports on the topic containing a wealth of relevant material which would facilitate future work The topic is a difficult and challenging one involving obvious political sensitivities Nevertheless it is a topic of extreme contemporary relevance Given the complexities involved there is a clear need to agree on matters of principle and on the general orientation of the topic before proceeding to formulate draft Articles The principle of sovereign immunity is well established in customary international law and continues to play a vital role in assuring the stability of international relations and in the effective discharge of the functions of the State In addition the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and related Conventions in this field guarantees the immunity of DPL agents and other representatives of States such as those on special Missions so that they could discharge their functions on bhalf of the State they represent unhindered by the jurisdiction of the host State In addressing the issue of sovereign and diplomatic immunity we must bear in mind the fact that the risk of politically motivated criminal prosecutions could very well lead to serious frictions in interstate relations There is therefore a clear need to strike a careful balance between the contending policy considerations involved i of preserving the wellestablished principle of sovereign and diplomatic immunity and ii of addressing the issue of impunity The challenge before the Commission is to preserve such balance without tilting too much one way or the other On the scope of persons covered by Sovereign Immunity we feel that Heads of State Heads of Government and Ministers of Foreign Affairs the wellknown Troika enjoy by virtue of their office full immunity ratione personae This position is well entrenched in customary International Law and clearly recognized by the International Court of Justice We also need to take into account in this regard the current realities in the conduct of international relations and the fact that the nature of representation in international relations has changed Consequently there is a need to examine other possible categories of state officials beyond the Troika who by virtue of their functions may be entitled to immunity ratione personae We would therefore agree with the Special Rapporteur that there might be a need to establish criteria to determine such categories The close involvement of an official in the conduct of international relations could be one such criteria These issues require deeper analysis bearing in mind interalia earlier work of the Commission such as the Code of Offences against Peace and Security and established state practice having regard to the distinction between Lex Lata and possible developments de legeferenda My delegation therefore is in favour of the proposal that has been made to constitute a Working Group at the next session of the Commission to further consider and analyze these difficult issues before proceeding to the stage of preparing draft articles The Obligation to Extradite or Prosecute The delegation of Sri Lanka agrees that the topic of Extradite or Prosecute obligation presents considerable difficulties particularly as it has implications for other aspects of the law such as universal jurisdiction Nevertheless we believe that the topic remains a viable one and need to be pursued with a deeper study of contemporary State practice During the debate in the Commission it had been noted that the methodology adopted in treating customary law and treaties as sources of the obligation to extradite or prosecute separately in two draft articles was problematic We agree that the focus should be on the obligation to extradite or prosecute and how treaties and custom evidenced the rule Concerning draft Article 4 international custom as a source of the obligation to extradite or prosecute we would encourage the Special Rapporteur to undertake a detailed study of State practice and opinio juris and determine which serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole gave rise to a customary law obligation to extradite or prosecute Among the key issues that must be addressed is whether the accumulation of treaties containing an obligation to extradite or prosecute meant that the State accepted that there was a customary rule in existence with regard to the obligation to extradite or prosecute Extensive State practice in becoming parties to treaties containing the obligation to Extradite or Prosecute could be a strong indicator of the existence of a developing rule of customary law We agree that the views that have been expressed that while the topic remains viable the work must proceed with a greater sense of urgency in the new quinuennium MFN Clause We welcome the progress made in the Study Group on the Most Favoured Nation MFN Clause under the Cochairmanship of Mr Donald Mc Rae and Mr Rohan Perera We note that useful discussions had taken place in the Study Group in an attempt to identify further the normative content of the MFN Clause in the field of investment taking into account current arbitral jurisprudence My delegation is confident that the outcome of the work of the Study Group would make a positive contribution towards ensuring greater certainty and stability in the field of investment law The study Groups efforts must result in an outcome that would be of practical utility to Members States and Judicial Tribunals alike The undertaking of the preparation of general guidelines and model clauses to assist States when negotiating Investment Promotion and Protection Treaties would be a positive step in this direction and we look forward to the completion of this work during the term of the next Commission Treaties over Time We also welcome the work accomplished in the Study Group on Treaties over Time under the Chairmanship of Mr Giorg Nolte Taking into account the subsequent practice in the interpretation of treaties would not only ensure that the Treaty remains relevant in contemporary times but also encourages and facilitates its practical application We take note of the preliminary conclusions by the Chairman on the work so far accomplished and hope that the work on this topic would be concluded in the next Quinquennium New Topics Sri Lanka welcomes the inclusion on the long term programme of work of five new topics referred to in paragraphs 365 to 367 of the Report on the basis of the criteria agreed upon by the Commission in 1998 We believe that the selection of these topics meet the relevant criteria However there is a need for prioritizing among them In response to the request contained in Chapter III of the Report calling for Proposals by States I wish to recall the suggestion made by the President of Sri Lanka during the 65 Session of the UNGA HE Mahinda Rajapaksa to address the issues of Intenational Humanitarian Law and their application to NonState Armed Groups in contemporary conflicts He stated it is worth examining the capacity of current international humanitarian law to meet contemporary needs It must be remembered that such law evolved essentially in response to conflicts waged by the forces of legally constituted States and not terrorist groups The asymmetrical nature of conflicts initiated by nonstate actors gives rise to serious problems which need to be considered in earnest by the international community Sri Lanka in its intervention at the Security Council Debate on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict on 11th November 2009 stated Much of the rules of war are based on the presumption that the parties to the conflict are conventional armies of responsible states engaging other state parties But terrorists totally disregard these laws and principles as they wage asymmetric warfare They mingle with and use civilians to achieve their goals Once again the practical realities based on the experiences of Member States must be seriously looked at instead of a theoretical application of humanitarian norms to all situations This was also referred to by the delegation of Sri Lanka during its intervention on the ILC Report last year The existing IHL framework addressing this issue is of a rudimentary nature While the ICRC has in recent times been engaged in addressing some of the gray areas that have arisen such as the notion of direct participation in hostilities in internal armed conflicts by way of providing an Interpretative Guidance more work needs to be done to address effectively the complex issues that have arisen in the context of internal armed conflicts We believe this is an area which should engage the attention of the ILC in its consideration of future topics so that an authoritative contribution could be made to this area of the law"

        "body": "One could surmise that the masses are pushed towards unlawful action in the belief that the law does not take its due course This has spread from setting fire to a bus after a fatal accident to attacking and setting fire to police stations The attack on Angulana Police Station after a double murder and setting fire to Dompe Police station all point to the same trend We could add several lives lost due to grease devil incidents as well The most recent incident was the destruction of the property of the suspects involved in the killing of a doctor in the Karandeniya area The killing had taken place a month ago People taking the law into their hands cannot be considered as merely a crime committed by them However the issue is to be solved by arresting and imprisoning those who were involved in the incidents as well as those who werent Anyone aware could observe several socio political reasons that influenced such behaviour to develop during recent times One reason is the breakdown of public trust towards the police On the other hand the reason for the public losing confidence in the police is due not entirely on the police but due to the role of the institutions that control the police It is acceptable that the Department of Police as a state institution is bound by rules and regulations of the state However the governments attempt to make the police a tool is unacceptable Anyone can understand the governments necessity to take under its direct control an institution that takes decisions regarding the public However taking various shameless actions to do so is not justifiable One of the independent commissions established by the 17th amendment that was adopted due to the keenness of the public and mediation of the JVP was the independent police commission Despite it being not an ideal criterion on democracy it opened a certain space for the police that had been politicized for several decades to be independent However one of the miracles the government has brought about with its 23rd majority is the closing down of this space and taking over the police Through this move the government has been able to create the officer in charge of a police station a person who yields to the ruling party organizer in the area There was much talk regarding filing as well as withdrawing cases on political requirements through the Attorney General Exonerating former ruling party Parliamentarian Kathriarachchi from murder charges exculpating ruling party Parliamentarian Duminda Silva from rape charges and withdrawing unauthorized building charges against ruling party Parliamentarian Earl Gunasekera are several such instances The list is too long to put down here The President who has immunity to be free from wrongs he commits but also having the authority to free others who commit crime is an extraordinary situation The wife of Minister Milroy Fernando who had been sentenced for murder former Basnayake Nilame Anton Tennekone and former Mayor of Kandy who were jailed for offences being exonerated are several such instances These moves only convince to the masses that court sentences too are decided on condition of allegiance to the ruling party Another main reason that shattered the trust people had in the judiciary is the belief that transition from the opposition to the ruling party has the luxury to be free from all crime People are aware that many peoples representatives who had various allegations of fraud crime and various illegal activities crossed to the government during the past did so not because they loved the ruling party Among them are those who supported killing of VIPs and backed up terrorism carried out mass scale frauds through privatization rackets and those who had been charged and proved of selling food stuff and roofing sheets received as foreign aid It is no secret that those who engaged in illegal rackets took refuge in the government to avoid being prosecuted The government may consider the 23rd majority it has manipulated in Parliament by harboring these political refugees is its victory It not only makes attempts to find those responsible for billions of public money that had been wasted through mass scale frauds and corruption futile The most serious catastrophe is the viewpoint that gets established in the society that law is meaningless The most recent incident that challenges law and justice and discussed by the media is the killing of Presidential adviser on trade union affairs Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra at Mulleriyawa on October 8 The police not only have been unable to identify a definite offender but also have not been able to take a statement from Parliamentarian Duminda Silva a prime suspect in the case nor have they been able to arrest him Meanwhile he on his own left the country recently claiming he wants to get treatment The media also reported that the President and five cabinet ministers visited him at the hospital It is such occurrences that would make the people specially family members of the slain ruling party stalwart that the government would not carry out a fair investigation regarding the murder These factors show that the breakdown of the trust masses had in the law establishment and the general displeasure regarding the existing socioeconomicpolitical system influences people to take law into their hands even in a small incident If this environment establishes the standpoint that the present socioeconomicpolitical system should be transformed into a more justifiable system it would have an effective development However if it doesnt the society would descend to social anarchism which would lead to total barbarism This is the threat many fail to see"

unbridled capitalism is facing an existential threat The seeds of its destruction which are found within itself have grown into creepers They are throttling capitalism In defence of capitalism profiteers or white collar racketeers talk about economic freedom the system accords the individual the public service it offers although at a profit the competitiveness that brings down prices and the useful mechanism of the market forces which not only determine prices of bread fuel and everything on sale but also fix the exchange rate and the interest rate They also talk about the socalled trickledown theory which claims that when the big investors earn in billions the others down the line will earn in millions or in tens of thousands or at least in thousands Deliberately oblivious to the yawning gap between a billion and a thousand or the bread on the table and the crumbs that fall they even oppose state intervention by promoting laissezfaire the capitalists version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Although they oppose government intervention they invade every aspect of governance As a result of their backstage involvement in politics those in whose hands are placed the trust of governance have become servants of capitalism In this collusion or equation the masses only have a commodity value But no more The Occupy Wall Street protests may not be in the scale of the Bolshevik Revolution that brought communism to Russia or the Arab Spring that ushers in democracy to the Middle East The Occupy Wall Street OWS is a message to both the capitalists and the politicians on their payroll that an increasing number of people in this information technology era are becoming politically conscious The United States which plunges deeper into the financial quagmire each time it makes an effort to come out of it is beginning to witness a politicallyconscious class struggle A few years ago those who protested outside the venues where the meetings of the International Monetary Fund the World Trade Organisation and the G8 were held were labelled anarchists and rounded up But the OWS is different and it seems to enjoy wider public support and is spreading across the United States The Americans are waking up to the reality and protesting the transfer of wealth from the masses to the financial elite represented by greedy Wall Street investors who were responsible for the 2008 financial crisis Facts on the ground show the income disparity is monstrous Highlighting this social injustice the World Socialist Web Site Review in its November 2000 issue said At the top of American society is a possessing class richer in terms both of wealth and income than any in history The richest one percent of American households has amassed more than 10 trillion ten million million dollars in wealth about 40 percent of the total national wealth The combined net worth of these multimillionaires is greater than the total wealth of the bottom 95 percent of the population Since the mid 1970s the top one percent has doubled its share of the national wealth from under 20 percent to 389 percent the highest figure since1929 the year of the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression According to another study the richest one percent of households owns half of all outstanding shares of stocks two thirds of all financial securities and over two thirds business assets Ten years after figures show that the gap keeps on widening The protests show no signs of fading away despite the harsh winter and repressive measures Yet most politicians in Congress apparently in empathy with Wall Street are opposing moves to impose new taxes on the top one percent In another twist President Barack Obama fighting his biggest political battle for next years reelection has hijacked the OWS cause He backs the taxtherich call and says if people have a job and feel that they can get ahead then people wont be occupying the streets But the protesters 60 percent of whom are Democrats and disgruntled with Obamas performance as President are unwilling to take him on board They are aware that Obamas 2008 campaign was backed by Wall Street and he is dependent on Wall Street donations for reelection campaign It would be nave to expect that the OWS would snowball into a major socialist revolution a recent poll shows that only 11 percent of the protesters are socialists but one cannot underestimate its power and impact Within six weeks almost every major city in the United States is witnessing an OWSstyle protest However the protest should be inclusive If the protests only target Wall Streets greed at the exclusion of what the capitalists are doing outside the US then as far as morality is concerned they are only marginally better than the top one percent The wars in Afghanistan Iraq and Libya are capitalistdriven as part of their plan to transfer the wealth from the people in the developing world to the capitalist elite in the US"

such an increase has taken place When the price of an oil barrel had risen to US98 in the world market the price of oil was reduced as it was the election period Today when the price of oil is USD92 in the world market isnt the price increase another wonder in AsiaWhile the budget is due to be presented only on the 21st the price of a litre of petrol was increased by Rs12 diesel by Rs8 and kerosene by Rs10 with effect from Sunday midnight It has become another wonder in Asia that when in the past the price of an oil barrel was varying between USD89 93 and the price of oil in the world market decreased by 2 percent that such an increase has taken place When the price of an oil barrel had risen to US98 in the world market the price of oil was reduced as it was the election period Today when the price of oil is USD92 in the world market isnt the price increase another wonder in Asia In the past there were major corruption activities which took place in the Petroleum Corporation The importation of substandard oil to the country resulted in a loss of 45 million and the hedging deal resulted in a loss of 5000 million to the Corporation In addition supplying oil at a reduced price to the Kerawalapitiya power station and the internal corruption taking place within has resulted in millions of rupees in losses All these losses are burdened on the ordinary people In order to cover the losses incurred the price of oil has been increased What happens next This results in vehicles used for public transportation such as buses vans lorries taxis all raising their fares This increase has a direct impact on the goods and services produced in the country The end result is the cost of living of the people becoming more difficult to bear The increase has taken place even before the budget has been presented In addition it was stated by the Chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Sri Lanka that a price increase of electricity will occur next January The inevitable result of the electricity rise which will definitely take place after the budget will not only affect the cost of living but also increase the production cost of locally manufactured goods There is intimation to say that there might be a salary increase in the budget according to the money allocated The government expenditure will exceed by more than 25000 million than last year which infers there might be a salary increase by RS1000 to all state employees But for the 6 million private sector employees there seems to be no redress which means the cost of living will affect them in a very grave manner We see that the country is being pushed to a very grave situation economically Though the Governor of the Central Bank boasts that the foreign assets of Sri Lanka totals to US 8 million however the net foreign assets are below US1 billion Therefore to keep the stability of the rupee the government is forced to sell us dollars in the open market Last July the Central Bank sold US 615 million to the banks The end result of continuous selling of US dollars in order to keep the stability of the rupee will only push the country further in to a grave economic situation Especially with Sri Lankas exports falling drastically and in contrast the imports increasing has resulted in a huge deficit between the export import balances The government instead of taking steps to stop the rupee value falling should raise the interest rates and increase the taxes on imports to protect the economy from faltering In addition we see that the Colombo Stock Market has shown disastrous results In the past there were over 6 million stock holding accounts but only 250000 transactions have taken place In reality a stock market grows if more and more investors enter the market The Securities and Exchange Commission hauling some of the brokers before them and questioningthreatening them as to why they bought stocks from certain companies is like the commission acting as policemen Some of the purchases done by the EPF and ETF have been from companies which had no value resulting in a continuous loss by these two institutions Stocks purchased from some companies have resulted losses to the tune of several millions Eg the share value of Grain elevators was around Rs15 about one and a half years ago In the past 5 months the share rose to around Rs75 and in the last two months rose to Rs258 The Employee Trust Fund purchased 5 million shares at the price of Rs236 Now the current value is only around Rs100 By artificially pushing the share value of these small companies from the bottom to the top with the connivance of the Securities and Exchange Commission officials and likeminded businessmen the end result was the EPF and ETF selling these shares and the loss being bared by ordinary working class people By these transactions these two institutions have loss several millions of rupees Taking into account these factors I infer that the next budget will be detrimental to the country and provide relief to the poor people of the country The present government has no vision to rid the country of debt instead they hope to survive on debtthis is the wonder of Asia"

nation Despite this Sri Lankas unemployment rate ranked at 58 last year A number of nations worldwide offer free education but only a few of them offer this free service up until higher education Much to the merit of our education system Sri Lanka is one such nation The concept of free education was proposed and implemented by CWWKannangara in 1944 and has resulted in a high literacy rate In fact it is much higher than expected of a developing nation Despite this Sri Lankas unemployment rate ranked at 58 last year The quality of any education system can be judged on the basis of the quality of the graduates it produces The employability and well roundedness of the graduates are a reflection on the quality of the system In light of the current unemployment rate it is arguable that there is a direct link between this rate and the quality of the system Hence though education is free one wonders as to its true quality and whether it sufficiently prepares students for the challenges of the working world The common perception is that the current system only encourages note taking and memorizing and does not instil selfeducation nor develop other essential skills In fact spoon feeding is a popular phrase that is used to criticize the existing system and it is a fact that it does happen This is not to say that all universities and lecturers adopt these methods there are indeed several exceptions However it appears to be a minority The system is further criticized as one which does not encourage questions or innovative thinking This is evident in a statement made by Mr Dayananda the former Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce who indicated a need to improve the quality of education as well as adding a greater emphasis on creativity Therefore the popular view is that our education system from primary to higher education does not cater to the needs of potential employees The private sector alone looks for a series of soft skills including communication and problem solving skills punctuality teamwork etc which they complain are not commonly found in graduates of the local system Hence authorities should perhaps focus on revamping and restructuring at least the university curriculums and incorporate the development of soft skills in undergraduates as it is clearly a public and national concern UNICEF recommends that a nation should allocate at least 6 percent of their GDP for education yet the local figure has been less than 4 percent and has steadily declined in the past few years Such an attitude does not paint a prosperous system which provides quality education for present and future generations Paradoxically there appears to be another catalyst behind the unemployment phenomenon in Sri Lanka which is not directly related to the education system and is illustrated by the high unemployment rate of graduates The reality is that most graduates refrain from accepting certain jobs in the hopes that a better opportunity would present itself In fact there is no job shortage as such but simply that graduates voluntarily opt to be unemployed until a better job opportunity comes along It is unfortunate but true that most graduates expect high paying plush jobs immediately out of university without an ounce of experience Considering the different qualities and qualifications employers look for in potential employees it is clear that this is not a realistic expectation On the flipside one must acknowledge the view point of a graduate as well The AL examination in this country is extremely competitive and to gain entrance to a university requires a successful combination of time effort and commitment Subsequently as an undergraduate a student will commit another 34 years of their life in order to obtain a degree and consequent to nearly 2 decades of schooling it is normal that some graduates may consider settling for substandard jobs over what they deserve to be unacceptable However at the end of the day what we must realize is that surviving in the working world does not depend solely on academic qualifications It depends largely on personal capacity and individual strengths Having a degree be it a local one or a foreign one is only a stepping stone and not an automatic qualification for a job Such academic achievements must be supplemented with relevant experience and such can be obtained via internships and voluntary contributions in order to market oneself successfully and secure employment Hence the glaring deficiencies in the system must be identified and the relevant authorities must take immediate action to rectify them However I believe that those benefitting from the system should not rely on the system alone but be prudent and supplement their academic qualifications with as much experience as possible for it is only then are they adequately prepared to face the challenges of the working world successfully"

on 2830 October several countries including Canada and Australia are likely to use the opportunity to pressurise Sri Lanka into allowing an international investigation into the latter stages of the war The other major trigger was the screening of the controversial Channel 4 documentary Sri Lankas Killing Fields in several Western legislative bodies The European Parliament was the latest venue and the screening of the onehour film has drawn strong reactions from government representatives Sri Lankas Ambassador to Belgium Luxembourg and the EU Ravinatha Aryasinha expressed dismay at the decision to allow the screening Ambassador Aryasinha asserted Those responsible for facilitating this private event and in allowing the European Parliament to be used as a platform by LTTE apologists only serve to strengthen the rump elements of the LTTE seeking refuge in the West who use the propaganda value derived from the screening of this film as a tool to intensify its fundraising and recruitment activities thereby undermining the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka Echoing his views Presidential Advisor on Reconciliation and Parliamentarian Prof Rajiva Wijesinha said that calls for an international probe into allegations of warcrimes in Sri Lanka were being spearheaded by individuals who are friends of the LTTE Prof Wijesinha too has emphasised that the Government would resist all attempts to derail the national reconciliation process The screening in the EU Parliament was jointly organised by the International Crisis Group ICG Human Rights Watch HRW and Amnesty International AI The panellists for the event were Alan Keenan Project Director Sri Lanka International Crisis Group Lotte Leicht EU Director Human Rights Watch Yolanda Foster Sri Lanka Researcher Amnesty International and Callum Macrae Director and Producer of the documentary in question Members of the European Parliament Ana Gomes Marietje Schaake Laima Andrikiene Raul Romeva i Rueda and Paul Murphy also participated in the event Member of the European Parliament MEP Paul Murphy opined The Sri Lankan government will not bring justice to the Tamil people while MEP Raul Romeva Rueda insisted that reconciliation will only come if truth and justice is put in place according to Crisis Group tweets after the event concluded In separate Twitter comments Callum Macrae director of the documentary said You do not achieve reconciliation by pushing crimes under the carpet Sri Lankas Killing Fields contain footage of what is in the main purported to be 1 extrajudicial executions of LTTE fighters by Sri Lankan forces towards the end of the war 2 dead bodies of female LTTE cadres who appear to have been sexually assaulted and 3 indiscriminate shelling of civilian hospitals The Sri Lankan government has consistently maintained that the visuals have been falsified Explaining their motive for cosponsoring the screening Alan Keenan Sri Lanka Project Director and Senior Analyst of the International Crisis Group maintained that it accurately depicts many incidents that potentially constitute war crimes and that require a fair and thorough investigation However Ambassador Aryasinha has insisted that its authenticity is in question as it includes footage of dubious origin content that is distorted and without proper sourcing and makes unsubstantiated allegations against the Government of Sri Lanka To counter the claims made in the Channel 4 documentary government emissaries have used several Western platforms to distribute copies of the documentary Lies Agreed Upon and report entitled Humanitarian Operation Factual Analysis produced by the Government The former is a direct response to Sri Lankas Killing Fields while the latter outlines the various stages of the war in detail DrGodfrey Gunatillekes observations In this context it is pertinent to reflect upon the observations made by Dr Godfrey Gunatilleke Emeritus Chairman of Sri Lankas oldest thinktank the Marga Institute In a Working Paper prepared for the Seminar on Accountability Restorative Justice and Reconciliation A review of the Report of the UNSGs Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka Dr Gunatilleke states The LTTE had deliberately integrated the civilian population into their military effort and turned the NFZs to battle fields By the mass conscription of civilians for military activity in the NFZ the building of fortifications with civilian conscripts and the use of all means available for military purposes the LTTE had effectively blurred the distinction between civilians and combatants How is intentionality and proportionality of army actions to be judged in such a situation The LTTE was refusing to surrender It was becoming clear that the defeat of the LTTE and the rescue of the hostages would entail heavy human costdeaths of the LTTE combatants conscripted civilians soldiers and non combatant civilians At this point the army after weighing the options available and their likely consequences had apparently decided that it could not halt the offensive and had to go ahead and put a speedy end to the resistance of the LTTE It has to be noted that the government would have had to take into account that the LTTE in their desperation might resort to acts of the utmost brutality that might involve deaths of civilians on a massive scale The need for devolution As important as diplomatic engagement is even more important is the very real and urgent need for a political solution to the countrys national question The governments development drive is also highly commendable as is the decision to increase development expenditure in the North and East as reflected in the Appropriation Bill presented to Parliament by Prime Minister D M Jayaratne on Tuesday However what is disturbing is the manner in which certain highranking government members have poohpoohed the devolution issue both publicly and privately with one particular highprofile government member stating in no uncertain terms that devolution was no longer a priority following the defeat of the LTTE The fact remains that although the LTTE has been militarily defeated the grievances that led to the rise of the LTTE and fuelled proLTTE movements all over the world are yet to be been addressed So long as such grievances exist a reemergence of an armed Tamil nationalist movement cannot be ruled out The Euro Polices reported warning to Sri Lanka about increased LTTE activities internationally is an indication of this reality This is why the present leadership needs to demonstrate a rocksolid commitment to facilitate an effective political process that will build bridges by formulating a mutual acceptable powersharing mechanism If the PSC is to be that mechanism then it should not be allowed to sit lazily on the backburner but should be given top priority This was a key demand put forward in the protest fast on Monday by leading Tamil political parties including the TNA TULF PLOTE EPRLF Pathmanaba Wing EPRLF Suresh Wing TELO and TNPF The protesters also demanded a halt to the reregistration of lands in the North and East The Tamil United Liberation Front TULF leader V Anandasangaree speaking to the Daily Mirror from Jaffna asserted that the people of the Northern Province were experiencing untold hardships and urged the government to redress a most tragic situation The respected Tamil political leader expressed disappointment at the governments failure to find a political solution that was palatable to all groups and called on the government to give precedence to resolving the ethnic question and rebuilding the lives of a warweary people A powersharing mechanism is an imperative for sustainable peace and social cohesion and as such the President should not entrust it entirely to Parliament but must give it leadership and direction This is especially important given that numerous such processes have failed in contemporary Sri Lankan history If there are minimum positions that are nonnegotiable then the PSC should be given clear guidelines and be made aware of these positions instead of being allowed to waste precious taxpayer time engaging in futile deliberations For example if there is discomfort in using the phrase federal constitution then it is simply pointless going round in circles trying to introduce the word to the discourse In short one hopes that the government will be able to prove that this is not yet another timewasting endeavour but a very serious and genuine attempt to make peace and reconciliation a reality"

        "body": "The death of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has some historic parallels to what happened 14 centuries ago Caliph Uthman an honest and generous ruler of Islamic Arabia was killed by rebels who fell into the schemes of foreign powers As the rebellion spread one by one the powercentres of the caliphate fell first Egypt then Kufa and Basra Though the old and feeble Caliph had his loyalists a majority of the people in the capital Madeena took no side Encouraged by this indifference the rebels who accused the caliph of tolerating the misrule of his appointees most of whom were his kith and kin killed him after laying a siege to his house for weeks He was dealt blow after blow on his head until he died The rebels wanted to mutilate his body and prevented the caliphs supporters from removing it for burial The bloodsoaked body was in the house for three days Finally after much persuasion by family members the body was taken to Jannatul Baqee a hallowed graveyard where many of Prophet Muhammads companions had been buried But the rebels who gathered there forced the body to be buried at the adjoining Jewish cemetery The comparison between Caliph Uthman and Gaddafi may be preposterous to some given Gaddafis negative side and the high esteem in which the old caliph is held by the Sunni stream of Islam though the Shiite stream supports the rebels allegations Yet the similarities are striking Whats more both Caliph Uthman and Gaddafi were killed at a time when the Muslims around the world were gathering in Makkah for Haj A Nasserite to the core Gaddafi started off well but later he succumbed to the disease that leaves out no dictator He became blind to reality and began to think that only he knew what was good for the country and the people The disease call it megalomania or whatever made him think he was a scholar and king of kings of Africa In his selfassumed expertise in scholasticism he even tried to change the structure of Quranic verses and rejected a large portion of the Hadeeth a collection of sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad by scholars who lived a century or two after the Prophets demise Although Gaddafi did much for the welfare of the people in spite of decades of crippling sanctions he tolerated no dissent Perhaps his paranoia was the result of repeated assassination attempts on him Many of those who fell victim to Gaddafis hit squads were from the eastern city of Benghazi where the antiGaddafi rebellion or the socalled Libyan Arab Spring began Also hunted down were Islamists who professed Wahhabism a puritanical version of Islam that is prevalent in Saudi Arabia Of course Saudi Arabia has an added reason to see the end of Gaddafi because Gaddafi kept on taunting Saudi rulers as American puppets and men in womens robes But it was not only the Wahhabi Islamists who wanted Gaddafi ousted Shiites the world over also disliked him This was largely because of the disappearance of a highlyrespected Shiite imam during a visit to Libya Both Iran and its Hezbollah ally in Lebanon believe that Imam Musa alSadr the Iranianborn Lebanese philosopher was kidnapped by Gaddafis hit squad and killed However in comparison to Egyptis Hosni Mubarak and Yemens Abdullah Saleh both darlings of the United States Gaddafi was perhaps an angel or at any rate much better than the rulers of Bahrain where prodemocracy protesters are tortured to death or tortured and jailed after sham trials Now Gaddafi is history With him were buried answers to many questions One such question is Was he responsible for the bombing of the PanAm flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie Perhaps he was not and perhaps the leaders of the Western world know it The Lockerbie incident was an important turning point in the longterm plan for a regime change in oilrich Libya There is evidence to indicate that Lockerbie bombing was carried out by a Palestinian group led by Abu Nidal who according to some reports was a US agent Peace activist and onetime US spy Susan Lindauer in her book Extreme Prejudice claims that it was no coincidence that the illfated flight was carrying a highlyincriminating report prepared by the US Defence Intelligence about the CIAs secret drug operations in Lebanon Probably burying the Lockerbie secret or getting rid of those who knew the truth was part of the game Abu Nidal committed suicide or was killed by Iraqi police under questionable circumstances in Baghdad in 2002 Another question that arises now is what lies ahead for Libya To answer this question one needs to understand the social structure of Libya Libyans lead a life of comfort but modernity is limited to mod cons The tribal structure is very much alive Though Gaddafis Qaththafa tribe in Sirte is just a minority within Libya the allied tribe Warfallah accounts for one sixth of Libyas six million population The Warfallahs largely inhabit the Bani Walid area As the Benghazibased rebels backed by NATO war planes and special forces on the ground was joined by fighters from Misrata Zavia and other areas the proGaddafi tribes adopted a tactical neutrality But in postGaddafi Libya the proGaddafi tribes are angry According to a Reuter report the Gaddafi loyalist tribes say their men are trying to regroup into a new insurgency movement in and around Bani Walid the strategic desert town south of the capital Tripoli At least Reuters is talking now As the war to kill Gaddafi proceeded the western media chose not to highlight the atrocities committed by the National Transitional Council fighters They blacked out the voices of Gaddafi supporters inside Libya in their bid to project a picture that the whole of Libya wanted Gaddafi out In Sirte scores if not hundreds of Gaddafi loyalists were arrested and summarily executed in what could be easily termed war crimes But the West turns a blind eye on war crimes in Libya Perhaps the Wests seenoevil attitude is a quidproquo for profits to be made in postGaddafi Libya Already the NTC has pleaded with NATO not to leave Libya So the war is not yet over The NTC leaders entered into fresh oil contracts with western transnationals even before Tripoli fell The fact that NTC leader Mustafa AbdulJalil in his victory speech left out Bahrain where the US Fifth Fleet is based though he mentioned Syria and Yemen was an indication that postGaddafi Libya would not hurt the West where it hurts Will Libyas Islamists resist the new rulers camaraderie with neocolonialist West especially the United States which is collaborating with Israel and preventing the Palestinian people realizing their right to statehood"

brought against Sri Lanka by the international community QBeing the first woman to hold this position is an achievement How did you get into the law profession and what was your career progression like I passed out as a lawyer in August 1977 and then I practised as a private practitioner for two years At the time my passion was to practise on my own and argue cases on my own as an advocate As I was not very highly connected and came from a middle class familyI didnt go looking for a senior lawyer and neither was it easy for me to get a senior It was my personal belief that if you work with a senior you may gather knowledge but you wont necessarily be given to argue cases on your own I thought that any lawyer passing out is a professional and should be able to argue cases on their own as equal professionals Therefore I used to go to the nearest courts and practised criminal cases and civil cases I continued this for some time However my mother who was not very educated thought that I was working too hard and felt that clients coming home all the time was not very proper and urged me to join a government department At the time the Attorney Generals Department was calling for State Councillors and I applied When I went in for the interview I asked the panel when I would hear back from them Thereafter when I was recruited they would constantly tease me about being so bold as to ask them this question When I joined I got involved in the civil side and although I was interested in criminal matters they never got me involved there probably because I was doing quite well in civil matters I have always been a simple person but at the same time brave QThere are repeated calls for independent external investigations into the country from the international community There are also repeated threats to file war crime cases against the government or government individuals in international courts as the legal representative of the government what is the legal stance you will take in countering these allegations We are a single sovereign country and this sovereignty cannot be challenged by any other entity Therefore unless we have signed for various treaties they cannot investigate into the country The superpowers are always trying to force us into these investigations they have no legal right to do this Q We are signatories to the Geneva Convention It has not happened to our country and I dont think that they would want to do something like this even though there is such a hue and cry about it And I believe they should not because the President did what was necessary to save the country I have gone for 30 years from home to work thinking that I might not return because of the threat to our lives Therefore I dont think that anyone can say that we have violated human rights because the end of the war was to save all the citizens of the country Q A war crime case has been filed against President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a court in Australia What are the legalities involved in this and if the government of Australia approves this case what will the procedures be like on the part of the Sri Lankan government The President has immunity therefore really the legal matters related to this cannot be discussed Q With regards to diplomatic immunity there are our envoys abroad and there are cases being filed against them Can no legal action be taken against them whatsoever while they are in these countries The President is immune and this notion comes down from this idea that a King does no wrong However if say Somapala wants to file a case against the President surely he can file a case the lawyers will not say that this is impossible they will file the case It is up to the President to take up the case Anyone can go and file a case against anybody because this is a free country In the world this same principle applies any superpower can impose themselves and they can try filing cases but it is only at that time that we can defend ourselves As the legal advisers to the government and along with the presidents legal advisors we will find a way of addressing the case Q The independence of your office has come into question by members of the public because of the fact that your office comes under the Presidential Secretariat We are still very independent and no I dont feel like my independence has been threatened This is because the President holds different Ministries and likewise our department comes under him therefore it had not really made any big difference Q Do you feel that the authority of your department has been lessened due to your submissions to the President No I dont think so still the judiciary is independent They can always have their own judgments and act any way they feel is right We are government servants and we dont come under any minister and the minister cant fire someone QAfter the passing of the 18th Amendment the President has supreme power he has a great amount of say in appointing individuals involved in the judiciary No I dont think so The President has done the right thing in appointing me because I was the one who was to get the due promotion He just appointed me it is a matter of procedure Q What is the status on the death penalty because the State is now calling for executioners Will it be implemented soon I think that this is something the whole world is debating But the last time someone was hanged was when the Governor General was William Gopallawa After that time no one has been hanged even though there was a death row QThe conviction rate in the country is very low at 4 percent What is the reason for this It is because of the commonwealth system of law prevailing in the country as well as the RomanDutch law Therefore all our parliamentary acts are mixed In this system any suspect has to be proved guilty without a reasonable doubt Sometimes judges also think oh this person might be guilty but this is not enough for conviction it has to be proved without reasonable doubt Therefore this is a very high standard of proof and it is a challenge to our department to adhere to this If we win a case only then we feel that this is done But to collect the evidence to prove without reasonable doubt is done by the police And after investigations they give us a dossier to prosecute and indict There is a very strict system prevailing in the country that is why the conviction rate is so low Sometimes I wish there was not such a high standard but it is as high a standard as in England or anywhere else in the world we cant rate ourselves any less In other Asian countries the standard is not so high its like the literacy rate in our country QThere is a general state of lawlessness prevailing in the country and the public feels that this is due to the fact that the legal system is not performing as it should Does your department take any responsibility for this No the lawlessness in the country is because of all these thugs and underworld people and so many other factors are working towards that It is the responsibility of the police to investigate we have no hand in this investigation or collecting the evidence It is all done by them"

        "body": "Becoming a ruler of a country at the age of 27 is not an easy task However 42 years ago Muammar Gaddafi who was then a captain achieved this task Gaddafi came to power in a bloodless coup in a land of oil and a world of conspiracies He was able to fortify his power during the 70s He collided with the west using the oil wealth and disclosed his vision through his wellknown Green Book He also played a leading role within the international arena He was a conspicuous character during the oil crisis in 197374 that shook the world When the cold war occurred between the USA and the Soviet Union Gaddafi was able to stand on his own without being a pawn of any power For four decades he witnessed rulers of other countries being dragged down from power He developed a strong military under his authority played a part of a philanthropist thanks to oil money and used his robust personality to become a leading figure in the African Continent Almost all countries in the African Continent sought help from him When the Arab world collided with western imperialism Gaddafi was a leading figure in the struggle against the west He had to pay for his role The USA carried out air attacks on the cities of Tripoli and Benghazi The attacks were intended to assassinate Gaddafi Despite one of his adopted daughters being killed in the attack Gaddafi did not give in However the strategies he chose to clash with the west resulted in his falling into crisis For example two Libyans were accused of the incident that killed 270 passengers when a Panam aircraft exploded over Scotland in Lockerbie Libya had to face sanctions when the perpetrators were not handed over to Scotland for legal proceedings This situation changed in 1999 not only when the two Libyans were extradited but it ended three decades of Gaddafis clashes with the west Subsequently Gaddafi attempted to strengthen his ties with the west He was forced to deal with the west for the stability of his regime This also brought the degeneration of his rule He was forced to trust only a small circle of his supporters so that he appointed his sons to senior posts in his army He created brigades that he could trust He was pushed towards the wrong calculation of depending on arms rather than masses Despite believing his rule would be strengthened with the new relationship with imperialism what was really happening was that his image was disintegrating in his country This is a common factor that is confronted with any ruler who believes in such tactics While his rule was moving towards despotism displeasure among the masses towards his regime grew in leaps and bounds However western powers including the USA that condemn Gaddafi now did not make any complaints regarding his dictatorship or suppression while they were enjoying his relationship For they believed Gaddafi was on their side The military power he developed could not protect him from the impact of the Arab Spring that set out from Tunisia The western imperialist countries for which he showed his alliance to abandoned him Countries like China that were presented with more investing opportunities too were discarding him The attempt to find solutions for mass risings through military means boomeranged on him This is so when uprisings became armed and imperialists decided to support such uprisings on an agenda of their own It seems western powers were careful to keep the leadership of the struggle against Gaddafi in their hands This is how the mass struggles that commenced in February were supported by the NATO air strikes by March Abandoning him by his African friends and the Arab world indicates the consequences any ruler who isolates himself from the masses who brought him to power is confronted with With this the end of his regime was only a matter of time When the revolt that began in Benghazi spread throughout the country and captured the capital Tripoli Gaddafi had to retreat with his most loyal brigades and carry out a fight that limited only for several cities However carrying out isolated fighting from a city that is cut off from supplies was only a matter of pride and prestige When the media hinted that Gaddafi may have fled the country he emphasized through recordings that he was still in Libya and he would die in Libya As he had predicted on the 20th of October after 8 months of the beginning of the uprising he died shedding his blood on Libyan soil He was killed in a NATO attack after being captured in Sirte his birthplace When the year 2011 began he or anyone in the world would not have thought he would come to such an end The issue for the people was not the long years of Gaddafis rule but the disapproval that grew as a result of his political diversion It is interesting to note that Fidel Castro ruling for 40 years never was an issue for Cubans though Gaddafi had to confront a brutal end at his 42 years of rule Also it would be very interesting to hear what certain leaders who had issued photographs with Gaddafi having his hands around their shoulders now have to say Anyone who longs to be fondled by imperialists would have to expect such an end whenever the imperialists decide time has come to abandon them It is advisable to have in mind that masses who have been burdened by rulers to please imperialists would never come to the aid of such rulers when they are abandoned by the imperialists and also they will not hesitate to push such rulers to the garbage heap of history"

        "body": "The recent incident at Mulleriyawa resulting in several deaths and serious injuries to others which took place when an election was in progress depicts the spiral of violence that has engulfed our electoral process The incident involved high ranking politicians of the ruling party itself and their heavily armed security personnel They were empowered and armed by the government which is wholly responsible for the terrifying incident If that be the level of violence which they inflict on each other one could imagine the level of violence intimidation undue influence malpractice and corruption of which the opposition parties are victims The general tendency has been to sweep things under the carpet and to gradually perpetrate more of the same But this time around the event has been so shocking that at least one constituent party of the ruling alliance the Jathika Hela Urumaya JHU has openly called for an entire review of the legal framework of the electoral process The fault ultimately lies not in the law but in the craving of individuals and groups of individuals and their insatiable clinging to positions and power with its attendant gains However the legal framework should be modified and strengthened to restrict the space for abuse and oppression since the ultimate victim has been the democratic electoral process itself The JHU is on the right track and I think the opposition parties and civil society should build up a strong public opinion calling for necessary review and reform based on past experience so as to uphold democracy According to Article 1 of our Constitution being the Supreme Law of the land our country Shall be known as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka Every politician who holds elected office beginning from the highest ranking the President and every public officer charged with the administration of the electoral process takes a solemn oath to uphold and defend the Constitution The essence of democracy which forms one part of our countrys name is free and fair elections at which those who wield governmental power are elected to office The essence of socialism which forms the other part of the name is equality of opportunity When the two components are combined our country to be deserving of its name should have periodic election to the representative organs of government held according to the due process of law free from intimidation corruption and other forms of abuse and victimization thereby ensuring an environment in which every voter is free to exercise his or her choice And an equal opportunity should be afforded to every candidate to convince the voter of such candidates claim to be elected to office These ideals are drifting to the distant horizon which is made apparent by the fact that the common opposition candidate at the last Presidential Election enjoyed only 12 days of freedom after the conclusion of the election He has been in custody ever since then and has been denied his pension earned upon 40 years of public service and stripped of his rank and medals awarded on his leading the Army to victory over the terrorists However the lessons of history are that countries evolve to be liberal and democratic from dismal and despondent stated through the reform and strengthening of the process of free and fair elections I would identify three aspects of the legal framework relevant to elections that require reform and strengthening to enhance the democratic and socialist ideal set in the Constitution of our country They are iThe system of elections ii Rules that regulate the conduct of elections iii Regulatory and enforcement mechanism and necessary to keep the electoral process on course The British being the last of our imperial rulers in their span of 150 years gradually transformed our state from a monarchy to a Democracy They did this by appointing Commissions to inquire into and report on the level of reform that was necessary at the particular stage of history The first was the ColebrookCameron Commission the proposals of which were implemented by the Constitutions of 1833 1910 and 1920 The next was the Donoughmore Commission of 1927 which resulted in the Constitution of 1931 being a watershed in the evolution to a democratic state Universal adult franchise the right to vote was introduced Our country was the first in the whole region to enjoy this right Elections were held to the State Council which exercised legislative and executive power in distinct electorates on the first past the post system without the intervention of political parties The last was the Soulbury Commission of 1945 which resulted in the Constitution of 1947 that introduced the British form of ParliamentaryCabinet government with elections of political parties The first Republic Constitution of 1972 did not make any change in the electoral system which functioned reasonably well with periodic changes of government In contrast to the process of gradual reform based on extensive consultation referred to above the 1978 Constitution was an overall change of the whole system of government and of elections effected with minimum consultation restricted to Parliament only J R Jayewardene was the architect of the constitution which was drafted by a handpicked team drawn from outside the public sector An Executive Presidency and a Parliament elected on proportional representation was introduced without there being any public demand for it or a comprehensive consultation as to its merits The only demand at that time was by the TULF for devolution of power which was not dealt with in this Constitution It appears that J R Jayewardene made changes on the basis of the results of the 5 preceding Parliamentary Elections 19601977 The results of the 2 main parties the UNP and the SLFP were as follows It is seen that although there were changes of government at every election the UNP got the higher aggregate and percentage of votes countrywide at all elections Therefore if the 1978 model had been in operation the UNP would have won the Presidency and the Parliamentary Elections throughout the period J R Jayewardene whilst giving vent to his will to establish a strong Executive Government had also been motivated to introduce the new system by a desire to keep his party in power He was right for 17 years but he probably did not bargain for charismatic leaders to emerge from the SLFP who would turn tables on a weak leadership of the UNP reducing it to the abject state it has descended today Further it is seen that J R Jayewardene has no genuine faith in the system of proportional representation In 1983 when the time came to hold the first Parliamentary Election under the new system J R Jayewardene avoided it by opting to extend the life of Parliament for another six years pm a Referendum Thus the architect was fighting shy of his own design What was introduced by the 1978 Constitution is known as the crude list system According to which upon the proportion of votes won by a party its candidates are declared elected in the order in which their names appear in the nomination paper In May 1988 at the tailend of his tenure J R Jayewardene realized the flow in this system and by the 14th Amendment introduced the Preference System of voting which has had calamitous consequences including the shooting at Mulleriyawa The moral of the story is that constitutional reforms should not be actuated or personal motivation but solely to serve the democratic ideal best The firstpastthe post system has distinct advantage of a direct link between the MP and his defined electorate He remains continuously responsible and answerable to the voters and could seek reelection only on the basis of performance This link is diluted and diffused in proportional representation where the electorate is a vast area and there is no clear line of responsibility in respect of a defined area Hence the first past the post system operative in England being the home of Parliament India Australia and many commonwealth countries and which served us well for many decades would bring us closer to democrat ideals The drawback in this system is that a party may be under represented in Parliament considering the total votes polled by its candidates This happened in 1970 March when the UNP polled 379 percent of the votes but won only 17 seats and in 1977 July when the SLFP polled 297 percent of the votes but won only 8 seats This could be remedied by introducing a mixed system in which only a certain percentage of the seats are filled by MPs elected to constituencies and the others are allocated to the parties or independent groups in proportion to the votes polled by its candidates within the district the district quota to be nominated by the party A further refinement has been made to this system in Germany to make it more equitable which is described as a process of Topping Up That would apply when the number of seats won by a party in the constituencies On the first past the post system is higher than the percentage of votes of that party in the district then the party having a lower number of seats than its percentage of votes would have more seats allocated from the district quota to bring its representation as close as possible to the proportion of votes polled A further measure that may be considered to cope with our experience of MPs crossing over to another party is that the seat of such MP would become vacant to be filled at a byelection In this case of an MP from the district quota the party would be entitled to make a fresh nomination I have mentioned these points for further consideration and debate since it is in the national interest to learn from our experience and adopt the best option The other two matters would be dealt with in a future article"

        "body": "But with the US enduring economic hardship its global influence in decline South Korea frets about having lost the attention of its nuclear protector This has only added to a rising chorus among the mainstream media and conservative politicians calling for review of South Koreas no nuke pledge The hardliners point out that the countrys future lies in arming South Korea with nuclear weapons harkening the strategy of South Korean President Park Chunghee a keen advocate for the development of a nuclearweapons programme who was assassinated in 1979 On the face of it their aggressive claim is persuasive The debate attracts plenty of pundits in what is by no means a media psychodrama or tale of a distant future That future is coming into sharp focus for four reasons First fuming rightwing groups have been calling for the South Korean Lee Myungbak government to nullify the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula signed in 1992 by arguing that the hostile North had already broken the pact In 2002 the Bush administration declared the 1994 Agreed Framework including a series of steps for normalising relations between the US and North Korea null and void in response to the Norths refusal to halt its enrichment programme So the 1992 pact has been reduced to a plaque that gathers dust in a dark closet As strong advocates of the Souths nuclear buildup in the wake of the Norths provocative nuclear tests they make light of the first clause of the pact that South and North Korea shall not test manufacture produce receive possess store deploy or use nuclear weapons The angry extremists continue to hold out hope for a nucleararmed Korea Apparently the diehard North Korean regimes threats and violations have provided ample excuses for South Korean hawks to do exactly the opposite of what the clause promised Second North Koreas nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 changed the logic of the denuclearisation of the peninsula ushering in a new era marked by an asymmetrical military posture If North Korea is discovered to have actual nuclear warheads South Korea would feel compelled to acquire a deterrent stockpile independently despite Americas committed nuclear umbrella policy The Norths third nuclear test could possibly lead the South to reconsider the ossified denuclearisationrelated policy a job requiring powerful leverage To this end if sufficiently intimidated average South Koreans could lose their reluctance over advancing nuclear capability While Seoul does not now harbour ambitions to develop a nuclearweapons capability the chance of a profound change of mind is not impossible For want of an alternative it would be wise not to take South Koreas non nuclear policy for granted The irony is that a growing number of South Koreans also live in a nuclearweaponssolveeverything version of Platos cave the same paranoid mindset the North has insisted upon Third from a pure political engineering standpoint the ideological debates that might move South Korea toward nuclearweapons capability would likely arise during the heat of the elections season next year By contending that the five other member states in the longstalled SixParty Talks except North Korea have been using the wrong approach extreme conservative pundits are likely to demand Lee Myungbak whose term ends in February 2013 to give the next president political space and diplomatic support on the possibility of developing a nuclearweapons programme In the context of an asymmetric nuclearweapons structure according to these hardliners the appropriate response should include concerted efforts to make the form of deterrence perfectly protective of Seouls defense nets Without having a ready formula for this costbenefit analysis many people in Seoul also vaguely assume that the desire for nuclear weapons can be an insurance policy in the world of international politics a way of righting decades of historical wrongs They point to the fact that South Korean leaders for domestic political reasons used to take bold positions contrary to Washingtons lest they appear to be Americas lapdogs But doing Washingtons bidding is not the point What is crucial for a rational assessment of such choices is the will and practical capabilities of South Koreans to open the Pandoras box called the nuclear weapons programme If South Koreans approve it has been suggested by one South Korean engineering professor that the nation is technically capable of producing a nuclear weapon in six months Fourth South Koreas denuclearisation policy is fundamentally predicated on good relations with the US Unfortunately the ROKUS alliance is in tatters Instead of cementing the mutual partnership the US openly supported calling the disputed body of water between Korea and Japan the Sea of Japan rather than East Sea The sharp differences over the revisions of the controversial ROKUS atomic agreement which expires in 2014 show another widening crack A growing number of South Koreans no longer have absolute confidence in American backing These changes of perception are the result of a paradigm shift for the alliance that both countries have enjoyed over 50 years This is not unexpected While Seoul cannot afford an open break with Washington it has reason to put some distance between itself and its long patron Some radicals even insist that the only way to understand events is to cause them even though this would precipitate a severe crisis in WashingtonSeoul relations and a disastrous situation on the peninsula Unrefined utterances in favour of pursuing nuclear weapons are unnecessarily unsettling peace and stability on the peninsula An insatiable appetite for weapons of mass destruction is likely to turn the peninsulaatarmistice into a powder keg These points are not meant to minimise the existent threats emanating from North Koreas nuclear weapons but rather to plead in favour of the need for sophistication in eliminating the nuclear threats per se Assuming that Americas ability to direct regional events is strikingly in decline and the devaluation of US power is not good for coherence and development in the region the US and South Korea must reach an agreement on the future direction for the alliance The US must invest in more diplomacy with South Korea and relay the unspeakable truth the time has come for South Koreans to stop chasing the ghosts of a former superpower Convincing South Korea that it can protect itself by nuclear weapons alone is like hoodwinking people into thinking that they can live by drinking only water Unlike water nuclear weapons have little to do with survival Courtesy Khaleej Times"

Palestinian lives The picture is complete or the balance is even with Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit standing on one side of the scale and 1027 Palestinians on the other In the 2006 Gaza war which Israel launched to secure the release of Shalit more than 1500 Palestinians half of them children died The casualty on the Israeli side was just 13 most of them soldiers The equation stands Take the Lebanon war of 2004 1200 Lebanese most of them civilians died while Israel suffered 120 casualties including 43 civilians Again a lopsided ratio is more or less maintained This disproportionate use of force violates international law especially Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter which calls for proportionality in defensive measures until the matter is referred to the UN Security Council and a remedy found This imbalance in the use of force is also evident in the coverage of the conflict in the Israelifriendly media in the West If one Israeli civilian is killed in Palestinian fire it becomes a page one story in US newspapers and a breaking news item on major television channels But if Israel kills a dozen Palestinians it hardly makes news If it does it appears on an inside page or down the line in the television news bulletin This bias was visible once again last week when major television channels in their interviews with experts framed their questions that reflected Israels position For instance the BBC kept on asking Israeli and US experts how they justified the swapping of one Israeli soldier who was in the custody of Hamas for five years for 1027 Palestinian prisoners some of them hardcore terrorists or dangerous people They may be dangerous people for the BBC or Israel but for the Palestinian people they are freedom fighters If the gravity of the crime they have committed or are alleged to have committed is a yardstick to label these Palestinian prisoners dangerous people then the crimes Israel has committed should make the Zionist state ten times or much more dangerous Although Israel and Israelifriendly media without conscience accuse these prisoners of carrying out attacks on Israeli civilians the fact that these Israeli civilians are armed to the teeth and they illegally occupy the Palestinian land is not mentioned in the Western media coverage These socalled Israeli civilians will fit the description of a militia According to Oxford Advanced Genie militia means a group of people who are not professional soldiers but who have had military training and can act as an army These settlers are rightwing armed squatters occupying Palestinian land in violation of the international law Armed rebellion by Palestinian freedom fighters is in keeping with the rules of international law for their fight is against oppressors occupiers and colonisers Yet the rightwing Western leaders and their corporate media are blind to the legitimacy of the Palestinian struggle peaceful or otherwise The Palestinians crimes in comparison to the crimes Israel continues to commit in occupied territories pale into insignificance Israel has used disproportionate force to kill Palestinian civilians is occupying Palestinian territory building illegal settlements on Palestinian land denying the Palestinians their right to statehood freedom of movement freedom of assembly and freedom to earn a living by cultivating their land or by fishing Israel prevents essential items such as food and medicine from reaching the Gaza Strip The deliberate coverup of Israels crimes makes the politicians and the media in the West equally guilty of these atrocities Such crimepromoting politicians are dime a dozen in the US Congress They have warned the Palestinian Authority that they would cut off whatever US assistance is sent if the Palestinian Authority goes ahead with its moves to seek UN membership As the US Presidential race gathers pace the candidates scramble to show their loyalty to Israel While President Obama goes on his knees to idol worship Israel and whitewash its crimes Republican candidates with the exception of Texas Congressman Ron Paul dash to beat him in the race to please Israel and the Zionist lobby which bankrolls their campaigns These beholdentoIsrael politicians are blind to Israels latest settlement building moves in East Jerusalem the capital of the future Palestinian state Even Obama who had spoken against settlement building is silent as the election year approaches On October 11 Israels hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the establishment of a new committee charged with finding ways to legalise settlement outposts built on private Palestinian land Palestinian commentator Ramzy Baroud says this means that every act of theft and colonial vigilante that took place since 1967 by individual or groups of Jewish settlers might soon be recognized as legal ownership It is the height of injustice not only from a Palestinian point of view but also from standards set by international law For example UN Resolution 252 of May 21 1968 considers that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which tend to change the legal status of Jerusalem are invalid and cannot change its status he says in a recent article Is there any use in Palestinians persisting with the belief that US can be an honest broker Start treating the US as part of Israel then at least the Palestinians can adopt a realist approach to peace"

        "body": "As the rest who feign any interest in the Conflict of an Island of our forefathers I ponder the plausible solutions The answer seems so simple I suggest reimagine Sri Lanka beyond the ethnonational confine We do not need a land for Tamil Eelam or to build several Buddhist statues amongst nonbelievers We do not need to colonize Sinhala people here and Tamil people there We need something else We do not need more ethnicity We need less The only problem with the ethnonational conflict in Sri Lanka is that we have too much ethnonationalismWe have too much Buddha Lovin Sinhala Chauvinists We have too much Tiger Flag wavin Tamil Eelam lovin nationalists Too much These individuals see life through an extreme matrix In a world where social cohesion is achieved through ethnic exclusiveness a purified ethnonational experience is needed Well in my eyes all of this is wrong Contemplation on this problem has left me convinced the problem in Sri Lanka is ethnicexclusiveness The UN Panel Report agrees The national boundaries in Sri Lanka leave several minorities outside walled offTheres an essence of being that a majority of Sri Lankans have inherited by a gift of blood and birth and thats being Sinhalese Theres a minority that has not inherited it and therefore are left to be felt like outsiders The national boundaries in Sri Lanka only accept those who through the purity of a blood line get to claim themselves Sinhala Buddhists ie the true natives of the land Yet Sinhala ethnonationalism leaves the Tamil minority frustrated Sure they dont speak Sinhalese Sure theyre not Buddhist But hell they live and have breathed the same land for centuries They have plowed the fields and birthed their children They have created and buried families on that land and to not be recognized as rightful natives of the land is an insult at the most Yet some of the Tamil community has responded to this ethnic exclusiveness with an exclusiveness of their own This is Tamil Nationalism Their ethnonationalism is no less brutal than the Sinhala ethnonationalism before them It too has led them in excluding the other It has left them rounding up brothers of the North because they were on the terms of ethnic boundaries different They were Muslim and therefore not really brothers at all They were different and the difference justified them leaving Tamil Ethnonationalism hasnt helped the situation It has only made it worst Nevertheless there persist selfdeterminists who believe that a Tamil homeland is the only answer A recent visit to Sri Lanka proved that much These believers of selfdetermination are pretty much saying Sinhala Chauvinists you can have the South just give us Tamil Chauvinists the North These ethnonationalists seem to think quite naively that if Sinhala and Tamil people arent feeling excluded on the Island anymore than the problem will just end Hopefully all the mixed bloods and Muslims wont complain nextThe sad reality is ethnonationalism will never solve the problem It will only aggrandize it Thus I come back to my initial proposition We must reimagine our lives beyond the confines of the ethnonational splendor There is a greater and more inclusive Sri Lanka to be imagined even if we havent imagined it yet And my wish for Sri Lanka is that we dream it We must awaken from this stupor of limited ethnonational determinism It will never allow us as human beings of a wonderful land to experience our true potential to create a community for human beings A land made not just for the Tamil and Sinhala But a land that is welcoming to the woman the underprivileged and the excluded middle See the fact is if we dont get over our ethnonational attachments well never talk about the human problems that plague our land We will never work towards creating a home for the universal yet distinct and fluid human identity To be liberated from our limited ethnonational attachments might be the closest Sri Lanka gets to a solution We must think of the multiple possibilities of creating community and we must be more creative than the traditional ideals we have set for ourselves As I finish this piece I worry for the ridicule I know I will get from the Sinhala and Tamil Nationalist or the wise academic who cant imagine anything but an accommodating ethnonational solution for Sri Lanka I worry not because I have any doubt in my suggestion but rather I worry because I understand though I deny it why importance is instilled in ethnic identities I understand the human attachment centuries so old Yet I say with the utmost respect to these ideals let go Let go not so I can conquer some intellectual feat Let go because I genuinely believe it is the best for our posterity Our children should grow up in lands not labeled by limited national boundaries But in lands that are promising to about any human being That ensure peace justice liberty and equality yet have no preference for the colour of your skin or tongue This is the land I imagine being the best for all that will evolve with the time and migration in the future That will be welcoming to the babies that might be born of the Chinese workers sleeping with the woman that will have them as they build highways in Sri Lanka A land that recognizes that nothing is ever permanent That things change with the times That one day these pure ethnic identities will be a story of the distant past Groundviews"

        "body": "Q Dr Rajitha Senaratne stated that the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence was unaware of the extent of MP Duminda Silvas activities Do you think that this is true No that is wrong Because before this incident took place I stated that it was very violent in the Kolonnawa electorate since I was aware of all the incidents Individuals fired at the cutouts of the President It is obvious that a thug would have done something like this because he doesnt careall they want to do is cause damage This is why I said there would be violence but they didnt take it very seriously In the meantime I must thank Dr Rajitha Senaratne for being very critical on this issue However by saying that the Defence Secretary was unaware what he is trying to do is take the president out of the equation Q But didnt the President know what was happening I think HE knows about this situation because the late Bharatha Lakshman was very close to the President And his sisters from Canada have sent many letters to the President Q The office of the President denies having received any letters calling for extra security Then there must be a postal problem between Canada and Sri Lanka Anyway I think that the president should take more responsibility he must know as the Defence minister how to take care of his people Furthermore the Defence Secretary is involved in politics and on the campaign trailwe used to have high regard for him As a Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a person who is very strict and noblebut now I dont know why that is happening and why he is getting involved in politics Q You said that the Defence Secretary was a very noble man but one thing Dr Senaratne said was that he might have a false impression of MP Duminda Silva and therefore unaware of his activities Actually that is the biggest problem when you have a monitoring MP of the Ministry of Defence you need to be aware of his background what he is doing what is his business etc because the Defence Ministry is something that is involved in the everyday life of the people and the rule of law in the country Which is why it is surprising to us that he was appointed as the monitoring MP when there are so many allegations against him Q The Director of the Media Centre for National Security has stated that at this time MP Duminda Silva is not a suspect in the investigation this is justified by his present condition That is a ridiculous statement as a lawyer I will tell you that He cant say something like that because hes not a judge and the case is still ongoing and it is still an investigation and not in a court house We know that the driver of Bharatha Lakshman has stated that Duminda Silva was at the incident and he instigated the violence Therefore everyone can see that Duminda Silva is involved in this situation and I dont know why Lakshman Hullugale is trying to exonerate him from this scene Q The justification is his present condition where he is unable to move and is in a fatal condition He should be under some custody As human beings we are very sorry for the situation that he is in But the problem is when you talk about the law you cant say that due to his condition no investigation or action can be taken against him Because then the law is being sympathetic But if this goes to a court house and he is released from these allegations in a court house then there is no problem Someday I might be in such a situation but then I couldnt say that simply because I am in such a situation the law does not apply to me That is why I say that let the investigation continue without political interference I heard that a police officer who was involved in the investigation has been transferred Every day it would seem that someone is trying to manipulate the situation take one or two fellows out of this scene and politicize the whole situation and pressurize these people Q Who is doing this manipulation I also dont know and we are going to question in Parliament why it is that the investigation is not going on in an impartial manner If the President is saying that he is trying to stop lawlessness and a peaceful existence for all these people then he has to show that in practice Because if in the meantime the police are being blocked from doing their investigations how can there be a calm situation in the country Q Who is behind the manipulation though I dont know the incidents that have taken place in the past few weeks have made me really sad Bharatha Lakshman was someone who has served the government for many years and Duminda Silva is someone who has served the government only for a few years Therefore what we can see is that they want young blood It is very sad that they are forgetting all that Bharatha Lakshman did for them Q The Defence Secretary has done a lot to control the underworld in the country and you appreciated this before Do you feel that Duminda Silva aided in this endeavour to curb the activities of the underworld His operations against the underworld were very successful and a number of these underworld leaders have fled the island Now when we see this kind of incident we realize that all the thugs have been involved in this situation Everyday a new underworld member emerges when one of them is killed or arrested in the meantime new ones are created Q One thing that Dr Rajitha Senaratne said was that the reason individuals can act in this undisciplined manner is because of the power of the government However the government is so powerful because there is no strong opposition to hold them accountable I fully agree You must understand that at the last election we got 43 individuals and from the 8 have been taken on by the governmentso every day they are getting stronger In the meantime we are also having problems I must say that the government is getting stronger because of the majority that they have and the election results that they are receiving The people must also think that when they vote the government in and give them the power over and over again that members of the government begin to think they have given us the power and we can do anything that we want"

President unaware of the tension that prevailed in the area before the election He didnt know as a president of a country he is busy with all the problems He is actually not bothered about the local incidents now he is more involved with the international situationbecause there are a lot of allegations brought against the government with the activities of the western countries the UN and so many other problems Q You are justifying the fact that the President was unaware of the situation but were the other senior members of the government aware of the situation Yes everyone who was campaigning in the Colombo district was aware of it but only a few days before the election Q However this was a situation that was brewing for some time The situation might have been going on for some time There are problems like this everywhere because of this preferential voting system Therefore if you are going to take serious action about that you will have to take action everywhere It is only when there was a shooting incident a murder and everything else that the gravity of this situation came to light Q You are saying the severity of the situation came to light only after the incident however the Thursday that preceded the election a UNP MP Dayasiri Jayasekera spoke of the situation in the area He tried to use the situation for his own advantage He was trying to say that cutouts of the President and Namal Rajapaksa were damaged by members of another party He was going on about that without listening to the chair Q He was bringing up a very valid point about the situation in the area why did the members of the government not take this seriously and address the issue In that case you know there are things like that between Sajith and Ranil Q But they have not shot at each other Yes till the day of the election they were not shooting at each other either Q But the President hasnt any authority to sort out squabbles between Sajith and Ranil But Dayasiri can cant he They were surrounding his office and throwing stones Then this situation should also have been stopped before they could start shooting at each other Q You cant say that you are part of the government and you all are responsible ministers It is because of this system that the government does not take serious action against allegations from the opposition and the opposition is not taking the allegations from the government seriously The opposition is not placing these allegations genuinely but for their own political gain Q The allegations from the opposition aside how can you say the government was unaware of the situation and the tension between two members of the party No I dont think that anyone could have predicted The tension brewed the same day from the time that Duminda and the crowd had gone and assaulted the Pradeshiya Sabha candidates wife and his crowd It is then that the whole situation cropped up when Bharatha heard this only he went to that side to look into the incident How can the government take seriously each and every allegation of this nature Q You cannot compare the situations because these individuals are highly placed in the government one was an advisor to the President and the other is a monitoring MP of the Defence Ministry No that is not true He was the monitoring MP for the Urban Development Authority because the Urban Development Authority and the Defence Ministry are linked Q However he had very close ties to the Defence Secretary Yes that is true Q So then why was the Defence Secretary not aware of his activities Defence secretary is not a politician and he is new to the country He has been living in America for a long time Even the President accepts that he doesnt know much about these people therefore if anyone calls him he will go there for some function I dont think that the Defence Secretary would have ever known about the underworld movements or weaponry or any of this Q That is a very serious statement to make to say that the Defence Secretary is unaware of the happenings in the underworld So that is why he has taken enough action Tell me today where is the underworld The underworld today is nothing compared to what was there before he took over How can the Defence Secretary know about everything that is happening in every part of the country Q When it has to do with arms and a possible threat to the life of individuals elected by the people should the Defence Secretary not be aware There are arms not only in Kolonnawa but everywhere in the island that is why he has ordered for an immediate raid to find these weapons Now that operation is going on Q You believe that MP Duminda Silva had links to the underworld Yes they say that he was and that he had individuals with him who were going up and down with him pretending to be part of his security Q Then do you think that not enough was done by those in authority to control his activities and keep him disciplined There were not many incidents against him Q But you admitted that he had links to the underworld But you know the thing is he is a very very nice person If you met Duminda even you would say that He is softspoken and a very smart fellow I know people who say he is a very nice person so I keep quiet Although I have spoken against him I will maintain one thing he is very gentle he is very innocentlooking Only when he pulls a gun out that everyone starts talking about his links to the underworld Q What you are saying then is because of his pleasant persona no one knew of his unsavoury activities You know when you become a politician there are so many stories some stories are correct and some are not Q Dont you think that the activities of the members of the government should be monitored to keep them accountable Yes definitely Q Then why was it not done But that type of monitoring or that type of discipline is not among the politicians and not among the society also Politicians are a byproduct of the society so when the society is corrupt the politicians are also corrupt Q But shouldnt politicians lead the way for the people That is right that is what we are trying to do But this does not mean that everyone understands that Q You have spoken up against the incident that took place and the culture that this incites What was the response from the President The President was very happy he didnt say anything wrong about me He was addressing the whole issue after the cabinet briefing I was also expecting him to say something to me but he didnt Q The President admits that there was a shortfall in the monitoring of individuals and the discipline in the party Otherwise He is so upset because Bharatha was his very close friend in politics until his death He wanted him to contest for the mayoralty of Colombo Q You have admitted that MP Duminda Silva was responsible for the death of Mr Premachandra Why is it that he is not a suspect in the case according to the Media Centre for National Security Not only him we are all responsible for the situation I have been in Parliament so many years and I am responsible as well Everyone says he is an accused Right so now what is to be done You can make him an accused and have the police stay by his bedside Why are policeman kept at some place for the fear that the accused will get away But in this situation if he can get up even for the fear of the police that is a great thing Q But when an investigation is going on how can an accused just be dismissed as not being a suspect Well the judge can decide on the right thing to do He knows that there is no use in keeping individuals at the bedside Q The discipline in the party is a crucial topic at the moment and the present situation has been building up for some time This is why I was saying that if you take the crux of the matter it is the preferential voting system Q You cant blame party indiscipline on the PR system Indiscipline has been there in politics throughout But the incidents of indiscipline increased because of this system That is why I have advocated that this system be changed I admit that some individuals have a lot of power when they are in the government and they misuse this power"

chief of the armed forces has the responsibility of the countrys security and his brother is the Defence Secretary Is it any surprise then that the secretary of Defence will control the police and other forces in favour of his brothers rule On the face of it we see that the national security has been politicized This type of situation has never before arisen in the history of Sri Lanka or in any other democratic country While the thirtyyear civil war was on it had been very beneficial to have the defence minister and defence secretary from one family The steps taken by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa to end the war are highly appreciatedat no time can any person underestimate or deny this fact However the end of the war has resulted in the people ridiculing the government uprisings strikes allegations and accusations by the opposition The present government who was responsible for the ending the war has to face these problems keeping in mind that ours is a democratic society In the past there had been many examples where ministers had taken the law into their hands The people were able to see on television how Mervyn Silva tied a government official to a tree Also sealing of warehouses taxes being collected from shops the stopping of animal sacrifice in kovils were also shown Although certain acts committed by this minister could be classified as good actswhen individuals take the law into their own hands to carryout good work the law can just as easily be used to commit undesirable acts as well and the limits of this lawlessness are unknown When MP Duminda Silva and his supporters came armed with poles to attack a United National Party demonstration the police media spokesperson stated that the MP and his supporters being armed with poles was not an offence but will become an offence only if they attacked the demonstrators Therefore it could be clearly inferred that the police were indirectly supporting Duminda Silva to attack the UNP protestors No action was taken when Galle provincial councilor Muthuhettigama cut the iron bars at the Galle bus stand where by damaging public property Additionally there are numerous instances where ruling party politicians and their henchmen have taken power in their hands and grossly abused the law openly Today this situation has reached a climax It is clear that the ruling party used all its powers to win the Colombo Municipal Council An enormous amount of work was implemented by the defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa I do personally appreciate the work he has done to beautify the Colombo city but oppose him dabbling in politics as the defence secretary which violates section 32 of the institution act The Urban Development Authority which came under the purview of the Defence Ministry had a responsibility to deny and approve that they did not intend to demolish tenement houses in the Colombo district Action should be taken by the Defence Minister and not the secretary The Defence Secretary addressed political rallies in the Kolonnawa area with Duminda Silva I questioned in parliament about these monitoring MPs Especially Duminda Silva and Sajin Vaas Gunewardene and many newly appointed MPs who were to be appointed as monitoring MPs by the present government Dinesh Gunewardene who answered my query stated that the government has not appointed such MPs but we see MPs attached to various ministries stating their designations as monitoring MPs in their various official communications Prasanna Solangarachchi who contested for the Kottkawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Saba which comes under the Kolonnawa electorate polled the highest number of preferential votes in spite of Duminda Silva working against him He was able to achieve this largely due to the support extended to him by Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra Renuka Perera and Ashoka Lankathilake While the battle to appoint the President of the Pradeshiya Saba members was going on a group had attacked Solongarachchis political office and shot the Presidents picture which I produced in Parliament If there was police protection to guard VIPs they would have listened to their leaders and not have attacked political offices belonging to members of the same party The security officers main responsibility is to guard their VIP and not to take orders to attack opponents and resort to thuggery The attack on Solangarachchis office and the shooting of the Presidents picture was done not by the police but by another party and if action is not taken a huge calamity will take place was stated by me in Parliament MP Azwer who was occupying the speakers chair misunderstood my point and ordered me out of the house This resulted in me being unable to explain my point clearly It is common for opposing MPs to exchange blows in Parliament but it is unheard of for security personnel assigned to a VIP to shoot another using up to 40 bullets The normal procedure in such a situation will be for the security personnel to try and move the VIP to a safer area failing which they will shoot in the air in order to disperse the mob and as a last resort will use their weapons but at all times following the law The shooting of another VIP using some 40 bullets was done not by a police official but by persons who are willing to act on orders of their leader even if it meant losing their lives Therefore it is puzzling how a monitoring MP of the defence ministry is employing such people for his security It is clear from these assassinations that among the security personnel assigned to guard VIPs there are people who are also armed with illegal weapons assigned for VIP security What is needed right now after a 30yearold war is not for politicians to kill each other but for MPs from both the government and opposition to unite and work together to uplift the country The oppositions responsibility and duty is to highlight government corruption injustices and the crimes committed against the Country The governments role is to patiently listen to these allegations and if proven true to investigate and take appropriate action and if they are proven false to take appropriate political and legal action Politics means to conduct a battle until you achieve power The governing party will try to protect and consolidate its power while the opposition will try to topple the government The capturing of power in this manner should be done in a democratic manner and not in an illegal way When persons resort to thuggery politicians who take up arms and the law into their hands they will not only threaten and kill members of the ruling party but members of the opposition as well Therefore as a mark of respect to Bhararha Lakshman Premachandra a broad democratic society should be created where people obey the law and not take the law into their own hands"

before their cause was taken over by violence and terrorism It seemed clear to me that changes in language and educational policy plus a more inclusive administrative system that empowered people in the regions were essential In addition there was great need to assuage the worries of those who had suffered most in the conflict namely the Tamils of the Wanni who had lost out even on the little development there had been in Sri Lanka in the preceding period and who had suffered appallingly when forced to become hostages of the Tigers in the first five months of 2009 Many of those who appeared before the Commission spoke however of what had gone wrong in recent years when political negotiations failed While that is a subject of great interest for historical reasons it does not contribute much to reconciliation for clearly we are talking of intransigence on the part of political players who had disproportionate influence at different stages In the most recent phase which took up most attention we were dealing with a terrorist group that repeatedly withdrew from negotiations even with interlocutors prepared to grant them more than others had ever requested Fortunately submissions in this regard did not play a large part in the interim report of the LLRC which addressed many concerns in a positive fashion They referred to five areas in which they suggested prompt action The first of these was the question of detention This is perhaps the most obvious instance in which concerns about the past could affect future reconciliation Testimony has been given suggesting uncertainty about whether loved ones are living or dead and this uncertainty needs to be addressed as best possible It should be noted however that such uncertainty did not extend to those under the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation From the beginning they could be visited and their families were aware of where they were A picture taken on my last visit to Vavuniya shows five young ladies with the mother of one of them She came from Kilinochchi which is reasonably near but the other four girls including one from far away Tirukkovil in the Amparai District had also had regular visitors However there was uncertainty about those in detention in Boossa and other places that had been used under Emergency Regulations Government could have done better to make lists available in this regard And though those lists are now available including with the National Human Rights Commission communication regarding this should be more precise The problem however is that many parents as has happened in similar situations all over the world are unwilling to accept that their children may be no more This is apparent from the fact that many representations to the LLRC relate to those who went missing in the nineties and even earlier While the grief of such needs to be assuaged it is unfortunate that statistics are used to suggest that there are large numbers missing because of events in the last three years That that is not the case is apparent from the fact that there have been only 2585 applications in the last two years to the Family Tracing and Reunification Centre set up by the Government Agent in Vavuniya with support from UNICEF The issuing of necessary certificates however is a must to ensure closure This it should be noted is also necessary with the large numbers still deemed disappeared in the context of the JVP insurrection of the late eighties Unfortunately the figures still outstanding from that period are conflated with the far fewer figures relating to the last decade A second area which the LLRC addresses is that of land issues In fact this was raised with the Law Commission some years back given the law of prescription that obtains in Sri Lanka Since several people were displaced for well over a decade including the Muslims expelled from the North by the LTTE problems could arise when their land was occupied by others for longer than the prescribed period Thus when people were resettled rapidly in the East in 2007 after the defeat of the LTTE in that province objections were raised that some of them were those the LTTE had settled in the previous decades in land taken from Muslims who had been displaced earlier We had noted some years back the need for clear policies as to what guidelines should be followed Whilst to my mind the original owners should have priority those who have been in occupation for some time cannot be ignored Fortunately in much of the North there is sufficient land to ensure that all are provided for but any mechanism will need to be carefully worked out The third area of concern was law and order with worries that armed groups still operated and that extortion was taking place This was a serious concern at one point and needs to be guarded against carefully but with disarming of all groups a priority the situation has eased The culture of violence of the last few decades has however been corrosive so continuing vigilance is a must The LLRC also spoke about administration and language issues which relates to the major problem that led to political agitation I will not dwell on that here because that relates to a long standing problem that has to be addressed effectively through structural reforms as well as the institutionalization of bilingualism It should be noted that while Tamil was made an official language in 1987 nothing was done to make this meaningful until in 2006 government introduced regulations to make it compulsory for public servants to have knowledge of the second official language for promotion In schools too both languages have to be learnt a measure introduced in the nineties while in 2000 English medium was permitted as an option However in all these areas there are still shortcomings most notably with regard to sufficient teachers Government needs swiftly to develop alternative systems of teacher training and deployment if the requirement is to be implemented It should be noted that in all parts of the country there is increasing demand for English and this will help with regard to the communication gap that still exists between Sinhalese and Tamils who were straitjacketed in monolingualism because of absurd educational policies Finally the LLRC deals with socioeconomic and livelihood issues which again are of longstanding concern The unequal development from which Sri Lanka suffered led to three youth insurrections in the last forty years two of them in Sinhala majority areas Even though the other had an ethnic complexion the sense of deprivation felt by young Tamils was a crucial factor in increasing support for terrorist movements and it is vital to provide better economic opportunities in Tamil areas if reconciliation is to be a reality The above extract was presented at the Association of Sri Lankan lawyers in the UKs Discussion on Challenges to reconciliation the Sri Lankan experience"

        "body": "BY DR DAYAN JAYATILLEKA Their weakness is that they have been unable to agree on a leader who can reflect that strength and instead have opted for a compromise in the form of Somawansa Amarasinghe who is to the JVP what Ranil Wickremasinghe is to the UNP The JVP would have been and would still bemuch better off with Tilvin Silva as leader and one of the others perhaps Lal Kantha as General Secretary The underground leadership of the JVP picked Wimal Weerawansa as its public face and voice in the years of recovery and reemergence a task which he performed admirablybut only so long as he was fighting against Ranil Wickremesinghes administration or the RanilCBK period of appeasement of the LTTE In any case his relatively poor knowledge of Marxism could never enable him to lead a party with the JVPs profile project some may say pretensions and better educated peers His political ambitions made him move on but his public performance deteriorated and star waned with his electoral victory in the Colombo district being the zenith of his popularity The UDF the JVPs dissidents have in their ranks the most dedicated and ideologically committed cadres and as Stalin pointed out once the correct political line has been determined cadres decide everything The UDF has as its defacto leader Kumara Gunaratnam whose older brother Ranjithan said to be dead was one of the most intelligent able and disciplined cadres I have met anywhere By comparison Kumara himself seems to have had more guts than brains but those guts were in abundance While the JVP cadre was busily murdering Sinhala leftists and minor state employees in the name of a patriotic war against the IPKF Kumara was a true believer who actually planned and possibly participated in an ambush of an IPKF unit The morning after the JVP leadership contacted the Indian Deputy High Commissioner and profusely apologised promising never to repeat that The more leftliberal commentators have tilted to or welcomed the emergence of the radical dissidents While the UDFs line seems to be more in consonance with something recognizable as radical leftist by international standards one problem remains The problem is that the JVPs university students wing and its leaders have joined the dissidents While the positive side is that wing of the JVP has in recent times made a welcome outreach to the Northern students and is therefore a bridge between North and South and an antidote to Tamil secessionism the negative aspect is the studentwing of the JVP has been the source of the most barbaric and retrogressive political behaviour in the form of defending raggers from disciplinary measures and prosecution launching violent protests against such disciplinary measures and opposing the introduction of English in schools and campuses The InterUniversity Students Federation IUSF has taken a stance that is seen or easily spun as antiarmed forces on the issues of university shramadana volunteer cleanup and the orientation course for incoming students It is one thing to be antimilitarisation and quite another to sound hostile towards the army especially one that is popular Any serious student of the Latin American Left as well as of the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia would know that the army is either an agency of change Venezuela or must be carried along with the process of change Therefore the interface with the army and the students would be regarded by any intelligent Left party as an opening for fraternisation This was understood by Wimal Weerawansa during the war years but not by the JVP or its more radical breakaway the UDF and its IUSF affiliate today More to the point a student federation that is seen to protect violentraggers from disciplinary and legal action but protests against a liberating patriotic peasantbased military is neither especially astute nor particularly prudent The reported affiliation of the IUSF and its angry ideology of levelling down and petty bourgeois egalitarianism as Engels called it with the dissidents militates pun intended against the evolution of the UDF into a more enlightened rational revolutionary or radical movement The dissident UDF will I fear be far too reliant on the IUSF to rectify and restructure its ideologywhich in turn means that the UDFs political behaviour will not be significantly better than that of the JVP Every society benefits from a strong Left as a social counterbalance In some instances when the Left has the appropriate mix of policies and personalities it manages to win social consent and political power This has been the case in Latin America from El Salvador to Argentina from Uruguay to Peru in what is referred to as the left shift It has also been so in the South Asian region in Nepal The JVP has been chronically unable to make that shift because its founding political paradigm of Wijeweeras brand of MarxismLeninism was so significantly different from that of the Latin American left and the Nepali Maoists that it does not readily permit such a transformation This is a problem that the dissident faction of the JVP now named United Democratic Front UDF will also faceThe problem with Wijeweeras JVP was not that it was patriotic nationalistic or populist all of which it was and is but that it was Sinhala centric and latentlysometimes manifestly Sinhala chauvinist Wijeweeras gross error was that instead of Lankanising MarxismLeninism he simply Sinhalised it"

        "body": "By Ayesha Zuhair Q Why is it that organisations such as the ICG were mute on the atrocities committed by the LTTE and yet are now very vocal in allegations of warcrimes against the government Is it that only state actors have to be accountable while nonstate actors can get away with largescale violations of human rights It is simply not true that the International Crisis Group has been mute on the atrocities of the LTTE From our very first report the Crisis Group has consistently criticised the crimes of the LTTE In our first report in November 2006 on The Failure of the Peace Process we wrote that the LTTE continued to kill and silence opponents recruit child soldiers and run the areas it controlled like a totalitarian regime We strongly criticised the failure of Norway the UNP and foreign states to do all it could to stop the LTTEs grave violations of human rights during the peace process This criticism was repeated in our June 2007 report on Sri Lankas Human Rights Crisis where we also analysed the LTTEs deliberately provocative attacks on the military and Sinhalese civilians as well as its violent repression of Tamil dissenters and forced recruitment of both adults and children Our May 2007 report Sri Lankas Muslims Caught in the Crossfire discussed at length the LTTEs 1990 forced expulsion of northern Muslims and massacres of Muslims in the east Our January 2008 report directly called on the LTTE to abandon publicly the demand for an independent Tamil state and to cease all attacks on civilians suicide bombings forced recruitment and repression of media freedom and political dissent and respect fully international human rights and humanitarian law In March 2009 we called on the LTTE to surrender and to allow Tamil civilians trapped in the fighting to go free In January 2010 we wrote that the LTTEs defeat and the end of its control over Tamil political life are historic and welcome changes Our May 2010 report on War Crimes discussed the atrocities and war crimes of the LTTE in detail No honest reader of any of our thirteen reports on Sri Lanka can say that we have been mute on the atrocities and other crimes of the LTTE Q There is a view that some rights groups including the ICG are often misinformed by proLTTE diasporic groups who left Sri Lanka under turbulent circumstances and know little about what is actually happening on the ground What is your response to this The Crisis Group reporting on Sri Lanka is not informed or influenced by any proLTTE groups in the diaspora or anywhere else Indeed we have regularly criticised both the LTTE and groups in the Tamil diaspora our February 2010 report on The Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora after the LTTE was even praised publicly by the Sri Lankan government for our criticisms of the support that many in the diaspora still give to the idea of a separate state of Tamil Eelam Our reports are based on years of research in Sri Lanka and constant and direct contact with Sri Lankans from all ethnic communities and all regions of the island Q Why did the ICG along with HRW and AI decide to distance itself from the LLRC Were you not prejudging the efforts of the Commission Our reasons for declining the invitation to testify before the LLRC were laid out clearly in our public letter of 14 October 2010 We still believe our decision was the correct one When dealing with a commission of this sort procedural fairness is fundamental How can it be fair or impartial for those with close ties to the government and who have defended the governments military conduct in international forums eg former Attorney General CR de Silva to be asked to investigate and judge that same conduct How can the government claim that a process whose mandate never mentions accountability or violations of the laws of war be considered an accountability mechanism adequate to address the numerous wellfounded allegations of war crimes detailed in the public domain How can a process with no provision for the protection of witnesses be adequate to investigate charges of such grave violations especially in a context where witnesses and critics of the government have been regularly threatened and killed I dont have to remind Sri Lankans of the long history of violence against dissent from which people from all communities have suffered Nor do I have to remind them of decades of failed commissions of inquiry Few have ever been held accountable for any serious violations of human rights in Sri Lanka whichever government political party or militant group was accused It is these structural flaws in the makeup of the LLRC and this history of impunity that made us skeptical about the LLRC I genuinely hope that its report will be made public next month and that our skepticism will be proven wrong Q The Sri Lankan Government has said that allegations of warcrimes are attempts to hinder the process of national reconciliation by inciting hatred and the Ministry of External Affairs has called on friendly countries not to issue threats but the space and support for restoration of what was lost over three decades Is support for the reconciliation process not the need of the hour Support for reconciliation is indeed very important But where is this process of reconciliation that you speak of What exactly is being done to bring the communities together in a way that addresses the deep grievances that many in each community Sinhalese Tamils Muslims Burghers still hold What is being done to democratise and demilitarise a society whose basic institutions have been so badly damaged by years of war and terror from all sides Sri Lankans of all communities are happy that the war is over and that people are no longer at the mercy of terror attacks and bombing from the air and that people are no longer dying in such large numbers from war and political violence Nonetheless we see little being done of any note by this government to listen to its people especially its minority communities but also Sinhalese about the changes needed to truly reconcile the deep ethnic class and caste divisions throughout the country Q The Sri Lankan government has undertaken several initiatives to promote reconciliation such as rehabilitation of excombatants resettling the vast majority of IDPs and providing closure to victims families Importantly members of all ethnic and religious communities enjoy greater freedom than they did during the course of the war Dont you think these are positive developments There have unquestionably been some positive developments but these initiatives you mention dont go very far Yes most of the excombatants have been released but many of them continue to be monitored and harassed by the security forces once released And why did they need to be held in detention without any independent monitoring or access to lawyers And what guarantees of a fair trial are there for those still detained You speak of closure to victims families but does this exist for those thousands of families who still dont know the whereabouts of their missing relatives either detained or killed in the final months of the war Yes most families have been released from Manik Farm but some 60000 people continue to live with host families another 7000 have just learned they may never return to their land in Mullaitivu now occupied by the military and those who have returned home have returned to a devastated landscape with few houses few physical or financial resources and inadequate government assistance Finally you speak of people enjoying greater freedom now than before the war yes all Sri Lankans are free from the terror and political depredations of the LTTE but can those in the north whose daily life is governed by the military and by officials from a different ethnic community really be considered free Can those in the south whose elections are repeatedly undermined by violence corruption and misuse of state resources as documented repeatedly by your own brave civil society organisations really be called free Q The ICG in its latest report states that reconciliation in Sri Lanka is harder than ever The LLRC is due to submit its final report shortly and talks between the GOSL and TNA continue albeit at a very slow pace Furthermore a Parliamentary Select Committee will be appointed to formulate a solution to the national question So what makes you claim that Sri Lanka is increasingly at risk of returning to conflict We have detailed at great length our reasons for worry As mentioned above I hope to be surprised by the LLRCs report but Ill remain sceptical until then We also hope to be surprised by the TNAgovernment talks but to date there is no reason for optimism especially following Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksas public statement that after the defeat of the LTTE there is no need for any constitutional reforms or devolution of power You state that a PSC will be appointed to formulate a solution to the national question but it remains unclear what exactly that committee will do or why it is needed With the government having a twothirds majority in parliament and containing almost all the parties in the PSC it could devise a solution on its own through negotiations with Tamil and Muslim parties Why does the President at the very least not state what he believes the basic principles of a solution to the national question should be Does he agree or disagree with the defence secretary Until this is clear even the best committee in the world will be meaningless"
