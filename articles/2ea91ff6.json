    "Our jackal is the only island subspecies of the Eurasian Golden Jackal across its range. Historically, it was even considered a species endemic to Sri Lanka. It is the sole wild dog on the island and stands as the third-largest carnivore present; only second to the charismatic Leopard and the sluggish Sloth Bear. These features already make it an iconic species, but for some reason, it has been overlooked. Photographers have missed its stunning moves, artists have forgotten to paint it, tourists hardly ask for sightings, and scientists failed to study it. Instead, the narrative of our Nariya is abandoned to folklore\u2014a cunning, selfish creature, a forgotten soul that nobody really likes",
    "\u2018The Way of the Jackal\u2019, aims to provide a comprehensive review of our jackal and elevate its status as a high-value entity for wildlife tourism. The three speakers who authored \u201cThe Way of the Jackal\u201d will provide a detailed description of the species, including, its taxonomic history, size, dietary ecology, behaviour, vocalization, social organization, and distribution. Furthermore, this talk will discuss the causes for their disappearance from our neighbourhoods, its consequences and the nature of human-jackal interactions.",
    "By placing the Nariya of the rural folk in the limelight, this book will serve as a catalyst for awareness, research, conservation, and harnessing the economic potential of the wild dog of Sri Lanka.",
