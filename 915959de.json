    "The Indian prime minister had underscored the need for the implementation of the 13th Amendment (13A) to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.",
    "India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13A, brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community. It created nine provinces as devolved units with a temporary merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces.",

    "Now-independent MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara and National Freedom Front\u2019s MP Mohamed Muzammil have confirmed their participation while National People\u2019s Power (NPP) decided to boycott the meeting."
