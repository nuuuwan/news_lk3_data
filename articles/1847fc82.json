    "Ranwala\u2019s resignation letter said he had not done anything wrong.",
    "\u201cIn the last few days, an issue about my educational qualification has been raised in the society. I have not made any false statement about my educational qualification,\u201d the letter read.",
    "\u201cBut as I do not have some of the documents required to confirm the educational qualifications at the moment, and I have to get them from the relevant institutions, it has become difficult to submit those documents promptly at the moment.\u201d",
