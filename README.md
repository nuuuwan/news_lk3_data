பாராளுமன்றத்தில்  புதன்கிழமை (04)  இடம்பெற்ற ஜனாதிபதியின் கொள்கை  விளக்க உரை மீதான இரண்டாம் நாள் விவாதத்தில் ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தி எம்.பி.யான தயாசிறி ஜெயசேகரவுக்கும் சபை முதல்வரும் அமைச்சருமான பிமல் ரத்னாயக்காவுக்குமிடையில் யார் இனவாதிகள் என்பது தொடர்பில் கடும் சர்ச்சை ஏற்பட்ட நிலையியில் திடீரென எழுந்து கருத்தை முன்வைக்கையிலேயே இவ்வாறு அர்ச்சுனா எம்.பி தெரிவித்தார்.

கடந்த அனைத்து அரசுகளிடமும் இனவாதம் இருந்தது. தமிழர்களான எம்மை பிரித்தே பார்த்தார்கள்.இனவாத ஆட்சியைத்தான் செய்தார்கள்.ஆனால் தற்போதுள்ள தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தி அரசிடம்  இனவாதம் இல்லை. அதனால்தான் வடக்கு மக்கள் பொய் பேசும் தமிழ் அரசியல்வாதிகளை தோற்கடித்து தேசிய மக்கள் சக்திக்கு 3 ஆசனங்களை பெற்றுக்கொடுத்தார்கள். அத்துடன்  சுயேட்சைக்குழுவான் என்னையும் வெற்றி பெற  வைத்தார்கள்.

### Compounding of capital market offences: Call for balanced regulation

*2024-12-05 00:46:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Compounding-of-capital-market-offences-Call-for-balanced-regulation/4-770113) · `en`

Consider reforms aimed at expediting judicial processes in financial crime cases, such as the establishment of specialised courts or streamlined procedures

The legal landscape surrounding capital market offences in Sri Lanka has tightened significantly due to recent amendments to the Securities and Exchange Commission Act (SEC Act). These amendments introduce stringent penalties, including mandatory imprisonment for major offences, and eliminate the option to compound five major offences. While this reflects a serious stance against capital market offences, the removal of compounding raises important concerns regarding the practical enforcement of these laws and the potential benefits of reintroducing compounding under controlled circumstances.

To settle (a matter) by a money payment, in lieu of other liability;

### Road much travelled: Identical paths towards fiscal distress in Sri Lanka and the Maldives

*2024-12-05 00:44:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Road-much-travelled-Identical-paths-towards-fiscal-distress-in-Sri-Lanka-and-the-Maldives/4-770112) · `en`

Though our economy be bruised, the external economic context and our innate geographic blessings, when bound with sound fiscal policies, shall certainly prevent a repeat of the ills that visited the Lankan economy in 2022

This article attempts an analysis of the eerily similar roads travelled in both Sri Lanka and the Maldives towards a fiscal cliff. Even though, we here in the Maldives, have not slipped off the precipice, the landscape is familiar and the dangers real and tangible.

However, it is important to stress at the outset, that while the terrain is familiar, it is not inevitable that we here in the Maldives too, tumble down the fiscal cliff into ‘white waters’ of internal turmoil, collapse of the political system and of an economic meltdown.

### AKD’s rightward neoliberal pivot: Dark debt deal, Tiger tribute coverup

AKD with Senior Economic Advisor and Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

“For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.”

Act I: Ranil Wickremesinghe (and his CBSL chief) turn the debt problem into a ticking debt-bomb with the ISB surge at tail-end of Prime Ministerial tenure (2015-2019). (https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/the-real-cause-of-sri-lankas-debt-trap/)

Act II: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ignores the ‘China card’ of ongoing discussions for debt-rollover, inducts new technocrats and pivots to the IMF option. Ranil Wickremesinghe, nominated not elected to Parliament, is appointed by besieged Gotabaya as PM and selected by the SLPP-dominated parliament as President, defeating the competing candidate-- their dissenting colleague and Mahinda’s ideologue in 2005 and 2010, Dullas Alahapperuma. (Insiders say RW was Basil and Gota’s choice; Mahinda tells media he voted for Dullas.)

Without ethnic reconciliation, economic growth and prosperity would be stunted at best or retarded at worst

If there is one political leader and one political party that could reverse this trend of intercommunal disconnection, dissatisfaction and discontent and bring them all together under the umbrella of a united Sri Lanka that leader would be Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and that party would be NPP. The support his party received from Tamil and Muslim voters from the north and east would vouch for this

Washington had no advance notice of the decision, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters, adding that he expected to speak with his South Korean counterpart in the coming days.

Armed troops had forced their way into the National Assembly building in Seoul but stood back when parliamentary aides sprayed them with fire extinguishers. Lawmakers rejected the martial law decision while protesters scuffled with police outside.
