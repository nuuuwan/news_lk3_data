  "original_title": "King Charles heckled by Indigenous lawmaker at Australian parliament",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "King Charles was accused of \u201cgenocide\u201d by an Indigenous senator at Australia\u2019s Parliament House on Monday, moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his \u201crespects to the traditional owners of the lands\u201d.",
    "Charles, on his 16th official visit to Australia and his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, had finished speaking when independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles\u2019 sovereignty over Australia.",
    "\u201cYou committed genocide against our people,\u201d she said. \u201cGive us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want treaty.\u201d",
    "Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over the colonisation of Australia, was stopped from approaching the king, who spoke quietly to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the podium but was otherwise unfazed. Thorpe was then escorted out of the chamber.",
    "Thorpe has said the incarceration and violence caused by colonisation can only end with a national treaty between the government and Indigenous people to address First Nations\u2019 issues.",
    "Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott from the conservative Liberal Party, who attended the event, told reporters it was an \u201cunfortunate political exhibitionism\u201d.",
    "A palace source said the king and queen were grateful to the many thousands of people who had turned out, adding they \u201care only sorry they didn\u2019t have a chance to stop and talk to every single one. The warmth and scale of the reception was truly awesome\u201d.",
    "The protest was an outlier among a stream of tributes to Charles and Queen Camilla from dignitaries and well-wishers in the crowds, with Albanese speaking about the respect Australians had for their monarch and praising Charles for his long advocacy on climate change.",
    "His speech made only a passing reference to the republican cause, which Albanese and much of his centre-left Labor party support.",
    "\u201cThe Australia you first knew has grown and evolved in so many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cYet through these decades of change, our bonds of respect and affection have matured - and endured.\u201d",
    "Albanese shelved plans for a referendum on turning Australia into a republic after a government-backed referendum to create an Indigenous advisory body was defeated earlier this year.",
    "The visit to parliament followed a trip to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra where the royal couple met more than a thousand well-wishers including Hephner, a nine-year old alpaca in a suit with a crown perched atop his fluffy white head.",
    "Hephner, named after Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, waited for hours alongside owner Robert Fletcher and long lines of others outside the memorial for the chance to greet the royal couple on their one-day tour of the capital.",
    "\u201cHe has many outfits and this is one we\u2019ve saved specifically for today,\u201d said Fletcher. \u201cOne king meets another king.\u201d",
    "Hephner\u2019s patience paid off. On a 30-minute walk to greet the crowds, Charles stopped to pat the alpaca, pulling back with a laugh when Hephner snorted in his face.",
    "The royal couple continue their visit to Australia in Sydney on Tuesday, before heading to Samoa for a meeting of countries in the British Commonwealth."
