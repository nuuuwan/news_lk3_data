    "Labour force participation is crucial for economic growth, with global rates typically ranging from 60% to 70% of the working-age population (ages 15-64). However, Sri Lanka faces significant challenges that inhibit its ability to reach these benchmarks, including outdated labour laws, demographic changes, and socio-economic barriers. This article compares the global labour force participation structure with that of Sri Lanka, highlighting key gaps and offering HRM-centred solutions to enhance workforce engagement, productivity, and sustainable economic development.",
    "Globally, countries experience workforce participation rates between 40% and 50% of the total population engaged in labour. Countries with strong labour policies often report higher participation due to a focus on education, flexible labour laws, and favourable economic conditions. Conversely, Sri Lanka\u2019s labour force participation rate (LFPR) falls significantly below this average, particularly in rural areas and among women. Contributing factors include:",
