    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 A military coup in the landlocked West African state of Niger on Wednesday (27th) appears to have toppled the government of President Mohamed Bazoum, with soldiers claiming \"a deteriorating security situation and poor economic and social governance\", international media reported.",
    "Although one of the poorest nations in the world, Niger contains some of the world's largest Uranium deposits. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken have called for the immediate release of President Bazoum, who has been detained by soldiers in the capital, Niamey.",
    "Land borders to its seven neighboring countries were closed by the military and a night curfew was declared nationwide. Other West African states have denounced the coup.",
    "Supporters of President Bazoum have taken to the streets of the capital, but soldiers have fired into the air to disperse them. It was unclear if the entire military was backing the coup, as soldiers believed to be loyal to the President have surrounded the national broadcasting station.",
    "The coup was announced by military spokesman Colonel Major Amadou Abdramane, who appeared with nine other senior military officers on national television, calling themselves the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP).",
    "\"We, the defense and security forces\u2026 have decided to put an end to the regime you know. This follows the continuing deterioration of the security situation, and poor economic and social governance,\" said Abdramane.",
    "A former French colony to the north of Nigeria, that became independent in 1958, Niger is one of the poorest states in the world, although it is a very large land area of 1.2 million square kilometers. It consists mainly of desert and its main source of irrigation is the Niger River. It is over 99% Muslim and its official language is French. It was ruled by France from 1900 to 1958. It has been wracked by several military coups and jihadist insurgencies including two currently being waged by Al-Qaeda and Islamic State. President Bazoum was elected in 2021.",
