My subject this morning is Leelananda De Silva with comments on his book The Long Littleness of Life: a memoir of government, the United Nations, family and friends, published 2016. I read it then but re-read it this week and am more impressed and desirous of sharing my feelings and opinion with others. Hence this article, with of course Leelananda‚Äôs permission to go ahead and write but not in praise, he strictly stipulated.

### AFTERMATH OF THE 1953 HARTAL

Motion of No Confidence in Government (Hansard of 1st September 1, 1953)

(Speech made by Dr. NM Perera published in his birth centenary memorial volume)

Dr. Perera:Before I deal with the subject, I want to say a word about the Hon. Prime Minister and his references to my good friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Bandaranaike). My friend the Prime Minister is not here. I hope that he has not had a recurrence of his affliction. Today while he was on the first part of his speech, he reminded me of the father; it was the same technique, the same type of personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I remember the last motion of No Confidence that we debated. I think it was moved just before the dissolution of Parliament, and it was one of the last debates which was attended by my good friend, the late Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake. He spoke in that debate and it was a tirade against my good friend the Leader of the Opposition.

### Fieldwork and Travels in Rural Sindh, Pakistan

*2024-11-03 02:09:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fieldwork-and-travels-in-rural-sindh-pakistan/) ¬∑ `en`

After completing my Ford fellowship at Oxford University in 1991, I joined the Indus River Left Bank Outfall Drainage Project in Sindh, Pakistan, as its Senior Socio-Economist and resident team leader. The project, sponsored by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and several other international donors, aimed at improving irrigated agriculture in Sindh. The Sindh Development Studies Centre (SDSC) of the University of Sindh in Jamshoro (near Hyderabad) oversaw the socio-economic studies of the project.

I arrived at Karachi Airport in late December. Parvez Pathan, my SDSC counterpart, met me at the airport. We discussed my accommodation and security on our drive to Jamshoro, about 220 kilometres from Karachi. He told me a beautifully furnished bungalow awaited me on the university campus. He opined that I should always have a trustworthy person with me for my security. SDSC had found a reliable young man to be my housekeeper, cook, and personal security guard.

### Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, NY, welcome October surprise for Democrats

Democracy under threat, as Trump sows doubt on election integrity

President Ronald Reagan, ‚ÄúThe Great Communicator‚Äù was famous for conceptualizing the American Dream, in a loose paraphrasing of the words enshrined in the Statue of Liberty.

Concluding his farewell speech in 1988, Reagan said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spoken of the Shining City all my political life‚Ä¶.But in my mind, it was a tall, proud city built on rocks, stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and heart to get here. That‚Äôs how I saw it, and see it still.

### Abrogation of the B-C Pact and what followed

*2024-11-03 01:51:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/abrogation-of-the-b-c-pact-and-what-followed/) ¬∑ `en`

(Excerpted from Render Unto Caesar by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Yet, as was to happen over and over again in the country‚Äôs politics, the vocal minority, in this case the hardliners finally won the day (in getting SWRD to abrogate the B-C Pact). In October 1957 the UNP under the leadership of J R Jayewardene set out on a march from Colombo to Kandy to protest against the pact. On the first day they covered 11 miles amidst some obstruction and skirmishes with government sponsored elements.

### Sagalassos: Meanwhile in the Mountains

*2024-11-03 01:42:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sagalassos-meanwhile-in-the-mountains/) ¬∑ `en`

At the birthday party held in August to celebrate the 100th birthday of Raja de Silva, school friend of my uncle Tissa and former Director General of Archaeology, I was fortunate to meet his daughter Nerina, also an archaeologist. She has been working for some years on a dig in Turkey and, when I expressed interest in that site, she lent me a book produced to accompany an exhibition of artefacts found there.

I did not read all the articles in it, for they were quite technical, including Nerina‚Äôs about the adhesives used to piece together broken material, ranging from pottery to statues. But they were fascinating, even though I could only read them cursorily. And they were illuminatingly supported by pictures, the articles being full of them, while the latter part of the book is pictures with detailed accounts of what they portray.

My initial contribution on the above subject was on 8 February 2024 at the time President Joe Biden was expected to be the Democratic Party nominee for the presidency against former President Donald Trump the Republican Party nominee.

A sequel to this subject has become necessary after Biden was compelled/pressurized to drop out of the race on 21 July 2024 after his disastrous performance at the debate with Trump on 27 June 2024 which led to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the succeeding candidate under questionable circumstances. It is misleading to state it was a voluntary decision by Biden.

It is clear from what follows below that it is a SHAM for the Democratic Party now led by Kamala Harris to pretend that the Party is the standard-bearer of DEMOCRACY in the United States. Its leadership which is part of this charade include holier-than-thou persons such as¬† Obama, Clintons, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer:

Douglas Devananda emphasizes practical action over dreaming. He advocates for Tamil autonomy and federalism, promising to address people's issues if elected. His party aims for 4-5 seats, focusing on welfare and representation rather than armed struggle or fake nationalism.

The EPDP Secretary General, Douglas Devananda, pointed out that this time will decide the people who are working for the people who are continuously living with the people.

Douglas Devananda, Secretary -General of the EPDP, who visited various parts of Vadamarachchi area on Saturday (02) for election campaigns, said this during a discussion with the people.

I am acting from the welfare of the people. But on that day, our Tamil political ancestors demanded that Samasti be Samadhi and decorated the parliament by gaining electoral victories.

But they do not have the mechanism of achieving the goal of the subject they have put forward. Similarly, the policies of the people in today's political territory that they are on the way of fake nationalism are unstoppable.

I do not ask for 23 seats to decorate parliament like other Tamil political parties. I request you to give me at least 4 to 5 seats

### The president who handles another important challenge

*2024-11-02 11:00:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197697) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Sri Lankan government faces challenges in economy, travel advisories, and reconciliation. National People's Power wins local election, increasing support. New government maintains economic committee, gaining IMF confidence. Travel restrictions implemented due to terror threats. Government addresses concerns about foreign tourists' illegal activities. President announces provincial council elections to promote diversity and decentralization. Critics argue high costs, but decentralization crucial for addressing ethnic and regional disparities.

üü©

The government is very intelligent in its actions, if it is a matter of dealing with the economy, travel instructions or reconciliation process.

Experiences its resulting benefit. The victory of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha in the South is a sign that the popular population continues to increase after a month of power.

The increase in the currency expands to the national people's power, not limited to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The difference in the success of the national people's power is much greater than the last time it faced such a local election.

Earlier in 2019, the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha had two seats.

Now it has captured 15 designs. The national people's power, which received only six percent of the vote, now received 48 percent of the votes.

The increase in the victory of the National People's Power in the Local Government election is the result of the polls of voters that they will benefit after the victory of the national People's Power in the presidential election.

*2024-11-02 10:45:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197701) ¬∑ `ta`

Kamala Harris's confidence remains strong among female voters. Young women are showing increased enthusiasm for her candidacy. A recent poll shows 55% of women under 30 support Harris. Her campaign focuses on empowering women and addressing gender inequality. However, her support among white women lags behind other demographics. To win, Harris needs to mobilize more female voters and address concerns among white women who supported Trump in 2016.
