    "In a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has urged that it is of utmost importance that the next Inspector General of Police should be an officer whose service in the police force has been exemplary and unblemished and able to restore public confidence in the Sri Lanka Police.",
    "The BASL also stated that it is of utmost importance that the best possible appointment be made to the office of IGP since public confidence in the\u00a0Police is vital for the administration of justice and the rule of law.",
    "The BASL said it was aware that the office of the Inspector General of Police has fallen vacant on 26 June 2023.",
    "The BASL is of the view that prior to the approval of the appointment of the IGP that the procedures to be followed in regard to recommendations or approvals for appointments under Article 41B or 41C should be determined by the Constitutional Council as provided for in Article 41E(6) of the Constitution.",
    "The BASL further said it has witnessed serious erosion in the public confidence on the Police.",
    "This letter had been issued by BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne and its Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
