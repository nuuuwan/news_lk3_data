  "original_body_lines": [
    "Maine\u2019s top election official has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run for president next year in the state, citing a constitutional insurrection clause.",
    "Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Mr Trump was not eligible because of his actions leading up to the US Capitol riot in 2021.",
    "Maine now joins Colorado as the two states to ban Mr Trump from the ballot.",
    "The decisions increase pressure on the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "Colorado votes reliably Democratic, however, Maine is more politically competitive and would be more significant for Mr Trump - the Republican frontrunner - to lose.",
    "The 34-page ruling says that Mr Trump must be removed from the Maine ballot because of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution - which bans anyone from holding office that has \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d.",
    "In her order, Mrs Bellows says that Mr Trump \u201cover the course of several months and culminating on January 6, 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol\u201d.",
    "She added that his \u201coccasional requests that rioters be peaceful and support law enforcement do not immunize his actions\u201d.",
    "Speaking with BBC News, Mrs Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the \u201cSupreme Court will settle this matter nationwide\u201d.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on section three of the 14th Amendment. But I\u2019m also mindful that no presidential candidate has, ever before, engaged in insurrection.\u201d",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s campaign had previously called for Mrs Bellows to recuse herself from the process, and on Thursday swiftly criticised her decision.",
    "Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called Mrs Bellows \u201ca hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat\u201d and claimed she was engaging in \u201celection interference\u201d.",
    "He added that the campaign will \u201cquickly file a legal objection in state court to prevent this atrocious decision in Maine from taking effect\u201d.",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential candidacy has been challenged in multiple states, on the grounds that the 14th Amendment bans him from holding office.",
    "The 14th amendment was ratified after the American Civil War in order to block Confederate secessionists from returning to power after southern states re-joined the Union.",
    "Colorado\u2019s ban was the first instance of the Constitution being used to disqualify a presidential candidate.",
    "But legal experts say the Colorado ruling will have a tough time standing up when it reaches the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court.",
    "And state courts in Michigan and Minnesota have also recently dismissed efforts to block Mr Trump from the ballot.",
    "The case to remove him in the New England state was brought by a handful of former Maine lawmakers who argued that the former president had violated his oath of office.",
    "Former federal prosecutor Joe Moreno told BBC News he believed there was \u201cno way this holds up\u201d.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s breathtakingly arrogant for her to unilaterally decide that someone has committed insurrection,\u201d Moreno said about Mrs Bellows\u2019 ruling.",
    "\u201cThis will create a political furore\u2026 that\u2019s the unfortunate outcome here,\u201d he said, adding he found Maine and Colorado to be \u201cvery shaky legal decisions\u201d.",
    "It all leads to a Supreme Court showdown - which Mr Moreno said should take place \u201crapidly\u201d to stop more states from individually determining Trump\u2019s eligibility.",
    "Thursday\u2019s ruling is the latest in a growing list of legal woes Mr Trump faces.",
    "He also has upcoming trials in federal court and in the state of Georgia for his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
    "But he had not been charged with inciting insurrection in either case."
