Within the Best Global Hotel Design category, the judges recognised the transformation of Sun Siyam Pasikudah for its blend of refined hospitality, artisanal craftsmanship, and environmental responsibility.",
    "The 34-room boutique resort on Sri Lanka\u2019s eastern coast was reimagined as a sanctuary of understated luxury, completed within an ambitious four-month timeline and re-opened in November 2023. To reduce waste, much of the original furniture was refurbished and reupholstered, while all new materials were sourced locally and installed by Sri Lankan craftspeople. The team commissioned handwoven textiles, bespoke lighting, and custom joinery, using natural materials such as bamboo, linen, terracotta, and reclaimed wood to create a tactile, grounded experience.",

Our resort now reflects the spirit of the island in a way that is both authentic and forward-thinking, offering our guests a truly unique sense of place.\u201d",
