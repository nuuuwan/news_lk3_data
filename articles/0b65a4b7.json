  "original_body_lines": [
    "From August 31 to September 1, 2025, the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin hosted a landmark event in geopolitics: the 25th Heads-of-State Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). This summit was the largest in the organization\u2019s history, serving as a powerful symbol of Asia\u2019s deepening cooperation across economics, finance, defense, and digital transformation. It underscored principles such as sovereign equality, adherence to international law, multilateralism, people-centered approaches, and action-oriented implementation. What began over two decades ago as a regional security platform has now evolved into a bloc with substantial economic ambitions and a vision for shaping a new global order.",
    "At a time when Western economies face slowing growth, rising debt burdens, and political fragmentation, Asia\u2019s emerging powers\u2014China, India, and Russia\u2014are actively rethinking strategic alignments, economic architectures, and digital infrastructures. The SCO summit revealed that the continent is no longer merely participating in the global economy; it is beginning to design new frameworks of cooperation that rival and potentially replace Western-centric institutions.",
    "The SCO summit, exploring its economic, financial, technological, and cultural dimensions. the Tianjin summit was not just another diplomatic gathering, but rather a watershed moment that could mark the start of Asia\u2019s ascent to the forefront of global economics.",
    "As of 2025, the nominal GDPs of India, Russia, and China are approximately $4.19 trillion USD, $2.08 trillion USD, and $19.23 trillion USD, respectively, making India the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, Russia the 11th, and China the second-largest by nominal GDP. Collectively, these three nations account for over $25.5 trillion USD, representing a significant portion of the global economy. Their combined economic activities have a major impact on global trade, investment flows, and geopolitical dynamics. In comparison, the total global economy (world GDP) is estimated at around $114 trillion USD, highlighting the substantial contribution of these three countries to the world\u2019s economic output.",
    "Historically, the SCO functioned primarily as a security and political dialogue platform, addressing counter-terrorism and border stability. But in Tianjin, the organization decisively revealed its economic ambitions.",
    "Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the creation of an SCO Development Bank, backed by \u00a52 billion in grants and \u00a510 billion in concessional loans for member states. This proposal was not symbolic rhetoric\u2014it was a practical step toward establishing an institutional financial pillar within the SCO, similar to the New Development Bank (NDB) established by BRICS in 2014.",
    "The new bank would prioritize financing for renewable energy projects, infrastructure connectivity, and digital transformation initiatives. By doing so, the SCO is directly addressing one of the most pressing needs of its member states: access to long-term, stable financing beyond the conditionalities of Western lenders like the IMF or World Bank.",
    "The potential of the SCO bank lies in its collective capital mobilization. China can provide liquidity, Russia can contribute energy-backed resources, and India can channel its rapidly growing fintech and IT capabilities. Together, they could fund transformative projects across Central Asia, South Asia, and beyond\u2014creating an Asian-led financing ecosystem.",
    "Another innovation introduced at the summit was the \u201celectro-yuan\u201d, a digital version of China\u2019s currency designed for cross-border trade settlement. Already piloted in Uzbekistan, the electro-yuan allows member states to bypass the U.S. dollar in energy, mining, and infrastructure contracts.",
    "By promoting yuan-based transactions, China is positioning its currency as a regional trade anchor, eroding dollar dominance. If widely adopted, the electro-yuan could reduce transaction costs, shield SCO economies from Western sanctions, and enhance monetary independence.",
    "While the yuan is central, Indian commentators have floated the idea of an \u201cR-Block\u201d\u2014a multi-currency arrangement involving the rupee, ruble, and renminbi. This would give India a stronger role in the financial architecture, preventing the bloc from becoming overly yuan-centric.",
    "If realized, the R-Block would not only diversify risk but also empower each member to trade in its national currency. Such a system could reshape the global financial architecture, accelerating the shift toward a multipolar currency world.",
    "The SCO Interbank Consortium, established in 2005, will also be strengthened. From 2026 to 2029, it is slated to receive \u00a510 billion in new financing, providing working capital for intra-SCO trade and investment.",
    "By scaling up interbank cooperation, the SCO is building financial muscle. This could eventually culminate in an integrated payment settlement system, similar to Europe\u2019s TARGET2, which would allow smoother financial flows across Asia.",
    "The Tianjin summit was as much about geopolitics as economics. Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin jointly articulated the need for a \u201cgenuine multilateral order\u201d\u2014a direct rebuke to Western dominance.",
    "The symbolism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walking arm-in-arm with Putin was powerful. Despite lingering tensions with China, India\u2019s visible presence demonstrated that it is willing to engage in alternative global structures that reduce reliance on Western institutions.",
    "Modi\u2019s attendance marked a subtle but deliberate diplomatic shift. While India remains part of Western-led groupings such as the Quad, it is also strengthening ties within Asia to hedge against geopolitical risks\u2014particularly after facing punitive tariffs and trade barriers from the U.S.",
    "New Delhi\u2019s decision to not endorse a Western narrative on the Ukraine conflict, combined with its participation in SCO financial initiatives, highlights India\u2019s strategy: strategic autonomy with diversified alignments.",
    "Xi Jinping also announced that SCO partners would gain access to China\u2019s BeiDou satellite navigation system, providing an alternative to the U.S.-controlled GPS. This is part of a broader push toward digital sovereignty, ensuring that Asia is not dependent on Western-controlled infrastructure in the digital age.",
    "Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are big winners of the SCO\u2019s new economic orientation. With China pledging billions for solar, wind, and infrastructure projects, these nations can diversify away from fossil fuel dependency while strengthening energy security.",
    "By promoting a green economy, the SCO is not only addressing climate change but also using it as an economic growth lever. Green projects create jobs, reduce import bills for fossil fuels, and position member states as leaders in renewable innovation.",
    "Digital transformation is another SCO priority. China\u2019s leadership in AI, fintech, and digital infrastructure gives the bloc an edge. India\u2019s fintech revolution\u2014its success with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the pilot digital rupee\u2014complements China\u2019s digital yuan.",
    "Together, these initiatives could create a regional digital ecosystem with shared standards, interoperable payment systems, and reduced dependency on Western Big Tech.",
    "The combination of the electro-yuan and the proposed R-Block suggests a strategic decoupling from the dollar system. If Asia builds its own currency corridors, it will have far more resilience against external shocks, sanctions, or dollar volatility.",
    "The SCO bank is not only an economic initiative but also a geopolitical tool. Just as the IMF has historically shaped economies through conditional loans, the SCO bank could influence regional policies\u2014only this time from an Asian vantage point.",
    "For Russia, integration into the SCO finance system is essential amid ongoing Western sanctions. For India, purchasing Russian oil and fertilizers using national currencies has already saved billions. The SCO offers a shielded trade ecosystem, enabling members to continue commerce without interference.",
    "* China invoked its WWII legacy to reframe historical narratives, presenting Asia as a civilizational counterweight to Western dominance.",
    "* Cultural performances, academic dialogues, and leadership exchanges emphasized a shared identity.",
    "In the future, SCO cultural initiatives\u2014academic scholarships, student exchanges, joint film festivals\u2014could complement economic integration by fostering people-to-people trust.",
    "Russian President Vladimir Putin used the summit to criticize NATO and the West, portraying the Ukraine war as a geopolitical struggle rather than a unilateral act of aggression.",
    "India and China struck a more cautious tone, calling for multilateral solutions\u2014reflecting both countries\u2019 desire to prevent the conflict from derailing Asian growth.",
    "Should the Ukraine war conclude, the SCO could position itself as a stabilizing force. With financial resources, infrastructure capacity, and diplomatic weight, the organization could participate in post-war reconstruction, linking Eurasia through economic connectivity.",
    "* India\u2019s cautious stance: unresolved border disputes with China prevent full alignment.",
    "* Diverse political systems: SCO members range from democracies to authoritarian states, making consensus difficult.",
    "* Institutional infancy: The SCO bank and financial mechanisms remain underdeveloped; their credibility depends on governance, transparency, and accountability.",
    "The SCO\u2019s combined emphasis on green energy and digital transformation offers a blueprint for sustainable growth. With India\u2019s tech expertise, China\u2019s financing power, and Russia\u2019s resource base, the bloc could pioneer an Asian model of development.",
    "By creating its own bank, interbank consortium, and digital currency system, the SCO is laying the foundation for a parallel financial architecture\u2014less beholden to the West, more reflective of Asia\u2019s priorities.",
    "The SCO is not a rigid military alliance like NATO. Rather, it is a flexible balancing mechanism, allowing members to cooperate economically while managing political differences. This flexibility may actually be its greatest strength.",
    "The 2025 SCO Summit in Tianjin was more than diplomatic pageantry. It was a watershed moment in the evolution of global economics. By launching financial innovations, signaling strategic unity, and promoting green and digital cooperation, the SCO has shown that Asia is no longer a follower of Western economic models\u2014it is crafting its own.",
    "* Financial innovation (development bank, electro-yuan, R-Block) is building new channels of capital.",
    "* Strategic signaling (India\u2019s balanced diplomacy, SCO unity) reflects a reconfiguration of global power.",
    "* Green and digital pathways point to a sustainable, future-oriented model of development.",
    "For the global economy, this means one thing: Asia is ascendant. The SCO has positioned itself not just as a regional bloc, but as a platform for global transformation\u2014one that could define the contours of the 21st-century economy.",
    "*Visvalingam Muralithas is a researcher in the legislative sector, specializing in policy analysis and economic research. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Economics at the University of Colombo, with a research focus on governance, development, and sustainable growth."
