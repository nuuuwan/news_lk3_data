### Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children

*2024-12-12 20:14:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104193/queensland-to-impose-adult-prison-sentences-on-children) · `en`

The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.

The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to “community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders” and will act as a deterrent.

But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.

The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.

The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the “rights of victims” ahead of “the rights of criminals”.
