    "Kapruka.com, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest locally owned e-commerce platform, announced that it has become the first online service in Sri Lanka to accept Apple Pay payments.",
    "This milestone highlights Kapruka\u2019s continued commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation and providing unmatched convenience for its customers.",
    "As Sri Lanka\u2019s leading e-commerce platform, Kapruka has consistently offered a wide range of payment options, including cryptocurrency and PayPal, ensuring unmatched convenience for its customers. Two years ago, the platform was the first in Sri Lanka to introduce cryptocurrency payment acceptance. Now, with the integration of Apple Pay, Kapruka reinforces its position as a trailblazer in the e-commerce space.",
    "This new payment option is expected to benefit Kapruka\u2019s extensive customer base of over 1.1 million Sri Lankan expatriates, who frequently use the platform to send gifts and essential items to loved ones back home. While Apple Pay adoption in Sri Lanka remains limited due to local banks not yet being enrolled in the Apple Pay program, this development makes Kapruka a key enabler of convenience for international users who rely on this secure and seamless payment method.",
    "Kapruka Founder and Chairman Dulith Herath said: \u201cAt Kapruka, our focus has always been on providing the best shopping experience for our customers by embracing innovation. The introduction of Apple Pay reflects our dedication to meeting the evolving needs of our users, especially the millions of Sri Lankans living abroad who depend on our platform to connect with their families and friends.\u201d",
    "Apple Pay\u2019s integration offers a faster, safer, and more private way to pay online. Customers using Apple Pay will now enjoy enhanced convenience, eliminating the need to enter card details manually, further streamlining the checkout process on Kapruka\u2019s platform.",
    "This initiative marks another significant step in Kapruka\u2019s journey of revolutionising e-commerce in Sri Lanka. As the country\u2019s most trusted e-commerce platform, Kapruka remains committed to setting benchmarks in technology adoption and customer satisfaction."
