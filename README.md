The US federal government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the lights on — and no one inside the Capitol knows what will happen next.

Republicans insist Democrats need to simply agree to extend current funding for another seven weeks.

The US Federal Government has officially closed. The government has to be officially closed due to the Awarding of Eleenming. This is the first time a US government has been officially closed after 2019.

The leaders of the United States personally emphasize that they should not be responsible for the shortage of funds: Republican Party insists that the Democratic Party should agree to extend the current funds for another seven weeks.

The Democratic Party has rejected the main relief to vote for his votes to pass any funding step in the Senate. Senators have a deep uncertainty of how long the shutdown can last.

The Senate is to vote again on the funding plan. The closing of the government means leave of lack of thousands of federal workers, and others who are considered essential will continue to report to work.

But most people are not paid until the end of this messy. Others, however, will continue to collect salaries as they do not fund their jobs through the annual discharge of Congress.

“Most ignorance is vincible ignorance. We don’t know because we don’t want to know” – Aldous Huxley (Ends and Means)

During her 107-day presidential election campaign, Kamala Harris (having inherited the Democratic Party candidacy after the precipitous departure of Joe Biden) tried to project herself as the true change agent. That image was blown to smithereens on the talk-show ‘The View’, just a month before the election. Asked what she would have done differently from President Biden in the last four years, she answered: “There’s not a thing that comes to mind.”

It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material

The tragedy that occurred at internationally famed Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks on the spot and injuring six other Bikkus is another heartrending news that shocked the entire Sri Lanka within the last one month. From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.

Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.

### Confirmation bias: Silently destroying meritocracy, objectivity and fairness

The varied public response to recent incidents ranging from the arrest of Ranil Wickremesinghe, former president and prominent politician of Sri Lanka to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, American right-wing political activist, evidence that our assessment of, and response to, events are primarily based on our like or dislike of the individual, or individuals, involved rather than on an objective and unemotional interpretation of the underlying facts. When we base our opinions and conclusions on our likes or dislikes of the individual rather than on the facts, we undermine the principles of fairness, justice, ethics, and integrity that underpin our society.

### Murdered crime figure linked to 2012 Thajudeen case

Police yesterday disclosed that an underworld figure killed in Middeniya earlier this year had been inside a vehicle that pursued rugby player Wasim Thajudeen shortly before his death in 2012.

Acting Police Media Spokesperson Nihal Thalduwa said the man, identified as Anura Vidanagamage, known as “Middeniya Kajja”, was recognised by his widow in relation to the case.

Investigators believe Vidanagamage was among those who followed Thajudeen’s car on the night of his death. Thajudeen, a former national rugby player, was found dead in his vehicle in May 2012. Although initially reported as a car accident, the case was later reclassified as a homicide.

Vidanagamage, alleged to have ties to organised crime, was shot dead in Middeniya earlier this year. Police said his role in the Thajudeen case has now resurfaced during ongoing probes into underworld activity and unresolved high-profile killings.
