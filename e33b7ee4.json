    "Sri Lanka has witnessed many political insurrections, a 30-year ethnic conflict, and class struggles up until the most recent people\u2019s resistance (Aragalaya). In each of these uprisings, the oppressed communities sought justice. Or equality, in other words. Against this backdrop, it is quite apt to remember Nelson Mandela, an individual who was determined to end the apartheid era and bring about a multiracial democracy.",
    "In appreciation of his one-man fight and legacy, the United Nations General Assembly declared his birthday which falls on July 18 as Nelson Mandela Day in 2009. Each year, Nelson Mandela Day is celebrated in many countries to appreciate the former South African President\u2019s contribution to establish peace and freedom.",
    "In his message to mark Nelson Mandela Day 2023 under the theme \u2018Climate, Food and Solidarity\u2019, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that Nelson Mandela was a colossus of courage and conviction. \u201cA leader of immense achievement and extraordinary humanity. A giant of our times, whose legacy we best honour through action:",
    "\u00b7 Action to expel the poison of racism, discrimination and hate;",
    "\u00b7 And action to promote equality, human rights and above all, justice.",
    "Today, poverty, hunger and inequality are on the rise. Countries are drowning in debt. The climate crisis is destroying the lives of those who have done the least to cause it. And our unfair and outdated international financial system is not fulfilling its function as a global safety net.",
    "We have it in our power to solve each of these problems. So, as we commemorate Nelson Mandela\u2019s life and legacy, let us be animated by his spirit of humanity, dignity and justice. Let us stand with women and girls, young people and change-makers everywhere. And let us take action to build a better world,\u201d the message read.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently facing many obstacles despite maintaining its political stability compared to this time last year; one of them being the health crisis. A crippled health sector can cause more damage than good to the people of any country. More deaths are being reported, allegedly due to substandard drugs. Good health is a fundamental right of any citizen but at present, it has been challenged by the state apparatus. Although Sri Lanka now has a political leadership, there seems to be a lack of communication and coordination. However, at a recent meeting with health ministry officials, President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently demanded transparency in all hospitals. But people can only keep praying for improvement in the present context.",
    "In a country like Sri Lanka, it is a challenge to be genuine to a cause. This was evident during the Aragalaya. It lacked leadership and as a result, it ended in an ugly way. There were some who gained extra mileage on political platforms thanks to the Aragalaya. The public urged for a change, and it slowly trickled down even to the so-called lower rungs of Sri Lankan society. Holding a placard on a street was perceived as an act of bravery.",
    "Mandela always stood on behalf of his people. He spoke for those who could vote as well as for those who were voteless. With mounting threats to his life, notices of arrests and other challenges, Mandela had to stay away from his family, relatives and friends and live the life of an outlaw even in his own land. But he continued his political work secretly. Such was his dedication to serve his people. From time to time, Sri Lanka has seen various figures coming to the fore to raise a voice on behalf of the people. But they are similar to shooting stars that vanish in a jiffy. Mandela once said, \u201cIt is in your hands to make a better world for all who live in it.\u201d Likewise, it is certainly in our hands, to make this world a better place."
