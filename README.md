Thank you for providing such a detailed overview of the political landscape in Sri Lanka. It appears you've been following the developments closely. Is there a specific aspect of this political situation you'd like me to elaborate on? Or perhaps you have a question about the current state of affairs in Sri Lanka?

🟩

The November 2019 presidential election and the August 2020 parliamentary election for Janata Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) and its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have become a big disappointment. JVP as a tactical move. In both elections, the compass contested as part of a new political front under the new symbol.The party set up a vast front of the national people's power. Although the first appeared among nominally equitable organizations, it was practically the dominant party that controls the power of the national people.

The JVP is the only simple reason. Dressed in the dress of national people power. It wanted to seize power by election. The JVP has overthrown the Sri Lankan state through the armed struggle. Tried twice. Both attempts failed.

The government has previously opposed bringing the group to the UK and complex legal battles have been fought for years over their fate.

In a letter on Monday, government lawyers said that “following further consideration”, the government had proposed a “change of policy”.

Under this, “all families, children and those of the unaccompanied males who do not have criminal convictions, outstanding charges or investigations would be offered the opportunity to be transferred directly to the UK”.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s John Keells Holdings reported profits of 1.36 billion rupees in the September 2024 quarter from a loss of 574 million rupees last year, helped by lower financial costs and stronger revenues and margins including from shipping and consumer goods.

The group reported earnings of 91 cents per share for the quarter (JKH also made a rights issue). For the six months to September JKH reported earnings of 33 cents per share on total profits of 499 million rupees, down from 892 million last year.

Group profits were helped by a 1.94 billion rupees non-cash gain on a 213 million US dollar loan owed by Waterfront Properties (Pvt) Ltd as the rupee appreciated. Rupee appreciation also reduced translated income from Maldivian resorts.

With the partial conversion of the convertible debentures issued to HWIC Asia Fund (HWIC) in February 2024, the interest cost on the instrument fell to 550 million rupees from 991 million rupees, JKH said.

Let’s build a parliament that values progress over politics, one that can make bold decisions for the betterment of Sri Lanka

Just a few weeks ago, Sri Lanka elected a new President, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, with high hopes for real, lasting change. But real change isn’t something a President can achieve alone. If we truly want to see our nation thrive, we need to come together in the upcoming General Election to build a strong, united parliament that supports the President’s vision: A Thriving Nation – A Beautiful Life.

### Overhead bridge being used for multiple purposes

*2024-11-06 05:45:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Overhead-bridge-being-used-for-multiple-purposes/14-768875) · `en`

The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (Drieberg’s Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets – smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

### Rethinking Central Bank independence in Sri Lanka’s development journey

*2024-11-06 05:38:36* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rethinking-Central-Bank-independence-in-Sri-Lanka-s-development-journey/4-768873) · `en`

Although an independent CBSL is intended to operate free from political interference, it remains heavily influenced by IMF directives, fostering dependency on IMF guidance

As Sri Lanka prepares for a new government post-14 November, it must carefully evaluate the extent of external influence on its economic policy. A critical question is whether Sri Lanka has already ceded too much control over its monetary and fiscal policy decisions to outside actors. Aligning national development goals of the new government will likely require greater coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, ensuring they operate in tandem to achieve shared objectives. The CBSL should retain the flexibility for strategic interventions that foster growth, development, and social welfare when needed

Interventions must uphold the principle of currency stability, given the grave consequences of unchecked money creation

A fresh controversy has erupted following reports that Sri Lanka’s Central Bank (CBSL) injected nearly Rs. 100 billion into the banking system by 25 October. Given that money printing was the major cause of the country’s financial crisis, this news has sparked considerable attention.

### Strategic focus and agility in unpredictable markets

One of the greatest challenges for commercial leaders is balancing immediate needs with long-term growth strategies

Commercial leaders today are tasked with steering their organisations through increasingly unpredictable markets. Maintaining strategic focus while being agile is crucial for weathering sudden disruptions. Leaders must balance the long-term vision with the need to adapt swiftly to unforeseen challenges, requiring a deep understanding of market factors like consumer behaviour, competitor activity, and regulatory shifts. Regular reassessment of strategic objectives is key, and when market conditions change, quick pivots are critical.

Agility doesn’t mean losing sight of the long-term strategy; it enhances execution by empowering teams to make informed, real-time decisions. Scenario planning is essential for staying aligned with core goals while adjusting to evolving conditions. This blend of focus and agility helps organisations remain proactive and adaptable.

### “President AKD’s Govt. revolves around policies of RW and MR” – Milinda Rajapaksa

It seems that the NPP Government does not have any new or innovative ways to run the country. President Anura Kumara is just following the path that Ranil Wickremesinghe took in terms of reforms and Mahinda Rajapaksa when it comes to infrastructure development. He follows both the leaders. With regard to national security, he can follow Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Earlier, the NPP was condemning the state intelligence agencies to get political mileage but now President Anura Kumara’s stance is different. This shows he is now on the correct path by following all previous leaders

Says SLPP is the best party which can give leadership to social democracy

Claims Sajith Premadasa has absolutely failed and SLPP has great opportunity to take leadership of the Opposition

Says NPP will bring more senior JVPers but not new NPPers to Parliament

Tips SLPP, Ranil Wickremesinghe’s party and SJB will bring new faces to Parliament

Cautions NPPers in Parliament will have serious issues due to their inexperience

*Keynote speech delivered at the International Multidisciplinary Research Conference at University of Kelaniya, October 25th, 2024.

We all know that in Sri Lanka, students are separated to specialized subject areas a bit too early. This early specialization continues even at universities. Now, some students are admitted to universities directly from the University Grant Commission and they are not allowed to segue into any other stream of leaning. In some cases, they cannot even take classes in another subject. In addition, there are departments in our faculties looking to seize the first opportunity to break away and establish their own faculties isolating further in their own expertise.
