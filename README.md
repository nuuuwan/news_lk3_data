On Monday, a government spokesperson described the move as a “one-off, due to the exceptional nature of these cases and in the interests of their welfare”.

### Iraqi fighters head to Syria to battle rebels but Lebanon’s Hezbollah stays out, sources say

*2024-12-03 10:59:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103952/iraqi-fighters-head-to-syria-to-battle-rebels-but-lebanons-hezbollah-stays-out-sources-say) · `en`

Hundreds of Iran-backed Iraqi fighters crossed into Syria on Monday to help the government fight rebels who seized Aleppo last week, but Lebanon’s Hezbollah has no plans for now to join them, according to sources.

Iran’s constellation of allied regional militia groups, aided by Russian air power, has been integral to the success of pro-government forces in subduing rebels in Syria who rose up against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.

But that alliance faces a new test after last week’s lightning advance by rebels in northwest Syria, with Russia focused on war in Ukraine and Hezbollah’s leadership decimated by a war with Israel that ended in a ceasefire last week.

The rebel storm of Aleppo is the biggest success of anti-Assad fighters for years. Government forces had held complete control of Aleppo since capturing what was then Syria’s largest city in a siege in 2016, one of the major turning points of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.

### What will it take for a (quick) win on anti-corruption?

*2024-12-02 22:37:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-will-it-take-for-a-quick-win-on-anti-corruption/4-769992) · `en`

If the executive fails to act, the appropriate oversight committee of Parliament must act

The elements of a solution can be discerned: Use the trial-at-bar and direct appeal to Supreme Court procedure used in Mahanama. Work out a solution, in the form of an amendment to the relevant statute if necessary, to expedite the appeal.

But this will still not put a big fish behind bars within 12 months. But it will get the job done within the term of a government, unlike in the case of Premaratne who served in the 6th Parliament which ended in 2010. The case dragged on through the 7th, 8th, and 9th Parliaments

I was at a meeting where a highly respected and experienced colleague said the Government must conclude a successful prosecution of a “big fish” within the first year or lose all credibility. They rode to power on the corruption narrative and have to deliver, he said.

If he is right, I thought, the Government is in trouble. Unlike my colleague, I had done timelines for the big-fish cases.

### History in the making!

*2024-12-02 22:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/history-in-the-making/) · `en`

Singer/composer Rajiv Sebastian says he has created history with the release of his latest music video, which is in the form of a duet with the veteran classical vocalist Bandula Wijeweera.

Says Rajiv: “With the demise of the gutty Sunil Perera (of Gypsies fame), people assumed that there will be no celebrity to criticize Sri Lankan politicians, and my new music video, with Bandula Wijeweera, changes that misconception.”

, according to Rajiv, is a surprising masterpiece in filling that vacuum.

Rajiv, of course, has shared his creativity with many well-known singers, including the late Desmond De Silva, also the late Sunil Perera, Annesley, Sohan, Corrine (remember ‘Mage Konde Nathath’), Falan, as well as Yohani (‘Halmessa’), and his contributions have been well received over the past three decades.

*2024-12-02 22:32:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Vote-on-Account-and-why/4-769991) · `en`

This is the first time in the history of our legislature since the days of the first State Council of 1931 that a VOA will be proposed on the basis of a law passed by the Parliament. The recently enacted Public Financial Management Act No. 44 effective on 8 August 2024 has built in provisions for the submission of a VOA to the Parliament. Hence the examination of the background and procedure with respect to VOA is important and timely. A major legal deficiency that had been in existence for decades with respect to submission of VOA was circumvented by a law passed by the Parliament in 2024

The right-thinking of Sri Lanka and the world over continue to recoil with horror on recollecting the vandalizing and burning of the Jaffna Public Library in the lead-up to the District Development Council (DDC) election in Northern Sri Lanka in mid-1981. The outrage was an acid test of the integrity of the J.R. Jayewardene regime of the time as well that of the country’s law-enforcers and public officials.

The regime concerned and sections of those entrusted with keeping the law emerged from the veritable hell fires which were the torching of the Library, utterly disgraced. But this was not the case with, Yogendra Duraiswamy (YD), the senior public servant and Returning Officer in charge of conducting the relevant poll.
