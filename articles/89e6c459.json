    "Colombo, May 13 (Daily Mirror) - In India Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday accepted an invitation to a public debate with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was requested by two former judges and a senior journalist through a letter sent to both the leaders.",
    "Yet in Sri Lanka, there is no acceptance of an invitation sent by the Daily Mirror for a debate among the three main prospective presidential candidates. Only National People\u2019s Power ( NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has responded positively so far while SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe both are yet to accept the invitation."
