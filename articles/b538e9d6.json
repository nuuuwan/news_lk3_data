    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s micro and small medium enterprises have shown resilience between 2018 to 2023, amidst economic shocks, however sector recovery levels lag behind those of 2018, a Department of Census and Statistics survey found.",
    "\u201cA trend is observed in the medium sector, with figures reaching 62,000 in 2021 and 75,000 in 2022,\u201d the report said, citing the improvements in the number of medium enterprises within 2022. \u201cHowever, despite this growth, it remains insufficient to match the levels seen in 2018,\u201d it said.",
    "The report said that during the first year of the global pandemic, in 2020, there was a 41 percent recorded decline in the number of small businesses and 50 percent decline in medium sized businesses, citing shocks to the Sri Lankan economy as a consequence of both the pandemic and Easter Sunday Attacks of 2019.",
    "\u201cThe number of small businesses decreased from 82,100 in 2019 to 48,400 in 2020, while the number of medium-sized businesses declined by 50 percent, from 12,200 in 2019 to 6,100 in 2020.\u201d",
    "It added that there was a subsequent increase in the number of small-scale businesses in 2021, as the recorded 48,000 small scale businesses of 2020 climbed to 58,000 in 2021, and further grew to 80,000 by 2022.",
    "However, the recorded gradual increase in the last 5 years still does not surpass the number of businesses in the sector in 2018.",
    "The survey conducted on MSMEs from March to June of 2023 assessed the impact of the economic crisis following the Covid-19 pandemic on MSMEs in Sri Lanka.",
    "Those considered within the micro category were individuals engaged in three wheel driving, owners of small grocery shops, proprietors of barber shops and individuals doing construction work on contract basis.",
    "Nearly 80 percent of active businesses in 2018 remained operational at the time of the survey in May 2023. However, a significant portion, 20.2 percent, had either temporarily or permanently closed, underscoring the impact of the crisis on business sustainability.",
    "The report also found that while micro-scale businesses experienced modest growth in employment levels, small and medium-sized enterprises faced significant declines in workforce numbers, reflecting the challenges of sustaining operations amidst economic uncertainty.",
    "Despite marginal improvements in employment figures in the years following 2020, the sector has yet to fully recover to pre-crisis levels. (Colombo/Feb21/2024)"
