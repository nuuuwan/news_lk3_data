    "As I have said with great relief before this, news in our land is good and actually excellent when compared with what spurts forth from other countries. The new government seems to be going seriously about its business of looking to the welfare of you, me, and more so our poorer brethren. Recent news of international gatherings had foreign VIPs voice their satisfaction in the way the country\u2019s new leaders are settling down to their governing.",
    "What\u2019s with the world then? You do not need Cassandra to tell you what calamities are being enacted in the Middle East, Ukraine, South Korea and Trump\u2019s disastrous, underhand, ruinous cabals and conspiracies that are fermenting in his mind for when he takes power. He was recently absolved of any crime or fault regarding the January 6, 2020 assault on the Capitol. Even we small fry heard over thousands of miles of sea and land his instigating the beefy white guys gathered that day for revolt in challenging the lawful election of Joe Biden as Prez.",
    "Cassandra has had more than her fair share of listening to, seeing and undergoing calamities, mostly man made like our country\u2019s bankruptcy. So, she moves to write about a hugely successful undertaking to rebuild a monument. Here is one instance of reconstruction as against destruction; giving life as opposed to taking it away, restoring beauty against causing ugliness.",
    "The name of this most famous Roman Catholic cathedral translates to \u2018Our Lady of Paris\u2019. A cleaning and restoration project, the second after one in 1963, began in1991. Most unfortunately a fire broke out in April 2019, attributed to interference with electrical wires. The fire was no mere blaze nor limited to a part of the building. Its soaring flames devoured most of the cathedral\u2019s roof and upper regions and heart-rending pictures showed the spires as they crumbled. All the upper artwork, the stained glass windows and priceless art, design and statues were destroyed or damaged. But after five years of reconstruction, the cathedral reopened its massive ancient doors, first to dignitaries and worldwide leaders on December 7, 2024, and now to the public. The dedication of workers achieved the near miraculous: keeping to schedule. The five year reopening deadline was kept despite predictions it would take decades. Another miracle: the total cost of 700m euros ($750m) was financed by donations.",
    "I read that within the cathedral were some of the most precious relics of Christendom: the crown of thorns and a sliver of nail from the True Cross. They sure must have been in such safe keeping that they are intact. Centuries old Gothic, Baroque and even 18th, 19th C sculptures and altar-pieces may have been damaged. but would have been restored.",
    "Thanks to Cass\u2019s son who arranged a trip to Paris for her and forced her to prise her bottom off her easy chair and travel, she has stood in front of Notre Dame lost in praise and sheer wonder. Being secular, she moved into the cathedral and with solemnity spent some quiet time absorbing the wonders on the ceiling wall and even the floor. The expanse of stained glass windows was stunning. Watching the opening ceremony of the restored cathedral, all these appear as marvelous as ever.",
    "The cathedral, a medieval place of Catholic worship, is sited on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 \u2013 an island in the River Seine. Construction began in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and largely completed in 1260. Dedicated to Virgin Mary, it is considered the finest example of French Gothic architecture. It is also exceptional for its three pipe organs and its immense church bells. The cathedral, as is to be expected, has seen tumultuous times. In the 1790s during the French Revolution it suffered extensive desecration with much of its imagery \u2013 sculptures, paintings \u2013vandalised. However great ceremonies and even jubilation have occurred within its doors, such as the coronation of Napoleon; and funerals of French Presidents.\u00a0 Victor Hugo\u2019s famous 1831 novel, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, reawakened interest in the cathedral which led to its restoration between 1844 and 1864. One supposes extensive damage was not done to the glorious church during WW II since France capitulated to the Germans with not much fight. On August 26, 1944, the Liberation of Paris from Nazi occupation was celebrated in Notre Dame with the singing of the Magnificat within.",
    "About 12m people visit the church annually making it the most visited Parisian monument. In 1805, it was awarded honorary status as minor basilica, the meaning of which is \u201ca large oblong hall with double colonnades and a semicircular apse, used in ancient Rome as a law court or for public assemblies.\u201d So it is a Christian church whose building is similar to a Roman basilica. It also means a church granted special privileges by a Pope.\u00a0 Incidentally, the present Pope was not present at the opening ceremony; a message from him was read.",
    "Writing of this grand occasion which Cass watched on YouTube, it was so noticeable (and distasteful to her) the attention and prime place of importance given to Donald Trump, at least by reporting media and even the reception committee. After all he is not even the US President yet. Detailed showing was of his being received by 46 year young Emmanuel Macron and wife, overshadowing the receiving of the Prince of Wales and other present leaders who attended. What Cass noticed was how the splendour, grace and solemnity of the occasion were lost on Trump. True. He looked foolishly blas\u00e9 \u2013 indifferent, even bored. The boor! Macron was all courtesy, not so his wife, seated next to Trump. No gesture of deference from her.",
    "The great achievement of reconstructing such a magnificent and massive building within schedule called for celebration and congratulations from all the world. I write in detail about this world event because it celebrates man\u2019s ingenuity and commitment and its construction as opposed to destruction that goes on unabated, with two persons most guilty: Benjamin Netanyahu and\u00a0 Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 The former is now giving evidence in court against charges of corruption and granting favours for which expensive gifts were accepted. Putin\u2019s time of retribution will surely come for the blood spilt in Ukraine.",
    "Tomorrow is Unduvap Poya, which commemorates the arrival of Sanghamitta Theri from India, bearing a sapling from the Bo Tree under which Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment. She also started the Mehenisassna, acceding to the request of Queen Anula of the court of King Devanampiya Tissa. The sapling, now more than 2500 years old, is in Anuradhapura surrounded by many healthy Bo trees. It is a symbol of the living Buddha. Remember the story of how during his 29 years of almost continuous residence in Savathhi (Sravasti), the Buddha decided to proceed on a teaching journey. Ven Ananda asked him how the monks would manage without him present. The Buddha suggested a Bo sapling be brought from Gaya and planted in the grounds. Its second or third generation is a wide spreading tree in that most sanctified of places in India.",
    "The symbol of the Bo tree brings to mind the Dhamma taught by the Buddha; the four Noble Truths and the Path we need to follow, minus too many rites and rituals which now seem to take precedence over the pure Dhamma. Even this attitude may change under the influence and principles of the new government and leaders we have.",
