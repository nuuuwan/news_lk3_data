    "The Government will begin enforcing laws against vehicles with unauthorised and hazardous modifications from today, Deputy Transport Minister Dr. Prasanna Gunasena announced yesterday.",
    "In a statement on his official Facebook page, Dr. Gunasena said the focus will be on vehicles with prohibited features, such as excessively loud sound systems and multi-coloured flashing lights.",
    "The decision follows a fatal accident on Thursday night (4) along the Ella-Wellawaya road, where a luxury jeep collided with a bus, causing it to veer off the road and fall nearly 1,000 feet, killing 15 people and injuring 18 others."
