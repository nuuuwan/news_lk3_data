    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A Sri Lankan Minister warns of emerging racism in the island nation targeting ethnic minorities ahead of 2024 elections while regretting the past racism-led events including riots and insurrections since the 1948 independence.",
    "Sri Lankan politicians have historically used racism to divide the country and win elections with the help of their own ethnicities and religious groups.",
    "The island nation is expected to hold presidential and parliament polls next year. A parliamentary election is likely in March, sources close to President Ranil Wickremesinghe have told EconomyNext.",
    "The country saw the first racism led division when the island nation\u2019s former Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike implemented \u201cSinhala only\u201d policy which deprived state jobs for well educated Tamils in 1956.",
    "That was followed by abolishing the merit system in university selection in 1972 which later deprived thousands of Tamil youth of being deprived of university entrance despite having higher marks than many others.",
    "Racism-led politics has always been the trump cards of some political parties specially when they are in opposition.",
    "\u201cWhen we are trying to do away with racism, some are trying to trigger the racism,\u201d Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment told reporters in Colombo at a media briefing.",
    "\u201cEverybody blames the country for not progressing for the last 75 years since independence. The main reason for that is racism.\u201d",
    "\u201cFrom the 1956 Sinhala-only event to each racism event had been used by politicians for their own benefits. People also hung in that string of racism, which could be easily triggered,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAll anti-Tamil riots, anti-Muslim riots, JVP crisis, LTTE crisis are the reasons that have taken this country backward.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s majority Sinhala politicians use anti-minority sentiment to win votes among Sinhala Buddhists saying that the country\u2019s main religion Buddhism is in danger because of minority Tamils, Muslims, and Catholics.",
    "Similarly, ethnic minority Tamils and Muslims also use racism to say their community is in danger because of majority Sinhalese. Such moves have led to riots and killings across the country, mainly before elections.",
    "\u201cIt is highly regrettable even today the racism is being used, \u201d Nanayakkara said.",
    "Referring to an ongoing growing concern of Tamil people in the Eastern province being deprived of their land rights, the minister said he saw nothing wrong in giving lands to Tamils.",
    "\u201cWhat is wrong with giving their land to them? All Sri Lankans have come to this country from outside. How can one group say others can\u2019t own lands? We are against this,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis country is owned by all. This country is not owned only by Sinhalese or Tamils or Muslims. This is the country we all live in. That is our concept, and we are not scared to tell that.\u201d (Colombo/Nov 23/2023)"
