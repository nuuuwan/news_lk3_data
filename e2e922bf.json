    "It is the highest number since the refugee crisis that peaked in 2015 and early 2016 \u2013 during some of the fiercest fighting in Syria\u2019s civil war \u2013 when the arrival of more than 1 million people on Europe\u2019s shores led EU solidarity to collapse into bickering and border chaos.
