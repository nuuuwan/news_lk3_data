    "People\u2019s Bank has announced a Special Relief Package aimed at reviving Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) across Sri Lanka, focusing on businesses with non-performing loans under Rs. 5 million. This timely initiative targets enterprises severely affected by recent economic challenges that were not addressed under previous relief measures.",
    "MSMEs play a critical role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, contributing over 52% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing nearly 45% of the workforce. Despite their significance, many small businesses have faced increasing difficulties in recent years, including rising operational costs, reduced consumer demand, and tighter financial conditions. The Special Relief Package is designed to provide immediate support to these enterprises while improving the Bank\u2019s capacity to manage outstanding loans effectively.",
