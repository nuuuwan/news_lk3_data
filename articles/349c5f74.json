    "FCCISL and NAITA partner for initiative supported by ILO and Government of Japan",
    "Five hundred and twenty five young Sri Lankans have successfully completed the work-based learning program in the tourism sector, a collaborative effort led by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL).",
    "The latest batch of trainees were awarded their certificates at a recent ceremony held in Nuwara Eliya, with the participation of Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Isomata Akio, as chief guest.",
    "In addition to Nuwara Eliya, the three-month work-based learning program was also conducted in Kurunegala, Puttalam, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Galle, and Matara. The training combined both theoretical and practical skills, including hands on experience through industry placements. Upon successful completion, trainees were awarded NVQ3 level qualification, empowering them to access decent work opportunities in tourism sector. Over 150 trainees have already received employment in leading hotels.",
    "This program played a significant role in equipping the workforce with essential skills to meet the growing demands of Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector. Additionally, it empowered youth by providing them with the training needed to embark on careers as young professionals in tourism, while also opening opportunities for foreign employment.",
    "Speaking at the event, Ambassador Isomata Akio said: \u201cTourism is a key driver of economic growth, and Sri Lanka has a distinct advantage in this sector. It is also a priority for the current Government. Japan is resuming 11 Yen loan projects in Sri Lanka, including the expansion of the terminal at Bandaranaike International Airport to accommodate more tourists. This training program in the hospitality sector not only provides young Sri Lankans with valuable local opportunities in the tourism sector but also opens doors for employment abroad, including in Japan. Recently, Japan\u2019s Specified Skilled Worker program has expanded to include accommodation and food services, creating additional prospects for Sri Lankans in the tourism industry.\u201d",
    "\u201cNAITA is proud to play a central role in enhancing Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET system through our work-based learning initiatives. Our apprenticeship programs are designed to meet the evolving demands of the industry while empowering young people to pursue successful careers in the tourism sector, both locally and internationally. By aligning our efforts with the needs of employers and the aspirations of youth, we ensure that our graduates are well-equipped to contribute meaningfully to the workforce. This program has already shown great success and will continue to be an integral part of our strategy moving forward,\u201d said NAITA Chairman H. A. Saththar.",
    "Speaking about the program, FCCISL President Keerthi Gaunawardane said, \u201cTourism has been identified as a key growth sector and a vital contributor to the national economy. However, the industry faces significant challenges following the pandemic and the economic crisis, particularly a shortage of skilled workers. The Strategic Plan for Sri Lanka Tourism 2022\u20132025 identifies skills training for the workforce as a critical action area. FCCISL, as a leading chamber with a district-level network, is proud to have facilitated this program, coordinating with all stakeholders to address these challenges.\u201d",
    "The initiative part of the UPLIFT project implemented by ILO and IOM, with funding assistance from the Government of Japan. UPLIFT enables Sri Lanka to better respond to the rapidly changing migration landscape through enhancing skills of aspirant and returnee migrant workers and improving their access to vital information. Thereby ensuring decent work opportunities and safe migration pathways for all Sri Lankans."
