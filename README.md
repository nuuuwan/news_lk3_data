ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s mobile banking users have been warned of hackers who are hi-jacking their phones and taking over bank accounts.

“We have been alerted regarding several incidents of financial fraud, both globally and in Sri Lanka, disguised as attractive online offers, leading to mobile device users inadvertently clicking on unknown links and downloading malicious apps and files,” a joint statement from Sri Lanka Banks Association, Lanka Pay and FinCSIRT said.

“This action grants scammers complete access to the mobile device, enabling them to control it remotely.

“Once the fraudsters take control of the mobile device, they have easy access to bank/payment apps that are installed on that device, leading to theft from bank accounts and payment cards accessed via the mobile device.”

### Dept. of Immigration and Emigration Chief makes public rationale for working with VFS Global

Following is the full text of a statement issued by Immigration and Emigration Department Controller General I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya yesterday on the Government’s decision to work with VFS Global for processing of visa applications for visitors to Sri Lanka

The Department of Immigration and Emigration commenced in 2012 the online Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) Programme. To grant approval to enter to Sri Lanka for the foreigners who visit Sri Lanka and under this program, only text data was obtained from foreigners. Subsequently, there was a strong requirement to introduce a new methodology due to the fact that this program was not updated timely to meet the technical requirements of the Department. This requirement was further intensified with the introduction of a new visa methodology.

As Sri Lanka braces itself for the Presidential Election, we, the public must vote for deeds – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

When electing our next President, vote for execution, not persona

Given the contextual importance of the upcoming presidential polls which, barring the unanticipated, is scheduled to take place around end-September or early October this year, it is not surprising that the key talking points at public and private gatherings, in newspaper articles, television chat shows and social media blogs are “Who among the candidates would serve Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan citizens best as the country’s President?” and “Who are you voting for?”

### Electricity sector: Without investment we will be in the dark again

From the fact the Sri Lankan developers of wind farms source many of the needed inputs from India, it should be

evident that the eco system of supportive manufacturers is well established there and not here

The 13-hour power cuts two years ago should have educated us on the importance of reliable power supply. But we forget after two weeks, it is said.

What is being done to ensure that will not happen again, including lessening dependence on imported fossil fuel, may not be perfect. But it is important to call out egregiously misguided criticisms. If such attacks succeed as they did 20 years ago, we will continue to suffer the consequences of a bad legal framework, resulting workarounds, and underinvestment in generation, transmission, and distribution. The blocking of new baseload plants from the 1990s served no one’s interests, other than perhaps of the so-called diesel mafia. We all paid for that. We continue to pay.

### Hollow rupee: High cost of mandatory currency conversions on Sri Lanka’s ability to earn foreign exchange

The impact of these dynamics will be felt in terms of reduced export revenue, within approximately nine months – which is the typical lead time on apparel orders

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currency’s strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.

### Harin denies resignation rumours amid visa fee controversy in Cabinet

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando last night refuted claims of his resignation dismissing a circulating letter as false.

Responding to the viral resignation letter on social media, Fernando clarified that while he did express intentions in the Cabinet regarding his dissatisfaction with the decision to increase visa fees, the letter in circulation was fabricated.

“Letter circulating is not true even though I mentioned my intentions in Cabinet, of not wanting to be a part of the decision to increase any visa fees. Date of the letter is also one month ago,” he noted via ‘X’.

Fernando expressed discontent with the new visa processing system, particularly highlighting his objection to the $ 18.5 service fee charged by VFS Global. “It is not surprising that the Opposition leader wants to pin this on me rather than on the line ministry, which implemented this system while we were finalising the proposal for free visas for over 50 countries,” he noted.

Public Security Minister Tiran Alles yesterday vehemently refuted claims suggesting that VFS Global had made a $ 10 million campaign contribution for upcoming elections.

Addressing reporters yesterday, Minister Alles dismissed the allegations as baseless and untrue.

“I saw something that VFS had given $ 10 million for President Wickremesinghe’s election campaign,” Minister Alles stated.

His remarks come in response to recent allegations made by Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who, through a post on ‘X’ on 4 May suggested that the only logical explanation is absolute corruption for the visa deal.

“I also saw today that Sajith Premadasa had demanded money to stop talking about it. These are both wrong. Doing these things will not help the country. I am asking to tell the truth to educate the public. I do not take even 5 cents from anyone. The people in the country know that,” Alles affirmed.

### Concerns emerge on unauthorised players entering local lubricant sector

While Sri Lanka’s petroleum industry awaits the establishment of a new regulator, concerns are being raised about the potential for unauthorised players to enter the market, particularly in the lubricant sector.

The previous regulatory body, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), ceased its activities in market monitoring, consumer and trade education, import inspection and action against unauthorised operators and product adulterators.

As per the Energy Ministry directive, the lubricant licence fees that were previously paid to the PUCSL are now to be paid directly to the ministry.

An entity expressing concerns in this regard is Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC.

“With this development, there is a risk that the vacuum could result in a proliferation of unauthorised players and product adulterators, which would be detrimental to the licensed players, consumers and government, in terms of loss of revenue,” said its MD/CEO Bertram Paul in the company’s annual report.

### Valuing Japan’s Moral Ethos & Economic Assistance

The visit of Japan’s foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa to Sri Lanka is an indication that the relationship between the two countries is on the mend. The manner in which Japan was ousted from the special status it had once held by the previous government headed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would have caused much heartburn. Japan was, for several decades, Sri Lanka’s biggest economic benefactor providing both outright grants and subsidized loans for a range of infrastructure and economic development projects. The cancellation of the light rail transit project, which Japan had offered on very concessional terms, was an example of both political churlishness and economic foolhardiness for which Sri Lankans have had to pay a very heavy price.

### US House passes anti-Semitism curbing Bill as university students turn against Israel

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/US-House-passes-anti-Semitism-curbing-Bill-as-university-students-turn-against-Israel/172-282042) · `en`

The United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a Bill that would expand the definition of anti-Semitism (anti-Jew). The Bill was passed when university students across the US had risen to condemn Israel’s genocide in Gaza. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.

When it becomes law, the “Anti-Semitism Awareness Bill” would allow the US Federal Department of Education to restrict funding and other resources to campuses perceived as tolerating anti-Semitism.

The law would mandate government civil rights offices to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA’s) definition of anti-Semitism.

But the definition has also drawn criticism because most of its examples of anti-Semitism involve criticism of Israel, including calling it a “racist endeavour or a racist project.”

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/VFS-gears-up-to-promote-Sri-Lanka-amid-visa-woes/108-282063) · `en`

Sri Lanka Tourism confirms no such discussion has taken place as yet

VFS says SL tourism promotion will be “comprehensively carried out through new eVisa platform”

VFS Global, which is currently facing a backlash, vows to boost Sri Lanka’s global image through a robust marketing plan with Sri Lanka Tourism. However, the details remain under wraps from the tourism authorities, Mirror Business learns.

The objective of the promotion is to achieve growth in inbound arrivals from the source markets, utilising its global network, as per the vision of the government to achieve five million tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka, VFS Global said in a statement to the media that ran six pages, consisting of details regarding its operations and plans in the island nation.

When Mirror Business reached out to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) for clarity in this regard, Chairman Priantha Fernando said neither the institution nor the Tourism Promotions Bureau is aware of any such plans.

### Collective resolve of regional and international actors, a glimmer of hope for Afghans - Air Chief Marshal Bulathsinghala

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Collective-resolve-of-regional-and-international-actors-a-glimmer-of-hope-for-Afghans-Air-Chief-Marshal-Bulathsinghala/172-282040) · `en`

Afghanistan has been in deep political divisions, structural governance  challenges, and economic insecurity to impede durable peace and  development progress for years. The interruption of the fragile peace  talks with the Taliban and the withdrawal of the NATO troops have  created more uncertainty for Afghanistan. The power shift made on 15th  August 2021 has complicated the matter further to a very higher  proportion

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is a  political UN mission established to assist the people of Afghanistan in  laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development. United  Nations Security Council Resolution 1401 established UNAMA on March 28,  2002. Its original mandate was to support the Bonn Agreement of December  2001

### Press freedom, a boon for economic recovery

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Press-freedom-a-boon-for-economic-recovery/172-282041) · `en`

Sri Lanka ranked 150 out of 180 countries in the 2024 Edition of the Press Freedom Index, published annually by Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Sans Frontiers - RSF) is a remarkable drop of 15 positions from 135 to 150 when compared to 2023.

However, Sri Lanka has been ranked higher than India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India is ranked 159th, Pakistan 152nd and Bangladesh 165th. Norway is ranked in the top position and Eritrea  in the last position. The RSF’s ranking is based on five indicators such as political context, legal framework, economic context, socio-cultural context and safety of journalists.

Sri Lankan authorities might still argue that media freedom in the country is above what prevails in the neighbouring countries and also they might find gaps in the index citing the fact that one of the criteria for Sri Lanka’s ranking in the index is the unresolved issues that have occurred during the separatist war which ended 15 years ago.

And…Viraj added that Terry and the Big Spenders have always been about class.

### SL’s debt-restructuring problems cast shadow on share-trading; indices dip

*2024-05-06 22:34:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sls-debt-restructuring-problems-cast-shadow-on-share-trading-indices-dip/) · `en`

The stock market yesterday witnessed some profit- taking by some share investors mainly due to delays in the external debt restructuring exercise. Sri Lanka expects to implement a debt restructuring framework in June this year but this will likely be delayed further, market analysts said.

Sri Lanka has failed to strike an agreement with international bondholders on restructuring more than US $12 billion in debt, a mandatory requirement set out by the IMF. This essentially accounts for the relevant delays.

All Share Price Index went down by 28.07 points, while S and P SL20 declined by 23.12 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.1 billion with five crossings.
