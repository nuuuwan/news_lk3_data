### Gaza women, children are nearly 70% of verified war dead, UN rights office says

The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70% of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.

The U.N. tally since the start of the war, in which IsraelтАЩs military is fighting Hamas militants, includes only fatalities it has managed to verify with three sources, and counting continues.

The 8,119 victims verified is a much lower number than the toll of more than 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the 13-month-old war. But the U.N. breakdown of the victimsтАЩ age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war.

This finding indicates тАЬa systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionalityтАЭ, the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs remittances coming from its overseas expatriate workers gained 13.9 percent to $587.7 million in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The total remittances in the first 10 months of this year also crossed $5.4 billion with a 11.7 percent gain compared to $4.7 billion in the same period in the last year, the latest Central Bank data showed.

Worker remittances are one of the top foreign exchange revenue earners for the island nation which is still recovering from an unprecedented economic crisis hit in 2022.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods.

As we have previously pointed out, though IMF programs appear to solely focus on development, they do not cater to or deal with matters that affect socio-economic justice and a fair go. Their only formula is one of liberalising markets for generating more profits for investors, with drastic cuts to social welfare benefits and expanding the tax base for increased revenue.

The IMF does not look into the socio-economic equity issues that are prevalent and predominant in most of the societies the world over, including in Sri Lanka. The theory of trickle-down economics[1] underpins their practice. However, nowhere has this theory once implemented been a success in terms of economic development, social stability, and an equitable sharing of the financial burden.

While it is unlikely that any well-meaning President would have exercised such powers indiscriminately and without good reason, the overall global situation today of a world near chaos, and the instances of US involvement in numerous countries and in conflicts and their failure to exercise their powers to prevent conflict or at least to minimise them and take the leadership in finding solutions through discussion and negotiation, have left open the question on the effectiveness of the US President when it comes to world affairs

Paradox of Power: Militarily it is a unipolar world of U.S. hegemony; economically it is a multipolar world with U.S. leadership; but on many transnational issues тАУ such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the migration of people, epidemic disease, drugs, and environmental degradation тАУ we live in a world only a step or two short of chaos (https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/american-power-the-world)

We are deeply concerned about the recent remarks made by Minister Vijitha Herath that no need has arisen to change the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) at this juncture.

*2024-11-08 17:23:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198212) ┬╖ `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



Government suppresses unions and media, fails to keep promises. New Democratic Front opposes this, emphasizing need for experienced leaders. Candidates lack ministerial/state experience, raising concerns about governance capabilities.

ЁЯЯй

The government seeks to suppress the voice of the people by controlling the country's unions and threatening the media without fulfilling the promises made to the people. "We will not allow it," said Assadsali, the new Democratic Front's Colombo district candidate.

In the presidential election, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, including the President, made various promises to the people of the national people.

They also made promises that they could not be implemented. Thus they came to power in the false propaganda.

They are currently asking for a majority in Parliament to fulfill those promises. Nothing has been done so far to come to power.

If the government has been managing the country since the government has come to power, then we will have to take responsibility for the country's rule in the new Democratic Front led by Ranil Wickremesinghe in a couple of years.

Here's a 200-character summary:



Tamil people can leverage political power post-regime change. TNA candidate R. Sanakiyan sees opportunity for Tamil representation in Sri Lankan politics, potentially becoming bargaining force for district issues.

ЁЯЯй

"The time has come for the change and we have a chance to create a change," the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Batticaloa district parliamentary candidate and former Member of Parliament, R. Sanakiyan said.

He was speaking at the election campaign meeting in Kalutara.

There is a regime change in the country. The president, who had carried out racist activities, had to go home.

The Rajapaksa family, who joined him as a group, has to go home.

In that way, the newly elected president in the country has clearly stated that he will not connect with the government, such as corrupt, robbers, rape, and comic recipients.

In that way, when we look at the other parties in the district, there is no such thing as any party to work with the president.

The Tamil people have a better chance. This is because the president was elected by 42 types of votes.
