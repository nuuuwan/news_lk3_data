  "original_body_lines": [
    "Educational reform stands as one of the cornerstone commitments in the NPP\u2018s election manifesto. Entrusted with this critical responsibility, the Prime Minister, who also serves as the Minister of Education, is at the forefront of implementing reforms that will shape the future of Sri Lanka\u2019s younger generations. However, it appears that the discourse surrounding the proposed education bill has so far been poorly articulated in Parliament. The Prime Minister and several senior ministers have not clearly communicated its objectives and potential impacts, following the proposed roadmap for implementation.",
    "Recognising these shortcomings, President Dissanayake took the initiative to personally address Parliament. His intent was to clarify the vision behind the NPP\u2019s proposed reforms, which include modernising the national curriculum, improving educational infrastructure, and addressing the persistent resource and accommodation shortages that threaten to leave some schools behind. His address aimed to restore public confidence and ensure a more inclusive and equitable education system across the country.",
    "President AKD\u2019s speech found to be a very thoughtful and inspiring. His vision for the development of our education system is commendable. I fully support most of the ideas he outlined for modernising the curriculum and using available resources in the most effective and economical manner, especially in today\u2019s rapidly evolving technological environment. His emphasis on aligning our education with global standards to enable our children to compete on an equal footing with their peers around the world is both\u00a0timely and necessary.",
    "That said, I do have concerns about the future of certain critical areas that were not addressed by the President, Prime Minister, or other senior ministers. I understand that the proposed reforms are still under discussion, and that the Prime Minister is currently touring the country to gather feedback from various stakeholders. However, since no separate standalone NPP white paper has been published, my reflections are based solely on limited sources, including President AKDS\u2019s speech. It is in this context that I wish to express some reservations and seek further clarity on the direction of these reforms.",
    "The focus of the new curriculum has clearly shifted toward a separate set of priorities compared to the previous one. Greater emphasis is now placed on subjects such as English Language, Science, Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Commerce, Management, and other skill-based disciplines designed to prepare students for both domestic and global job markets.",
    "In his recent address to Parliament, President AKD highlighted that, unlike resource-rich countries, Sri Lanka lacks significant natural resources like minerals or oil to generate foreign income. Instead, he underscored the need to invest in our most valuable and marketable asset, human capital. He emphasized that enhancing education will enable Sri Lanka to export skilled professionals, earning much-needed foreign exchange to help develop the country\u2019s industries.",
    "To realise this vision, English must undoubtedly play a significant role in a reformed education system. However, giving English undue priority over native languages carries the serious risk of marginalising our native language. Sinhalese, spoken by approximately 16.5 million people primarily in Sri Lanka, has limited use and recognition beyond national borders. Tamil, while also a local language that must be preserved within Sri Lanka, holds broader international significance, with over 64.0 million speakers in Tamil Nadu, India, and other parts of the world.",
    "Given the growing emphasis on global employment opportunities and fostering an entrepreneurial mindset, it is understandable that students may feel reluctant to prioritise Sinhalese, History, and Literature in their academic and professional development. As President AKD noted in his speech, many students in the past chose to study Science because it offered a pathway to becoming a doctor or engineer, professions that were among the highest-paid in Sri Lanka.",
    "From a practical standpoint, English is often viewed as the key to accessing international job markets and the global business environment. However, this shift must be carefully balanced to ensure that the historical, cultural, and linguistic heritage embodied in Sinhalese and Tamil is not eroded in the process.",
    "While I believe in the importance of English as a global lingua franca, it has opened countless doors for professional advancement and international communication, this progress should not come at the expense of our native language.",
    "I recall my own school days in a modest government school in Maharagama (Govt. Training College Practising School) with a total of 250 boys and girls from Grade 6 to GCE O/L. We had just three English periods a week, each lasting around 40 minutes. Still, we achieved functional fluency, thanks to resolute teachers who took pride in their work and focused on helping us excel in national exams, without resorting to private tuition.",
    "Studying, Science in the Sinhala medium and taking Sinhalese Literature as a subject for my O/Ls gave me a deep appreciation for our culture and its distinctive creativity, especially the nuanced humour and poetic depth that enrich our understanding of society. This exposure nurtured not only a sense of pride but also critical thinking and emotional intelligence, qualities that are just as vital in today\u2019s world.",
    "Now, more than ever, we must match the energy and investment directed toward technical subjects with a parallel effort to preserve and promote the Sinhalese language and its literary tradition. Only through such commitment can we continue producing insightful dramas, poetry, and literature that reflect and critique the evolving social and political landscape, works that have defined and shaped our national consciousness in the past.",
    "If we neglect this cultural heritage, we risk seeing it fade into irrelevance within a generation. The Sinhalese language, if reduced to ceremonial use, could eventually become a dead language. For me, and for millions of others, this would represent a profound cultural loss.",
    "To preserve the richness and complexity of our society, we must radically rethink how History is taught. Rather than a dry sequence of events, History should be explored as a contextual, social science that deepens understanding and sharpens critical thinking. Many of our national problems are cyclical, better historical awareness could have helped us anticipate recent declines.",
    "As we advance in English, Science, Technology, AI, and Commerce, we must also safeguard our linguistic and literary heritage, our unique history, and the humanities because these are sacrosanct. These are not mere academic disciplines, they are the soul of our identity. Without them, progress risks becoming a hollow pursuit.",
    "Modern educational curricula increasingly focus on preparing future generations to excel in fields such as Science, Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Commerce, and Management. These disciplines are vital for innovation, increasing productivity, and competing globally. However, if such progress occurs without the cultivation of moral shame and moral dread, we risk producing a society driven by self-interest, one where illegal and unethical actions are tolerated or even encouraged in the pursuit of economic gain.",
    "We have already seen the consequences of this imbalance. In recent decades, individuals in high positions of power have engaged in embezzlement of public funds, abuse of authority, drug trafficking, arms dealings, and blatant disregard for the rule of law, often with the tacit approval or direct involvement of influential politicians and top-level officials. This reflects a cultural shift toward a transactional mindset where \u201cpublic service\u201d is interpreted as \u201cwhat is in it for me?\u201d",
    "Educational reform must confront this issue directly. The development of moral and ethical character must be a foundational component of our education system, not an optional subject, but a compulsory one. Integrity, honesty, and social responsibility should be embedded into the daily lives of students from an early age if we hope to build a law-abiding, compassionate society. Equally important is the active involvement of parents in supporting this aspect of their children\u2019s development.",
    "We can draw a powerful lesson from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. Israel, while a global leader in technological and scientific advancement, has faced international criticism for its treatment of civilians in Gaza. This raises an uncomfortable but necessary question, has the pursuit of technological superiority come at the cost of moral accountability?",
    "A truly advanced society is not defined solely by its innovations, but also by its adherence to ethical principles. Progress without morality is a dangerous path. It is imperative that we educate the next generation to succeed not only in their careers, but also in their conscience.",
    "Educational reform must move beyond a narrow focus on subject-specific excellence and instead nurture students as well-rounded individuals. One of the UK\u2019s leading private schools offers a compelling model by defining academic scholarships within the school, not merely as a measure of intelligence, but as an attitude of mind. As the school explains, \u201cIt involves fostering intellectual curiosity and humility in our pupils and developing within them a passion for learning and independent thinking. They are not just hard workers but have a genuine and sustained interest in academic life beyond the curriculum alone.\u201d",
    "It is essential that the Prime Minister\u2019s education advisers, currently drafting the final reform proposals, give due weight to such values. A forward-thinking education policy must include clear strategies for cultivating and recognising these qualities in every school, ensuring that the development of well-rounded, intellectually curious, and independently minded students becomes a national standard, not a private privilege.",
    "The current trajectory of the NPP government reflects a strong alignment with capitalist principles, particularly in its emphasis on economic development through the cultivation of an English-educated, technologically skilled workforce with an entrepreneurial mindset. While this approach may yield significant material and economic gains, it also invites important ethical and social questions, particularly concerning equity, inclusivity, compassion, and the potential erosion of local cultural and social values.",
    "As the Abbot of Amaravati Monastery, Ajahn Amero, in the UK once wisely noted: \u201cIf the belief is profit for me against absolute good, then I am against capitalism. Whatever is done solely to make a profit is harmful.\u201d Referring to the Sigalovada Sutta, the Venerable further emphasized: \u201cIt should be the skilful use of human energy for the benefit of the workforce and society. Profits must be reinvested for the common good. If that is the case, it does not matter whether it is capitalism or not.\u201d",
    "This insight serves as a powerful reminder that economic systems must be guided by ethical values. Capitalism, when unchecked, often compromises human dignity by exploiting desires and fears for profit. Therefore, as the government pursues educational reforms, it must go beyond merely producing technically skilled individuals for economic gain.",
    "The true purpose of education should be to nurture a generation of free thinkers who are compassionate, morally grounded, intellectually robust and are committed to uplifting our nation. Educational reform must cultivate not only academic excellence and technological proficiency but also the social, cultural, religious, and moral foundations essential for holistic national development."
