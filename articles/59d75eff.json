    "Following is a letter to political party leaders of SLPP, SJB, JVP/NPP, SLFP, UNP, TNA and SLMC",
    "With elections, possibly the Presidential election first, followed by a parliamentary election thereafter, we see mainstream political parties focussing on elections, with heavy criticism of previous Governments, they were also party to at different times in different alliances. It is an irony therefore, the whole focus of all Opposition parties is on \u201ccorruption and economic crisis\u201d with no mention of their responsibility for any of them. They also have only vague deviations from the IMF Program pursued by President Wickremesinghe-led Government. Shared perception nevertheless in both the Government and the Opposition is the IMF remains the sole saviour this moment, while the crisis is not merely economic.",
    "Social implications of the 40-year and more free-market economy that turned \u201ccitizens into consumers\u201d in a non-functioning \u201cprocedural democracy\u201d is that it has left this society in a complex tragedy. Browsing through police statistical records of the past decade will tell you, all shades of crimes are fast increasing in a failing State. From murder, extortions, drug peddling, rape of women, rape of underage girls, sexual exploitations and physical abuse of children, have been continuously increasing. Added are number of pending Court cases counting 1.1 million in 2023 and prisons overcrowding by 232%.",
    "Economic crisis apart, they are major issues that need immediate solutions with education, health, public transport and rural life also demanding serious, far-reaching reforms. We are not aware of what solutions political leaders offer to people who are now tired of listening to criticisms but need solutions to their deep-rooted problems. We need to stress, as political party leaders you have the responsibility of explaining to the People, what your party program is, to qualify to be elected to Government.",
    "Your party program the people need to discuss is certainly not the traditional \u201celection manifesto\u201d all political parties distribute during election time. People need to have a clearly spelt out holistic \u201cnational recovery program\u201d well in advance of elections, for discussion. We insist your party program should include without ambiguity \u2013",
    "1. A definition on \u201cnational development\u201d and accordingly what your political party means by social development of a nation.",
    "2. Clear review of the ongoing IMF Program, and if you intend amending it, your proposed provisions that should be presented at elections for a people\u2019s mandate in their draft form.",
    "3.With \u201cIndependent Commissions\u201d proving wholly incapable of establishing independent State agencies, your program to make them independent, efficient and corruption-free State agencies.",
    "4. Reforms to re-establish Police Department as a \u201ccivil department\u201d totally devoid of any attachments and responsibilities regarding State security.",
    "5. Your proposals to democratise society in establishing a functional, participatory democracy including the still denied fundamental rights of nearly 2 million private sector workers though ensured under Article 14.1(d) of the Constitution.",
    "6.Reforms in educational, health, public commuting and rural agriculture sectors your party proposes with a futuristic outlook",
    "7.Your position on establishing a civil administration in N-E, on land disputes, disarming armed groups and power devolution for democracy as recommended in the LLRC Final Report.",
    "We believe, a program that covers all the above issues and areas, should be published by your party endorsed by your party affiliated organisations without waiting for elections to be declared officially. Professional associations, trade unions, agriculture and fisheries sector organisations, civil society and community organisations need time to discourse on it and make their comments public, as to how the program would serve their needs.",
    "While thanking you in advance, we believe your response would be positive and within two weeks from today, 24 June (2024).",
    "Chandrasena Maliyadde \u2013 Rtd. Director General Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation Asanka Senadeera \u2013 Social Activist",
    "Parakrama Niriella Award winning director stage drama, telefilms and cinema",
    "Anton Marcus FTZ & General Services Employees\u2019 Union Joint Secretary"
