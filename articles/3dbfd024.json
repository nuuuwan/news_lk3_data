    "A young mother told electronic media yesterday that she was searching for rice to buy \u2013 all over the town she lived in \u2013 after dropping off her children at classes.",
    "\u201cI have hunted all over the place to buy some rice for my family, but I couldn\u2019t find any,\u201d she said.",
    "A middle-aged father said that no rice was available at Sathosa outlets although the government had said rice stocks would be made available at Sathosa at the new maximum retail price.",
    "Meanwhile, the dearth of rice in the market is fueling concerns not only among the consumers but also of other stakeholders including farmer associations, small rice millers, wholesalers and retailers.",
    "Anurudda Tennakoon, Chairman, National Farmers Cluster said that the president has taken a decision in line with the price per kilo asked by the medium and large scale millers.",
    "\u201cWe say that this regulation (new maximum retail price) must be strictly implemented. Large and medium scale millers say that they bought paddy at a higher rate so they can\u2019t sell it at a reduced price. This needs to be monitored and acted upon properly. Now imported ice is going to be sold at Rs. 220. We know that Indian Swarna rice will cost only Rs.110 when it is unloaded at the Port of Colombo. If it is going to be sold at Rs. 220, they will be making a huge undue profit. What the government did was pacify these millers without caring for farmers. The bureaucratic mafia is misleading this government. We urge the authorities to take firm action instead of pampering the large-scale millers.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, retail vendors say a profit of Rs. 5 for a kilo of rice isn\u2019t enough and it should be Rs. 10.",
    "Another vendor said that there was no Nadu rice for even Rs. 260. \u201cAnd no Keeri Samba for even Rs. 280. We can\u2019t operate with this controlled price. We will have to close our outlets,\u201d he said.",
    "A senior wholesaler said.\u201d If Dudley mahattaya sends us rice at a lesser rate, we can pass that benefit on to the consumer and sell at lower prices that consumers can afford.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said that he would watch how the issue of rice prices would trend in the next 7-10 days, and take stern action if higher prices persist in the market.",
    "The President has said that rice is an inalienable right of the people and rice millers have enjoyed all sorts of facilities to engage in their businesses, and it is their duty to return that favour to the consumers whose staple food is rice.",
