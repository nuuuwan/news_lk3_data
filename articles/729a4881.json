    "Marking a critical push to combat all forms of violence against children in Sri Lanka, the International Conference on Child Protection (ICCP\u201925) was inaugurated on 25 July and ran until yesterday (27 July). The conference brings together over 250 participants, including Government\u00a0 leaders, leading Government\u00a0 institutions, international and local experts, researchers, and child protection practitioners, to forge stronger protection systems for children.",
    "Hosted by the Centre for Gender Studies at the University of Kelaniya in collaboration with the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) and supported by the European Union (EU) through UNICEF Sri Lanka, ICCP\u201925 aims to drive policy, academic, and institutional action on some of the country\u2019s most pressing issues related to children.",
    "According to NCPA, over 10,000 child abuse and related complaints were reported in 2024, with over 8% involving some form of sexual abuse. Recognising the urgent need for evidence-informed solutions, ICCP\u201925 brings together policy makers, academics and practitioners with the aim of supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s renewed commitments in addressing violence against children. Therefore, the conference is fully aligned with the national policy on child protection and represents a milestone in implementing the international pledges made at the 2024 Global Ministerial Conference to End Violence Against Children.",
    "\u201cThis is not just a conference. This is an important contribution to the national discourse on ways to protect our children. This is a platform to act, not just reflect,\u201d said Speaker of Parliament Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne addressing the inaugural session.",
    "Meanwhile Minister of Justice and a Guest of Honour at the conference Harshana Nanayakkara said, \u201cChild protection is a justice issue. We are committed to reform systems to focus on the best interests of children and ensure that every victim has access to child-friendly justice.\u201d",
    "Echoing this commitment, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Carmen Moreno expressed the importance of their support for child-centred justice reforms, strengthening the legislative framework and enhancing the capacity of institutions and professionals working with children. She said, \u201cThe primary aspiration of any justice system must not be retribution, but reintegration into society. Justice for children must be guided by principles of proportionality, including age and gender appropriate treatment, and take at heart the need to care and protect the dignity and future development of these children.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith strong evidence, effective leadership, coordination, and investment, Sri Lanka can establish a protection system that benefits every child. Academia plays a crucial role in informing policy to address violence against children,\u201d said UNICEF Sri Lanka Acting Representative, Bego\u00f1a Arellano.",
    "Highlighting the critical role of the academic sector in translating data into action, University of Kelaniya Vice-Chancellor Senior Professor Nilanthi de Silva said, \u201cUniversities must not only study child protection, but they must also shape it. ICCP\u201925 is where that transformation begins.\u201d",
    "In a video message, Special Representative of the UN Secretary General (SRSG) on Violence Against Children Dr. Najat Maalla M\u2019jid, stressed the need to provide a continuum of survivor-centred services, leaving no one behind.",
    "National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Chairperson Former High Court Judge Preethi Inoka Ranasinghe, highlighted that preventing children from being subjected to abuse is equally important as delivering justice to those who have already been victimised. \u201cIt is only through a united and informed society that we can ensure protective future for every child,\u201d she added.",
    "The International Conference on Child Protection (ICCP\u201925) is organised by the Centre for Gender Studies of the University of Kelaniya, with support from the European Union through UNICEF Sri Lanka, in partnership with the National Child Protection Authority. ICCP\u201925 brings together national leadership, academia, and international actors to drive evidence-based solutions to end violence against children.",
    "The conference is funded through the European Union\u2019s Support to Justice Sector (JURE) project, jointly implemented by UNICEF and UNDP with the Ministry of Justice."
