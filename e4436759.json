    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 There are indications of a growing mismatch between recruitment of Sri Lankan workers (supply) and global job vacancies (demand) in foreign employment, with increasing supply shortages \u2013 especially for skilled jobs, a World Bank report shows.",
    "\u201cYou have overseas workers that are sending remittances to Sri Lanka; however there is a difference in their skills,\u201d Shobana Sosale co-author of the World Bank report, \u2018Enhancing Skills in Sri Lanka for Inclusion, Recovery, and Resilience\u2019, said at its launch this week.",
    "\u201cJob vacancies for foreign employment have been stable. Yet supply has been falling faster than demand,\u201d according to the report, which cites government-registered sources.",
    "\u201cThe mismatch exists across all skill levels and has been growing evenly over the years, but it is much higher for skilled workers, for whom only 10 percent of job vacancies were filled in 2022, up from 5 percent in 2020 and 2021.\u201d",
    "According to the report\u2019s findings, only 5 per cent of 700,000 foreign vacancies available could be filled. \u201cFew workers enter the job market with appropriate skills training.",
    "Housemaids were in greater supply, with approximately 17 percent in 2020 and 11 percent in 2021.",
    "Sri Lanka has been promoting migrant workers who are a major source of forex for the cash-strapped country.",
    "The national foreign employment policy does focus on investing in a skilled workforce, to wean itself from dependence on remittances from low-skilled workers, through vocational and professional training.",
    "\u201cThe Foreign Employment Bureau advices all workers to receive NVQ through the recognition of prior learning route or by attending training courses at a training institute,\u201d the World Bank report pointed out.",
    "\u201cThis approach is to ensure that workers have qualifications of internationally verifiable standards for their employment in both domestic and high-income countries.\u201d",
    "To become globally competitive, Sri Lanka\u2019s workforce must gain the technical competencies and higher-order cognitive skills needed in domestic and foreign labor markets. (Colombo/Dec14/2023)"
