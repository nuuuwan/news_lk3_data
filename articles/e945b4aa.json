    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has requested the government to ensure that the ongoing investigation into the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks, which snuffed out about 275 lives, will be conducted in a transparent and credible manner. Making a special statement in Parliament, on Monday, he pointed out that a person whose child was killed in the terror attacks had written to the UNHRC, expressing his dissatisfaction with the probe. The government ought to heed the Opposition\u2019s call.",
    "One wonders whether a pang of conscience has prompted Premadasa to make the aforesaid request. He and several other SJB seniors were in the Cabinet of the UNP-led Yahapalana government, which failed to prevent the Easter Sunday carnage despite the availability of actionable intelligence. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry which probed the Easter Sunday attacks has said, inter alia: \u201cThe dysfunctional government was a major contributory factor for the events that took place on 21st April 2019.\u201d (pp. 470-71) The JVP also backed that administration, which shielded the corrupt and neglected national security.",
    "The SJB seniors cannot absolve themselves of responsibility for the Yahapalana government\u2019s lapses that led to the Easter Sunday attacks, as we argued in a previous editorial comment. It is hoped that the Opposition, led by the SJB, will get off its high horse and remain intensely focused on the Easter Sunday carnage probe.",
    "The ongoing investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks is widely considered emblematic because it is expected to delve into a host of crucial issues, such as systemic failures in intelligence and the State\u2019s inability to ensure expeditious delivery of justice. Several negative factors have taken their toll on the current probe, the main being a conflict of interest.",
    "The government has politicised the CID by appointing a prominent member of the ruling NPP\u2019s Retired Police Collective (RPC)\u2014former SSP Shani Abeysekera\u2013\u2013as its Director. Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security, retired SDIG Ravi Seneviratne has also been a member of the NPP\u2019s RPC. Worse, Seneviratne was the SDIG in charge of the CID and Abeysekera was the CID Director at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks. The CID failed to prevent the terror strikes.",
    "A presidential committee has held Seneviratne and Abeysekera accountable for the CID\u2019s failure to prevent the 2019 carnage and recommended legal action against them. The NPP government has dismissed the committee report as baseless, but the fact remains that the CID, under the duo\u2019s watch, failed to prevent the terror strikes, and the possibility of a future government instituting legal action against them cannot be ruled out. Abeysekera\u2019s subservience to the Yahapalana politicians severely compromised his credibility. An audio clip of a conversation between him and the then Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake is a case in point. In 2023, Seneviratne was prosecuted for causing a road accident under the influence of alcohol. The Opposition says the drunk driving charge against him has now been withdrawn! So, his critics argue that his interests will be safeguarded in a similar manner as regards the CID\u2019s failure to prevent the Easter Sunday terror attacks.",
    "Among the National List candidates of the JVP in the 2015 general election was Mohamed Ibrahim, father of two suicide bombers who funded the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) terror project, and took part in the Easter Sunday attacks. The JVP-led NPP government stands accused of shielding Ibrahim for political reasons. Deputy Minister of Defence Maj. Gen. (retd.) Aruna Jayasekera was the security forces commander in the Eastern Province at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks. It has been alleged that some military intelligence operatives had links to the NTJ terrorists, based in the Eastern Province, and therefore Jayasekera should be held accountable for what those officers allegedly did, the Opposition has argued. The government recently aborted a motion of no confidence the Opposition sought to move against Jayasekera. This kind of arbitrary action the government has resorted to in defence of Jayasekera has vindicated the Opposition\u2019s claim that the NPP will go to any extent to safeguard his interests.",
    "Given the foregoing, one can argue that the integrity of the current probe into the Easter Sunday attacks has already been compromised.",
