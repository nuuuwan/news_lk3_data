    "Earthfoam Private Limited, a leading manufacturer of natural latex-based mattresses, toppers, and pillows, recently inaugurated their new liquid latex collection centre in Monaragala.",
    "This state-of-the-art facility is designed with the aim of boosting the efficiency and productivity of liquid latex collection, marking a key development for the industry. Many local organic latex farmers in the region, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, often lack access to accurate information about the market prices and true value of their organic latex. As a result, they are frequently offered unfairly low prices by purchasing companies, which fail to reflect the hard work and dedication these farmers invest in collecting the liquid latex. This issue is particularly significant in Sri Lanka\u2019s dry zone, where rubber cultivation is gaining prominence. They have also introduced the Thurushakthi health insurance scheme in collaboration with Ceylinco Life Insurance, benefiting 1,700 organic rubber farmers and their tappers. This comprehensive insurance plan, which is launched under the Earthfoam\u2019s Fair Trade Programme, covers hospitalization, critical illness, and protection against natural and accidental deaths. The scheme is an expansion of last year\u2019s initiative, where life insurance was provided to around 800 beneficiaries. This year, the number of beneficiaries has been significantly increased with plans to further extend it to 3,000 next year (2025).",
    "During the inauguration ceremony, Earthfoam CEO, Januka Karunasena said,\u201d Earthfoam manufactures and exports high-quality latex foam products made from 100% natural and organic rubber to over 30 countries, including Europe and America. The company sources its rubber from over 1,700 local farmers and uses specialized methods and equipment to ensure consistency, comfort, safety, and durability.",
