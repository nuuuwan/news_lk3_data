    "The special parliamentary session called for Sunday to debate the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill ahead of the 12 December International Monetary Fund (IMF) review for the $ 2.9 billion bailout was adjourned yesterday due to the lack of quorum.",
    "Debate on the Second Reading of the Bill and the Finance Bill was taken up in the house yesterday morning. The debate with a vote was slated to continue until 4.30 p.m. yesterday, in accordance with a decision made by the Committee on Parliamentary Business during a meeting on 20 November chaired by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.",
    "However, during the session opposition MP Nalin Bandara notified Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse about the insufficient quorum in parliament as required by parliamentary standing orders. Consequently, despite ringing the division bell for five minutes, as the quorum was still not met, the Deputy Speaker adjourned Parliament until 9.30 am today.",
    "The constitutional requirement for quorum in Parliament, as stipulated by Article 73, is 20 members, including the person presiding over the session.",
    "In accordance with Standing Order 11 of the Parliament, if at any point the Speaker or any other presiding member is informed that a quorum is not present, they are required to order the division bells to be rung. If, after five minutes, quorum is still not achieved, the Speaker or the presiding member may adjourn the Parliament."
