  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA) has warned that unless the proposals and suggestions aimed at resolving the crises in the country\u2019s health sector are promptly implemented, a stringent trade union action will be initiated on 01 January, 2024.",
    "The final decision on this matter is scheduled to be made by the GMOA\u2019s Central Committee on December 27.",
    "Expressing concerns, the GMOA highlighted that since the beginning of 2022, more than 1,700 doctors, including specialists, have left the country, and an additional 5,000 are likely to follow suit.",
    "This significant exodus has resulted in the closure of nearly 20 small hospitals, with over 400 hospitals and specialist medical units at risk of severe disruption due to the shortage of doctors."
