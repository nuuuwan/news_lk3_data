    "The release of this documentary comes at a critical juncture in Sri Lanka\u2019s political history. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) hold an extraordinary parliamentary supermajority. This rare political opportunity provides the platform to enact long-overdue constitutional reforms\u2014reforms that Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam envisioned nearly three decades ago as essential to redressing the grievances of Sri Lanka\u2019s minority communities.",
    "Yet, despite the scope of the NPP\u2019s electoral mandate, meaningful steps toward constitutional reform have been disappointingly absent. It is my sincere hope that this documentary will serve as both an urgent call to action and a source of inspiration\u2014encouraging the Sri Lankan public to hold President Dissanayake accountable to his promises and to advocate for Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s vision of a just and inclusive constitution.",
    "In addition to examining Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s far-reaching proposals for power-sharing and minority rights in Sri Lanka, the documentary also features interviews conducted with people who discuss his international contributions\u2014most notably Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s role in monitoring Chile\u2019s 1988 plebiscite that helped end Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship, and Dr. Tiruchelvam\u2019s role in shaping Kazakhstan\u2019s post-independence constitution. These segments highlight how Neelan\u2019s constitutional thinking and moral vision transcended national borders and helped shape democratic transitions in various parts of the world.",
    "The two-hour documentary concludes with a poignant and beautiful elegy by the acclaimed Sri Lankan-Tamil poet Indran Amirthanayagam."
