Comrade Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne’s legacy deserves recognition through thoughtful analysis. In response to my recent article titled “41 Years to Black July – Our Voices Towards Meaningful Reconciliation,” I propose addressing a critical issue.

Comrade Karunaratne’s political journey began within the Lanka Sam Samaja Party (LSSP). However, in 1972, he parted ways with the LSSP when it joined forces with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The 1972 republican constitution, drafted by the SLFP, inadvertently transformed Sri Lanka into a Sinhala Buddhist state, marginalising the Tamil community. Subsequently, the 1978 Constitution, enacted during Prime Minister JR Jayewardene’s regime (with current President Ranil Wickremesinghe as a cabinet minister), further entrenched Sinhala separatism, further alienating Tamil speakers.
