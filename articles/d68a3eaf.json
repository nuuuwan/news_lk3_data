    "Calls for political will needed to stop the silent slaughter",
    "In Sri Lanka, the road is deadlier than three decades of civil war. Nine lives are extinguished daily, a tragedy often silently attributed to mechanical failures that a proper vehicle inspection could prevent. For eight years, Tokyo-based entrepreneur Sajeev Rajaputhra has carried the burden of this truth, tirelessly advocating for a modern Roadworthiness Inspection System (MOT).",
    "Rajaputhra, an automobile expert, saw the crisis not just as a national shame but as a personal call to action. His solution was comprehensive: a high-tech Public-Private Partnership (PPP) leveraging Japanese expertise, automated inspection lanes, blockchain, and AI \u2013 a system requiring zero government funds, designed to eliminate the alleged corruption that plagues current emissions checks.",
    "Yet, his mission became a frustrating loop of political instability. The proposal won ministerial approval multiple times, only to be reset with every one of the seven cabinet reshuffles. The lowest point came when eight Japanese investors, ready to deploy technology and capital, were forced to return home without a single dialogue just a few months ago, after Rajaputhra failed to secure an appointment with the current Transport Minister. This missed opportunity symbolized the political fragility costing the nation momentum and lives. Over 26,000 Sri Lankans have perished on the roads since his initial submission in 2017.",
    "Now, with economic recovery on track and a stable political environment, Rajaputhra refuses to surrender. He emphasizes that the private sector can fund the infrastructure and execute the technology, but only the government can help allocate underutilized state land for the test centres across the country, enact the necessary public policy and specific regulations.",
    "At a recent press conference, he released a poignant call to the political hierarchy: \u201cI am ready to be used by the government.\u201d This means releasing all his years of research and KPMG feasibility reports, free of charge, to accelerate the process. With the system ready to launch the first centre within three months of approval, the question is stark: Will the current administration finally demonstrate the political will needed to stop the silent slaughter, before another 16,425 preventable deaths occur?",
