üü©

Following a warning that Israeli tourists may be attacked, special security has been implemented around Sabad houses in many parts of the country, including Colombo.

Accordingly, security has been enhanced near the Sabad houses in Colombo, Augkam Kutta, Ella and Weligama areas where Israel's tourists arrive.

The police said that the area was provided with security before the consultation provided by the embassies.

Minister Vijitha Herath said that special security measures have been launched early this month in the area where tourists are visiting Akkam Guda, Ella, Weligama and Ahungalla.

A protest outside the Bangladeshi president‚Äôs home demanding his resignation ended when demonstrators clashed with riot police while trying to storm the compound, with 30 injured in the melee.

President Mohammed Shahabuddin‚Äôs powers are largely ceremonial but he played a pivotal role at the height of an August student revolution that ousted autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.

Shahabuddin announced his one-time ally had quit on the day she fled the country for neighbouring India, paving the way for the caretaker administration now running the South Asian country.

But last week he said in a local media interview he had not actually seen a written letter from Hasina to that effect -raising the prospect that her resignation was unlawful.

Protesters began gathering outside Shahabuddin‚Äôs compound in the capital Dhaka on Tuesday demanding he step down and accusing him of residual loyalty to Hasina and her Awami League party.

### Canada to cut immigration numbers, government source says

Canada will sharply lower the number of immigrants it allows into the country for the first time in years, marking a notable shift in policy for the government as it tries to remain in power.

Canada will bring in 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027, down from 485,000 in 2024, according to a government source.

The number of temporary residents, meanwhile, will decrease by about 30,000 to around 300,000 in 2025, the source said.

Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers, but in recent years, the national debate around immigrants has shifted in part due to rising housing prices.

Many Canadians have been priced out of the housing market since interest rates started rising two years ago. At the same time, a huge influx of immigrants has pushed Canada‚Äôs population to record levels, further boosting housing demand and prices.

Former president's advisor Sakala Ratnayake has appealed to the government to appoint a national security advisor to address threats from terrorist groups.

As the country's tourism industry is growing, reports of security threat can be affected.

Our government has developed a mechanism for sharing intelligence with other countries, thereby exchanging important information and ensuring the safety of the people.

Due to this, Sri Lanka has not faced any major threat for the past few years.

Former Minister Kanchana Wijesekera criticizes government handling of Israeli tourist threats. He argues lack of communication with foreign embassies led to travel advisories. Two suspects arrested by TID.

üü©

Former Minister Kanchana Wijeeskera has expressed concern over the threats of attacking Israeli tourists in the Sri Lankan area, despite the information on the current government, but the current government has not taken action.

Kanchana has questioned why the government did not explain to foreign diplomatic authorities about the actions taken on the warning attacks.

"The threat to national security should never be taken, is one of the most important income sources in the country," said Kanjana Wijesekera.

He pointed out that if the government had had an advance information and explained it to diplomatic embassies, he could have prevented Sri Lanka's travel advice alert on the basis of precautionary measures taken.

"The government should at least call for a meeting with diplomatic embassies and security officials, explain to them the steps taken and work with foreign embassies to eliminate travel advice to Sri Lanka," the former minister added.

### SriLankan Airlines‚Äô safety rating restored after addressing cockpit incident

In a swift move, Airlineratings.com last week downgraded SriLankan Airlines‚Äô safety rating from 7 to 6 stars following a disturbing incident aboard flight UL 607. On September 21, 2024, the captain of the flight locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit. The incident was deemed serious enough to warrant an immediate reassessment of the airline‚Äôs safety credentials.

However, after a thorough review and prompt response from the airline, the rating has been restored to 7 out of 7 stars, acknowledging SriLankan Airlines‚Äô commitment to addressing the incident with transparency and urgency.

On September 21, a flight from Colombo to Melbourne took an alarming turn when the captain of flight UL 607 locked the co-pilot out of the cockpit.
