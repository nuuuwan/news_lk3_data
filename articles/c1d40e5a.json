    "Intrepid Colombo has successfully concluded the third chapter of its transformative \u201cWomen in Tourism\u201d initiative, expanding its reach to the Uva Province with two impactful capacity-building sessions held recently in Bandarawela.",
    "Conducted in partnership with Australia\u2019s Market Development Facility (MDF) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the session welcomed a group of enthusiastic participants across two specialized workshops designed to empower women at different stages of their tourism careers.",
    "The first session brought together women business owners already working within the tourism industry, while the second welcomed aspiring and current female tour leaders, creating a comprehensive approach to women\u2019s empowerment across the tourism value chain. Since its inception in September 2024, the program has seen a remarkable success.",
    "\u201cWhat makes this iteration particularly exciting is how we\u2019ve tailored our approach to meet women where they are in their careers,\u201d said Poornaka Delpachitra, Country GM of Intrepid. \u201cWhether they\u2019re established business owners looking to scale up or aspiring tour leaders taking their first steps into the industry, we\u2019re providing the tools, networks, and confidence they need to succeed. The enthusiasm and engagement we witnessed in Bandarawela was truly inspiring.\u201d",
