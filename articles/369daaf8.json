    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 S&P Global Ratings has upgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign rating to CCC+ from Selective Default (SD) on a stable outlook citing the island nation\u2019s economy has recovered steadily from its 2022 economic crisis, but its debt burden remains high even after the restructuring of most of its external debt.",
    "It has been the first rating improvement by the S&P since the unprecedented crisis three years ago.",
    "\u201cWhile Sri Lanka has been actively negotiating with creditors on remaining commercial debt still in default, including SriLankan Airlines\u2019 government-guaranteed bonds, we believe that, based on the passage of time, further resolution is unlikely under current circumstances,\u201d the S&P said in a statement.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s economy has recovered steadily from its 2022 economic crisis, with some macroeconomic indicators already surpassing pre-crisis levels. However, its debt burden remains high even after the restructuring of most of its external debt.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe therefore raised our foreign currency sovereign credit ratings on Sri Lanka to \u2018CCC+/C\u2019 from \u2018SD/SD\u2019 (selective default) to better reflect our forward-looking opinion of Sri Lanka\u2019s creditworthiness. At the same time, we affirmed the \u2018CCC+/C\u2019 local currency ratings.\u201d",
    "S&P slashed\u00a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s rating as an issuer of foreign currency debt to \u2018selective default\u2019 after the island nation missed sovereign bond interest payments in April 2022.",
    "It said the stable outlook reflects a balance between its expectation of Sri Lanka\u2019s continued economic recovery, supported by fiscal reform and external improvements, and the country\u2019s high debt and heavy interest burden over the next one to two years.",
    "\u201cWe could lower the ratings on Sri Lanka if we see indications of renewed funding and liquidity stresses,\u201d the rating agency warned.",
    "\u201cDevelopments that could precede such signs include a rapid rise in inflation, a further rise in the government\u2019s interest burden, or significantly weaker fiscal performance, leading to funding pressures.\u201d",
    "However, it also said the ratings could be further raised if economic growth continues to be robust.",
    "\u201cWe believe that Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal and external improvements are more entrenched. This would improve the government\u2019s ability to manage its large debt.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe upgrade reflects Sri Lanka\u2019s recent efforts to complete the restructuring of its remaining commercial debt, including government-guaranteed Sri Lankan Airlines (SLA) bonds, following its December 2024 exchange of most of its Eurobonds.\u201d",
    "\u201cNegotiations on restructuring the SLA debt began earlier this year, with the airline and government making an offer based on comparability of treatment with other external creditors.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe see a possibility that some lenders could become holdout creditors, making a further resolution in the negotiations unlikely, based on the passage of time.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe believe this situation is also unlikely to disrupt or unwind the debt restructuring process, given the principles of comparability of treatment and the most-favored creditor clauses in Sri Lanka\u2019s restructured bonds.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe ratings on Sri Lanka are supported by its strong economic recovery, rapid fiscal consolidation and reform (supported by an ongoing IMF program), accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, an improving external position, and sustained progress in reducing fiscal risks from its state-owned enterprises (SOE).\u201d",
    "\u201cThese strengths are counterbalanced by the country\u2019s high debt\u2013as most of its high-yielding domestic commercial debt was excluded from the debt restructuring exercise\u2013and a very heavy interest burden of about 50% of general government revenue. These structural vulnerabilities will take time to unwind, particularly as external debt servicing will start to increase in 2029.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe \u2018CCC+\u2019 ratings reflect our views that Sri Lanka\u2019s creditworthiness is vulnerable and dependent upon favorable financial and economic conditions, but the government does not face a near-term payment crisis.\u201d (Colombo/September 19/2025)"
