    "The negative impact of the use of asbestos in Sri Lanka is aggravated by factors like open dumping, continuing with the practice of installing roofs without ceilings that increases the human\u2019s exposure to asbestos and the demolition of structures without following the procedures relating to the proper disposal of demolished materials consisting of asbestos. The Sri Lankan authorities are, thus, turning a blind eye on the health hazards emanating from asbestos, Centre for Environmental Justice Executive Director Dilena Pathragoda said.",
    "Pathragoda added: \u2018There are alternative roofing materials that Sri Lanka has been using and still uses, such as, clay tiles, Aluminium/ stainless steel metal roofing sheets, as well as concrete roofs that are advantageous for maximizing the use of space.",
    "\u2018Research is also ongoing for the introduction of cement and sand roofing sheets and alternative fibres that can replace asbestos fibres.",
    "\u2018We need a strong alliance in Sri Lanka to lead research-based decision-making on the use of asbestos. I fail to understand how this material which is a proved health threat in some countries becomes safer in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u2018Toxicity is not defined by geographical boundaries and our decision-makers should understand this to ensure a safe environment for us and our children. We must at least start from preventing early childhood exposure by banning the use of asbestos in pre-schools, schools, child care facilities, children\u2019s homes and hostels.",
    "\u2018Environmental exposure to asbestos here is almost undetected. Piles of asbestos sheets are openly dumped, used as separators in gardening and demolished debris lies open, amidst the residences.",
    "\u2018Children have been observed playing around these areas. However, no health screening has ever been conducted to determine the exposure and health impact among these kinds of communities.\u2019",
    "Meanwhile, the CEJ\u2019s project planning and environmental scientist Chalani Rubesinghe said: \u2018Asbestos is widely used in Sri Lanka as it is believed to be economical. However, the real cost of asbestos is not calculated. The health cost of environmental and occupational exposure is not included in the cost of these sheets. \u2018Research conducted by Eng. Priyanga Peiris and the team revealed that occupational exposure is high among; workers in the asbestos manufacturing industry, carpenters working in the installation and cleaning of asbestos roofs and ceilings, policemen on traffic duties exposed to asbestos emanating from vehicle brake pads, carpenters and masons working on the demolishing of asbestos roofs and ceilings, and persons who live under asbestos roofs. This research also indicated that the number of cancer cases increased among participants who were exposed to asbestos at workplaces for more than 10 years.\u2019",
