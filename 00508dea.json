    "\u201cThe process of domestic debt optimisation is not finalised yet. The government is fully committed to ensure the stability of the banking and financial sector. Recognising the sensitivity, premature speculations without a conclusion could potentially undermine market confidence,\u201d Semasinghe tweeted Sunday June 18 morning.",
    "\u201cTherefore it is of importance that we speak on this matter responsibly and diligently. We have made progress in engaging with our bilateral creditors on debt restructuring efforts. We are optimistic that the engagements will lead to a favourable agreement to achieve stability,\u201d he said.",
    "Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said early May that public bank deposits and stability of the banking system will be safeguarded in any reorganisation of domestic debt.",
    "\u201cThere is speculation about the stability of public deposits and banking system stability,\u201d Weerasinghe told a public forum.",

    "Sri Lanka has to at least extend the maturity of some domestic debt to meet the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2019s annual financing ceiling in 2027-2032, which has to be brought down to about 13 percent of gross domestic product from the current 30 percent.",
    "Sri Lanka banks have said they have received assurances on the effect of any debt restructuring.",
    "IMF Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer said early May that the international lender is in constant dialogue with Sri Lanka over domestic debt restructuring plans.",
    "Any domestic debt restructuring has to ensure financial stability, he said.",
    "\u201cOur role is to ensure that whatever debt restructuring strategy the authorities decide is consistent with debt targets that are designed for Sri Lanka to restore debt sustainability,\u201d said Breuer.",
    "\u201cAs such we do not have any particular view on how the burden should be distributed whether they are external or domestic.",
    "\u201cHaving said that we do have a keen interest to ensure that the domestic economy and the domestic financial system continues to work and are stable.\u201d (Colombo/Jun18/2023)"
