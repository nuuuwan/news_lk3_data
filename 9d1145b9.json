    "The Medical Officer of Health (MOH) in Maharagama, Dr. Kosala Muthukumarana said that a total of 55 street food stalls were inspected during the operation, including all 35 food stalls established at Kimbulawala, Thalawathugoda.",
    "There, the PHIs have found that due to the open display of the food items including meat and fish dishes for sale, the food items had been contaminated as a result of the direct impact of dust and smoke emitted from the vehicles.",
    "In addition, keeping cooked food together with raw food, roasting meat on rusty iron trays, using days-old oil to fry meat have made the food items unfit for human consumption.",
    "Apart from that, the food stall owners have also been warned over not using hand gloves, face masks, and hair covers or aprons while preparing the food. Concerns were also raised regarding the waste water discharge and the garbage bins being left opened.",
    "Meanwhile, Public Health Inspectors have taken steps to destroy 12 kilograms of chicken and also some flavouring agents which were found to be unhealthy for consumption in Kottawa area during the inspections."
