    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Some businesses which are alleged to be run by foreigners, particularly Israelis, are actually owned by Sri Lankans when investigations are made, Assistant Superintendent of Police and Acting Director of Tourist Police Division Prabath Widanamagama said.",
    "Opposition politicians have pointed out that foreigners on tourist visas run businesses illegally in tourist hotspots such as Arugam Bay and Weligama.",
    "\u201cYes, we have received reports, we took legal action against some such places, but when we go there to investigate it is Sri Lankans who show up as owners.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is everyone\u2019s responsibility; people engaged in the tourist trade must decide whether they are going to be bought over for money to allow other people to operate under their names.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t come to Sri Lanka and do business on a tourist visa, that\u2019s illegal, we take action against that.\u201d",
    "Legal action was taken against two British nationals recently, he said.",
    "There are 241 places supplying services to tourists in the Arugam Bay area he said.",
    "Arugam Bay has hit the headlines recently due to having a Shabad house and markings and menus in Hebrew in the area where there is a concentration of Israeli tourists.",
    "There is anger against Israel\u2019s current government over its starvation of Gaza residents, shooting them which has been described as genocide.",
    "\u201cBy regulating them we hope to bring them within the established procedures.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s not completely true that there is a large number of Israelis in Arugam Bay. There\u2019s about 2,000-3,000 tourists daily in Arugam Bay. Yesterday [Monday] there was about 2,337, of that only 443 were Israelis.\u201d (Colombo/Aug6/2025)"
