    "For the first time in 20 years, child labour is on the rise, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) shared.",
    "In a message for the World Day Against Child Labour, the ILO pointed out 160 million children, almost one-in-10 worldwide, are in child labour.",
    "Making the scenario worse is that half, about 80 million, are in the most hazardous forms of child labour, which is work that poses a real threat to their physical and mental health.",
    "\u201dChild labour rarely happens because parents are bad, or do not care. Rather, it springs from a lack of social justice.The antidote to poverty-driven child labour is decent work for adults, so they can support their families and send their children to school, not to work,\u201d said ILO Director-General, Gilbert F. Houngbo.",
    "He added that decent work means ending forced labour, creating safe and healthy workplaces, and letting workers organise and voice their needs.",
    "\u201cIt means ending discrimination \u2013 because child labour often affects marginalised groups.",
    "\u201cWe must step up our fight against child labour, by supporting greater social justice. If we do this, an end to child labour is not just possible. It is within reach,\u201d said Houngbo in his message.",
    "This theme for World Day Against Child Labour is on \u2018Social Justice for All. End Child Labour\u2019."
