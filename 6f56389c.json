    "Sri Lanka\u2019s most technologically innovative bank, HNB PLC, partnered with LinearSix Pvt Ltd. to introduce \u2018Lime\u2019 \u2013 a revolutionary fin-tech solution that will radically streamline customer onboarding and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.",
    "The landmark integration of \u2018Lime\u2019 was commemorated at a special ceremony attended by top officials from both organisations, including HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles, and LinearSix CEO, Mario Gooneratne, with the system going live on 1st November 2023.",
    "\u201cHNB has been among Sri Lanka\u2019s most aggressive banks on digital transformation. We have steadily digitalised all back-end processes and established centres of excellence to centralise these back-end processes. We are constantly striving to unlock new ways of enhancing our overall customer experience. This includes a constant focus on cutting down on wait time from a simple transaction or the opening of new accounts, to investments.",
    "With the adaptation of Lime, the overall customer journey can now be accomplished in a fraction of the time, ensuring unmatched speed and convenience. This in turn helps us to continue fulfilling HNB\u2019s promise of being a joy to bank with,\u201d HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles stated.",
    "Typically, customer onboarding for the opening of new accounts and other services tends to be a time-consuming process for all banks. Historically, this has been a significant challenge given the amount of information required from customers, as well as the stringent regulatory and due diligence requirements required from banks.",
    "\u201cLime was developed to offer a superior user onboarding process. Its intelligent user interface approach has greatly reduced the time and effort required in onboarding and other areas by dramatically reducing the turnaround time to under five minutes for opening an account,\u201d LinearSix CEO, Mario Gooneratne said.",
    "According to HNB Chief Information Officer, Druvi Vaidyakularatne, the integration of Lime promises to be a game-changer. \u201cLime\u2019s user-friendly interface simplifies onboarding and reduces training time for employees, regardless of their experience level. Meanwhile, the use of a robust tech stack built on highly scalable and agile, cloud-agnostic technology allows operations management across all HNB branches.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis in turn enables HNB to more effectively cater to growing consumer demands. Moreover, the integration of Lime into HNB\u2019s existing infrastructure comes at a fraction of the IT cost associated with traditional solutions adopting a modern software as a service (SAAS) model,\u201d Vaidyakularatne added.",
