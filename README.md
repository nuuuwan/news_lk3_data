The fire, which has largely been extinguished, occurred around 10:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. Sunday ET) at a factory run by battery manufacturer Aricell in Hwaseong, south of the capital, Seoul.

The blaze began after a series of battery cells exploded inside a warehouse with some 35,000 units, said Kim Jin-young, a local fire official. What triggered the explosion remains unclear, he added.

He said rescuers were trying to find the five people unaccounted for.

A Reuters witness saw firefighters moving as many as six bodies out of the factory, which is in an industrial area.

ECONOMYNEXT – Ahead of Sri Lanka’s move to restart import of vehicles, industry players say that the government should impose strict controls in allowing old vehicles into the country.

Allowing old vehicles in “will become a burden on the country in terms of subsequent demand for spare part imports and emissions,” Pandithage told shareholders in the annual report.

Sri Lankan conglomerate Dimo, the agents for Mercedes-Benz and Jeep in Sri Lanka expects its vehicle sales segment to become active once again.

More than 1,300 faithful died during the Hajj pilgrimage, which took place amid intense heat, and most of the deceased did not have official permits, Saudi Arabia said on Sunday.

“Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83% being unauthorized to perform Hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

Based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries’ responses, an AFP tally last week put the toll at more than 1,100.

The dead came from more than 10 countries stretching from the United States to Indonesia, and some governments are continuing to update their totals.

Arab diplomats said last week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths — 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.

The diplomats said the cause of death in most cases was heat-related.
