(BBC) - Uganda captain Brian Masaba said it "doesn't get more special than this" after his side beat Papua New Guinea to earn their first win at a T20 World Cup.

The Cricket Cranes, making their debut at a major global event in any of cricket's formats, edged to a tense victory by chasing 78 with three wickets and 10 balls remaining.

"I mean, they've put in the work, they've put in such a shift. And to get a win for their country at the World Cup is very, very special."

The Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union has brought together workers from the plantation sector to organise the first ever Workers’ Tribunal from 7 to 8 June, at the BMICH, Colombo. In this Tribunal several other unions will also be giving their testimonies.

Organisers said it has been 200 years since workers in the plantations have been enabling Sri Lanka’s growth with their sweat and blood. The situation of the workers remain dire and unchanged. The long-standing mobilisation by workers demanding an increase in the basic wages to Rs. 1,000/- began in 2010 and gained momentum in 2018. In this context, the Wages Board increased the workers’ wages to Rs. 1,000/- per day in 2019. The intervention of the Wages Board in this matter has been unacceptable to the companies and the legal battle is still ongoing. Therefore, since 2018, the conditions of workers’ rights have only become worse.

A recent press statement issued by the Ministry of Finance dated 27/05/2024, appears to be a belated focus possibly due to an intervention initiated by an external authority. It pronounces a scheme designed for the implementation of reforms for State Owned Banks.

The diagnosed defects to be addressed are in summary form as follows;

SOBs have faced significant stress during the recent economic crisis,

SOB lending practices have deteriorated due to inadequate risk mitigation and weak governance

SOB balance sheets have absorbed losses of SOEs and help large fiscal deficits of those SOEs

These have led to delays in reforms which contributed to the economic crisis

### Understanding how Zionist Israel has been fooling the world

It is not a fight between two equal states but between an occupier and those that they have occupied

“When IRA was bombing people in England, we did not drop 2000 lbs bombs on Belfast” was a chilling note with utter disgust from the ardent pro-Israeli Broadcaster/Journalist Piers Morgan. This was following the attack on the Rafah refugee tents killing 45 and injuring 250 already displaced civilians on 26 May. The silly claim of Netanyahu’s was, “there were two Hamas operatives.”

BJP’s two-time sitting MP, Lallu Singh, suffered a defeat at hands of Samajwadi Party’s Awadhesh Prasad in Faizabad

The construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, seen by many as one of the defining emotive issues of this year’s Lok Sabha polls, did not yield electoral dividends for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) locally as the party lost the Faizabad constituency that houses the temple town.

The BJP’s two-time sitting MP, Lallu Singh, suffered a defeat at the hands of the Samajwadi Party’s Awadhesh Prasad in Faizabad. The defeat highlighted the success of the Samajwadi Party’s new caste calculus as the party’s strategy to field its prominent Dalit leader, Awadhesh Prasad, from a non-reserved constituency dealt a decisive blow.

Prasad bagged 554,289 votes as against Singh’s 499,722 and won the seat by a margin of 54,567. With this victory, memories of the 1989 polls came back, when Mitrasen Yadav of the CPI had won the seat in the middle of the temple movement.
