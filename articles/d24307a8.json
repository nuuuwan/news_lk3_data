  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved updating the country\u2019s National Policy on Senior Citizens, first introduced in 2006.",
    "The revision comes in response to shifting global and domestic demographic trends. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the proportion of Sri Lankans aged 60 years and above is projected to rise to 24.8% by 2052. As a result, this demographic shift demands stronger measures to safeguard the welfare and rights of senior citizens.",
    "The updated national policy is designed to enable older citizens to live with dignity in supportive social, economic, physical, and spiritual environments. Developed under the theme \u201cRespectful Senior Citizen \u2013 Meaningful Retirement\u201d, the framework emphasises both protection and empowerment, aligning with the Government\u2019s broader policy priorities.",
    "Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing\u00a0 on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the new approach seeks to ensure that Sri Lanka\u2019s ageing population remains integrated and active in society, while also strengthening systems that provide care and protection for vulnerable elderly groups.",
    "He said the move underscores the Government\u2019s recognition that addressing the needs of senior citizens is central to long-term social protection and inclusive development in the country.",
    "The proposal to this effect was submitted by Rural Development, Social Protection and Community Empowerment Minister Dr. Upali Pannilage."
