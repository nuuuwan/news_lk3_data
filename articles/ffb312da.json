    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lankans overwhelmingly cite the economy and inflation as their biggest concerns going",
    "into the September presidential election, an independent poll has shown.",
    "The Institute for Health Policy (IHP)\u2019s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) polling during April to July 2024 showed, however, concerns about unemployment have been rising since the start of the year, whilst the numbers of Sri Lankans citing corruption and drugs as top national problems have been declining.",
    "IHP said in a statement on Thursday August 22 that the SLOTS poll asks respondents to name the top two problems facing the country, with responses being unprompted. During April\u2013July 2024, 59 percent named the economy (+3 points from January\u2013March 2024) and 55 percent inflation (-7pts) as their top concerns. This was followed by 38 percent mentioning unemployment (+9pts) and 21 percent high taxes (-0.5pts). Smaller numbers of Sri Lankans cited corruption (6 percent), health (6 percent), drugs (5 percent), and education (4 percent) as in their top two concerns. None of the over a thousand respondents cited the presidential system, the constitution, or democracy as priority problems.",
    "\u201cWhilst there is broad consensus that the economy is the most pressing national problem, better-off and poorer Sri Lankans differ in their perceptions about what is important. The least affluent third of Sri Lankans are more likely (69 percent) than the richest third (52 percent) to think the economy is a top priority. In contrast, poorer Sri Lankans are less likely (54 percent) than the better-off (63 percent) to cite inflation as a top problem. An even bigger contrast is seen with unemployment, which only one in five (18 percent) of poorest Sri Lankans cite as a top priority compared with one in two of the middle and most affluent Sri Lankans. Economic issues and inflation are the top concerns across all age groups. Younger Sri Lankans (18\u201329 years) are most concerned about inflation (60 percent), while concern about the economic crisis increases with age, reaching 67 percent among those aged 60 and older. Job-related concerns are most common among the younger population, but decrease with age.\u201d",
    "IHP said SLOTS combines data from a national sample of adults (ages 18 and over) reached by random digit dialling of mobile numbers, and others coming from a national panel of respondents who were previously recruited through random selection. All estimates are weighted to be representative of the national population, including characteristics such as age, gender, province, sector, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and education.
