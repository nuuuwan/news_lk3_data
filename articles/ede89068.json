  "original_title": "\u201cWorld War 3 has begun,\u201d says Ukraine\u2019s ex-military commander amid Russia conflict",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Valery Zaluzhny, former military Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine, believes World War III is underway, adding the direct involvement of Russian allies in the conflict indicates the same.",
    "\u201cI absolutely believe that in 2024 we can believe that the Third World War has begun,\u201d Mr Zaluzhny said during a speech at the Ukrainska Pravda\u2019s UP100 award ceremony.",
    "Now serving as Ukraine\u2019s envoy to the United Kingdom, Mr Zaluzhny pointed to the direct involvement of Russia\u2019s autocratic allies as a significant factor in the war\u2019s global expansion.",
    "\u201cSoldiers from North Korea are standing in front of Ukraine. Let\u2019s be honest. Already in Ukraine, the Iranian \u2018Shahedis\u2019 are killing civilians absolutely openly, without any shame,\u201d he continued, stressing North Korean troops and Chinese weapons were now actively contributing to the war.",
    "Mr Zaluzhny urged Ukraine\u2019s allies to take decisive action and prevent the conflict from spreading beyond the country\u2019s borders. \u201cIt is still possible to stop it here, on the territory of Ukraine. But for some reason, our partners do not want to understand this. It is obvious that Ukraine already has too many enemies,\u201d he warned.",
    "His comments came amid heightened tensions, with Moscow reportedly deploying over 10,000 North Korean troops to the Kursk region and utilising Iranian drones and other advanced weaponry against Ukraine.",
    "\u201cUkraine will survive with technology, but it is not clear whether it can win this battle alone,\u201d Mr Zaluzhny said.",
    "His speech also coincided with Russia\u2019s use of a hypersonic ballistic missile in Dnipro, an attack that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned as a severe escalation. \u201cThis is a clear and severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war,\u201d Mr Zelensky said.",
    "Valery Zaluzhny has remained a significant voice in Ukraine\u2019s military and political discourse despite his dismissal earlier this year. Once celebrated for stopping Russia\u2019s initial invasion in February 2022, tensions with President Zelensky led to his ousting. General Oleksandr Syrskyi replaced him, reportedly for his closer alignment with Mr Zelensky\u2019s strategies."
