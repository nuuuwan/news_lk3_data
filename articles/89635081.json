    "The committee tasked with investigating allegations against Chairperson of Aura Lanka Group of Companies and President of Aura Lanka Sports Ltd. Viranjith Thambugala, regarding unauthorised entry into Anuradhapura Prison, has concluded that Thambugala had entered the prison with proper permission and did not meet with any prisoners during the visit as alleged.",
    "The committee led by its Chairperson retired High Court Judge Sisira Ratnayake handed over its report to the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapaksha yesterday.",
    "According to the committee report, Thambugala had entered the prison premises with formal authorisation and visited the facility at the request of the Prisoner Welfare Association. It noted that his purpose was to offer financial aid for acquiring loudspeakers and related equipment for Anuradhapura Prison. Importantly, the report confirms that Thambugala did not engage in any confidential discussions with prisoners during his visit.",

    "The committee stated that no evidence has been presented to substantiate the allegations mentioned in the accompanying video related to this incident. However, the committee recommended installing a CCTV camera system to cover key areas, including the prison office premises, to enhance prison security and prevent similar accusations in the future.",
    "Meanwhile, Commissioner General of Prisons Thushara Upuldeniya, has requested the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to pursue legal action against both the individual and the organisation responsible for disseminating false information."
