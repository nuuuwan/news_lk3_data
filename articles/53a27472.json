    "I was perhaps a little overenthusiastic, in trying to claim objectivity for Rajiva Wijesinha\u2019s latest book, when I said at the launch on Tuesday, December 17, at Lakmahal, that the role of the political commentator and observer is not to pass judgments, but rather to lay bare the facts for the reader to decide. During the Q and A I was bluntly \u2013 and justly \u2013 critiqued by a member of the audience: no, he said, the role is not to overwhelm the reader with facts \u2013 it is to come to conclusions, to make the reader aware.",
    "I am not sure whether this country is ready for another book on Ranil Wickremesinghe. It has been not quite three years since Wijesinha came out with a book \u2013 a grand expose, in my view \u2013 of J. R. Jayewardene. There was much to commend about that particular work, in particular its evisceration of K. M. de Silva\u2019s and Howard Wriggin\u2019s biography. It was only halfway through that I realised how sordid and irredeemable things had become since 1977, when the entrenchment of corruption took on new, unprecedented proportions. But then I realised that Wijesinha was not writing a dirge for the way things were, rather a revelation of where we are now, and as importantly, what we can do about it.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Emasculation of the United National Party (2024, Neptune Publications) follows Wijesinha\u2019s trajectory of political writing. The book is full of tragedy and pathos, and bathos. It does not lay the sole blame for what has happened to the country, and the UNP, on Wickremesinghe \u2013 as Dayan Jayatilleka noted his speech, he is a protagonist set against a wider dramaturgy. But Wickremesinghe is not a bit player either \u2013 he emerges as the culmination of everything that the UNP did to itself, and to the country, until 1994. Viewed that way, Wijesinha\u2019s book is a worthy successor to his study of Jayewardene \u2013 though as he told me before the event, there just isn\u2019t anyone of K. M. de Silva\u2019s intellectual calibre to take on the task of Wickremesinghe\u2019s biography today.",
    "The book begins with a look at some of the few good men the UNP produced in the 1970s, including Gamini Jayasuriya and Ranjith Atapattu. They were, as Wijesinha notes, honest and utterly scrupulous. But they were also in a minority, and typical of the Jayewardene regime \u2013 which even his biographers admit left a wide berth for corruption \u2013 they were sidelined. Wijesinha does his best to exonerate those who remained \u2013 the lesser evils \u2013 among whom he lists the then Finance Minister, Ronnie de Mel. The way he frames it, the turning point was the 1982 election, the subsequent referendum, and the 1983 riots. It is at this juncture that the party abandoned all pretences to statesmanship.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe surfaces at this point. Wijesinha leaves no stone unturned in his critique of the man, including his parliamentary interventions after the 1983 riots. But to be fair by Wickremesinghe himself, the UNP had already deteriorated by then. Deprived of its liberal wing \u2013 one which Wijesinha traces to the death of Dudley Senanayake \u2013 it embraced authoritarianism with much enthusiasm. In a way, one could say this was inevitable: Sri Lanka was the first South Asian country to impose neoliberal capitalism on its economy, and as was typical of such countries, it modelled itself along the lines of other authoritarian capitalist states, including of course Singapore. Wijesinha does not critique the opening up of the economy itself \u2013 he implies, correctly I believe, that it was inevitable at that point. He finds fault instead with the manner in which it was done.",
    "Although Wijesinha does not explicitly bring them up, I see parallels between this and Wickremesinghe\u2019s handling of the economy after 2022. Economists and civil society were by 2022 agreed that there was no alternative to the IMF \u2013 simply because the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government had exhausted all other options. Yet Wickremesinghe\u2019s reforms \u2013 highly orthodox, even if supporters claimed them to be radical in the run-up to elections this year \u2013 shifted the burden to the middle-classes. I should perhaps not quote extensively from Wijesinha\u2019s book, yet the following passage is insightful.",
    "\u201cBut what the IMF had requested before agreeing on the funds was acted on only insofar as the less well off were targeted, as with the new tax regime that burdened the middle classes disproportionately. What Ranil did nothing about was the restorative justice the IMF and the country wanted, bringing those who had plundered the country to justice and getting back at least some of the ill gotten gains.\u201d",
    "What we saw during the Wickremesinghe presidency \u2013 a point Wijesinha does not touch on that much \u2013 is the diminution of support he had hitherto secured from the upper echelons of the Colombo liberal intelligentsia. I distinctly remember an apologia, of sorts, penned by a group of writers calling themselves \u201cSome Colombo Liberals\u201d in September 2019, in the run up to presidential elections that year, stressing that \u201cthe UNP does not belong to liberals and there is no need to support the party to identify as a liberal.\u201d Yet there was a time, not too long ago \u2013 during my teenage years \u2013 when it was fashionable, in order to be identified as a liberal, to support the policies Wickremesinghe adopted.",
    "Which brings us to the elephant in the room, the million dollar \u2013 or rupee \u2013 question that the book leaves us with: what, exactly, constitutes liberal politics in Sri Lanka? Some would identify it with the centre-right, others with the centre-left. But is there a centre-right or centre-left in this country? As a friend of mine told another friend on his way out after the launch ended, \u201cWhat is socialist?\u201d Once could well ask, \u201cWhat is liberal?\u201d and still get the same, stony silence such questions provoke. Perhaps it was foolish to identify the liberal mainstream with Wickremesinghe, or for that matter the UNP \u2013 at least in its post-1977 iteration. But one point keeps coming back to me: though Wickremesinghe\u2019s career may have ended, for now, the ghost of his ideas remains. In a way, that may be his strength and biggest trump card: ensuring that his ideas survived even his downfall.",
