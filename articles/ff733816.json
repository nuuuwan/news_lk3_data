    "This was down from US$ 225.7 million in April but up from US$ 100.0 million a year ago when the trade was recovering from repeated crises.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy weakened due to waning inflows from tourism and other foreign currency inflows due to the 2019 Easter attacks, two years of pandemic induced restrictions over travel and in-person events, and then by the \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 in 2022.",

    "Provisional data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) showed that stakeholders expected the 900,000 tourist mark to be crossed by end May, the milestone was reached on June 1.",
    "The daily arrival average has dropped to the levels of 3,100.",
