    "Parliament is to have a debate on the recently-concluded external debt restructuring agreement between Sri Lanka and some of its foreign creditors. It is hoped that the focus of the House will remain undivided on the country\u2019s debt crisis and the ways and means of overcoming it, and nothing else. Parliamentary debates usually descend into slanging matches.",
    "Opinion is divided on the aforesaid agreement which the government has made out to be a huge success. The Opposition has dismissed it as a sellout, claiming that the government has agreed to conditions totally unfavourable to the country. The truth, we believe, is somewhere between these two extreme positions.",
    "The debt structuring agreement has provided Sri Lanka with some respite, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be considered an achievement worthy of celebration. Sri\u2008Lanka\u2019s International Sovereign Bonds have not yet been restructured; the government is hopeful that an agreement with the bondholders can be reached. There is a long way to go before we achieve debt sustainability, the be-all and end-all of breaking the back of the current crisis, and putting the economy back on an even keel. This is a gargantuan task that requires a substantial increase in the country\u2019s export revenue and a drastic reduction in the outflow of foreign exchange, among other things.",
    "The Opposition\u2019s position on external debt restructuring smacks of a mindset that the foreign creditors must be penalised for Sri Lanka\u2019s blunders which have brought about the current crisis. True, Sri Lanka would have gained hugely if its creditors had been made to agree to big haircuts and other such extreme measures, but the question is whether it would have been able to borrow again from external sources in such an eventuality.",
    "How can the foreign creditors be expected to be so considerate as to take huge haircuts for the sake of Sri Lanka while some local trade unions are demanding their pound of flesh or even more, and the MPs are all out to secure duty-free vehicle permits, which will be a drain on the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves? Worse, Sri Lankan exporters stand accused of parking their export proceeds overseas.",
    "Meanwhile, the crisis we are facing is multi-factorial although our focus is only on the economic aspects thereof. Therefore, our efforts to solve it once and for all should not be limited to the economic front. The need for social and political reforms to prepare the country for doing what needs to be done to overcome the present crisis cannot be overemphasised. We are without a work ethic as such and our attitude to work, as a nation, is appalling, to say the least; it is only natural that our national productivity remains woefully low, and we continue to be dependent on foreign aid.",
    "Ideally, the government and the Opposition should have got together to help resolve the country\u2019s worst-ever economic crisis, and formulated a recovery strategy, instead of playing politics with the issue. In fact, all members of the current Parliament are duty bound to make a collective effort to hoist the country out of its debt crisis. The SLPP government on Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s watch precipitated the economic crisis, but successive governments have contributed to the country\u2019s unsustainable debt, albeit to varying degrees. Those in the current Opposition were in the Yahapalana  government or were supportive of that regime, which borrowed more than USD 10 billion between 2015 and 2019, according to SLPP Leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The SJB MPs were in the UNP at the time. The TNA, the JVP, etc., fully backed the Yahapalana administration, and even prevented its collapse in 2018 by helping it muster a parliamentary majority. Besides, the TNA backed the LTTE, which inflicted incalculable damage on the economy, and the JVP itself destroyed state assets worth billions of rupees in the late 1980s.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his willingness to consider alternative proposals outlining a viable strategy to overcome the debt crisis. He has invited the Opposition to submit such proposals, if any, and undertaken to facilitate a meeting between the proponents thereof and the IMF representatives. Will the Opposition take up the challenge and present an alternative plan when the debt deals are taken up for debate?",
