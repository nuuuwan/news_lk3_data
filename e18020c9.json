    "Says the officer appointed must be able to restore public confidence",
    "Stresses\u00a0 it is of utmost importance that the best possible appointment be made",
    "Highlights recommendations and approvals of the Constitutional Council must be sought",
    "In a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) urged him to appoint an officer whose service in the police force is exemplary and unblemished and who is able to restore public confidence in the Sri Lanka Police.",
    "The BASL noted that the while the office of the Inspector General of Police has fallen vacant on 26 June, the association is of the view that public confidence in the Police is vital for the administration of justice and the rule of law. \u201cHence, it is of utmost importance that the best possible appointment be made to that office,\u201d they said.",
    "\u201cIn recent times we have witnessed serious erosion in the public confidence in the Police. The BASL has previously highlighted the lack of independence, politicisation, police brutality, custodial deaths, and lack of professionalism, which have all contributed to the erosion of public confidence in the Police. Further, we are of the view that the Easter Sunday attacks are a clear example of the grave ramifications of incompetent individuals holding such high office,\u201d the BASL added.",
    "The BASL noted that in the case of Mohammed Rashid Fathima Sharmila v K.W.G. Nishantha and others SCFR 398/2008- S.C.M. 03.02.2023 the Supreme Court observed that the police had lost the credibility it ought to have.",
    "Further, the BASL said it was also of the view that prior to the approval of the appointment of the Inspector General of Police that the procedures to be followed in regard to recommendations or approvals for appointments under Article 41B or 41C should be determined by the Constitutional Council as provided for in Article 41E(6) of the Constitution."
