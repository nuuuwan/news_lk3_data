    "The stock market investor sentiment notably improved yesterday with the anticipation that interest rates would come down. Besides the debt restructuring process with bond dealers was reportedly going off smoothly. These developments positively impacted banking sector counters in the share market, analysts said.",
    "In September, Sri Lanka experienced deflation for the first time since 2015, with the general price level falling below that of a year ago. This decline was driven by administrative price adjustments that brought down key cost drivers, including food, fuel, and water tariffs. This situation would considerably impact interest rates, market analysts added.",
    "Both food and non-food inflation turned negative, contributing to the overall deflationary trend. Despite this, annual average inflation remains positive, reflecting elevated price levels from earlier months. The continued drop in vegetable prices and the lingering effects of reduced fuel and water tariffs suggest that inflationary pressures have eased significantly in the short term. The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) has deflated on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis recording -0.5 percent in September 2024 (Vs 0.5 percent in August 2024).",
