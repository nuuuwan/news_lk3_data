    "Thailand\u2019s trade talks with the United States are expected to be concluded before Aug 1, and US tariffs on the country are not expected to be as high as 36 per cent, its finance minister said on Tuesday (Jul 29).",
    "The United States was Thailand\u2019s largest export market last year, accounting for 18.3 per cent of total shipments, or US$54.96 billion. Washington has put its deficit with Thailand at US$45.6 billion.",
    "Thailand is ready to negotiate and its proposal remains the same, Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told reporters.",
    "\u201cThe United States has already opened the way for further negotiations, and we will continue the discussions,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked whether the talks could be done before the Aug 1 deadline, Pichai said, \u201cYes, it can be done in time. We\u2019re definitely ready and now we\u2019ll see how the US decides.\u201d",
    "US tariffs on Thailand could be announced on Aug 1 or Aug 2, Pichai said.",
    "\u201cThis is roughly where things stand. I think it\u2019s very close now,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe we definitely should not face 36 per cent.\u201d",
    "Earlier this month, Pichai said the country made more concessions in addition to an earlier improved trade proposal that offered zero tariffs on many US products.",
    "He said US tariff rates on Thailand are expected to align with other countries in the region.",
    "Vietnam and Indonesia now face US tariffs of 20 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, significantly lower than the levels announced in April."
