    "Today (June23) is the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister and President Ranasinghe Premadasa who was born on this day in 1924 at Dias Place, Keselwatte in Colombo Central. He had his primary education at Harvard Methodist Girl\u2019s School and Lorenz\u2019s College and his secondary education at St. Joseph\u2019s College, Colombo where he studied up to his Cambridge senior exam. He also received Buddhist instuction at Hewavitarana Daham Pasala in Pitakotuwa (Pettah).",
    "It is a pleasure for me to write a few lines on this occasion about a leader who stood by ordinary people through thick and thin. I had the good fortune of meeting him long before he had reached the acme of his career as President Premadasa was a long-time friend of my father, late E.P.De. Silva, who was a well-informed political reporter before he became the Editor of the Daily Mirror.",
    "President Premadasa began his political career in 1950 as a member of Labour Party under A.E. Goonasinha, was elected a member of the Colombo Municipal Council from the San Sebqastian ward. In 1956, he joined the United National Party running unsuccessfully against Dr. NM Perera at Ruwanwella.",
    "In March 1960 he was elected as a Member of Parliament from Colombo Central but failed to retain the seat at the election which followed in July the same year. In 1965, he was first appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction and the Minister when late Senator M. Tiruchelvam who held the portfolio resigned in 1968. After 1977, when J.R. Jayewardene became the first President of Sri Lanka, Premadasa was appointed Prime Minister. After more than four decades of active politics, in 1988, he became the second Executive President of Sri Lanka up to 1993 when he was assassinated.",
    "Sadly the country lost a dynamic leader who was action and result oriented and had the vision to developing the economy island wide by taking industries to the rural areas and providing employments to rural youth helping to alleviate poverty in the villages. His Janasaviya poverty alleviation and 200 garment factories programs stand out in this regard.",
    "The late President had the common touch, always believing in that ordinary people should share the responsibility of finding solutions to their problems. He was convinced that major problems including the lack of foreign exchange could be overcome by harnessing our own resources.",
    "President Premadasa, due to his friendship with my father, never forgot to visit me whenever he visited the Badulla District where I worked as Assistant Superintendent at Downside Estate, Welimada and Superintendent at Shawlands Estate, Lunugala. He was most concerned about the living conditions of the estate workers such as housing, drinking water1}, electricity, sanitation etc.",
    "Despite the then unsettled domestic situation in the country with twin insurrections in the north and south led by the LTTE and JVP during his tenure, he continued with the implementation of his schemes and programs for economic and social reconstruction. The thrust of his approach was the launching of the village awakening movement Gam Udawa (village reawakening) and Janasaviya (strength of the people). He had feeling for and empathy with the common man and reached out to uplift their living conditions in most of his programs.",
    "The object of these, as stated by him, was whatever development the country achieved must benefit the poor and be focused on eliminating the gap between the haves and have nots. He looked for officials with a \u201cMust and Can Do\u201d attitude to carry forward his programs. There\u2019s a wide perception that had President Premadasa\u2019s life not been prematurely cut down, he would have led the country to a progressive and disciplined future similar to many other developed countries. Such leadership is badly needed today.",
    "Though sometimes controversial he remains an iconic figure in politics today. Hopefully, present political leaders would learn from his mistakes and follow his good example and pave the way for a better Sri Lanka.",
