    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka today announced that the deadline for accepting applications for postal voting in the 2024 General Election, which was scheduled to end at midnight today (8), has been extended until midnight on 10 October 2024.",
    "The Elections Commissioner General said that this decision was made in consideration of the possible postal delays and several requests made by the public to the commission.",
    "Furthermore, the election regulatory body has also advised that it is more appropriate to hand over the postal vote applications completed on October 09 and 10 by hand to the district election office of the district where the office of the certifying officer is located, instead of handing them over to the posts, in order to avoid the possible delays.",
    "The Election Commission also noted that the application deadline will not be extended further under any circumstances."
