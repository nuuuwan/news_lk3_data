### South Korea’s President Yoon reverses martial law after lawmakers defy him

*2024-12-04 08:32:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103978/south-koreas-president-yoon-reverses-martial-law-after-lawmakers-defy-him) · `en`

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift a surprise martial law declaration he had imposed just hours before, backing down in a standoff with parliament which roundly rejected his attempt to ban political activity and censor the media.

In South Korea’s biggest political crisis in decades, Yoon shocked the nation and declared martial law on Tuesday night to thwart “anti-state forces” among his domestic political opponents. But outraged lawmakers unanimously rejected the decree. Yonhap news agency said the cabinet had agreed early on Wednesday to scrap the martial law.

Protesters outside the National Assembly parliament shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.

The main opposition Democratic Party called for Yoon, who has been in office since 2022, to resign or face impeachment.

### Sri Lanka central bank net foreign reserves just above zero

*2024-12-04 07:28:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-net-foreign-reserves-just-above-zero-191861/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka net foreign assets moved to positive territory in October 2024, with about 63 million dollars over its reserve related liabilities, official data shows, after two years of deflationary policy with interest rates to match.

Sri Lanka’s central bank’s reserves became negative by 4.6 billion after rate cuts were enforced by inflationary direct and open market operations.

The central bank also borrowed reserves through swaps, and also busted a special drawing rights allocation (a type ‘reserve’ created by the International Monetary Fund) in the course of mistargeting rates through a policy rate which ended in a sovereign default.

A ‘transmission mechanism’ then spreads the mis-targeted rates along the yield curve.

When reserves were hitting negative territory during the last currency crisis, the central bank already had loans from the International Monetary Fund taken during currency crises triggered by earlier rate cuts.
