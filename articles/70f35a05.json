    "\u201cThere will be a strong list for all of Sri Lanka. We don\u2019t want a government but we do anticipate the opposition leadership,\u201d said Lanza.",
    "\u201cAfter we submit nominations on the 11th, we will meet on Saturday. On Monday there will be a meeting chaired by former President Wickremesinghe and former Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. We will bring everyone who was nominated to Colombo and there we will announce who our opposition leader is,\u201d he said.",
