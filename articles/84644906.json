    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s police department is on the verge of a seismic change, with the fates of its top two officers to be decided by separate disciplinary authorities in landmark cases involving misconduct, incompetence, and gross criminal behaviour.",
    "Inspector-General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon is the first head of the department in its 159-year history to face impeachment. A three-member inquiry body, appointed by Parliament, is expected to announce its decision soon.",
    "Official sources close to the administration say Tennakoon, against whom Parliament initiated impeachment proceedings in April, should know his fate this week or at least by the end of the month.",
    "Legislators voted unanimously on April 8 in favour of a resolution calling for a formal investigation into Tennakoon\u2019s conduct. His inquiry heard he was running a \u2018criminal enterprise\u2019 under the guise of law enforcement and was unfit to serve the police even at the lowest rank.",
    "He was appointed police chief in November 2023, despite Sri Lanka\u2019s highest court ruling that he had tortured a suspect in custody by rubbing menthol balm on the victim\u2019s genitals.",
    "Tennakoon is also accused of authorising the ill-fated police drug raid on the W15 hotel in December 2023, which led to a gun battle between rival police units in coastal town of Weligama. No drugs were found during the raid.",
    "The Supreme Court suspended him in July 2024 pending the outcome of a separate case challenging the legality of his appointment following a controversial vote within the Constitutional Council.",
    "If the Parliament-appointed panel, headed by Supreme Court Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, finds Tennakoon liable, Parliament will be required to vote on his removal. Both the government and the opposition are united in their efforts to sack Tennakoon.",
    "Tennakoon could make history as the first Inspector-General to be impeached in Sri Lanka. He was strongly supported for the top post by then Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and endorsed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "Amid the drama involving Tennakoon, the fate of his deputy, Senior Deputy Inspector-General Nilantha Jayawardena, also hangs in the balance. Jayawardena is facing a disciplinary inquiry over his role in failing to prevent the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings.",
    "At the time, Jayawardena headed the State Intelligence Service (SIS), which had been alerted to a potential terror strike 17 days before the bombings that targeted three hotels and three churches, killing at least 279 people and injuring over 500.",
    "The former SIS chief was removed from his position and made the de facto number two in the police force by Wickremesinghe in January 2023. However, on July 18, 2024, the National Police Commission interdicted Jayawardena and launched an investigation.",
    "Official sources indicate that it is highly likely Jayawardena will also face termination due to the weight of evidence and several judicial orders calling for his prosecution on charges of incompetence and negligence.",
    "He had already paid 75 million rupees in damages as ordered by the Supreme Court on January 12, 2023. (COLOMBO/July19/2025)"
