    "The sun slants through the high windows of Seylan Bank\u2019s head office, catching on shelves stacked with old ledgers, rare coins and brittle newsletters. Sitting amid these treasures, Dr. Nimal D. Rathnayake \u2013 senior banker, researcher and self-styled custodian of the island\u2019s financial memory \u2013 looks more like a historian than a man who signs off on billion-rupee transactions.",
    "\u201cBanks are the backbone of the Sri Lankan financial system,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cThey provide liquidity to the economy and reshape the risk profile of assets.\u201d",
    "He speaks with the easy authority of someone who has spent decades both practising and studying the craft. Over a long conversation he takes me from ancient monasteries to fintech start-ups, tracing how Sri Lankans have saved, lent and transacted for two millennia.",
    "In the beginning there were no banks \u2013 just barter. \u201cTrade was mostly goods for goods,\u201d Dr. Rathnayake explains. \u201cOver time, coins like the Kahapana appeared between the 3rd century B.C. and the 1st century A.D.\u201d Gold doubled as currency and a store of wealth.",
    "Even then, people looked for places to keep their surplus. Buddhist monasteries, under the Niyamatana system, stepped into that role. \u201cThey accepted deposits of grain, pulses and currency, lending them out at interest to fund religious life and community welfare,\u201d he says. Long before the word \u201cbank\u201d entered Sinhala, the idea of trusted intermediaries was already here.",
    "With the arrival of the Portuguese and later the Dutch, European concepts of finance began to filter in. Dr. Rathnayake shows me a print of the Bank van de VOC \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s first formal bank, established in Colombo in 1743 by the Dutch East India Company. \u201cIt was set up to handle trade finance,\u201d he says. By 1785, the island had its first printed banknotes, denominated from one to ten Pathaga.",
    "The earliest unit of currency known in Sri Lanka is referred to as a \u2018Kahapana",
    "Then came the British era, and with it a surge of institutions whose names still echo today. Bank of Ceylon (1841), Western Bank of India (1843), Oriental Bank Corporation (1851), Mercantile Bank of India (1854), Hatton Bank (1888, now HNB), HSBC and Chartered Bank (1892). \u201cThis was the foundation of the modern system,\u201d he notes. British banks financed tea, rubber and coffee exports; their cheques and ledgers underpinned colonial commerce.",
    "Independence brought a new centre of gravity. \u201cThe Currency Board gave way to the Central Bank of Ceylon in 1950 under the Monetary Law Act,\u201d Dr. Rathnayake recalls. \u201cMr. N. U. Jayawardena became the first Sri Lankan governor in 1953.\u201d",
    "For him, that shift marks the birth of a truly national monetary authority with an active policy role. He still remembers the shock of the 1996 bomb attack on the bank\u2019s York Street headquarters. \u201cIt was a blow not just to a building but to the confidence of the sector,\u201d he says quietly.",
    "Fast-forward to the present. Sri Lanka\u2019s banking sector now counts 24 licensed commercial banks and six licensed specialised banks. For decades only three British, three Indian and one Pakistani bank operated here; liberalisation in 1979 opened the doors to American and European institutions \u2014 Citibank, Bank of America, Banque Indosuez, European Asian Bank, Chase Manhattan, Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank and others.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve moved from a club of a few banks to a diverse landscape of local and international players,\u201d Dr. Rathnayake explains. \u201cBut the biggest change isn\u2019t the numbers; it\u2019s technology.\u201d",
    "\u201cDigital transformation is inevitable,\u201d he warns. \u201cBut Sri Lanka still has only about 12.4 million internet users out of 23.2 million people. We need the right mix of physical and digital.\u201d",
    "He ticks off the trends he\u2019s watching: mobile-first services, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, blockchain, fintech partnerships. \u201cBranch networks and large workforces will inevitably shrink,\u201d he says. \u201cBanks and staff must prepare early. Collaborating with fintechs and strengthening cybersecurity will be key.\u201d",
    "Paperless and green banking, he adds, are not just buzzwords but necessary shifts. \u201cThe financial landscape is changing rapidly, necessitating greater innovation from banks. But amidst all these changes, the importance of trust remains constant.\u201d",
    "As our conversation winds down, Dr. Rathnayake runs his fingers over an old copper coin on his desk. It\u2019s a quiet reminder that Sri Lanka\u2019s banking culture has always been in motion \u2014 from barter to coins to banknotes to mobile apps.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve adapted before,\u201d he smiles. \u201cWe can do it again \u2013 but only if we balance innovation with inclusivity and trust. The past shows us that banking succeeds when it\u2019s woven into the fabric of society, not imposed from above.\u201d",
    "He hopes more young bankers will study history. \u201cKnowing how we got here makes it easier to see where we\u2019re going,\u201d he says.",
    "3rd century B.C.\u20131st century A.D. \u2013 Kahapana coins in circulation; Buddhist monasteries act as financial institutions.",
    "1743 \u2013 Bank van de VOC established in Colombo by the Dutch East India Company.",
    "1841 onwards \u2013 Surge of banks under British rule \u2013 Bank of Ceylon, Hatton Bank, HSBC and others.",
    "1950 \u2013 Central Bank of Ceylon established, replacing the Currency Board.",
    "2025 \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s banks balance digital transformation with physical presence as internet penetration grows.",
    "Dr. Rathnayake\u2019s blend of scholarship and frontline experience makes his message clear: Sri Lanka\u2019s banking sector has always adapted to change \u2014 and must do so again, balancing digital innovation with inclusivity and trust. The coins, ledgers and memories in his office are not just relics of the past but signposts for a future where banking, once again, becomes a bridge between people and progress.",
