    "The Grammy Awards were much in the news, in our scene, the past few weeks, and that was mainly because our artistes were seeking CONSIDERATION for a Grammy Award.",
    "Those who are not familiar with the criteria for nomination got the impression that submitting an entry for consideration is a great achievement, and there were congratulatory messages on social media.",
    "One must remember that an entry that has been submitted for consideration is sent to the members of the Recording Academy, assuming that particular entry meets the criteria, to be voted on.",
    "Being Grammy-nominated is a PRESTIGIOUS ACHIEVEMENT, but simply seeking consideration is NOT, and we were seeking consideration for Best Global Music Album.",
    "Well, the nominees for Grammy Awards 2025 were announced last Friday, 8th November, 2024, and Sri Lanka is missing from that list.",
    "Best Global Music Album brought into the spotlight the following:",
    "Beyonc\u00e9 added to her all-time record number of Grammy nominations with 11, for the 67th Grammy Awards, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli XCX and Billie Eilish with seven nods each.",
    "Beyonc\u00e9 now has a career total of 99 Grammy nominations \u2013 more than any other artiste \u2013 but she\u2019s not yet won the Recording Academy\u2019s top prize, Album of the Year. Who knows, we may see her do it this time!",
    "The winners of Grammy Awards 2025 will be revealed at the event in Los Angeles, on 2nd February, 2025.",
    "Yes, Sri Lanka did have a Grammy Award winner, and that was in 2014.",
    "Hussain Jiffry won the prestigious Grammy Award as a member of the Herb Alpert Quintet. They won the Best Pop Instrumental Album Award for their album \u2018Steppin\u2019 Out.\u2019",
    "For the record, the renowned bassist, who is now based in LA, in the States, has performed with many artistes, including Sergio Mendes, Al McKay, Yanni, Dave Weckl Band, and Herb Alpert, and is said to be one of the most sought-after bassists in LA.",
