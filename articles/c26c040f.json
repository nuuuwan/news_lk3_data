    "The Israeli army said Wednesday that it struck near the entrance to the Syrian Ministry of Defense in Damascus.",
    "The strike came as clashes continued in the southern Syrian city of Sweida after a ceasefire between government forces and Druze armed groups collapsed.",
    "Israel has launched a series of airstrikes on convoys of government forces since the clashes erupted, saying that it is acting to protect the Druze.",
    "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
    "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
    "Clashes raged in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Wednesday after a ceasefire between government forces and Druze armed groups collapsed and Israel threatened to escalate its involvement in support of the Druze religious minority.",
    "Syria\u2019s Defense Ministry blamed militias in Sweida for violating a ceasefire agreement that had been reached Tuesday, causing Syrian army soldiers to return fire and continue military operations in the Druze-majority province.",
    "\u201cMilitary forces continue to respond to the source of fire inside the city of Sweida, while adhering to rules of engagement to protect residents, prevent harm, and ensure the safe return of those who left the city back to their homes,\u201d the statement said.",
    "A rebel offensive led by Islamist insurgent groups ousted Syria\u2019s longtime despotic leader, Bashar Assad, in December, bringing an end to a nearly 14-year civil war. Since then, the country\u2019s new rulers have struggled to consolidate control over the territory.",
    "The primarily Sunni Muslim leaders have faced suspicion from religious and ethnic minorities. The fears of minorities increased after clashes between government forces and pro-Assad armed groups in March spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks in which hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad belongs, were killed.",
    "The latest escalation in Syria began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze armed factions in the southern province, a center of the Druze community. Government forces that intervened to restore order have also clashed with the Druze, while reports have surfaced of members of the security forces carrying out extrajudicial killings, looting and burning civilian homes.",
    "No official casualty figures have been released since Monday, when the Syrian Interior Ministry said 30 people had been killed. The U.K.-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 250 people had been killed as of Wednesday morning, including four children, five women and 138 soldiers and security forces.",
    "The observatory said at least 21 people were killed in \u201cfield executions.\u201d",
    "Israel has launched a series of airstrikes on convoys of government forces since the clashes erupted, saying that it is acting to protect the Druze.",
    "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
    "In Israel, the Druze are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the military. In Syria, the Druze have been divided over how to deal with the country\u2019s new leaders, with some advocating for integrating into the new system while others have remained suspicious of the authorities in Damascus and pushed for an autonomous Druze region.",
    "On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the Israeli army \u201cwill continue to attack regime forces until they withdraw from the area \u2014 and will also soon raise the bar of responses against the regime if the message is not understood.\u201d",
    "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday night that Israel has \u201ca commitment to preserve the southwestern region of Syria as a demilitarized area on Israel\u2019s border\u201d and has \u201can obligation to safeguard the Druze locals.\u201d",
    "Israel has taken an aggressive stance toward Syria\u2019s new leaders since Assad\u2019s fall, saying it doesn\u2019t want Islamist militants near its borders. Israeli forces have seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory along the border with the Golan Heights and launched hundreds of airstrikes on military sites in Syria."
