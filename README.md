### සේවක අයිතීන් වෙනුවෙන් ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාවෙන් අලුත් නීතියක්

*2024-08-26 13:03:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/200343) · `si`

ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාවේ අද (26) සිට ක්‍රියාත්මක වන පරිදි "right to disconnect" "විසන්ධි කිරීමේ අයිතිය" යන නීතිය හඳුන්වා දී තිබේ.

එම නව නීතිය තුළින් සේවකයින්ට රාජකාරි වෙලාවෙන් පසු රැකියාවට අදාළ කෙටි පණිවුඩ, දුරකථන ඇමතුම් සහ ඊමේල් පණිවුඩ නොසලකා හැරීමට සහ ප්‍රතිචාර නොදක්වා සිටීමට ඉඩ ප්‍රස්ථාව හිමිව ඇත.

ඒ සඳහා ආයතන ප්‍රධානීන්ට කිසිදු දඬුවමක් කළ නොහැකි බව ද විදෙස් මාධ්‍ය වාර්තා කර තිබේ.

ඔස්ට්‍රේලියානු රජය සඳහන් කර ඇත්තේ, සේවකයින්ට සිය පෞද්ගලික ජීවිතයට රැකියාවෙන් සිදුවන හානිය වළක්වාගැනීම සඳහා මෙම නීතිය හඳුන්වා දුන් බවය.

මෙම නව නීතිය කඩවීමක් සිදුවුවහොත් ඒ සඳහා වරදකරු වන ආයතන ප්‍රධානියෙකුට හෝ සමාගමකට ඔස්ට්‍රේලියානු ඩොලර් 93,900ක් දක්වා දඩයකට යටත්වීමට සිදුවන බවද විදෙස් වාර්තා සඳහන් කරයි.

ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාවට අමතරව මීට පෙර සිටම තවත් යුරෝපයේ රටවල් 20ක පමණ මෙම නීතිය අනුගමනය කරන බවද වාර්තා වේ.

COVID-19 වසංගතයෙන් පසු ඩිජිටල් සන්නිවේදනය සහ දුරස්ථව වැඩකිරීම වර්ධනය වීම මධ්‍යයේ මිනිසුන්ගේ වෘත්තීය සහ පුද්ගලික ජීවිත අතර සීමාවන් බිඳ දමා ඇති බව ඔස්ට්‍රේලියානු රජය පෙන්වා දී තිබේ.

### Australian employees now have the right to ignore work emails, calls after hours

*2024-08-26 12:20:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101513/australian-employees-now-have-the-right-to-ignore-work-emails-calls-after-hours) · `en`

Australian employees can now ignore work emails and calls thanks to a new “right to disconnect” law designed to curb those and other intrusions into personal lives.

The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.

Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.

“Before we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day,” said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.

“Now, globally it’s the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday.”

### Israel and Hezbollah in major missile exchange as escalation fears grow

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel’s military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv.

Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah’s backer Iran and Israel’s main ally the United States.

As long as the people keep asking for giveaways as against conditions for life improvement, the takaran era will not end – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

It is because of this increased literacy that people are asking politicians making promises to also state how the money will be found. The politician who some time back promised to zero out VAT, has now retreated to saying that VAT will be removed for educational and healthcare services (leaving aside the fact that most of these services are already exempt from VAT). Even then, he is being challenged to explain how the shortfall is going to be covered

“We all know what to do, but we don’t know how to get re-elected once we have done it” ― Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg 1995-2013

Handing out roofing sheets used to be a thing in Sri Lankan elections. It was thought that giving tangible things to people would motivate them to vote for the giver. Now we use the term metaphorically, hopefully.

New research by Sri Lanka’s universities and research institutions should cover research in all the three major sectors of the economy, agriculture, industry and services – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

A country interested in creating a creative economy should put all the four essential ground conditions in place if it is to succeed in its attempt. First, knowledge must be created by its universities and research institutions. Then, such knowledge should be made available to prospective entrepreneurs for use in commercially viable productions known as innovation. Once the initial entrepreneurs become successful, that knowledge, both invention and innovation, should be disseminated or diffused across the economy to facilitate others to imitate the original inventors and innovators

### Beyond red tape: How digitalisation can save Sri Lanka’s economy

*2024-08-25 23:06:00* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Beyond-red-tape-How-digitalisation-can-save-Sri-Lanka-s-economy/14-765952) · `en`

In the high-stakes world of trade and logistics, corruption at Sri Lanka’s customs, IRD, ports, and airports is not just an inconvenience—it’s a crisis that’s crippling the nation’s export sector. Outdated, manual systems have become breeding grounds for corruption, where bribery and inefficiency rule, bleeding exporters dry and stifling economic growth. The country stands at a critical juncture, where the only viable path forward is the digitalisation of customs and trade operations.

These antiquated, paper-based customs processes are no match for the demands of the modern global economy, where speed, accuracy, and transparency are paramount. Instead, they are plagued by errors, deliberate delays, and a lack of accountability, allowing corrupt practices to thrive unchecked. As global trade standards become stricter, the need for transparent, secure, and efficient customs operations has never been more urgent.
