    "Not quite The Charge of the Light Brigade that the English Poet Tennyson wrote during the Crimean war, but Sri Lankan voters have not cannons but candidates to the right of them, candidates to the left of them, candidates in front of them, and even to the back of them. With 38 candidates officially running in the election, there are enough to surround the voters from all directions.",
    "Out of the 38 only three are expected to perform significantly and at least keep their deposits. They are to the left (AKD), right (RW) and centre (SP), and each one of them is making a distinct pitch to attract voter attention. This week saw AKD and the NPP going first with the release of their Manifesto simultaneously in Sinhala and Tamil on Monday. The Independent Ranil Wickremesinghe followed suit on Thursday, but only in Sinhalese with an executive summary in English. Sajith Premadasa rushed in with his own the same day, but it was a limited edition for the Prelates of the Sangha; the more public version is not expected for almost a week on September 4.",
    "Pictures do tell political stories. The two pictures juxtaposed above are from 2019 and 2024 and they illustrate the NPP\u2019s spectacular rise under Anura Kumara Dissanayake \u2013 from the deposit losing 3% in 2019 to being a real contender for power in 2024. Pundits are lining up behind the three candidates and are using punditry to promote their favourite candidate. Yet there does not seem to be a corresponding effort to discern the voters and locate the candidates relative to the different segments that make up the voting public.",
    "The veteran columnist Kusal Perera rhetorically asks the question \u201cWhom should I vote for this presidential election?\u201d (Financial Times, 28 August 2024), and finds none of the three leading candidates eligible for his vote. Similar to the majority of respondents in the CPA survey that I cited last week. Mr. Perera lists the known infamies of Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa who are both cut from the same UNP cloth, but at its extreme social ends. In addition, Mr. Perera lists quite a few surprising charges against Anura Kumara Dissanayake and traces them to the JVP\u2019s past.",
    "An interesting but lost nugget that Mr. Perera resurrects is the alleged cahooting between the JVP and the Indian High Commission in Colombo to undermine the Ranil-Norway peace process two decades ago. It was widely known that then President Kumaratunga got India\u2019s imprimatur before pulling the rug under the Wickremesinghe government in October 2003, and upending the peace process. But the JVP\u2019s implication is not so widely known. Much blood, water and draught have come and gone since, but its significance today is the possibility that for all its anti-Indian rhetoric the JVP would seem to have had parallel ties with the Indian establishment. And going farther back in time than the much publicized formal visit of Anura Kumara Dissanayake to New Delhi last year to meet with Modi\u2019s mandarins.",
    "There may be others like Kusal Perara who may choose not to vote or spoil their ballot at the booth. But that is not going to stop the election being completed and a new president elected, likely with less than 40% of the total votes in the election. There are rumours and concerns that Ranil Wickremesinghe might play yet another trick to thwart a conclusive election outcome. His decision to supply MPs with repeater shotguns and his gazette extraordinaire for the armed forces to be at the ready to maintain public order, look weird and they sure feed the rumour mill.",
    "But Anura Kumara Dissanayake has dismissed any threat to the elections due to Ranil playing tricks, and has confidently predicted that the NPP will be forming a new government. He has also asserted that Mr. Wickremesinghe will not be able to do anything about it because the government servants, the police and the army including retired veterans are all supporting the NPP. It would have been far better if Mr. Dissanayake had called on the government servants, the police and the armed forces to stand neutral and do their job impartially instead of tagging all or most of them as JVP/NPP supporters.",
    "Just days before the 1977 election, then UNP leader JR Jayewardene gave a public warning to public officials and the police (the army was hardly involved in election security those days) that they should not follow undue directions from higher ups that were intended to bolster the outgoing (SLFP) government. If they could not rebuff bad orders, JRJ said, they should go on leave and return after the election with the new (UNP) government in power.",
    "Mr. Dissanayake could and should have made a statement like JRJ instead of claiming that vital parts of the government are already a part of his campaign. That somewhat undermines his sweeping thesis that he is the pre-eminent change candidate who will undo all the misdoings of the past 76 years. At the same time, the NPP leader if elected president should refrain from doing what JRJ did after becoming Prime Minister and then President in 1977/78. JRJ went on to preside over the politicization of the state apparatus like never before. Nothing has been the same since.",
    "Fast forward to 2024, all three candidates are crisscrossing the country holding rallies and making speeches, but no one knows for sure who is in the lead and who is behind. Through the very questionable polls, self-promotional assertions, special pleading by pundits and weighted gossip, what seems to average out is that of the three main candidates \u2013 Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa are jostling between the first and second positions, and Ranil Wickremesinghe is behind in third \u2013 but \u201csurging,\u201d whatever that means. There is an old saying \u2013 if you are drowning, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a foot or a furlong under water. But surging under water is a new metaphor.",
    "With only three weeks to go before the election, the campaign is entering a new phase with the releasing of the manifestos. But manifestos by themselves are unlikely to change the directions in which the voters seem to be leaning already. AKD and the NPP have been releasing manifestos for quite some time. In a sense, they are the most consistent callers for change; their manifesto is both a continuity and evolution from 2019, and the follow up in February 2022. Their electoral progression was interrupted by Ranil Wickremesinghe when he executively denied funds for the local government elections disregarding even the Supreme Court\u2019s order.",
    "Now Ranil Wickremesinghe is the continuity candidate, but his campaign seems hopelessly top heavy. He has the largest number of \u2018agents\u2019 \u2013 all Ministers appointed by him and MPs who depend on him for their pension. The images of RW and his entourage bring back memories of MR 1 (duly blessed by MR 2) and his entourage before the January 8 election in 2015. They looked on the way out rather than staying put. What is it going to be for RW now?",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe is also trying out alternative slogans, like Donald Trump in the US. He first got 34 parties to sign on to the slogan, Puluwan Sri Lanka, in a Battaramulla ceremony, a play on Barak Obama\u2019s \u201cYes, we can\u201d mantra. That was supposed to be the title of his election manifesto. But the slogan did not catch on, and so the manifesto was released on Thursday with a different title: \u201cFive Years of Winning the Country with Ranil.\u201d Its \u201cprincipal components,\u201d the five precepts, speak for themselves: \u201cTheravada Trade Economy,\u201d \u201cOperation \u2013 Beyond 2025,\u201d \u201cMake a Radiant Society,\u201d \u201cWin the Motherland,\u201d and \u201cUnite Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Sajith Premadasa is in the middle and is in contention. The manifesto release in two editions and a week apart may have been a slip up. He is found to be appealing by those on the right who are frustrated with Ranil Wickremesinghe, and those in the middle who find Anura Kumara Dissanayake a little too far to the left. There are others who find commonalities between Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake; those on the right find the commonalities to be alarming, and those on the left use them to call Sajith Premadasa a progressive.",
    "Interestingly, and hopefully consequentially, both Premadasa and Dissanayake are committed to ending the executive presidential system and returning to a parliamentary system that will have a Head of State elected by the people\u2019s representatives. Ranil Wickremesinghe is silent on the matter. His main mantra is the IMF and the irrevocability of the Agreement he reached with the IMF. But he should know that any agreement can be renegotiated without revocation, especially after a national election. And the election is not a referendum on the IMF Agreement.",
    "The presidential election is not going to be conclusive in itself without an immediately following parliamentary election. Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only candidate who would be inclined to keep the current parliament going as long as it could. And, if elected, he will. Premadasa and Dissanayake, on the other hand, are likely to dissolve the current parliament and go for a parliamentary election as soon as possible.",
    "At the same time, the transition from the presidential election to the election of a new parliament will be an uncharted period for the country in the event of a Premadasa victory or, perhaps more so, a Dissanayake victory and the NPP reduced from three to two MPs in parliament. Not that the bridging challenges during a transitional period cannot be identified or addressed. But they need to be acknowledged in advance by the candidates and articulated as part of their current campaign. That will also add to the validity of their claim that they can be trusted with power.",
