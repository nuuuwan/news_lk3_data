    "A tense situation has been reported in front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party\u2019s Headquarters on Darley Road in Colombo 10, following the arrival of MP Dayasiri Jayasekara.",
    "However, MP Jayasekara had claimed that he will recommence duties in the post of General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) this morning (05).",
    "Meanwhile, he also alleged that he is still the legitimate General Secretary of the party.",
    "Accordingly, Jayasekara had extended an open invitation to party members and supporters to participate in the event of his resumption of official duties.",
    "Against this backdrop, the SLFP\u2019s Senior Vice Chairman Prof. Rohana Luxman Piyadasa had stated that they will accept MP Dayasiri Jayasekara as the SLFP\u2019s General Secretary.",
    "He further stated that a candidate from the SLFP will be nominated for the upcoming Presidential Election.",

    "On Tuesday (02), the Colombo District Court issued an interim order against the SLFP\u2019s decision to expel MP Dayasiri Jayasekara from party membership and the post of General Secretary. Jayasekara, who was the former General Secretary of the SLFP, had sought an order revoking the decisions taken by the party to oust him from the position he held within the party.",
    "Jayasekara had filed the complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the party\u2019s General Secretary and a letter directed by the party\u2019s then chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself.",
    "On September 05, 2023, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara was ousted from the SLFP with immediate effect and he was stripped of his position as the party\u2019s general secretary.",
    "The then SLFP chairman, former President Maithripala Sirisena communicated this to MP Jayasekara in a letter, adding that a disciplinary inquiry would also be initiated against the parliamentarian pursuant to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution.",
    "However, addressing concerns pertaining to MP Jayasekara\u2019s removal, former President Sirisena had stated that the party membership was only temporarily suspended.",
    "He further asserted that the SLFP was ready to accept the MP as a party member, or any other title he may wish to hold within the part, except that of the SLFP General Secretary."
