### Sri Lanka moves to enable overseas citizens to vote

*2025-09-17 06:34:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Sri-Lanka-moves-to-enable-overseas-citizens-to-vote/56-781792) · `en`

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the formation of a committee to explore legal amendments and formulate new laws that would allow Sri Lankans living abroad to participate in national elections.

Under the current Sri Lankan Constitution, the right to vote is limited to citizens residing within the country who are registered on the electoral roll. No existing law provides a mechanism for overseas citizens to vote. Recognising this gap, the Cabinet has tasked the Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Governments Minister with appointing a committee to examine the legal framework necessary to safeguard the voting rights of citizens living overseas.

Several Asian countries, including India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, have already implemented legal strategies to enable overseas voting, and experts consider such reforms in Sri Lanka both timely and necessary.

The study will focus on developing a sustainable solution to improve connectivity with the city’s main corridors, while addressing bottlenecks at the Lotus Roundabout.

“The Lotus Road roundabout area in Colombo has turned out to be a high traffic congestion place, especially during peak hours and it has been observed that this has led to traffic congestion in the urban transport network,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said it has been found that this issue will be further aggravated with the completion of the Colombo Port City and the Port Access Road, and the completion of major development works currently underway in the capital.

### Govt. denies plans to list State banks on Colombo Stock Exchange

*2025-09-17 06:32:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Govt-denies-plans-to-list-State-banks-on-Colombo-Stock-Exchange/56-781789) · `en`

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday dismissed speculation that the Government intends to list the two main State banks on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), calling such claims “just rumours.”

“The matter was not taken up at the Monday Cabinet meeting, which means it was not discussed. The rumours were just rumours,” he clarified at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing.

The comments come in response to claims by the trade unions of the two State banks, who alleged that 20% of the banks’ shares would be listed on the CSE and expressed concerns over potential moves to privatise the institutions. The unions also raised several other issues related to employee welfare and management decisions.

Dr. Jayatissa reassured that the Government has no plans to privatise or list the State-owned banks.

### Consultation conundrum: How ‘people friendly’ is the Government?

*2025-09-17 06:20:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Consultation-conundrum-How-people-friendly-is-the-Government/4-781782) · `en`

If the current Government is to be true to its claim it is a people’s government, it must consult stakeholders in a transparent and inclusive manner

In August 2025, the Government issued a public notice calling for submissions from the public and local and international media on amendments to the Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024 (OSA). In May 2025, the Government issued a similar public call for comments and recommendations on repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). These are positive steps. However, although the Government called for public submissions, there has been no dialogue to date with those that made submissions regarding the PTA. For instance, my submission on the PTA was not even officially acknowledged. The Government’s good intentions notwithstanding, if consultations are not inclusive and meaningful, they will be viewed as a ticking the box exercise.

### Kithul’s revival: Blending tradition, wellness and export potential

*2025-09-17 06:07:16* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Kithul-s-revival-Blending-tradition-wellness-and-export-potential/4-781780) · `en`

Despite its deep roots and unique value, the kithul industry in Sri Lanka remains largely informal and under-developed

In a world increasingly seeking natural, healthy alternatives and sustainable food sources, kithul, a traditional Sri Lankan sweetener is poised to capture international attention. Derived from the sap of Caryota Urens palm, (commonly known as the fishtail palm), kithul has long held a revered place in Sri Lankan culture, economy and traditional medicine. But beyond its domestic role, kithul holds untapped potential in the international marketplace, particularly as a natural sweetener aligned with wellness trends and sustainability.

### Designed for control: Digital infrastructure and public

While they hasten to develop cutting-edge systems, governments and contractors need to be more transparent about how those arrangements are structured

Across the Global South, Digital Public Infrastructure is being sold as a leap forward for inclusion and modern governance. But as Pamodi Waravita reveals, these systems often deepen exclusion, entrench surveillance, and blur the line between public good and private control.

Scan your face using a Government-approved app or press your finger to a biometric reader to collect welfare payment, enrol your child in school, access a public health scheme or retrieve land records — all within seconds. On paper, it sounds like a digital utopia, especially across Asia and the Global South, where public services are often slow, opaque or out of reach.

### Rewiring for growth: How Government and fintechs can power Sri Lanka’s digital revival

When banks, fintechs, and telecom networks interoperate, citizens can pay, save, borrow, and receive Government benefits and services on any compliant platform

The world economy is entering a new phase, with growth and innovation increasingly driven by Asia’s rising economic powerhouses and by global waves of technological disruption. For Sri Lanka, a nation whose economy remains anchored in agriculture and whose export markets are still concentrated in Europe and America, this transition presents critical challenges but also unprecedented opportunities. To find our place in this changing order, we must embrace innovation as the pathway to resilience, competitiveness, and inclusion.

### UN inquiry finds Israel committing genocide in Gaza

*2025-09-17 05:44:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/UN-inquiry-finds-Israel-committing-genocide-in-Gaza/56-781773) · `en`

A United Nations Commission of Inquiry says Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

A new report says there are reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out since the start of the war with Hamas in 2023: killing members of a group, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to destroy the group, and preventing births, the BBC reports.

It cites statements by Israeli leaders, and the pattern of conduct by Israeli forces, as evidence of genocidal intent.

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

At least 64,905 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry.
