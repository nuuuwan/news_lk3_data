    "Screening of women for early detection of breast cancer in Sri Lanka received a major boost with the recent gifting and commissioning of the latest, state of the art Digital Mammography system valued at over Rs 100m.The equipment was a gift from the Rotary Club of Colombo, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s premier and oldest clubs, in partnership with Rotary International District 3640, Seoul, Korea.",
    "Today , breast cancer is on the rise with an incidence of over 5000 cases annually, with many in the late stages of cancer . Breast cancer accounts for over 25% of all cancers and is the leading cause of death in females in the 40-55 age group. This new Digital machine which replaces the previous analog machine, will now enable the confirmation of diagnosis , and expedite the screening and early detection process whilst ensuring greater accuracy and efficiency, and being able to detect around 20- 80% more invasive cancers as well. It\u2019s a big break- through for cancer early detection in Sri Lanka.",
    "The machine will be located at the Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Centre in Narahenpita. Rotary\u2019s landmark project to screen women free of charge goes back almost 20 years. Over this period over 80,000 women have been screened free of charge, and several non conformities detected at an early stage when it is very treatable. Rotary works in close partnership with the National Cancer Control Programme of the Ministry of Health. Together they have greatly succeeded in bringing down the rising incidence of breast cancer, through screening and early detection.",
