### Sri LankaтАЩs SMEs: Debt-trapped dilemma

A substantial portion of Sri Lankan SMEs, approximately 70%, are currently insolvent or teetering on the brink of bankruptcy

A cornerstone of successful debt recovery lies in preserving the businessтАЩs operational viability rather than resorting to liquidation. Many debt restructuring solutions fall short by neglecting the critical aspect of cash flow matching, which is fundamental to servicing debt obligations. By strategically realigning assets based on their utilisation, it is possible to strike a balance between debt recovery and cash generation, fostering a more sustainable recovery process

The path to prosperity of Sri Lanka starts from political stability to enable it to attract mainly FDI as it lacks the capital, skills, technologies and the required international market access to start an export-led strategy of economic development to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty. In this strategy it is important to emphasise on promoting especially the productivity (of the private sector, (which has been described as the тАШthe engine of growthтАЩ) apart from upgrading the macroeconomic stability of the country and the international market access

Instead, the figures highlight a range of factors, including the fall of other southern Opposition political parties, leftist coalitions and paramilitary groups that allowed the NPP to siphon votes and grow their base amongst those who had already previously voted for pro-state forces.

Today is a special day in our Parliament. The authority was handed over to both groups. Our side has empowered the last presidential election. It is important in the history of Sri Lanka.Most MPs have been selected in our country's electoral system. All the provinces and people have contributed to it as the North and East.

Political parties have been formed on the basis of provinces, nationalism and religions for so long. So the separation, doubt and racism were strengthened between people. When racism is strengthened on one side, racism will be strengthened against it. Racism will not be in the same place. We have seen the history of it in our country, politics and society. But we thank all the people who believe in us.

There are people who believe in other parties without trusting us. That is democracy. It is not democratic to create people's activities surrounding a single party.
