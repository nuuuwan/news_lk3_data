    "Sri Lanka\u2019s coconut industry faces a critical production gap, yielding only 3,000 million nuts annually against a national demand of 4,500 million. To tackle this, CBL Global Foods is deploying a SMART agriculture package comprising drip irrigation, balanced nutrition programs, and intercropping systems. These interventions are designed to rapidly enhance yields, with an ambitious goal to double productivity to 15,000 nuts per hectare within three years.",
    "The project targets farmers in Sri Lanka\u2019s North-Western, North-Central, and Northern provinces, regions poised to become the country\u2019s second \u201ccoconut triangle.\u201d This initiative not only promises increased yields but also provides direct market access, fair pricing, and financial support through supply chain financing, ensuring timely payments to farmers.",
    "\u201cWe are excited to partner with USAID on this transformative journey. At CBL Global Foods, we believe in empowering small and medium-scale coconut farmers with innovative tools and technology, which will significantly uplift their productivity and livelihoods,\u201d Randeewa Malalasooriya, Chief Executive Officer of CBL Global Foods Limited said.",
