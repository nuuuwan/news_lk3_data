    "Commonwealth observers, working across various teams, have reported to their posts across all nine provinces in Sri Lanka, ahead of the country\u2019s presidential election on 21 September 2024, a statement said.",
    "The teams have been deployed to; Central, Eastern, North Central, Northern, Northwestern, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva and Western and will be observing pre-poll arrangements in the run up to election day.",
    "The teams will be present when voting begins at 7am, and will observe the process until the polls close at 4 pm. As is customary, they will then observe the counting of votes and the tabulation of results.",
    "Commonwealth Observer Group Chairperson, former President of Seychelles, HE Danny Faure, who is following the process from Colombo, has also been observing pre-poll arrangements and has scouted a number of polling stations to which he will return on election day. He will be at the St Thomas Prep School station to observe as the first votes are cast.",
    "\u201cWe recognise the significance of this election because Sri Lankans have been given the first opportunity to vote since the Aragalaya movement in 2022. Our presence here demonstrates the Commonwealth\u2019s commitment to democratic values and principles. We are here because democracy is one of the Commonwealth\u2019s cornerstones, and the foundation for vibrant, healthy, and prosperous societies, and most importantly we are here for the People of Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "This is the Commonwealth\u2019s 200th election observation, and the sixth in Sri Lanka since 2005, demonstrating the Commonwealth\u2019s systematic effort to strengthen the process, culture, and institutions of democracy across its member countries,\u201d he said.",
    "13,421 polling centres have been set up across the country forover 17 million registered voters and they will choose among 38 presidential candidates, including the incumbent, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. The 38 presidential candidates represent the largest ever such pool in the history of the country.",
    "Sri Lanka is preparing for its presidential election on September 21, with over 17 million citizens, including first-time voter Dilushi, set to participate. She believes the Commonwealth\u2019s presence is crucial. The election also coincides with International Peace Day, emphasising the importance of peaceful voting.",
    "Of the registered voters, more than 700 thousand Sri Lankans qualify for advance voting - referred to as postal voting, the purpose of which is to allow eligible voters who cannot vote in person on election day to cast their ballots. The Commonwealth Observer Group support team, already on the ground in Colombo, witnessed the opening and closing of advance voting in the run-up to election day.",
    "The President of Sri Lanka is elected using a preferential voting system, whereby voters can rank up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the total valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the top two are eliminated, and the candidate with the most overall votes in the second round of counting is then declared the winner.",
    "Following its observations, the Commonwealth Observer Group will share its findings through a preliminary statement on 23 September, 2024, the statement added."
