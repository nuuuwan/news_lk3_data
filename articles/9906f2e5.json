    "Brotherless Night by V.V. Ganeshananthan wins the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction\u00a02024",
    "Brotherless Night is an unforgettable coming-of-age novel, an awakening from tribal loyalties into new-found identity and agency. It is set in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, during the\u00a0civil war\u00a0between Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhalese ethnic majority and the country\u2019s Tamil minority. Between 1983 and 2009, this bitter conflict resulted in the deaths of around 100,000 people and displaced approximately 800,000 more.",
    "The protagonist, Sashikala Kulenthiren, a young Tamil woman, is a teenager when the novel begins, walking apace with her brothers towards glittering university degrees. Theirs is a home filled with books, conversation, gardening. But her world changes when government atrocities and the call of militancy start disappearing boy after boy from the peninsula.",
    "Two of Sashi\u2019s brothers join the Tamil Tigers rebel army after their other sibling is killed in anti-Tamil riots. Sashi is seized by grief for her fallen and embattled brothers as they are swept up in bloody conflicts. Gradually, she finds strength in a women\u2019s collective which agitates, organises for themselves and treats hypermasculinity, instead of serving it.",
    "There has been a boom in recent years of fiction dealing with this historical moment. There is\u00a0Traitor\u00a0(2010) by the former child-soldier Shobasakthi, its anti-hero navigating the extremes of victim and predator. Anuk Arudpragasam\u2019s\u00a0The Story of a Brief Marriage\u00a0(2016) is set in a bombarded campsite in the final months of the civil war. In Shehan Karunatilaka\u2019s Booker prize-winning\u00a0The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida\u00a0(2022), the ghost of photojournalist Maali returns to his nightmarish old life in Colombo for closure.",
    "None of these novels, however, revisit what\u00a0Ganeshananthan calls\u00a0the \u201ccountry of grief\u201d to show how women suffer and survive. They don\u2019t touch on a \u201cterrified and empowered\u201d response such as Sashi\u2019s to the vacuum created by missing fathers, brainwashed brothers, or radicalised friends.",
    "Sashi\u2019s thoughts on civic participation and collective responsibility revolve around two institutions responsible for democratic society\u2019s self-governance and health \u2013 the university and the hospital. As a medical student, Sashi ponders on the ethics of treating \u201cterrorists,\u201d including her brothers, in the Tigers\u2019 field clinic.",
    "The education Sashi receives from her professor, Anjali Premachandran, goes beyond anatomy lessons to an \u201cintense moral engagement\u201d with widening spheres of inquiry. Anjali is critical of Tamil militancy, a heroic stance in itself, and equally unafraid of confronting Sinhalese army officers for their misdeeds. In an insurgency, with the hospital and university in regress, Anjali teaches her wards the feminist right to dissent.",
    "Brotherless Night anatomises a separatist movement born of majoritarian (Sinhalese) rule and anti-Tamil pogroms in the post-independence period. It does so with escalating condemnation of its concerted violence. The Tamil Tigers had shown flagrant disregard for civilian safety in their operations. The novel shows us the sheer extent of that collateral damage.",
    "The Tigers had not only used innocent people as human shields but also destroyed the cohesion of communal life in Jaffna. Ganeshananthan writes about homes wrecked by the coercive recruiting of sons and daughters to the cause. She documents the brutal curtailing of any worldly ambition for the young cadres, a death sentence of sorts.",
    "The novel recounts the endless cycles of violence between military offensives and the Tigers. \u201cDaily we were haunted, not by ghosts but by the malevolent, unavoidable present,\u201d Sashi narrates. Brotherless Night mourns the ravaged bodies of women, caught in the power play between the Tigers, the soldiers, and the Indian peacekeeping force.",
    "Instead of separating reading and writing from the scene of violent action, Ganeshananthan champions the powerful role of literature in war zones. The act of reading situates Sashi in the structures of world history, creating new solidarities for her. Works such as Sri Lankan activist Kumari Jayawardena\u2019s\u00a0Feminism and Nationalism in the Third World\u00a0prove to be instrumental in galvanising a feminist movement in Jaffna as women read women in the book.",
    "Writing is a means of enduring war trauma at first. Over time, it aids real and imaginative witnessing, without which there can be no redress for atrocities.",
    "Sashi joins professor Anjali and her husband Varathan in preparing anonymous pamphlets with meticulously collected and verified facts on the conduct of war. \u201cNo sooner would we write something down than the Tigers and the Indians or the Sri Lankan Army would follow in our wake, trying to erase it,\u201d Sashi notes. In this process, she learns how to \u201ccollect the truth\u201d under surveillance and censorship.",
    "In her conjoined lives as healer and reporter, Sashi realises that pain is information, and that this can be weaponised, as in the case of the rape victim turned pregnant suicide bomber.",
    "Sashi\u2019s reports are a \u201cstream of information\u201d on the basis of which United Nations documents are written up, although they prompt no UN action. Despite this documentation of testimony and evidence, Brotherless Night is history-adjacent \u2013 not history, the narrator suggests. One may argue that, much like the research reports on war crimes, the novel is a unique tool of justice.",
    "Brotherless Night addresses the psychic devastation suffered by this minority ethnic group in Sri Lanka. It\u2019s an important read that goes some of the way to counteract the destruction of heritage implicit in acts such as the\u00a0burning of 97,000 volumes\u00a0in the Jaffna Library, a repository of Tamil literature and culture, by the Sinhalese thugs in 1981.",
