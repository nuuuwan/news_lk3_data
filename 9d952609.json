  "original_body_lines": [
    "United National Party (UNP) member and Presidential Advisor on Parliamentary Affairs, Ashu Marasinghe yesterday said media organisations that follow ethics need not be concerned about the proposed Broadcasting Authority Act and any possible repercussions under it.",
    "\u201cWhy fear? If the media engages in ethical practices no media organisation should be concerned. No harm will come to them,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOnly those who violate the laws of the country and media ethics should be worried,\u201d he added.",
    "Marasinghe also slammed critics that claim the new law will allow the licences of broadcasters to be suspended.",
    "\u201cMany claim the act will allow licences to be cancelled. But the critics have forgotten that the subject Minister is already empowered to cancel licences if required. But it does not happen,\u201d he said.",
    "Marasinghe also accused the mainstream media of broadcasting news that should not be topics of discussion in the country, going as far as calling the reports \u2018garbage\u2019."
