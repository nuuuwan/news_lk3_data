### Sri Lanka’s ambitious governance and macro-linked bonds explained

Sri Lanka’s restructuring of $12.55 billion in international bond debt is set to lead to the launch of a series of new, as-yet-untested instruments linked to economic growth and governance.

Observers say it is one of the most complex set of instruments ever arranged in a restructuring. The bonds aim to give the country additional debt relief if the economy falters and to encourage it to improve its governance.

The governance-linked bond (GLB) is the first of its kind and is designed to reward Sri Lanka for transparency and effective economic management by reducing the interest on its debt. To earn that reduction, Sri Lanka must meet targets, or key performance indicators (KPIs), seen as indicating better governance.

The first KPI demands that Sri Lanka exceed a baseline ratio set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for total revenue to GDP in both 2026 and 2027, which the Fund has projected at 15.3% and 15.4% respectively.

### Bolivia opens fuel imports in Sri Lanka-style move amid money printing

*2024-12-17 07:59:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/bolivia-opens-fuel-imports-in-sri-lanka-style-move-amid-money-printing-194564/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Bolivia has authorized 27 companies to import fuel, breaking the monopoly of state-run Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) media reports said, as fuel shortages and queues hit the country amid foreign exchange shortages.

“I went to the pump on Calle 35 in Chasquipampa and there was nothing, then to the one on Calle 21 in Los Pinos and there was none either,” a fuel user was quoted as saying by the publication El Diario.

In late November even worse queues and diesel and petroleum had bigger shortages, the newspaper said.

Bolivia was once a natural gas exporter and the YPFB was broken up and privatized under a rightwing president.

However, the domestic currency Boliviano collapsed from around 6.0 to the US dollar to 2,000 to 7.4 to the US dollar two years later as macroeconomists printed money.

In the inflation and stabilization crisis that followed, leftist President Eva Morales came to power amid public protests.

### Engaging civil society to further support education system in Sri Lanka

*2024-12-17 01:20:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Engaging-civil-society-to-further-support-education-system-in-Sri-Lanka/4-770600) · `en`

When reviewing civil society’s involvement in supporting the education system in Sri Lanka, we find that existing opportunities are minimum. It is not that civil society in Sri Lanka has not contributed – however given the vast potential for collaboration and partnership, impact has been limited, largely due to the ad hoc nature of interventions.

The role of civil society and contribution towards development cannot be undermined. Recently UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s remarks to the United Nations Civil Society Conference in support of the Summit of the Future on 14 May 2024, further reiterated the importance of this role: “Time and again, I have witnessed the enormous impact of civil society in every corner of the world. I see you easing suffering, pushing for peace and justice, mobilising for change.”

Organisational misalignment is the silent killer of a business’s effectiveness and prosperity

Achieving the level of organisational alignment needed to provide a competitive advantage is not an easy task in today’s fast-paced business environment. Businesses today are more complex than ever before. Market conditions and working environments are evolving at an accelerated pace, making it imperative for businesses to react and make decisions quickly. To respond successfully to change, organisations need a clear understanding of their processes, tools, and data and how they all fit together. If this does not happen effectively, an inevitable corollary is the formation of organisational silos

As Sri Lanka charts its path toward recovery and development, the public sector must evolve into a catalyst for progress rather than a constraint

Sri Lanka’s public sector has become a focal point of intense debate, reflecting its critical role in governance, service delivery, and employment. However, its inefficiencies, fiscal burdens, and disparities in resource allocation have come under sharp scrutiny amid escalating economic pressures. The expanding public workforce, while offering job security and supporting livelihoods, poses pressing challenges that demand urgent attention. Modernising and innovating this pivotal sector, along with ensuring fair and effective resource distribution, is essential to overcoming these hurdles and steering Sri Lanka toward sustainable development.

Adding insult to injury, during peak hours, these high-tech traffic lights are often switched off, with traffic police manually directing vehicles. This is not only a waste of investment but also doubles operational costs, as manpower replaces technology.
