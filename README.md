*2025-09-30 17:04:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226506) · `ta`

In Nuwara Eliya, sidewalk merchants have been trading on the streets for many generations, but the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Commissioner's move is accused of taking various measures to completely disrupt the livelihood of the sidewalk merchants.

In front of the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat on Tuesday (30), they expressed their support by carrying banners and chanting slogans against the actions of the Municipal Commissioner.

The protesters said that although various tourism development projects in Nuwara Eliya are being implemented through the current government, the action of the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council Commissioner is a barrier.

Similarly, the street merchants do not implement the Regulatory Act, creating massive disruption to our business.

Therefore, the new Municipal Commissioner who serves the public is that the city of Nuwara Eliya is moving towards development, as well as the corridor business order law.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankas inflation rose 1.5 percent in the 12-months to August and only 2.3 percent over 36 months, since the central bank’s deflationary policy started to show in the balance of payments, official data shows.

Sri Lanka’s economy grew 4.9 percent in second quarter of 2025, above growth projections by the International Monetary Fund, as the remarkably lower inflation and exchange rate stability.

The central bank has missed its high 5 percent inflation target lifting the customary the burden of inflation from hardworking families allowing annual salary hikes to be real, and making investment and construction costs predictable as it was before the central bank was created.

Sri Lanka’s inflation is also helped by better US monetary policy with commodity prices easing from around the second half of 2022 after the US hiked rates.

Better US policy has helped global inflation. The US has started cutting rates but slowly.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents appeared to make little progress at a White House meeting aimed at heading off a government shutdown that could disrupt a wide range of services as soon as Wednesday.

Both sides emerged from the meeting saying the other would be at fault if Congress fails to extend government funding beyond a Tuesday midnight deadline (0400 GMT Wednesday).

“I think we’re headed to a shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said.

Democrats say any agreement to extend that deadline must also preserve expiring health benefits, while Trump’s Republicans insist health and government funding must be dealt with as separate issues.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the two sides “have very large differences.”

Before detonating their vehicle in the southwestern city of Quetta, six attackers who were inside the car stepped outside and engaged troops in an intense shootout, police said.

People living in the area said the blast was so powerful it was heard from miles away.

Dozens were also wounded and taken to hospital after ambulances rushed to the site in front of the Frontier Constabulary.

No group immediately claimed responsibility, though suspicion will fall on separatist groups that often target civilians and security forces in insurgency-plagued Balochistan, where Quetta is the provincial capital.

Provincial health minister Bakhat Kakar said there were fears the number of people killed could rise.

Local television channels and CCTV footage from the site of the explosion shows a car stopping in front of the gate of the paramilitary compound.
