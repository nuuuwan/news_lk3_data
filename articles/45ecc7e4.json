  "original_body_lines": [
    "The United States intends to launch further strikes at Iran-backed groups in the Middle East, the White House national security adviser said on Sunday, after hitting Tehran-aligned factions in Iraq, Syria and Yemen over the last two days.",
    "The United States and Britain unleashed attacks against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, a day after the U.S. military hit Tehran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Jordan.",
    "\u201cWe intend to take additional strikes, and additional action, to continue to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked, when our people are killed,\u201d White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program on Sunday.",
    "The strikes are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting war.",
    "Tehran-backed groups declaring support for the Palestinians have entered the fray across the region: Hezbollah has fired at Israeli targets at the Lebanese-Israeli border, Iraqi militias have fired on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthis have fired on shipping in the Red Sea and at Israel itself.",
    "Iran has so far avoided any direct role in the conflict, even as it backs those groups. The Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either.",
    "Sullivan declined to be drawn on whether the United States might attack sites inside Iran, something the U.S. military has been very careful to avoid.",
    "Speaking to CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program moments earlier, he said Friday\u2019s strikes were \u201cthe beginning, not the end, of our response, and there will be more steps - some seen, some perhaps unseen\u201d.",
    "\u201cI would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign,\u201d he said.",
    "Saturday\u2019s strikes in Yemen hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations.",
    "The Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the strikes \u201cwill not pass without a response and consequences\u201d.",
    "Another Houthi spokesperson, Mohammed Abdulsalam, indicated the group would not be deterred, saying Yemen\u2019s decision to support Gaza would not be affected by any attack.",
    "Residents described being shaken by powerful blasts. \u201cThe building I live in shook,\u201d said Fatimah, a resident of Houthi-controlled Sanaa, adding that it had been years since she had felt such blasts in a country that has suffered years of war.",
    "The Yemen strikes are running parallel to the unfolding U.S. campaign of retaliation over the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on an outpost in Jordan.",
    "On Friday, the U.S. carried out the first wave of that retaliation, striking in Iraq and Syria more than 85 targets linked to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40.",
    "Mahjoob Zweiri, Director of the Gulf Studies Center at Qatar University, did not expect a change in Iran\u2019s approach even after the latest U.S. strikes.",
    "\u201cThey keep the enemy behind the borders, far away. They are not interested in any direct military confrontation which might lead to attacks on their cities or their homeland. They will maintain that status quo,\u201d he told Reuters.",
    "Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said the latest attacks on Yemen were \u201ca flagrant violation of international law by the United States and Britain\u201d, warning the continuation of such attacks was a \u201cworrying threat to international peace and security\u201d.",
    "Andreas Krieg, Associate Professor at King\u2019s College, London, noted that while U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria had marked an escalation in terms of their breadth and the amount of ordinance dropped, they had not hit targets in Iran or Iranians.",
    "\u201cThe US has stepped away from that, because it would have led to further escalation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we will see a response by these militias or by Iran on U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq, but that response will be measured as well,\u201d he said.",
    "U.S. Republicans have been putting pressure on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to deal a blow to Iran directly.",
    "While the Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians, the U.S. and its allies characterize them as indiscriminate and a menace to global trade.",
    "The U.S. has carried out more than a dozen strikes against Houthi targets in the past several weeks.",
    "Major shipping lines have largely abandoned Red Sea shipping lanes for longer routes around Africa. T",
    "his has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while denying Egypt crucial foreign revenue from use of the Suez Canal.",
    "Hundreds of people attended a Baghdad funeral procession for 17 members of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) killed in the strikes. The PMF is a state security force containing several Iran-backed armed groups.",
    "Hadi al-Ameri, a senior Iraqi politician close to Iran, said it was time to oust U.S. forces, 2,500 of whom are in Iraq in a mission to help prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. \u201cTheir presence is pure evil for the Iraqi people,\u201d he said.",
    "Iraq and the United States last month initiated talks about ending the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s presence in the country."
