    "Sri Lanka, which is famous the world over for ancient, giant Dagobas, has earned notoriety for huge pyramids\u2014albeit of a different kind. It has become a haven for various pyramid scams. Sri Lankans boast of their relatively high literacy rate in the region, but they are easy prey for racketeers, who are now using the digital space to carry out their illegal operations far more effectively than in the past. Victims who invest their lifelong savings in these fraudulent schemes on the sly, ignoring warnings, protest in public when they lose their money, cursing the government in power and asking it to intervene and help recover their losses. A surge in pyramid scams has prompted the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to launch an \u2018Anti-Pyramid Awareness Week\u2019 under the theme, \u201cPyramid is a trap \u2013 don\u2019t get into the wrong track\u201d.",
    "Pyramid schemes not only defraud individuals but also severely undermine financial systems; financial and banking sectors suffer heavily due to reduced liquidity and an erosion of public confidence in them. These frauds also bring about economic volatility and macroeconomic shocks due to the bursting of asset bubbles, etc., and lead to huge regulatory and legal costs, which the public has to bear. Sri Lankans must be educated on the mega crises caused by pyramid rackets in countries like Albania, Zimbabwe, and Romania. It is hoped that the CBSL\u2019s cross-sectoral initiatives involving several key state institutions to protect the public against pyramid racketeers will reach fruition, with some sense being eventually knocked into the gullible members of the public, who must also be told in no uncertain terms that if they ever invest in such scams, they will be doing so at their own risk, and taxpayers\u2019 money will not be used to compensate them under any circumstances.",
    "It is a matter for relief that there are institutions like the police, the CBSL and the Finance Ministry to protect the public against organised financial frauds like pyramid schemes, or at least to make a serious effort to do so, but there is no one to save the people from the political pyramid scams, as it were, wherein the victims invest something much more precious than money\u2014their future.",
    "During the past several decades, Sri Lanka has seen a number of mega political pyramid scams that defrauded about 22 million people by making various promises and reneging on them. These scammers not only get off scot-free but also have themselves voted back into office to resume their frauds, savour power and enrich themselves. In the early 1970s, the people fell for the rice-from-the-moon scam but were left with hardly any rice to eat thereafter. Seven years later, they were duped by the infamous eight-pounds-of-grain racket coupled with a promise to usher in a Righteous Society and guarantee Shelter for All. Then came on the scene the political scammers promising economic relief and a country free from corruption and terror\u2014dooshanaya and beeshanaya. The promised economic relief turned out to be pie in the sky; corruption and terror continued to thrive. An extension of that political pyramid scam came in the form of a project to ensure a \u2018Prosperous Future\u2019 for everyone; it was followed by the Good Governance fraud, which paved the way for the worst-ever financial crime in the country\u2014Treasury bond scams\u2014and various other rackets. Perhaps, the biggest-ever political pyramid scam in this country was the one that promised \u2018Prosperity and Splendour\u2019 as dividends but bankrupted the economy, causing unprecedented hardships to the public. It is against this backdrop the ongoing \u2018Beautiful Life\u2019 project should be viewed. The current leaders came to power, condemning the post-Independence period as a 76-year curse, and whether it will turn out to be \u201876-Year Curse Plus\u2019 remains to be seen.",
    "Manthri.lk, a platform of Verit\u00e9 Research, has launched the  Anura Meter, an online tracker, to monitor the progress in fulfilling the key promises made in the 2024 presidential election manifesto of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. One hopes that the Anura Meter will help figure out whether the people are receiving the dividends they were promised when they invested their future in the Beautiful Life project. Unless their expectations are met, they, too, will take to the streets like the victims of the financial pyramid schemes or the Aragalaya activists.",
    "Meanwhile, in combating the financial pyramid scams, the remarkable resilience, influence and adaptability of the wealthy scammers with political connections and international links must not be underestimated. The fraudsters adopt tactics such as hiring celebrities and other such popular personalities to lure the public. There is said to be a sucker born every minute. It may be recalled how tens of thousands of people fell for Dhammika  peniya\u2014a kind of herbal syrup\u2014which a carpenter-turned-shaman touted as a cure for Covid-19. Nevertheless, the government initiative to keep the pyramid racketeers at bay deserves fullest public cooperation.",
