    "Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith urged the authorities to remove containers from the ship X-Press Pearl which caught fire in the sea off Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThese containers numbering to be more than 1,000 should be removed as these are causing more environmental issues,\u201d the Cardinal said during his visit to the coast over the weekend.",
    "\u201cA powerful Minister said someone had accepted a bribe worth $ 250 million to hush up the X- Press Pearl disaster and no probe has been made into it. It is our duty to remind the authorities to carry out an investigation,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cRulers of this country are only interested in earning money and not to develop the nation. They continue with the market economy which has been designed by the international community. No production is taking place in the country as everything is imported from other countries rather than producing them locally. Paddy farmers should be helped to produce adequate stocks which the country needs and the fishermen should be assisted to make full use of the sea. I don\u2019t blame the ruling party alone for the country\u2019s failure as the opposition will also have to take the blame,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cI challenge those who are responsible to dissolve Parliament and hold a general election. People will reject all 225 members of the House,\u201d the cardinal said. (Yohan Perera)"
