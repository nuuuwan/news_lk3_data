  "original_body_lines": [
    "Demands Govt. give people right to vote and hold an election immediately",
    "Promises to defeat any attempt to take country towards a dictatorship through misuse of powers",
    "Says rulers are working hand in hand to create disorder in society",
    "The Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith yesterday called on the Government to hold an election to allow the people to make their voices heard.",
    "\u201cAn election must be held immediately and the people must be allowed to express their opinion,\u201d he said. He also stressed that any attempt to take the country towards a dictatorship through the misuse of power to curtail the freedoms of the people will be defeated.",
    "The Archbishop expressed these views while addressing the centenary celebrations of St. Anthony\u2019s College, Katana.",
    "\u201cWe cannot take our nation forward with a leadership that lacks foresight and prioritises self-interest over the well-being of our country. Therefore, let us prepare. An election is our right that is imperative to every citizen above the age of 18 to decide the future of this country. We ask for that right,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAfter initially claiming there were no funds, they now boast about their financial resources. If resources are indeed available, they should proceed with the election and let the people express their views. We will not permit those who gained power through illegitimate means to abuse their authority and impose laws that restrict the freedoms of the people, leading our nation down the path of dictatorship. Let this serve as a reminder to the leaders.\u201d he added.",
    "The Cardinal further expressed that the current leaders of the nation are collaborating closely to transform law into disorder and to guide society astray, making them unsuitable individuals to govern the country.",
    "\u201cToday, the leaders of the country are working hand in hand to turn justice into injustice, turn governance into dictatorship, and lead the society from law-abiding to lawlessness. Therefore, we must prepare for the possibility of driving out such people. Such people are not fit to rule this country. They should be ousted,\u201d he said."
