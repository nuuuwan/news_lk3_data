    "The \u2018Know Your Neethi\u2019 Legal Aid and Awareness Camp held on 1-2 August 2025 at the Badulla Cricket Stadium, successfully brought together over a thousand community members for two days of legal education, support, and empowerment.",
    "The program was carried out by the Support to Justice Sector Project (JURE), funded by the European Union, jointly implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Sri Lanka, and facilitated by the Ministry of Justice.",
    "The legal aid and awareness camp served as a dynamic, community-focused platform to promote legal literacy and access to justice. This initiative placed a strong emphasis on inclusivity and equity, actively engaging traditionally underserved populations, including women, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable and marginalised groups, ensuring their voices were heard and their rights addressed.",
    "The event was also attended by key dignitaries including Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara, President\u2019s Counsel and Secretary to the Ministry of Justice Ayesha Jinasena, Uva Province Governor J.M. Kapila Jayasekera, Mayor of Badulla Nandana Hapugoda, UNDP Sri Lanka Resident Representative Azusa Kubota, and Uva Wellassa University Vice Chancellor Senior Professor Kolitha Bandara Wijesekara.",
    "Speaking about the event, Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara, said: \u201cThis camp is a testament to our commitment to ensuring that the law serves everyone in Sri Lanka \u2013 not just in theory, but in practice. By bringing legal education and services to communities in Badulla, we are taking concrete steps to dismantle barriers and build trust in our justice system.\u201d",
    "Over the two days, attendees had access to a variety of engaging and informative activities designed in local languages to demystify the legal system and connect people with relevant services. These included interactive activities and games to explain legal principles and processes; information booths managed by government agencies, offering guidance on legal entitlements and public assistance programs; and legal aid clinics where individuals received free, one-on-one consultations with legal professionals on pressing issues such as land disputes, employment rights, language rights, family law, and cybercrime. Forum theatre performances brought everyday legal challenges to life through dramatised storytelling, making complex legal issues more understandable and relatable, while psychosocial support services were made available to assist individuals experiencing emotional distress related to their legal circumstances.",
    "The \u2018Know Your Neethi\u2019 Legal Aid and Awareness Camp presented a unique space for dialogue between community members and institutional representatives, encouraging greater transparency, trust, and collaboration in the justice system. By connecting people directly with legal support services, the camp helped reduce barriers to justice, particularly in underserved areas. The regional camp is an extension of the ongoing \u2018Know Your Neethi\u2019 legal awareness campaign that was launched recently, reaching wider audiences through a dynamic hub of legal literacy, where viewers can access short films, expert interviews, and explainer videos in Sinhala and Tamil. Hosted across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, the campaign channel offers simplified, engaging content designed to make legal information accessible, relatable, and actionable.",
    "European Union Ambassador to Sri Lanka Carmen Moreno highlighted the commitment of the EU to fostering access to justice in Sri Lanka: \u201cBuilding legal literacy is the first step toward people\u2019s empowerment. It equips people with the tools to challenge injustice and to demand that the law is applied equally, fairly and transparently. When citizens are informed, systems improve and justice is more accessible. The right to participate becomes real, and everybody can make meaningful contributions to shape new laws and regulations.\u201d",
    "UNDP Sri Lanka Resident Representative Azusa Kubota said: \u201cAccess to justice is fundamental to achieving inclusive and sustainable development. Through initiatives like the \u2018Know Your Neethi\u2019 Legal Aid and Awareness Camp, UNDP is proud to work with partners to strengthen legal empowerment and uphold the rights of every individual in Sri Lanka. It is our sincere hope that the knowledge and tools tested and tried in Badulla will be replicated and scaled across the country for wider impact.\u201d",
    "The Know Your Neethi Legal Aid and Awareness Camp is a part of the JURE project\u2019s broader efforts to strengthen the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice. The initiative underscored the fundamental message that justice should not be a privilege reserved for the few but a right guaranteed for all."
