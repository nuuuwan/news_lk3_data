    "Accordingly, Sri Lanka has strongly rejected the proposed drafted resolution at the present session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and Sri Lanka continues to oppose the 51/1 resolution of the drafted resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council and has not agreed to any resolution that extends the powers of the collection of external evidence mechanism.",
