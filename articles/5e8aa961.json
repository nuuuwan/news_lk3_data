    "A conversation with Bishop Duleep de Chickera on his latest book \u2018Beyond checkpoints: Stories of human resilience in troubled Sri Lanka\u2019, took place recently at the Diocesan Chambers, Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour, Bauddhaloka Mawatha Colombo 7.",
    "The discussion was moderated by University of Jaffna Senior Lecturer Dr. Mahendran Thiruvarangan, while selected passages from the book were read and commented on by educator and story-teller Suramya Hettiarachchi. Published in 2023, and now in its second print, \u2018Beyond Checkpoints\u2019 recently won a State Literary Award.",
    "Beyond Checkpoints is a series of vignettes documenting the author\u2019s experiences and reflections as a priest and Bishop during war-time Sri Lanka. Threaded together in the form of a meditative travelogue, it is an account of his and his wife Geetha\u2019s travels during pastoral visits in the north and east of Sri Lanka. What emerges in the narrative is a voice humbled by the resilience of a people who have lived through the violence of war and harmful effects of political impunity.",
    "In a review, Professor Neloufer de Mel observes: \u201cIt is a traveller\u2019s tale, which conveys to us with humour, astute observation and discernment, how victim-survivors, fellow travellers, priests, soldiers and militants in Sri Lanka\u2019s long drawn ethnic war narrated the conditions of their lives, or simply went about their business.\u201d In another review, Hashani Boange writes: \u201cThe book is structured around Rev. de Chickera\u2019s travels across various checkpoints \u2014 literal and metaphorical \u2014 that mark the divisions and tensions within Sri Lankan society. These checkpoints symbolise the barriers and obstacles that exist both in the physical landscape and in the collective psyche of the nation.\u201d In addition to bookshops, Beyond Checkpoints is also available for sale at the Bishop\u2019s office in the Cathedral premises at Bauddhaloka Mawatha for Rs. 1,000 during office hours on weekdays."
