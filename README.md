Delivering a special statement in Parliament, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Supreme Court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP and therefore the IGP will continue in his position. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has declared his candidacy in the upcoming Presidential election, has stated that he will not appoint an acting IGP as this may lead to election petitions being filed against him.

### “Ranil is the biggest mistake”

Basil Rajapakse criticizes President Ranil Wickremesinghe's decision to run as an independent candidate, calling it a mistake. The PA's executive committee, led by former President Mahinda Rajapakse, was set to decide the presidential candidate. There's disagreement within the party over whether Wickremesinghe or another member should be the candidate. The PA feels neglected by Wickremesinghe, who they claim prioritized strengthening the UNP over the PA, leading to internal dissatisfaction.

🟩

Basil Rajapakse, the founder of the PA, said that the announcement of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's contesting as an independent candidate was completely wrong.

The executive committee of the PA was chaired by former President Mahinda Rajapakse to take a final decision on the presidential candidate.

It has been paid attention to a member of the PA in the presidential election and the candidature of President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the candidate.

One party has stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be fielded as presidential candidate and another party should field a member of the party as the presidential candidate.

It is absolutely wrong to announce that he is contesting as an independent candidate as he is in talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the issue of the presidential candidate.

We supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022 without any conditions. But for the past 2 years, he has not given priority to the PA's party.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will hold key units related to national security and rescue when handing over its Chinese-built airport operations to a consortium between Indian and Russian firms, a top government official said.

The island nation is in the process of handing over the $209 million Chinese-funded airport to a consortium between Shaurya Aeronautics Pvt Ltd of India and Airports of Regions Management Company of Russia after it won the contract to manage Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport for 30 years.

The airport was once dubbed the “world’s emptiest airport” because of a lack of flights. It has incurred a loss of 3 billion rupees (US$10 million) annually since it was started in 2013 by former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, who borrowed heavily for post-war infrastructure in his second tenure of 2010-2015.

The Indian-Russian consortium was chosen despite the United States having informed Sri Lanka government about a US sanction on the key stakeholder of the Moscow firm.

*2024-07-29 15:49:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100857/athapaththu-eyes-t20-world-cup-after-sri-lankas-asia-cup-success) · `en`

Victorious Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu believes her side’s success in the Women’s Asia Cup was well deserved as the island nation turns its attention to this year’s ICC Women’s T20 World Cup.

Sri Lanka claimed their first Women’s Asia Cup title on Sunday, with Athapaththu leading from the front with a hard-fought half-century to help her team chase down India’s total of 165/6 with eight balls remaining.

The victory helps cap off a tremendous 14-month period for Sri Lanka, who have claimed T20I series triumphs over Bangladesh, England and South Africa in recent times as well winning the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament to earn a place at this year’s tournament in October.

That will be the next challenge for Athapaththu and Sri Lanka, but the experienced skipper is excited about what her side can achieve at the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh.
