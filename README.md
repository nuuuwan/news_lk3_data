### Is the Muslim minister's demand racist?

*2024-11-24 14:04:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199546) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



The question of whether a Muslim minister's demand is racist stems from historical context. In Sri Lanka's political history, there were no Muslim ministers. The current situation involves Muslim MPs elected under the National People's Power. Some argue they may be unsuitable for the new regime. However, questioning their suitability isn't inherently racist, as it's based on performance rather than religion.

üü©

In the past, there are no Muslim ministers to tear down so we see those who call it the Muslim Minister. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked the people to vote for newcomers, saying that all those who have been in the past have not managed the country properly.. If so, are Muslim MPs elected on behalf of the National People's Power, but are they inappropriate for new regime change?If they are inappropriate, it is not the crime of Muslims to contest them as candidates.

### Far right eye breakthrough in Romania presidential vote

*2024-11-24 13:42:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103725/far-right-eye-breakthrough-in-romania-presidential-vote) ¬∑ `en`

Romanians were voting Sunday in the first round of a presidential election amid a surge in inflation and fears over the war in neighbouring Ukraine that could favour far-right leader George Simion.

The vote kicks off two weeks of elections in the poor NATO member country, including a parliamentary vote and a December 8 presidential run-off.

Social democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is leading a field of 13 hopefuls in the polls, with about 25 percent, followed by AUR leader Simion on 15 to 19 percent.

Simion is targeting people like Rodica, a 69-year-old who was among the first to vote in Bucharest‚Äôs chilly sunshine. The pensioner, who would not give a family name, was afraid of the Ukraine war and wanted ‚Äúbetter living conditions and peace‚Äù.

The stakes are high in the race to replace President Klaus Iohannis, a liberal and staunch Ukraine ally, who has held the largely ceremonial post since 2014.

### No electricity tariff revisions this year: PUCSL

*2024-11-24 13:05:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103723/no-electricity-tariff-revisions-this-year-pucsl-) ¬∑ `en`

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) states that there will be no revision of electricity tariffs for 2024, citing delays in the submission of necessary proposals by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

The PUCSL Corporate Communications Director, Jayanath Herath pointed out that the CEB submitted an initial set of tariff revision proposals at the end of September. However, the PUCSL deemed the proposed reductions insufficient and requested a revised submission by November 8.

Despite the initial deadline, the CEB sought multiple extensions, most recently requesting an additional two weeks after failing to meet the extended deadline of November 22. Consequently, the PUCSL has planned to grant an extension until December 6.

Even if the CEB submits the revised proposals on December 6, the PUCSL clarified that it would take six to eight weeks to review and finalize the tariff adjustments. As a result, any potential revisions to electricity tariffs will be postponed to 2025.

It has been a source of inspiration, guidance, fostering a connection between India & Sri Lanka...Sri Lankan Airlines is not only offering the opportunity to discover significant locations‚Äù

Countries at the COP29 summit in Baku adopted a $300 billion a year global finance target on Sunday to help poorer nations cope with impacts of climate change, a deal its intended recipients criticised as woefully insufficient.

The agreement, clinched in overtime at the two-week conference in Azerbaijan‚Äôs capital, was meant to provide momentum for international efforts to curb global warming in a year destined to be the hottest on record.

Some delegates gave the deal a standing ovation in the COP29 plenary hall. Others lambasted wealthy nations for not doing more and criticised the Azerbaijan host for hurriedly gavelling through the contentious plan.

‚ÄúI regret to say that this document is nothing more than an optical illusion,‚Äù Indian delegation representative Chandni Raina told the closing session of the summit, minutes after the deal was gavelled in. ‚ÄúThis, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.

Cyril was a master of public relations, capable of crafting newsworthy stories and engaging with leading international journalists.

### Women in Politics ‚Äì Local and two from UK, US

*2024-11-24 04:13:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/women-in-politics-local-and-two-from-uk-us/) ¬∑ `en`

The 2024 Parliamentary elections have broken records and earned first evers for more than one reason. One very encouraging fact is that women‚Äôs representation has increased to over 10%. This trend, we are certain, will continue. 21 women MPs have been elected and 19 are from the NPP including Ambiga Selvam from Badulla who comes from the tea plantation worker sector. That is such good news. Two are from the SJB: Chamindrani, daughter of Lakshman Kiriella and Rohini Kaviratne, re-elected from Matale. Three more are expected from the NPP national list. This against only 13 women MPs in the previous government.

Much though they deserve writing about, I move overseas, since these women in Parliament will be known to all via local media and of course conversation, even gossip.

‚ÄúAs we all know, regionalism in South Asia has had a late beginning. One of the remarkable developments since the Second World War has been the spread of regionalism, manifested in the setting up of regional organizations which have to cover most of the globe. The fact that SAARC came to be formed so late has been explained by the disparities and imbalances within our region. Nevertheless, there is at the same time, an underlying homogeneity among South Asian countries, on which we hope to build an enduring regionalism for the common benefit of all of us.

At parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka last week, the centre-left National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) checked all lists and squared all circles, winning not just traditional seats but also polling divisions populated by minority communities.

Speaking to the media on Friday, November 15, hours after general election results were announced in Sri Lanka, Tilvin Silva, General Secretary of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the dominant member in the National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) alliance that governs the country, acknowledged that his party would commit to ‚Äúdeveloping the country, eradicating corruption, and enhancing democracy with accountability.‚Äù

Silva‚Äôs remarks came in the backdrop of one of the biggest electoral landslides in the island‚Äôs political history: the NPP, reduced to three seats at the 2020 general election, gained a two-thirds majority, obtaining 159 seats and 61 percent of the vote, last week.

Trump‚Äôs new Ambassador to Israel: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no such thing as a Palestinian‚Äù

The re-election of Donald Trump to a second term of the presidency of the United States has changed the ideological trajectory of the future of the United States. At least for the foreseeable future.But it has sealed the fate of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Permanently.

To even consider the validity of the above statement, one must look into the constitutional, conventional and practical qualifications for the Presidency of the United States. Constitutionally, the President must be at least 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.

About 20 years ago, I used the same title, in a writing dealing with Mahinda Rajapaksa‚Äôs triumphant ascent to power, published in an issue of the Sunday Island. In that I expressed my deep apprehensions of a Rajapaksa dispensation. As the years unfolded, the grim realities of years of misrule, with the younger Rajapaksa outdoing the elder brother in criminality, corruption and incompetence, exceeded the worst fears of my imagination. In between, not to be forgotten, there was also the crushingly disappointing ‚Äúyahapalanya‚Äù farce, perpetrated by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe collaboration.

The Jenolan caves, some 175 kilometres to the west of Sydney, got their name from the aboriginal name ‚ÄòGenowlan‚Äô for a mountain in the district and are said to have been accidently discovered by Charles Whalam in 1838 when he was on the trail of an escaped convict turned highway robber.
