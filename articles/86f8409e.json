    "Colombo, Feb 5 (Daily Mirror) - Human Rights activist Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa was released on a personal bail of Rs. 25,000 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate today.",
    "The doctor appeared before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna De Alwis through a motion filed by his Counsel Rajitha Lakmal.",
    "During the inquiry Counsel told the Magistrate that on 1st of January, during a protest opposite the entrance to the CID, Police had arrested the doctor and some other suspects who were later produced before the Fort Magistrate's Court.",
    "During the inquiry, the Cinnamon Garden Police had submitted to the Fort Magistrate's Court that the Colombo Chief Magistrate had ordered the Cinnamon Gardens Police to arrest three suspects including Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa and two others and to produce them before the Chief Magistrate today (5) allegedly for placing a funeral wreath opposite the house of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwell on January 01 .",
    "Counsel asserted that on checking from the Court they found that no such order had been made by the Court and underscored the fact that the Cinnamon Gardens Police had made this assertion spuriously and deliberately before the Fort Magistrate to mislead the Fort Magistrate in order to get the doctor and others further remanded til yesterday.",
    "Counsel said Minister Keheliya Rambukwella had not even lodged any complaints to the police other than a complaint made by Minister Keheliya\u2019s daughter.",
    "Counsel contended that this is a serious issue and to take appropriate action against those responsible.",
    "The Chief Magistrate however observed that there is a 'B' report filed by the Police before the court, even though the court had not made any such orders to arrest the suspect. The Magistrate released Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa on Rs. 25,000 personal bail as the court has no jurisdiction to release a suspect at this stage of the case. The case was put off for March 11."
