    "Israel\u2019s government said a drone was launched toward the prime minister\u2019s house Saturday, with no casualties as Iran\u2019s supreme leader vowed that Hamas would continue its fight against Israel following the killing of the mastermind of last year\u2019s deadly Oct. 7 attack.",
    "In Gaza, at least 21 people were killed in several Israeli strikes, including children, according to hospital officials and an AP reporter.",
    "Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement.",
    "In September, Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahu\u2019s plane was landing. The missile was intercepted.",
    "Saturday\u2019s strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah a Hamas ally backed by Iran\u00a0 has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October.",
    "In addition to the drone launched at Netanyahu\u2019s residence, Israel\u2019s military said some 55 projectiles were fired in two separate barrages at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning. Some were intercepted, the army said, and there were no immediate reports of any casualties.",
    "Israel also said Saturday it killed Hezbollah\u2019s deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel",
    "In Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck.",
    "A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it\u2019s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas\u2019 leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar\u2019s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him.",
    "Since Israel claimed Sinwar\u2019s death Thursday and a top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages they took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The staunch position pushed back against a statement by Netanyahu that his country\u2019s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming.",
    "Sinwar was the chief architect of the 2023 Hamas raid on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.",
    "More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital\u2019s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff. At the Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the building\u2019s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement.",
    "In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital.",
    "The war has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, and left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel.",
    "Sinwar\u2019s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the war in Gaza even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country.",
    "Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a Thursday night speech announcing the killing that \u201cour war is not yet ended.\u201d",
    "Still, the governments of Israel\u2019s allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwar\u2019s death would pave the way for an end to the war.",
    "In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar\u2019s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead."
