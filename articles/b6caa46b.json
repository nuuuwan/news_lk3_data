    "According to the latest announcement made by Fitch upgrading BOC\u2019s international ratings, Fitch has considered the following factors in order to support their rating action;",
    "Fitch highlighted that the successful completion of debt restructuring has reduced sovereign-related stress on Sri Lankan banks\u2019 operating environment and as well as on BOC\u2019s overall credit profile. In terms of Bank\u2019s risk profile, it is expected that the conclusion of sovereign debt restructuring and the Bank\u2019s focus on expanding private-sector lending will moderate the exposure to the sovereign in the medium term.",
    "Fitch has further upgraded BOC\u2019s business profile score considering the Bank\u2019s continued strong market position as the largest bank in Sri Lanka and the potentials to expand the business fostered by the improved operating environment. The Bank\u2019s profitability will be further improved in line with the finalized restructuring terms and conditions of sovereign instruments.",
    "Moreover, foreign currency funding and liquidity score of the Bank has upgraded reflecting the significant improvement in the liquidity profile and will be further strengthen with the restoration of the sovereign\u2019s creditworthiness, subsequent to the successful debt restructuring and thereby providing the Bank, the access to foreign currency wholesale funding.",
    "The asset-quality of the Bank will be further enhanced due to better economic conditions of the country and the potential capacity of the Bank to enrich its credit portfolio. Additionally, Fitch has noted that the reduced risk of sovereign default and the stabilizing economy alleviate solvency risk for BOC and thus, revised upward the Bank\u2019s capitalization and leverage score.",
    "BOC, being the No. 1 Bank in Sri Lankan Banking industry, its commitment goes beyond mere financial transactions and extends to building lasting relationships, fostering financial empowerment and steering the economic growth.",
    "Envisioning to be \u201cNation\u2019s preferred financial partner\u201d for customers and by offering innovative financial solutions and unwavering support for economic stability and growth over eight decades as \u201cBankers to the Nation\u201d, BOC has continuously interacted with individuals from diverse roots in Sri Lanka, demonstrating a steadfast commitment to generate value for all stakeholders.
