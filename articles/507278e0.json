    "Seylan Cards, the Essential Card for Heartfelt Essentials, has partnered with FitsAir to continue its Swipe and Win promo. This initiative follows the success of previous iterations, where Seylan Cards rewarded customers with airline tickets to exciting destinations such as Singapore and the Maldives. Now, Seylan Card holders have another opportunity to win free airline tickets to Dubai. One lucky Seylan Card holder will have the chance to win two airline tickets to Dubai, on a monthly basis, starting from October 1st till December 31st , 2024.",
    "With 6 tickets for 3 winners up for grabs, Seylan Card holders need to carry out a minimum transaction of Rs. 5,000 using their Seylan Credit Card to enter the draw. The more transactions they make, the higher their chances of winning. Seylan Bank will announce the winners monthly, ensuring transparency and fairness in the selection process.",

With the holiday season approaching, now is the perfect time to secure your tickets with a trusted partner like FitsAir. I encourage all cardholders to participate and make the most of this exciting opportunity.\u201d",
