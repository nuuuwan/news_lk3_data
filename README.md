But his critics charge that he is without experience in statesmanship. Being a first timer in presidency, his critics are technically correct because he does not have a track-record. But experience does not matter to a person who can quickly grasp an issue, has a ready ear to listen, and change himself suitably to an emerging diverse situation. He has shown this adaptability by accepting IMF’s EFF as the most pragmatic way forward for Sri Lanka without dragging the country to a destabilising shock as predicted by his critics. AKD has the capacity to convert information to knowledge strengthened by experience, a requirement of knowledge as presented by Albert Einstein

The Election Commission announced a Parliamentary election for 14 November 2024 with deadlines for nominations of candidates set for 11 October, 2024.

COPF’s relentless efforts have shown the power of accountability and how one committee’s determination can make all the difference

Millions of tourists apply for visas every year to explore Sri Lanka. But in 2023, something went very wrong with Sri Lanka’s visa system, leaving many tourists and citizens questioning how such a simple process could turn into a national controversy.

### The man who could have been the President!

*2024-11-11 01:00:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-man-who-could-have-been-the-President/4-769053) · `en`

Sri Lanka is currently on a path to establishing a government free of injustice, nepotism, fraud, bribery, and all forms of corruption. For this ambitious goal to be achieved, individuals of impeccable character must hold government positions, and citizens must likewise adopt a mindset that supports integrity and accountability in all capacities. Achieving a truly corruption-free state requires that the ruling party remain open to constructive criticism, and that its supporters welcome such feedback without becoming sycophants—rejecting good advice or silencing critics.

Lawyer Nagananda, a respected attorney in both Sri Lanka and England, is widely known for his unwavering commitment to fighting injustice and corruption in all its forms. His constructive criticism is imparted without bias toward any individual or party. Consequently, he has often been regarded as an enemy by many, finding support only among a few rational-minded individuals.

80 percent uniform fabric was donated by China in 2024. The remaining 20 percent was resolved by the Sri Lankan government.
