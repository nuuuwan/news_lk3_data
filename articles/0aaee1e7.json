    "Nutrition Sri Lanka \u2013 an ambitious program to end malnutrition \u2013 was formally launched recently. It seeks to provide undernourished children and pregnant women with the nutrients essential through the consumption of fortified rice.",
    "The program is spearheaded by Akshata, which is the first brand in Sri Lanka to acquire and master the technology to produce fortified rice kernels efficiently and cost-effectively. Fortifying staple foods such as rice with essential micronutrients like vitamin A, B vitamins, iron and zinc is among the most economical evidence-based interventions to help combat widespread micronutrient deficiencies.",
    "Nutrition Sri Lanka is an initiative by Grains \u2018n\u2019 Green\u2019 Ltd Managing Director Roshan Perera, which produces Akshata products. Experimentation on fortified kernels in Sri Lanka using extrusion technology began in January by a research team led by Senior Professor K.K.D.S. Ranaweera with technical support from PATH. Lions International Past President Mahendra Amarasuriya was also an important part of the program and contributed in many ways.",
    "\u201cWe have already started production of fortified rice kernels to be supplied for the rice fortification initiative under the school meal program. The company is hopeful of more orders from sub-saharan African countries,\u201d said Roshan Perera.",
    "According to him, rice fortification for addressing the issue of micronutrient deficiencies in the population is a vital initiative, and local production of fortified rice kernels for use in the manufacture of fortified rice was identified as a key element in the long-term sustainability of the rice fortification programme. He also noted that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 mandated that the poor in India should get only iron-fortified rice under all government welfare schemes, and this has been extremely successful.",
    "\u201cWe are the only company in Sri Lanka with the capability and technical know-how to implement this project and provide the necessary fortified kernels at 50% of the cost currently incurred by importing,\u201d said Perera. The kernels are enriched with folic acid and iron through an extrusion process creating nutrient-rich grains that will be blended with regular rice to produce fortified rice.",
    "He added that fortified rice will soon be available to the public to purchase off the shelf with various nutrients added to cater to deficiencies, which will revolutionise the rice industry in Sri Lanka while building a healthier population. Though rice is a great source of energy, it is a poor source of micronutrients because the milling process removes the nutrient-rich bran layers.",
    "Malnutrition is a serious problem in Sri Lanka. At present, as many as 2.3 million children in the country suffer from its dire consequences. Sri Lanka has one of the highest rates of acute malnutrition among children under 5 years in South Asia, and many suffer from chronic wasing. It is essential to remedy this and ensure that children have a chance to develop physically and mentally and achieve their full potential.",
    "It is interesting to note that experts\u2019 approval of rice fortification for the school meal program emphasised the need to manufacture fortified rice kernels locally as importing fortified kernels is a heavy burden on the country\u2019s foreign exchange. Akshata\u2019s efforts have finally made this a reality.",
    "Akshata is a pioneer in the cultivation and manufacture of food products that cater to health-conscious consumers in Sri Lanka. It was the first brand to introduce heirloom rice varieties with proven health benefits such as pachchaperumal, suwandel, black rice and kuruluthuda to Sri Lankan supermarkets. It is also the first brand in the world to introduce breakfast cereals made of heirloom rice. These products include moringa, jackfruit and lotus flower seeds along with an innovative honey spoon. Akshata products are high in nutrients and have earned an enviable reputation among health-conscious consumers."
