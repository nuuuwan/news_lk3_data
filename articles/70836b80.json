    "With the poya of December, the Sri Pada season is declared open. This announcement was made on Dec. 14 \u2013 Unduvap Poya \u2013 a week ago. As always, with seeing the press announcement, a rush of memories crowded my mind. They had to be shared. Personal but permissible, I expect.",
    "Sri Pada, aka Adam\u2019s Peak and Samanala Kanda, is the fifth tallest peak in Sri Lanka\u2019s Hill Country at 2,243 m or 7, 359 ft. The mountain rises from its foothills grown commercially with tea, and soars as a conical shaped single rock whose peak now has been flattened to accommodate viewing areas and buildings, including a temple where the monks in charge live. It is under the religious purview of the Saman Devale in Ratnapura. Needless to mention is the fact that its fame is due to the footprint at the very summit, gold painted.",
    "It is large and not a human print by any means. Perhaps when the Buddha was considered a super human, his physical size too was greatly exaggerated, but now even the most rites and ritual bound rural Buddhist knows the Buddha was a human being in stature and appearance but possessing super human intellect and powers.",
    "As we know, the other four major religions practiced in SL venerate the Peak for their own reasons. The Hindus believe the mountain is an abode of God Shiva and the footprint is his. Thus its name Sumanakuta \u2013 Mountain of Shiva\u2019s Light. The resident guardian is one of the four guardians of Lanka \u2013 God Saman \u2013 who protects the Peak, humans who visit, and animals.",
    "Islamic and Christian traditions believe it is the Mount of St Thomas and Adam, who took refuge here when chased out of the Garden of Eden by the creating God. I have also heard Noah in his life sustaining ark came to the Peak when he found the flood had abated. Interesting fact unearthed when researching for this article is that it is also known as Mt Malaya in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and even Ratnagiri. As kids in Kandy we witnessed thousands of yellow butterflies fluttering in droves on a determined path and were told they were on their way to Samanala Kanda to die there.",
    "The above are a mixture of facts, myths and legends. Here are a couple of certainties ferreted out. The Mahavamsa mentions the Peak to state that Buddha visited it and left his foot print. The Rajavaliya  notes that Kind Valagamba (1st BC) took refuge here from Indian invaders. Also mentioned by Chinese Fa Hien when he stayed in the country from 411 to12 AD; Venetian traveller Marco Polo in 1298; Arab Ibn Batuta who climbed to the summit in 1344.The first Britisher to climb was Lt. William Malcolm on April 26, 1815 and then John Davy in 1817.",
    "Not to miss mentioning is Arthur C Clarke\u2019s 1979 scifi novel set in the 22 century and sited in Sri Kanda \u2013 thinly veiled Sri Pada \u2013 and King Kalidasa living thousands of years before in his \u2018pleasure garden\u2019 \u2013 Sigiriya. A space elevator is constructed to link the ground station with a satellite in orbit at a distance of 22,300 miles. The Fountains of Paradise won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for best novel that year.",
    "Six routes lead to the summit. I was aware of the Ratnapura, the Kuruwita, the Hatton-Nallathanna and the Ihala Malibadda. The most used is the Hatton route, the walk starting from the small hamlet Dalhousie and tea estate to cross the Seetha Gangula \u2013 ice cold stream \u2013 and start the stone steps climb at the Indi Katu Pahana where you are supposed to throw a ball of cotton thread and a sewing needle down the precipice. The climb is about four miles and lit all the way with electric lights during the season from December to May. Nowadays it gets very crowded and often it\u2019s a slow step by slow step climb, taking much longer than the usual four hours.",
    "A few intrepid adventurers climb off season. This declared no-climb season is due to the drenching SW Monsoon and to allow wild animals to roam around freely in their domain. Dedicated off-season pilgrims prefer the loneliness of the long distance climber, stillness and closeness to nature and still find a few kades and resting places open en route.",
    "About 70 years or more ago, the Sri Pada Vandanawa was a once in a lifetime pilgrimage. Now certain pilgrims or adventurers set forth annually. I first heard the name Sri Pada and bawled out because Mother was missing and I was told she had gone on pilgrimage with relatives.",
    "As a teenager, my second brother, my sister-in-law, a friend of his and I undertook the pilgrimage with nothing untoward happening except being intrigued by the shared camaraderie and metta of those descending expressed to the upward climbers. The encouraging chant is: \u201cMe nagina nadeta, Sumana Saman Devi pihitai.\u201d Often a relationship was professed like Me akkata and once Me nandata while I was just 18. Maybe my head covering was too ageing! But certainly fun.",
    "The Guide Mistress of Hillwood College, Kandy, very bravely decided to take the senior guides up the Peak, in the late 1950s. We teachers joined and the Principal\u2019s husband, Rev. Sam, was chief guardian. From the time we set foot on the rocky climb, it rained. We just walked through, soaked but not shivering. I was walking with my friend Kamala when she suddenly darted forward and clutched a young teacher aide who was trudging alone before us. She was walking straight when a right angled turn had to be taken on the gravel path. If Kamala had not dragged her back she would have fallen into the stream that flowed alongside. It was a case of her being mesmerized, sort of just trudging along step following step without looking out.",
    "We reached the top just before dawn and the day turned fine. Our clothes dried on us. We were treated to a marvelous sunrise. Never to be forgotten how the sun coyly showed a sliver of its bright orange self from behind a dark mountain, then dipped down, then rose again with a little more showing, and so on till it was brilliantly visible, whole. You moved to the opposite side to marvel at the huge, perfectly triangular shadow stretched across a wide area of land below.",
    "My sister\u2019s family, ours and another nephew decided to go the way of pilgrims: by train to Hatton and all that. My elder son was eight and conscripted to join. From the time the trudge started he was morose; not verbally complaining but body language was clear he was unhappy. My sister and I gave our money for safe keeping to my husband as we wanted to travel very light with only chocolate, cheese and such like packages. Train tickets too were with hubby.",
    "He lay down while climbing on the ledge of the protective wall on the precipice side and then when we stopped at a kiosk for coffee and buns, he found his purse missing. Going back brought no results. Nephew had 30 rupees. So it was a glass of hot water we bought with two sips each. Hubby assured us the monks in charge would help us. They knew his father or of him as having been a Ratnapura public servant. \u201cThey\u2019ll give us money, not to worry.\u201d",
    "True enough, we were received at the summit with comforting assurances and even a room to spend the night in. A huge bed was crept into by about five of us to find large wooden boxes packed tight with coins below it. Son wanted to ease himself. No toilet was available and no way of searching.",
    "So I went to a door, pushed it open and told him to go ahead. He was not going to do that \u2013 pee from inside the room. I, without really thinking, put my foot out into the pitch darkness. No solid earth at all. We were on the edge. Who knew how far the descent was? I muttered a heartfelt prayer of gratitude to Saman Deviyo. Son did what to him was rude: eased himself from within the building.",
    "Mother told us of a woman who pushed people and rushed up. A little later a commotion. That woman had missed her footing and fallen down from near the summit. I certainly vouch for Sumana Saman Deviyo\u2019s benevolence and protection. Otherwise how explain my caution that night with my son, and the hardly heard of accidents with even rash climbers.",
    "The climb is hazardous plus taxing your strength, sinews and even determination. Fortunately you climb in the night and see only an ascending zigzag of lights. The next day you are appalled you climbed so high and so far. Your legs are one big ache and protest as you descend. In Kandy of long ago, the custom was to foment the returnees\u2019 feet with hot freshly made kavun,  specially the feet of kodukarayas \u2013 first timers.",
