  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Chief Prelates of all three Buddhist Chapters emphasized that proposed amendments to the Penal Code introducing an offence for corporal punishment, as well as government initiatives to promote tourism through LGBTQ-related activities, could undermine cultural values and give rise to serious social catastrophes.",
    "These observations have been made in a joint letter to the President, issued with the signatures of the Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangalabidhana Mahanayake Thero of the Malwatta chapter of Siam Nikaya, Most Venerable Warakagoda Dhammasiddhi Sri Pagghananda Gnanarathanabidhana Mahanayake Thero of the Asgiriya Chapter of the Siam Nikaya, Most Venerable Karagoda Uyangoda Maithree Moorthi Mahanayaka Thero of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya and Most Venerable Makulewe Wimala Mahanayake Thero of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya.",
    "In their letter, the Chief Prelates emphasized that disregarding a country\u2019s cultural identity, historical heritage, and traditional customs, while attempting to govern based on narrow arbitrariness or imitation of foreign practices, could result in societal anarchy and the collapse of social order.",
    "The Chief Prelates specifically highlighted concerns regarding the incumbent government\u2019s proposed amendment to Section 82 of the Penal Code to criminalize corporal punishment, as well as the Tourism Development Authority\u2019s (TDA) support for promoting tourism targeting LGBTQ tourists. They described these initiatives as a serious disruption of societal values and a potential source of multiple social crises.",
    "The Chief Prelates urged the President, who has consistently emphasized the significance of Buddhist philosophical principles and their role in sustainable social development, to give urgent attention to this matter and take necessary measures to prevent such actions, which they consider unethical.",
    "The full statement issued by the Chief Prelates of all three Buddhist Chapters follows:",
