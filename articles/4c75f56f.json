    "In the quiet early hours of July 8th, the arrivals terminal of the Bandaranaike International Airport was filled with something far greater than applause or fanfare\u2014it was filled with emotion. Flags fluttered, voices called out, and arms opened wide in a heartfelt welcome. Sri Lanka\u2019s own Johann Peries\u2014the first Sri Lankan to climb all Seven Summits\u2014had returned home. But for Johann, it wasn\u2019t about glory or recognition.",
    "Speaking to The Sunday, he said:\u201dSo actually getting back to Sri Lanka, going back home was the most important thing for me,\u201d he said, voice steady but heartfelt. \u201cAfter being away for one month and under those conditions, being alone\u2026 getting back to your own home country was really emotional for me, especially after taking on a task like this.\u201d",
    "The achievement is extraordinary by any measure. Climbing the highest peaks on each of the seven continents\u2014Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Mount Vinson in Antarctica, and Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania\u2014is a feat attempted by few and completed by even fewer. Johann Peries joins that elite club, carrying with him the hopes and pride of an entire nation.",
    "\u201cThis originally started with me taking it on as a personal journey,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut later on I realised that I was carrying the national flag with me, and that meant a lot of pride. Taking my flag with me to the highest point of each continent\u2014it gave me great honour. Every time I took the flag out on top there, it was very emotional for me. I kept saying that I\u2019m not doing this just for me, but for the nation and its people.\u201d",
    "For Johann, climbing has never been about ego or records. He doesn\u2019t speak in clich\u00e9s, and he avoids the word \u201cconquer\u201d entirely.",
    "\u201cI do not use the word \u2018conquered\u2019 because nature is something you cannot conquer. As Sir Edmund Hillary said, it is not the mountain that you conquer but yourself. So I always say I climbed. I summited.\u201d",
    "He has now summited five of the Seven Summits and reached the highest point possible on the other two\u2014no less an achievement. For him, it was always about the journey, the responsibility, and the lessons.",
    "\u201cThat itself was a huge challenge for me, and it really gives me great honour, like I said before.\u201d",
    "And yet, for all the physical demands, the real test, he insists, was mental.",
    "\u201cEvery mountain has its own challenges. People keep saying, \u2018You climbed Everest, so this is nothing.\u2019 But I keep telling them: every mountain has its own personality. It can be the shortest one, but it can challenge you in a completely different way. For me, this was more than a physical challenge\u2014it was a mental one.\u201d",
    "\u201cBeing out there all by yourself, under conditions we\u2019ve never experienced before\u2014storms, snowstorms, avalanches\u2014and meeting new people, climbing with new people \u2026 there were times when we didn\u2019t know if we were going to come back.\u201d",
    "And sometimes, the thin line between success and tragedy appeared right in front of him.",
    "\u201cThere was a moment I\u2019ll never forget. We were just about to get to the last ridge after nearly 15 days. There was this huge crevice we had to cross, and the guy in front of me slipped. He fell backwards\u2014legs up, head down, hanging. I had to help him mentally, guide him back onto the rope.\u201d",
    "The image is burned into his memory. The climber, shaken, gave up shortly after.",
    "\u201cThat could have been me. That moment will stay with me forever.\u201d",
    "Johann\u2019s passion for the outdoors didn\u2019t begin on Everest. It began in his childhood.",
    "\u201cIt was my father who inspired me. He didn\u2019t hold us back. We used to go outdoors\u2014fishing, climbing, exploring. That\u2019s where it all started.\u201d",
    "Over time, those simple childhood adventures grew into a deeper calling. He wanted to test himself, to see how far he could go.",
    "\u201cThe first dream was to climb Everest. We did that. And then the question came\u2014what next?\u201d",
    "That question led to a new goal: completing the Seven Summits. But it also raised new challenges.",
    "\u201cPeople often think that once you\u2019ve done Everest, you\u2019re invincible. But that\u2019s not how it works. Every climb is different. You still have to prepare, sacrifice, train. People underestimate that. I don\u2019t party before expeditions. I\u2019m up at 4.30 or 5 a.m. to train. On weekends, I go up-country for altitude training.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you don\u2019t prepare, the mountain becomes your enemy. But if you do it right, you have a chance. You need to be physically ready, but also mentally prepared. That\u2019s where many fall short.\u201d",
    "With the Seven Summits behind him, one might assume Johann is ready to rest. But he sees this not as the end, but the beginning of something far greater.",
    "\u201cThe summit is not the end. It\u2019s the beginning of another era for me. I\u2019m asked again, \u2018What next?\u2019 And I keep saying: there are so many other mountains. Some I want to attempt again. But I also want to inspire others, train others.\u201d",
    "In that spirit, Johann is exploring the possibility of starting a mountaineering school or foundation in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWe already have amazing people in this field\u2014some beyond me in many ways. I want to join hands, collaborate, bring people together.\u201d",
    "His dream is to create pathways for young Sri Lankans to enter the world of mountaineering, survival training, and outdoor exploration\u2014not just for sport, but for character building.",
    "\u201cWe have the potential to put Sri Lanka on the map, not just in cricket or tourism, but in adventure, resilience, and exploration.\u201d",
    "He wants to create a platform where discipline, preparation, and courage are instilled from a young age.",
    "\u201cWe need to come together and stand together. If we work as one, we can lift the nation.\u201d",
    "Johann\u2019s message to athletes, explorers, and everyday dreamers is simple but powerful.",
    "\u201cYou have to have determination, strength, and courage. But above all, you need commitment. Whatever your dream is\u2014whether it\u2019s in sports, business, or academics\u2014you must stay committed. There\u2019s always a first step. You just have to take it.\u201d",
    "He acknowledges that not everyone\u2019s mountain is physical. Sometimes it\u2019s poverty, fear, trauma, or simply self-doubt. But all mountains, he insists, can be climbed.",
    "\u201cThere are many mountains in my life still to climb. And I\u2019ll keep working toward them\u2014as I have done in the past.\u201d",
    "A book is in the works, capturing not just his adventures, but the emotional, spiritual, and psychological landscapes of his journey. Through storytelling, mentoring, and training, Johann hopes to pass on what he\u2019s learned\u2014not just about summits, but about life.",
    "As Sri Lanka welcomed its climber home, Johann brought back more than a passport full of stamps or Instagram-worthy summit photos. He brought back resilience. He brought back perspective.",
    "\u201cWhen you\u2019re up there, you realise how small we are. The mountain is bigger than you. Nature is bigger than you. Life is bigger than you. And yet, you find strength in that.\u201d",
    "His journey is proof that greatness often comes not from triumph, but from humility, reflection, and grit.",
    "So when Johann Peries unfurled the Sri Lankan flag at the roof of each continent, he wasn\u2019t just marking personal achievement. He was planting a seed of possibility in every Sri Lankan heart.",
