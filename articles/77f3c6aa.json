    "In a strategic move to ensure continuity and growth, Gunewardena has transferred his equity in the business to the current CEO, Sheron Jayasundara, entrusting her with the mantle to carry forward the agency\u2019s distinguished legacy for the benefit of its talented team and valued clients.",
    "The agency created history when it became affiliated to the global advertising network Bates in its inception year and followed up with several other pioneering moves. Since its inception, NGage Strategic Alliance has been at the forefront of IMC and PR in Sri Lanka, being the first ad agency to introduce PR and an international PR network, Rowland Communications Worldwide, to Sri Lanka. Following this, came its BTL affiliation with the 141 Worldwide network and a media affiliation with MediaEdge, a WPP media specialist. In 2008, the agency forged an affiliation with the global PR giant Burson-Marsteller, which continued for a decade, and more recently joined hands with Astrum, a reputation advisory fast growing in South Asia with global outreach through IPRN.",

As a SLIM Past President, Founder President of the Four A\u2019s and Founder member of PRASL, he is widely recognised for his contributions to industry advancement, thought leadership and marketing and communications education.",
    "Sheron Jayasundara, an accomplished professional and CIM graduate with over three decades of experience in the ad industry including her 25-year career at NGage, and elected as a two-term President of the Four As, she has been the face and driving force behind NGage\u2019s client and awards success in recent years. As COO and then CEO, she demonstrated exceptional leadership, steering the agency through the recent difficult years and further solidifying its position as an industry leader. Jayasundara\u2019s deep understanding of client needs, combined with her team management prowess positions NGage Strategic Alliance for continued growth and success.",
    "\u201cI am honoured to take forward the legacy that Nimal has built over the years,\u201d said Sheron Jayasundara. \u201cNGage will continue to uphold its commitment to delivering excellence, fostering innovation, and empowering our talented team to achieve their fullest potential.\u201d",
