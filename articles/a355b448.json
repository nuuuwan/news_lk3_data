    "Inside the auditorium a woman said she and other visitors rushed towards the stage, as soon as they realised shots were being fired. \"I saw a person in the stalls with a sidearm and there were cracks [of gunfire] going off, I was trying to crawl behind a loudspeaker,\" she told Russian TV.",
    "Fire and plumes of smoke rose into the sky and the hall's facade burst into flames as glass on the top two floors of the building blew out.",
    "The fire appeared to have started when the attackers threw some kind of incendiary device.",
