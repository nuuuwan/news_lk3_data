  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013Election Commission has halted an appointment made by new Port Minister Vijitha Herath to the state-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) after the former official complained to the EC citing the move was against the election laws.",
    "Minister Herath appointed the new Managing Director after replacing Prabath Malavige who has nearly ten years of service remaining. The move was done without prior notice to Malavige, SLPA officials told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cThe complaint states that a new SLPA Managing Director has been appointed while asking to vacate the current MD Prabath J Malavige immediately from the post,\u201d B P C Kularatne, the additional Election Commissioner in charge of law, investigations and planning at the EC wrote in a letter to the Secretary of the Port Ministry.",
    "\u201cThis is a kind reminder to submit a report after suspending the appointment and probing the incident as this transfer has been carried out without the knowledge of the Election Commission while the parliament election has been called on.\u201d",
    "The EC has scheduled the parliamentary election on November 14.",
    "Herath has also appointed a new chairman which has been usually a political appointment.",
    "An SLPA official said the unprecedented move in SLPA was done is a surprise to Malavige",
    "\u201cFortunately, the Election Commission intervened, ordering the ministry\u2019s secretary not only to reinstate the current Managing Director but also to refrain from making any such changes until after the parliamentary election,\u201d the SLPA official said. (Colombo/October 05/2024)"
