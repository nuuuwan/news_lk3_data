    "The Attorney General\u2019s Department yesterday informed the Supreme Court that specific provisions of the Private Member\u2019s Motion submitted by Sri Lanka Podujanaa Peramuna (SLPP) MP Jayantha Ketagoda, which aimed to re-convene dissolved Local Government bodies without holding elections is in violation of the constitution.",
    "The bill proposed by the MP aimed to amend the Municipal Ordinances pertaining to urban councils and municipal councils, granting the subject minister the authority to recall Local Government Institutions for a period of time as deemed necessary.",
    "An Additional Solicitor General representing the Attorney General in court said that if the bill is to be passed, it must be done through a special majority in parliament and requires a public referendum.",
    "The Additional Solicitor General made the announcement regarding the bill when 27 petitions filed against the proposed legislation by MP Jayantha Ketagoda were brought up for examination. The petitioners are seeking an order from the Supreme Court declaring the bill unconstitutional. Ketagoda\u2019s proposal has faced strong criticism from various parties, with many condemning it as a significant threat to the people\u2019s sovereignty, which is safeguarded in the Constitution."
