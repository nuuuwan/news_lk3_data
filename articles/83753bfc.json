    "\u201cDo they use the app to kill elephants?\u201d It\u2019s a question that\u2019s been floating around social media and public discourse lately. But for those involved in the field\u2014people who\u2019ve spent years working to mitigate human-elephant conflict\u2014the question seems not only absurd but dangerously misinformed.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to laugh,\u201d says Vinura Abeyrathne,the youngster who cereated the Elephant App, with the support of team members who helped craft Sri Lanka\u2019s National Policy for Minimising Human-Elephant Conflict (2020). \u201cBecause if that was really the case, what were people using during the past 70 years when elephants were shot? They didn\u2019t have an app then, did they?\u201d",
    "Vinura, along with Wildlife Ranger Saman Hallholuwa, is part of a team behind the Elephant Journey mobile app, a community-based conservation tool aimed at increasing public awareness and real-time reporting of elephant movements to reduce conflict and improve safety for both humans and elephants.",
    "The app\u2019s core philosophy is built around a powerful truth: \u201cAwareness is conservation.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about knowing an elephant is nearby,\u201d Vinura explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping people respond smarter, safer. If a farmer knows a wild elephant is near his field, he can take steps to protect himself and avoid confrontation.\u201d",
    "But like any new technology, especially in rural settings, skepticism and resistance are expected. \u201cWhen online learning came along, people doubted that too. But now it\u2019s a part of everyday life,\u201d he adds.",
    "Vinura has combed through years of data on elephant deaths in Sri Lanka. What he found was revealing:",
    "\u201cNearly 99% of elephant deaths are due to direct shootings\u2014typically in sudden confrontations with people who have firearms, not from poachers or outsiders coming in to kill elephants for ivory or meat,\u201d he says.",
    "Most deaths happen when a farmer or villager, often caught off guard, shoots the elephant in self-defence\u2014usually aiming for the head. \u201cThese aren\u2019t targeted killings. They\u2019re chaotic, tragic incidents in tense moments.\u201d",
    "He also points out that ivory poaching is incredibly rare in Sri Lanka. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard of a single confirmed case recently where a tusker was killed for ivory. If anyone has a legally proven case, they\u2019re welcome to share it.\u201d",
    "The Elephant Journey app is not a tracking device for hunters; it\u2019s a location-based reporting system.",
    "If an elephant is spotted near a village, a user can submit a report.",
    "Only users within a 5-kilometre radius of that area can see the alert.",
    "Users do not receive constant notifications unless the report is relevant to their location.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t just sit in Colombo and see where elephants are in Monaragala,\u201d Vinura clarifies. \u201cThe app is designed to prevent panic and avoid misuse.\u201d",
    "Some worry that the app will attract onlookers hoping to \u201csee\u201d elephants. Vinura dismisses this:",
    "\u201cPeople in these rural areas see elephants all the time. They\u2019re not going to flock around a spot just because someone submitted a report. These aren\u2019t safari tourists. These are villagers trying whose lives are in danger just outside their front doors.\u201d",
    "Even if someone does show up out of curiosity, he says, it can also trigger empathy. \u201cYou see a baby elephant, a mother, you start to think: why are they here? What are they going through? That\u2019s where awareness begins.\u201d",
    "And what about the argument that someone could use the app to find and shoot an elephant?",
    "\u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d argues Vinura. \u201cTo shoot an elephant, you don\u2019t wait for an app report. These aren\u2019t stealth operations, most shootings happen in someone\u2019s backyard, not hidden in a jungle.\u201d",
    "In fact, Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t even have the kind of deep wilderness where poachers can hide for days. \u201cThere are no secret elephant-hunting gangs tracking elephants via apps,\u201d adds Ranger Saman Hallholuwa. \u201cIt\u2019s the local guy with a gun, scared for his life, making a tragic decision.\u201d",
    "The real genius of the Elephant Journey app is its simplicity. It empowers local communities to report, avoid, and understand elephants instead of reacting with fear or violence.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t create this tool for academics or NGOs,\u201d says Vinura. \u201cWe made it for farmers, children, mothers or anyone living with the threat of elephants outside their door.\u201d",
    "In his words, the question \u201cDo they kill elephants using the app?\u201d is as illogical as asking, \u201cDo people cause accidents because of Google Maps?\u201d",
    "Elephant conservation is no longer just about protecting animals in distant forests. It\u2019s about coexistence in real time in backyards, on roads, and in farmlands.",
    "\u201cThis app doesn\u2019t kill elephants,\u201d says Vinura. \u201cIt might be one of the few things that can help keep them alive.\u201d",
    "Because in the end, saving elephants starts with understanding them\u2014and understanding begins with awareness.",
    "The Elephant Journey App is available for download on Android and iOS.",
    "Developed by conservation professionals and wildlife experts to support real-time, community-based human-elephant coexistence.",
