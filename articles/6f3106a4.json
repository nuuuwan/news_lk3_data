    "SLPP decides to replace district leaders who extended support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe",
    "SLPP\u2019s Kanchana Wijesekera says, despite being stripped of posts, they will not withdraw support for Ranil Wickremesinghe",
    "Claims more MPs are likely to announce decision to support Wickremesinghe in coming days",
    "Urges party leadership to reconsider decision to field a different candidate or risk losing support of its members",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs who extended their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently have refused to withdraw their support, despite the party taking steps to replace some of its district leaders due to their backing of Wickremesinghe.",
    "The party appointed several new district leaders yesterday to replace those who announced their support to the President, in defiance of the SLPP\u2019s decision to field its own candidate at the 21 September election.",
    "SLPP Anuradhapura District Leader S.M. Chandrasena was replaced by SLPP National Organiser Namal Rajapaksa, while SLPP Gampaha District Leader Prasanna Ranatunge was replaced by State Minister Indika Anuruddha. Minister Kanchana Wijesekera\u2019s Matara District leadership was handed over to MP Nipuna Ranawaka. Meanwhile, Minister Ramesh Pathirana was stripped of the Galle District leadership, and State Minister Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva was appointed in his place.",
    "Communiques have also been issued to party members urging adherence to party discipline, accompanied by a warning that failure to comply could result in the loss of party membership.",
    "Speaking to the media, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said removing him or others from their party positions will not influence them to go back on their decision to support Wickremesinghe. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from media reports that some of us have been removed from our party positions. They might send us letters, hold disciplinary inquiries, but they won\u2019t be able to change the opinion of those who have already made their decision,\u201d he said.",
    "Wijesekera mentioned that a majority of party MPs share the same stance and that more MPs, including SLPP stalwart Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, are likely to announce their decision to support Wickremesinghe in the coming days.",
    "Wijesekera said if the party does not reconsider its decision to field a different candidate, it risks losing the support of its members. \u201cIt is unclear how many will remain in this state,\u201d he said, noting that over 100 ruling party MPs have already extended their support to Wickremesinghe.",
    "According to reports, SLPP district committees in Kandy, Ratnapura, Kegalle, and Nuwara Eliya were convened over the weekend, where proposals to support Wickremesinghe were passed unanimously."
