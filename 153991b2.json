  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sierra Leone\u2019s president declared a nationwide curfew Sunday after gunmen attacked the military\u2019s main and largest barracks in the West African nation\u2019s capital and then overran detention centers, including a major prison.",
    "The attack raised fears of a breakdown of order amid a surge of coups in the region.",
    "The detention centers, including the Pademba Road Prisons \u2014 holding more than 2,000 inmates \u2014 were attacked just as security forces fought to restore calm during sustained shootouts at the Wilberforce military barracks, according to Information Minister Chernor Bah.",
    "\u201cThe prisons were overrun (and) some prisoners were abducted by the assailants while many others were released,\u201d Bah said. Security forces managed to \u201cpush back\u201d the assailants to the outskirts of the city where fighting continues, he added.",
    "Sierra Leone\u2019s President Julius Maada Bio earlier declared a nationwide curfew in response to the attacks.",
    "An Associated Press journalist in the capital said that gunshots were still heard in the city hours after the government assured residents of calm, although it wasn\u2019t clear who was behind the exchange of fire, nor if any arrests were made.",
    "\u201cThe security forces are making progress in the operation to defeat and apprehend those responsible for today\u2019s attacks,\u201d Bah said. \u201cThe government remains in control and on top of the situation.\u201d",
    "The president and the country\u2019s Ministry of Information and Education also both said that the government and security forces are in control of the situation, trying to dismiss fears of a possible escalation of violence in the country whose population of 8 million people is among the poorest in the world, having some of the lowest scores on the U.N. Human Development Index.",
    "No details were immediately given about the gunmen or the reason for the attack, which comes months after Bio was reelected for a second term in a disputed vote in which the main opposition party accused the electoral commission of rigging the results.",
    "Videos posted online showed soldiers patrolling Freetown\u2019s empty streets and captured the loud blasts of gunshots at dawn. The AP couldn\u2019t immediately verify the authenticity of the videos.",
    "West Africa\u2019s regional economic bloc ECOWAS \u2014 of which Sierra Leone is a member \u2014 described the incident as a plot \u201cto acquire arms and disturb the peace and constitutional order\u201d in the country. The bloc has in recent months tried to reverse the surge in coups in West and Central Africa, which has recorded eight military takeovers since 2020, the latest in Niger and Gabon this year.",
    "\u201cECOWAS reiterates its zero tolerance for unconstitutional change of government,\u201d the bloc said in a statement.",
    "Bio was reelected in Sierra Leone\u2019s fifth presidential election since the end of a brutal 11-year civil war \u2014 more than two decades ago \u2014 which left tens of thousands of people dead and destroyed the country\u2019s economy.",
    "He continues to face criticism because of debilitating economic conditions. Nearly 60% of Sierra Leone\u2019s population is facing poverty, with the youth unemployment rate being one of the highest in West Africa.",
    "Two months after Bio won the disputed vote, police said they arrested several people, including senior military officers planning to use protests \u201cto undermine peace\u201d in the country.",
    "A protest against the government in August last year resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people, including six police officers."
