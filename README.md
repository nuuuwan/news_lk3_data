Sri Lankan banks’ operating environment (OE) assessment and overall credit profiles will be supported by any improvement in the sovereign’s credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: RD, Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) following a completed debt restructuring, says Fitch Ratings.

“This is due to the strong link between sovereign financial health and banks’ operating conditions. We believe this would be positive for the National Ratings of Fitch-rated large Sri Lankan banks – albeit based on their creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers,” the rating agency said.

Sri Lankan banks’ current OE score of ‘ccc-’/stable is linked closely to the sovereign’s local-currency credit profile, given their predominant exposure to the domestic economy and government securities (local-currency treasury instruments: 33.4% of assets and foreign currency instruments: 3.4% at end-1H24) and lending to the broader public sector.

The appeal is clear, says Flash Pack: “Sri Lanka packs in all the punch of India – only on a smaller, more accessible scale, and delivered at a much slower pace.” The company highlights diverse experiences from “incense-swirled cities, buzzing with tuk tuks” to “misty highlands steeped in tea plantations” and dramatic coastlines.

“But where Sri Lanka really comes into its own,” the company adds, “is its easy-going balance of beaches, spoiling hotels and restorative, delicately spiced food.”

In a landmark achievement, Sri Lanka has seen a 75% increase in female representation in Parliament following the recent election, with a total of 22 women now set to serve as Members of Parliament.

This number is just over 9% out of the total MP representation in Parliament, up from the previous 6%. The previous Parliament had just 12 female MPs, but this election has ushered in 21 newly elected female candidates.

Additionally, the National People’s Power (NPP) has appointed Attorney-at-Law Lakmali Hemachandra to one of its 18 National List seats, further boosting the figure to 22.

The number could potentially rise if other political parties, such as the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), decide to allocate one of their National List positions to a female candidate, further enhancing gender representation in the legislature.

MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday attended the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament as the National List appointment of the New Democratic Front (NDF).

Speaking to the media, he affirmed that his appointment via the NDF’s National List was legal, insisting that he was rightfully nominated by the party.

“It is just two members who are making a big fuss over my nomination, not the entire party,” he claimed, commenting on the controversy surrounding his nomination as the NDF National List candidate.

MP Karunanayake argued that as a senior member of the United National Party (UNP) he has sacrificed a lot and underwent many challenges for the betterment of the party. “We cannot sacrifice our party for the benefit of mere 2-3% of people. Those who know, know,” he said.  Karunanayake said once the agreements that were agreed by the parties are released to the public domain, it will answer many of these questions.
