    "Matara electoral organizer of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Sajin Vass Gunawardena criticized the speech made by former minister Basil Rajapaksa at Friday's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna national convention.",
    "He pointed out that former minister Basil Rajapaksa threatened the public, quoting him as saying, \"When you pelt stones at the dog, it runs, but when you pelt stones at the lion, it fights back. But he needs to remember that sometimes dogs bite too and that a lion pursues the tasks it promised to his family, that he failed to do.\"",
    "Sajin Vass also stressed on the Supreme Court ruling that determined Basil Rajapaksa as one of the group that was responsible for Sri Lanka's bankruptcy.",
    "He also challenged Basil and the SLPP to hold elections as soon as possible.",
