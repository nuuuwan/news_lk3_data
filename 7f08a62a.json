    "COLOMBO (News 1st); People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals (PETA) said it is grateful to Sri Lanka\u2019s government for nixing a plan to export 100,000 monkeys to China and for recognizing that they aren\u2019t commodities to be bought and sold.",
    "\u201cThese monkeys do not belong in captivity. It is almost certain that, once in China, they would be funneled into biomedical experiments and dead within months,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Jones-Engel, the PETA Senior Science Advisor.",
    "As Sri Lankan animal groups\u2014including the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka\u2014and primate experts showed, these macaques are individuals with families who live in tight-knit communities.",
    "PETA had written to the Sri Lankan government \u00a0urging them to cancel the sale of the monkeys, who would likely have ended up in laboratories where they would have been tormented and killed.",
    "30 petitioners including the Wildlife and Nature protection Society of Sri Lanka have filed action in the Court of Appeal against the statement made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera regarding the exporting of toque macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to China.",
