  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says the extension granted to C.D Wickramaratne is a distortion",
    "Asks Constitutional Council to step in to appoint a suitable IGP",
    "Claims tussle within Govt. on appointment could threaten SL\u2019s national security",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member and MP Prof. G.L Peiris yesterday called the inability of authorities to appoint a new Inspector General of Police, simply tragic. \u201cIs there no one suitable?\u201d the MP asked.",
    "Peiris called the move to extend the tenure of IGP C.D Wickramaratne instead of appointing a new IGP a distortion and said the Constitutional Council must step in to appoint a suitable IGP immediately. \u201cThe Constitutional Council has a duty to do so,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP drew attention to the alarming surge in diverse criminal activities, which encompassed crimes like murders, rape, and drug smuggling. The MP emphasised that countering this escalating crime wave necessitates the establishment of a highly efficient Police service.",
    "\u201cThe tussle within the Government to appoint the next IGP could even threaten the country\u2019s national security,\u201d Peiris warned.",
    "Peiris said the possibility of the current government successfully apprehending thieves is a mere dream. He went on to assert that the government has even gone as far as pilfering the very bill that was initially introduced with the intention of capturing these criminals.",
    "Commenting on the Private Members Bill presented by MP Jayantha Ketagoda relating to Local Government Institutions, Peiris said if it is approved, the Prime Minister would wield supreme authority as the minister responsible for the subject. \u201cThis suggests a significant concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister,\u201d he said.",
    "Peiris also expressed the belief that if the proposal is implemented, local government representatives would have the ability to retain their positions for an extended duration, essentially allowing them to stay in office as long as they desired."
