    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A Sri Lanka rubber traders group has said the government\u2019s decision to abolish the Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) scheme from October 1 would cause \u2018severe and far-reaching consequences\u2019, and urged it to differ or phase it out.",
    "\u201cRemoving SVAT without a tested and operational refund mechanism will trigger widespread financial distress across Sri Lanka\u2019s natural rubber industry, threatening smallholder livelihoods, SME viability, export competitiveness, and foreign exchange inflows vital to the nation\u2019s recovery,\u201d the Colombo Rubber Traders\u2019 Association (CRTA) said in a statement.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s natural rubber sector supports tens of thousands of smallholder farmers, CRTA pointed out.",
    "\u201cThe removal of SVAT will force manufacturers to pay billions in VAT upfront, causing delays in purchasing raw rubber and exerting downward pressure on farm gate prices.\u201d",
    "SMEs within the rubber supply chain \u2014 who provide essential raw materials, processing, and services \u2014 will be disproportionately affected, the association said.",
    "\u201cWith limited access to financing, these businesses cannot absorb the burden of upfront VAT payments, putting many on the brink of collapse.",
    "\u201cSuch a collapse would reverse decades of progress in building local value chains, destroy jobs, and erode the industrial backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s rubber economy.\u201d",
    "Exporters already strained by high operational costs and volatile global demand now face crippling liquidity risks due to uncertainty over VAT refund timelines, it said.",
    "\u201cWithout SVAT, these companies will be forced to tie up working capital or resort to expensive borrowing, further squeezing already thin margins.\u201d",
    "\u201cMany companies simply cannot afford to have their cash blocked for 45 days or more,\u201d Harin de Silva, Chairman of CRTA said.",
    "\u201cIf this happens, they will be forced to reduce operations, delay payments, or even shift to importing raw materials \u2014 putting local suppliers at risk and discouraging foreign investment.\u201d",
    "Although Sri Lanka\u2019s Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has promised VAT refunds within 45 days, CRTA points out that there is a complete lack of confidence in the readiness of the system.",
    "\u201cThe proposed risk-based digital refund mechanism is still in its infancy, with crucial components such as e-invoicing yet to be fully implemented.\u201d",
    "\u2013 Defer or phase out SVAT only after a fully operational and proven digital refund mechanism is in place",
    "\u2013 Protect smallholder farmers and rural communities whose incomes depend on uninterrupted market access",
    "\u2013 Support SMEs from cash flow shocks that could lead to widespread closures",
    "\u2013 Safeguard Sri Lanka\u2019s export economy and preserve urgently needed foreign currency inflows",
    "\u201cRemoving SVAT in the absence of a functioning refund system risks plunging the entire value chain into chaos. The",
    "Government must act responsibly and decisively to prevent irreversible damage,\u201d de Silva said. (Colombo/Sep28/2025)"
