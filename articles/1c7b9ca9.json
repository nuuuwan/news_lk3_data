    "Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne yesterday informed Parliament that he needed more time to study the no-faith motion, submitted by the Opposition against Deputy Minister of Defence Maj. Gen. (retd.) Aruna Jayasekera, and reveal his opinion thereon. Some government bigwigs have already declared that a no-faith motion cannot be moved against a deputy minister, and therefore speculation is rife in political circles that the Opposition\u2019s efforts will be in vain. However, the issue the Opposition has raised through the no-faith motion will not go away.",
    "The government\u2019s argument that no-confidence motions cannot be moved against deputy ministers does not have a leg to stand on. The Constitution and the Standing Orders do not say that a no-faith motion cannot be moved against a deputy minister, as some legal experts have rightly pointed out. It is hoped that the government will not throw away the rule book, and bulldoze its way through.",
    "In a bid to bolster its claim that no-faith motions can be moved not only against ministers but also against others, the SJB has cited what President J. R. Jayewardene\u2019s government did to TULF leader A. Amirthalingam in 1981. This argument, we believe, is self-defeating. A motion of no confidence was moved against the then Opposition Leader Amirthalingam, but its passage had no effect on him, as he did not have to command the confidence of the entire Parliament to function as the Opposition Leader; he only had to enjoy the confidence of the Opposition. That unprecedented, despicable no-confidence motion, which irreparably damaged the reputation of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, cannot be considered a precedent worthy of emulation by any stretch of the imagination. That said, it will be a mistake for the NPP government not to take up the no-faith motion against Jayasekera for debate.",
    "The government finds itself in a dilemma. Defeating the no-faith motion against Jayasekera is child\u2019s play for the NPP with a two-thirds majority in Parliament, but it is wary of doing so lest it should antagonise the Catholic Church, which is of the opinion that the credibility of the ongoing investigations into the Easter Sunday tragedy will be compromised if Jayasekera continues to function as the Deputy Minister of Defence. Jayasekera was the Security Forces Commander in the Easter Province at the time of the Easter Sunday terror strikes, and serious allegations have been levelled against the military personnel who rushed to the safe houses of the NTJ terrorists in the East in the immediate aftermath of the carnage. Therefore, the government will do everything in its power to prevent the no-faith motion against Jayasekera from being taken up for debate. It is bound to go all out to abort the motion on some flimsy pretext. However, the argument of the Catholic Church at issue will remain valid and erode the credibility and integrity of the probes into the Easter Sunday attacks unless Jayasekera steps down or is removed.",
    "However, one should not be so na\u00efve as to think that if Jayasekera ceases to be the Deputy Defence Minister, by any chance, that will pave the way for an independent, impartial probe into the Easter Sunday attacks. With or without him in that position, the government can still suppress evidence against him, if any. Two NPP political activists, namely former SDIG in charge of the CID, Ravi Seneviratne and former CID Director SSP (retd.) Shani Abeysekera, function as the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security and the Director of the CID respectively. Strangely, those who are concerned about the credibility of the Easter Sunday carnage have not asked for the removal of Seneviratne and Abeysekera from those positions as they actively campaigned for the NPP. More importantly, it has also been alleged that they did not act on intelligence provided by the SIS (State Intelligence Service) in early April 2019 about the impending Easter Sunday terror attacks. The SJB cannot be expected to do anything that will adversely affect the interests of Seneviratne and Abeysekera because its leaders were in the Yahapalana government, which used the CID to do political work; this fact is borne out by a leaked audio clip of a telephone conversation between Abeysekara and the then Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake. If the practice of catapulting retired police officers loyal to the ruling party to the top posts in the police continues, future governments will follow that precedent, pull their favourite cops out of retirement and appoint them as CID Director, etc., to safeguard their interests and launch witch-hunts against their political opponents.",
