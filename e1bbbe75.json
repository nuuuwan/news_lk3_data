    "It appears to be spreading quickly and could be one reason why there has been a recent rise in cases and hospitalizations.",
    "\u201cWe continue to see a rise in COVID-19 cases in this week's report. We have also seen a small rise in hospital admission rates in most age groups, particularly among the elderly. Overall levels of admission still remain extremely low and we are not currently seeing a similar increase in ICU admissions,\u201d said Dr Mary Ramsay, UKHSA's Head of Immunisation.",
    "Officials further say they are \"closely\" monitoring the situation as COVID case rates continue to rise.",
    "In this context, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said though people are better protected by vaccines and prior infection, countries should not let down their guard. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
