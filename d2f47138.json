    "Ceylinco Life has been ranked the most valuable brand in Sri Lanka\u2019s insurance industry across both Life and General Insurance categories in the 2023 rankings of the country\u2019s top 100 brands published by Brand Finance, the world\u2019s leading independent brand valuation consultancy.",
    "Brand Finance has assigned a brand value of Rs 3.5 billion for the Ceylinco Life brand, which is higher than the value of the highest-ranked brand in the General insurance sector as well, in the recently released rankings. Ceylinco Life has also moved up one place in the overall rankings to 27th position on Brand Finance\u2019s \u2018Sri Lanka 100\u2019 which include the largest banks, telcos, conglomerates and retail giants.",
    "Ceylinco Life has also received a \u2018AA\u2019 Brand Rating from Brand Finance this year which denotes its low credit risk and strong ability to meet financial obligations.",
    "Commenting on the Company\u2019s latest ranking by Brand Finance, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said: \u201cWe have consistently been recognised as the most valuable life insurance brand in Sri Lanka. Reaching the top of the entire insurance sector in a year that has witnessed an overall drop in brand values due to the challenges faced by the country, speaks volumes for the resilience of the brand. This is an important validation that the Ceylinco Life brand has continued to build trust and confidence among consumers.\u201d",
    "Referring to the life insurance industry in the country, the Brand Finance report noted that \u201cthe Life Insurance industry has faced challenges due to reduced disposable income caused by inflation, rupee devaluation and tax reforms, leading to a decline in demand and premium payment capacity. Additionally, increasing interest rates have diverted clients towards alternative investment options, posing a threat to the life insurance business.\u201d",
    "\u201cCeylinco Life was able to retain its position as the top-ranked brand in the Life Insurance segment in Sri Lanka 100 and, amongst other life insurers Ceylinco Life records the lowest drop in the brand value (-9% comparing to 2022 FY),\u201d Brand Finance said.",
    "In addition to calculating brand value, Brand Finance also determines the relative strength of brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance. Compliant with ISO 20671, Brand Finance\u2019s assessment of stakeholder equity incorporates original market research data from over 100,000 respondents in 38 countries and across 31 sectors.",
    "Ceylinco Life ended 2022 with assets of Rs 191.5 billion, consolidated income of Rs 45.63 billion, gross written premium income of Rs 29.16 billion, a Life Fund of Rs 134.9 billion and an investment portfolio of Rs 165.9 billion.
