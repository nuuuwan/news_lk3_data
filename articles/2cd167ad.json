    "What Washington asked Sri Lanka not to do in the name of democracy, during Aragalaya in 2022, is being done in the US! There have been police crackdowns on US university students engaged in protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Hundreds of undergrads have so far been arrested and their encampments in university premises broken up. Columbia University has cancelled in-person classes in view of student protests.",
    "According to international media reports, the New York police descended on a student protest at a plaza near New York University after nightfall, the other day, arrested dozens of protesters, and pulled down their tents. They used force to neutralise the protesters who offered resistance. What the New York police did was similar to the crackdown we witnessed at Galle Face immediately after the elevation of Ranil Wickremesinghe to the presidency in 2022. Have the US police taken a leaf out of their Sri Lankan counterparts\u2019 book, or is it the other way around?",
    "American higher education institutions shaken by student protests against Israeli aggression in Gaza and police crackdowns in the US include Yale, Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California, Berkeley, Princeton, and University of Michigan.",
    "The unfolding drama in the US reminds us of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. The New York police crushed protest marches, using as they did pepper spray, etc., on protesters. Hundreds of OWS protesters who rose against growing inequality owing to corporate influence on the US government were arrested. However, they inspired people to hold similar protests in more than 900 cities in 82 countries across the world. Eleven years later, the US government took up the cudgels on behalf of those who were engaged in \u2018occupy\u2019 protests in Sri Lanka!",
    "Why is the US, which pontificates to the rest of the world on the virtues of democratic rights, and even makes interventions to ensure that they are protected, crushing student protests ruthlessly instead of heeding the youth\u2019s call for an end to the massacres in Gaza. After all, the Biden government itself has been compelled to declare that it is contemplating sanctions to rein in Israel, which continues its military operations in Gaza in spite of their enormous human, social and economic costs.",
    "Washington censured President Wickremesinghe for chasing away protesters to clear Galle Face and enable the Presidential Secretariat to reopen in 2022. The Biden administration urged Colombo to tolerate democratic dissent and heed the voice of protesters. The question is why it is not practising what it preaches to others.",
    "American university students have demonstrated that they have a sense of justice and a concern for human lives. They are right in holding protests to crank up pressure on their government to step in to stop massacres in Gaza. True, Hamas must be condemned for its acts of terror in October 2023, when it invaded some parts of Israel, killed many Israelis and took hundreds of civilians hostage. It must release all hostages without further delay. Israel\u2019s right to self-defence cannot be questioned. But the Netanyahu government is using the Hamas atrocities as an excuse for its brutal campaign against Palestinian civilians. Its killing spree must be stopped forthwith, as the US students are rightly demanding.",
    "Some Jewish students have reportedly complained of antisemitic harassment in recent days, and their complaints must be probed and action taken against the culprits, but crackdowns on protests against Israeli attacks on civilians in Gaza cannot be countenanced on any grounds.",
    "The civilised world wept for Jews during Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Today, a hawkish Jewish government is making the world weep for Palestinians. The voice of moderate Jews who detest violence is suppressed.",
    "The protesting US university students, we believe, represent America\u2019s conscience, which is being systematically suppressed by the Washington-based hawks who thrive on bloody conflicts around the world. There is no way the Biden administration can cover its nudity.",
