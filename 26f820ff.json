    "The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) has introduced an online web portal to manage the recruitment process within the BOI. This latest initiative is in line with the digital transformation strategy of the Board. The first for a Government department. The platform is an in-house developed platform by the BOI IT team with the collaboration of the BOI HR department. The initiative of BOI aims to onboard young and dynamic graduates who want to carve a successful career with the BOI.",
    "The online platform will enable job seekers to register with BOI web site real-time and apply for BOI vacancies when they get published. The system is capable of processing the applications. The applicants can submit their details and CVs via this online portal and communicate online with the BOI until the end of the recruitment process. The new system has digitised several of the BOI HR department processes that were done manually. The system is accessible via the mobile application of the BOI.
