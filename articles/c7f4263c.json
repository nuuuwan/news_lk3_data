    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The European Union and the United States have reached a 15 percent tariff deal President Donald Trump said would be \u2018all inclusive\u2019 according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
    "Trump said the US was talking to a number of other countries and he was \u201cdoing them at the low end, not the high end because we don\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u201d",
    "More discussions are also on with China he indicated describing the existing agreement as a \u2018sort of\u2019 deal.",
    "Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had discussions with the US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer Friday as discussions to lower tariffs continue.",

    "\u201cWe are agreeing that the tariff straight across for automobiles and everything else will   be a straight across tariff of 15 percent,\u201d Trump said at a joint briefing with von der Leyen on the EU deal.",
    "\u201cWe have the opening up of all of the European countries which I think I could say were essentially closed.",
    "\u201cI mean they weren\u2019t exactly taking our autos. You weren\u2019t exactly taking our agriculture and then you would have smaller things but for the most part it was closed and now it\u2019s open.",
    "The EU agreed to buy 750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest an additional 600 billion dollars of investments into the U.S. above current levels, Trump said.",
    "EU investments in the US are a key driver of America\u2019s trade deficit and more investments will widen it. The EU will also buy an unspecified volume of American defence equipment.",
    "Trump\u2019s and his key advisor Harvard qualified Peter Navarro\u2019s understanding of the trade deficit rejects economics and is based on spurious Mercantilism, critics say.",
    "\u201cWe have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world,\u201d Leyen said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s a huge deal. It will bring stability. It will bring predictability. That\u2019s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.",
    "\u201cWe just struck a deal  with Japan as you know and we\u2019re very  close to a deal with China,\u201d Trump said.",
    "\u201cWe really sort of made a deal with China, but we\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd we have numerous other deals. And mostly I\u2019m just going to charge tariffs and you know there\u2019s not a deal per se, but people are going to pay tariffs and we\u2019re doing them at the low end, not the high end because we don\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u201d"
