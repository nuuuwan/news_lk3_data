### Lack of access to finance major barrier to women’s empowerment in Sri Lanka: study

The study has found that, despite a commendable literacy rate, disparities in financial and digital literacy hinders access to financial services.

The Advocata Institute said in a statement on the study that Sri Lanka has been struggling with inadequate digital infrastructure and a regulatory environment where vulnerable populations, notably women, face exploitation and marginalisation which contributed to restricting women’s access to finance. Other barriers, which include the lack of digital and financial literacy, drove consumers, especially women, towards informal financial services.

With the ship barreling toward the bridge at “a very, very rapid speed,” authorities had just enough time to stop cars from coming over the bridge, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said.

Colombo, March 27 (Daily Mirror) - The prolonged breakdown of one of the linear accelerators at the Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, which predominantly treats the pediatric patients has placed hundreds of lives at risk.

Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the linear accelerator, crucial for administering radiotherapy — a vital cancer treatment, has been non-operational since February.

Despite the severity of the situation, the Health Ministry has turned a blind eye by not taking remedial measures to rectify the issue, exacerbating the concerns.

Apeksha Hospital currently houses five linear accelerators, each playing a pivotal role in delivering various treatments. However, the malfunctioning machine holds particular significance for pediatric patients due to its specialized features.

Furthermore, the breakdown has resulted in a backlog of over 500 patients awaiting treatment, plunging many, especially children, into precarious circumstances where their lives hang in the balance.

Says softer than expected inflation provided space to resume cuts

Expresses confidence of maintaining mid-term inflation at targeted range between 4% to 6%

The Central Bank yesterday resumed cuts by further reducing key policy rates by 50 basis points as inflation remains anchored. The move was also to further ease the financial conditions with a view to support and accelerate the expansion of the economy.

The rates cut came after a four months hiatus since November 22 last year, when the Central Bank said they would pause any more reduction until both, the government securities yields and the lending rates, fall broadly in line with the policy rates.

Although both yields and rates eased thereafter, quite notably the yields showed some reversal in the last four weeks while the softening in lending rates slowed, the Central Bank said.

In 1989 Kumar Gunaratnam operating under the nom de guerre “Gemunu” led the JVP/DJV against the Indian army in the Trincomalee District. Under his command, the DJV-JVP in Trinco accomplished a few military strikes against the Indian Army but these incidents did not gain much publicity due to the concerted efforts of the Sri Lankan and Indian authorities to deliberately suppress information. They did not want the JVP to gain publicity and political credit through these operations. Besides most incidents of that nature in Trincomalee were believed to have been committed by the Tigers then. Although the mass media of the day have not publicised this phase, there is some important material available in books, monographs and research papers

### Hot air over elections and Commissioner of Elections - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-27 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Hot-air-over-elections-and-Commissioner-of-Elections-EDITORIAL/172-279651) · `en`

The Commissioner of Elections made it clear to all Lankans that the presidential elections would be held in a timely manner in keeping with Constitutional requirements.

To him we owe a vote of thanks. Many a citizen had begun to doubt whether elections -presidential or general elections- would be held at any time in the near future, given the number of elections postponed via sleight of hand over the years.

Even as we pen these lines, our country is going through one of the hottest periods weather-wise. As though this were not bad enough, political party leaders and their followers are also breathing fire at their opponents, adding to the heat.

We continue witnessing intra-party squabbles in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and dirty linen being washed in public. The ‘National People’s Power is gaining in popularity. But in the past it has not been able to turn this into actual votes.

The year 2024 is already seeing a turnaround for private equity deals with Sri Lanka expecting deals amounting up to USD 250 million, says the Hong Kong-based merchant banking firm MCM Partners.

Speaking to Bloomberg Markets Asia on Monday (March 25), Managing Director of MCM Partners Jahnavi Bhagwati explained as to why she sees a turnaround for private equity deals in 2024 as opposed to a sluggish 2023.

According to her, countries like India and Sri Lanka, which is a turnaround story, are going to present opportunities in the private space this year after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March, ending the country’s historic era of negative interest rates in a move that marked a historic shift in monetary policy.

Bhagwati mentioned that the stock markets in the region are already seeing a pickup as inflation has been curbed, adding that investment activity will spur when rate cuts kick in.
