    "Former Director of the Police Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) DIG Nalaka Silva was released from all charges concerning the VIP assassination plot by the Colombo Magistrates Court yesterday.",
    "Silva was released by Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage after the Attorney General informed the courts that there was insufficient evidence to go ahead with the case.",
    "The top cop was arrested on 25 October 2018 and promptly interdicted after being accused of plotting to assassinate several VIPs including former President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa while he was the Defence Secretary. Silva was arrested based on a claim by a former Police informant and the self-styled Director (Operations) of the Anti-Corruption Force Namal Kumara.",
    "Earlier this year, Silva was reinstated by the Police and appointed as DIG Puttalam as investigations did not find sufficient evidence against him.",
    "He was reportedly investigating the primary suspect of the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings at the time of his arrest, having obtained an open warrant to nab terror mastermind Zahran Hashim."
