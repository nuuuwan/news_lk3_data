### National Chamber of Exporters expresses concern over Customs disruptions

National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) said yesterday that the recent actions taken by the Sri Lanka Customs Officers’ Union, including a two-day “sick leave” campaign and work-to-rule initiatives, have had profound implications across Sri Lanka’s business community, particularly affecting exporters and importers. It said these actions were initiated due to perceived grievances and unmet demands from the Customs Officers’ Union on various issues.

NCE President Jayantha Karunaratne highlighted the significant disruptions caused by these actions. He emphasised that the work-to-rule approach has resulted in substantial delays in clearing imported goods at ports and checkpoints, causing disruptions in production schedules and logistical operations. These delays have particularly impacted exporters, who face stringent deadlines to fulfil international orders, leading to strained relationships with overseas buyers and potential financial penalties for missed deliveries.

### Is excessive board interference killing executive spirit?

Management’s role is to manage, and the board’s role is to oversee without killing the innovative spirit of management

Whilst in law, and on paper, a board is superior in rank to management, it is important that a board must never make the management feel inferior. Directors and executives must cohabit on a platform of collaboration, trust, and respect. The board-management relationship must be positioned as a value creating partnership where the board is humble in displaying some subservience to management’s technical, functional, and integrating expertise in running the company and the management appreciates the board’s advisory, guidance, governance, and oversight roles in increasing stakeholder value. A shared vision is vital and will result in management accepting the board’s untethered authority over selected aspects of the company

### That regional carrot of doing good and being best

*2024-07-12 01:09:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/That-regional-carrot-of-doing-good-and-being-best/4-764163) · `en`

In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs

The EU and the US disburse significant amounts of money under the banner of doing good, and often mandate local partners with no subject matter expertise to drive programs on mental and sexual health, child welfare, nutrition and employee rights that do more damage than good to the future of our nation. When these are married to local individuals and organisations that give scant regard to the nation, its people and future; the outcomes can be perilous

The European Union and the US are amongst preferred export destinations, but winning buyers from these markets do not come easy. In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs. Hypocrisy and geo-political powerplay is rife, but cracks are slowly but surely beginning to show.

### Change, system or the people?

*2024-07-12 01:02:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-system-or-the-people/4-764161) · `en`

Whether a nation with this record can find the balance after a summersault of an attempted system change, only history will tell

From 1948, it has been an endless series of missteps, reflecting a national temperament which urges the path of backwardness and poor productivity. The emphasis was not on becoming a stronger or a wealthier nation, but on a hazy idea that all our ills are due to the nastiness of the system, there is this wealth somewhere in the country which should be distributed equally! A system must be created that feeds all the braggarts and the laggards (our Parliamentarians have already done this by voting in all kinds of benefits for themselves!)

A spectre is haunting Sri Lanka – the spectre of the NPP/JVP.

All powers of old Sri Lanka have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: A President without a popular mandate, a Government lacking credibility, political parties with tired faces, and businessmen with dark histories.

### Questions over the term of the President

*2024-07-12 00:57:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Questions-over-the-term-of-the-President/4-764160) · `en`

Unsurprisingly the SC has dismissed the Fundamental Rights petition requesting the Supreme Court to hold that the President has a term of six years, in limine. Reportedly, the SC has found no merit in the petition.

If the term of office of the President had been interpreted to be six years, as the petitioner had sought, it would no doubt have been expressly in violation of the Constitutional provisions, limiting the President’s term to five years, introduced by the 19th Amendment.

What the petitioner had pleaded for was sort of a judicial review of post-enactment legislation by the Supreme Court, a power which the SC is not vested with under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It could hardly be surmised that the SC could arrogate to itself a power that is not vested in it by invoking any other doctrines of law, including inherent jurisdiction. However, the power of interpretation of the Constitution that lies with the SC is a power that it can use as it may deem fit.

Russia is committed to finding the “earliest possible solution” to the issue of Indians being duped into joining its army and fighting in the Ukraine war, a top Russian diplomat said, in Moscow’s first comments on the matter.

An Indian official accompanying Modi said on Tuesday that Russia has promised their early discharge.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s presidential poll will be held this year on October 5 or 12, its Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry said in parliament on Thursday.

“Do not doubt that the presidential election will be held between September 17 and October 17 this year. Most probably it will be held on either Saturday, October 5 or Saturday, October 12,” Sabry said.

“The president is not afraid to go before the people because he has accomplished something, he has a report card.

Based on that report card the people will decide. This government and the president have no intention to stay on a day extra.”

Parties afraid of an election and those who want to destabilise the country were spreading false information about the postponing of elections, Sabry said.
