    "The relevant order was issued by a Supreme Court bench comprising of Justices Murdhu Fernando, Shiran Gunaratne, Achala Wengappuli and Priyantha Fernando when the case was taken up in court this morning (10).",
    "While the attorney who appeared on behalf the fishing community raised concerns that they are yet to receive compensation for the massive losses suffered due to the X-Press Pearl disaster in 2021, Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, assured that measures are underway in this regard.",
