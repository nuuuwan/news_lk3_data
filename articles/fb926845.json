  "original_body_lines": [
    "Over the past elections, the people of Sri Lanka have spoken clearly. They placed their trust in the NPP, not out of blind loyalty, but out of desperation for change\u2014for what was popularly called \u201csystem change.\u201d However, that electoral victory did not grant the NPP the licence to act with impunity. Rather, it created a moral and political obligation to deliver on the promise of fairness, opportunity, and resilience for all citizens.",
    "Some days ago, I listened to Minister Lal Kantha \u2013 a moment of rare clarity. He reminded us of something often overlooked: regardless of who is in government, the state remains an instrument of power, often of repression. This is not a new observation, but a timeless one. The state, in its current form, still carries many colonial vestiges that were designed not to serve the people but to control them.",
    "Despite independence in 1948, many of the repressive laws and structures built to maintain a colonial regime still endure today. They have been repackaged, renamed, and expanded, but rarely reformed in any meaningful way.",
    "This is not unique to Sri Lanka. Over a century ago, Lenin wrote that the state is not a neutral body\u2014it is, at its core, an apparatus of coercion. He said, and I quote, \u201cA standing army and police are the chief instruments of state power.\u201d That reality, sadly, still holds.",
    "In Sri Lanka, the mass uprising we now call Aragalaya was not a unified or a revolutionary movement. It was a coalition of discontent, ranging from reformists to neo-liberals. People wanted change, but they didn\u2019t always agree on what that change should look like. That made revolutionary transformation unlikely from the outset.",
    "Today, Sri Lanka finds itself in a deeply interconnected and volatile world. Economically, socially, and politically, the global situation is unstable. And as a dependent economy, Sri Lanka is particularly vulnerable. Unless we break out of this dependency\u2014much of it inherited, but some of it willingly embraced\u2014we will continue to feel the shocks of global turbulence.",
    "To its credit, the NPP government has taken some positive steps. Inflation is down, wages have risen, and the budget is in a better position than before. But we must also be realistic: these are only steps to lay foundations, not destinations. They offer hope, yes, but they must be built upon with real structural reform.",
    "We cannot expect to overcome our current crisis without tackling the root causes\u2014economic inefficiency, social inequality, and flawed governance. Reform must be deliberate, systematic, and participatory. But let\u2019s be honest\u2014transformational change cannot happen in a vacuum. It requires a revolutionary spirit and, most importantly, the active participation of the people.",
    "That is the difference between a participatory democracy and an authoritarian regime. When people are engaged, empowered, and given a real say in the decisions that shape their lives, a better society becomes possible.",
    "Yet, despite the hopeful signs, the machinery of repression remains intact. The Prevention of Terrorism Act, the ICCPR Act, and the Online Safety Act\u2014all tools of control, inherited from previous regimes\u2014are still active. These laws are designed to silence dissent, not to protect democracy.",
    "The danger is clear: unless the government radically reforms these tools of repression, Sri Lanka risks sliding once again into authoritarianism. We\u2019ve seen it before. We\u2019ve lived through it. People have both elected autocrats and resisted them. This is not new terrain for us.",
    "But here\u2019s the hope: civil society has always been the difference-maker. When we organise, when we speak out, when we demand rights and accountability, we shift the course of history. The fight for democratic rights is never over. And it must continue\u2014not just defensively, but offensively. We must fight not only to protect rights, but to expand them.",
    "What Sri Lanka needs now is not just economic recovery, but economic transformation\u2014a more productive economy, stronger regional partnerships, diversified trade, and a resilient social safety net. We must reduce dependency and modernise the economy to truly lift people\u2019s living standards.",
    "This webinar is part of that larger effort. It\u2019s a deliberate attempt to shine a light on the reforms\u2014economic, political, and social\u2014that should have been front and centre in the NPP government\u2019s first year. And it\u2019s a call to civil society: your engagement matters. Your voice matters. The government must be guided, not just by party ideologies or economic frameworks, but by the real needs and aspirations of the people.",
    "We also need to recognise that the government is not without its challenges. It suffers from a lack of experienced leadership and a capable public service infrastructure. These are not problems that can be fixed overnight. But they must be acknowledged and addressed, with urgency and transparency.",
    "At the same time, the government must clarify its goals, communicate better, and focus on what truly matters: policy reform, practical results, and protecting people\u2019s rights. The window for excuses is narrowing. People are watching. They are demanding better.",
    "And finally, while this government may not yet have descended into bureaucratic authoritarianism, it is not immune to that danger. The signs are there. The warning lights are flashing. But so too is the opportunity\u2014the opportunity to chart a new course, to build a fairer, more inclusive, and more democratic Sri Lanka.",
    "Let this webinar be a platform for that action. Let our voices serve as reminders, as warnings, and as guides. The future remains unwritten, but we are all authors of it."
