  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lankan\u00a0security forces still harass families of victims of forced disappearances and misuse the country\u2019s draconian counterterrorism law a year since President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office with promises of reform, Human Rights Watch said today. The\u00a0United Nations\u00a0Human Rights Council should renew the mandates for the UN to collect and analyze evidence of abuses in Sri Lanka, along with continued monitoring and reporting on the situation.",
    "On August 13, 2025, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u00a0reported\u00a0that there had been almost no progress in accountability for\u00a0widespread abuses\u00a0by government forces and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during the 1983-2009 civil war, and that \u201cthe structural conditions that led to past violations persist.\u201d Tens of thousands of victims of\u00a0enforced disappearances, many last seen in military custody, remain unaccounted for.",
    "\u201cPresident Dissanayake pledged that he would adopt more rights-respecting policies, but very little has changed, particularly for Tamil victims of abuses,\u201d said\u00a0Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe families of the disappeared continue to face threats, including for engaging with the UN, while prospects for justice in Sri Lanka are as remote as ever.\u201d",
    "In June, the UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, visited the\u00a0Chemmani mass grave\u00a0near Jaffna, from which the bodies of over 100 people including children believed to have died in army custody have been recovered, and\u00a0called for\u00a0\u201crobust investigations by independent experts with forensic expertise who can bring out the truth.\u201d Over several decades, about 20 mass grave sites have been discovered in Sri Lanka, including those linked to the brutal security forces crackdown during the 1987-1989 uprising in southern Sri Lanka by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People\u2019s Liberation Front or JVP), the formerly militant leftist party that is now the largest constituent of the Dissanayake government.\u00a0None of these sites have been adequately investigated.",
    "In 2020, the government withdrew its support for a UN Human Rights Council resolution adopted by consensus biannually since 2015 to advance justice. In 2021, the Council created the\u00a0Sri Lanka Accountability Project\u00a0to gather information and evidence for use in possible future trials. Many\u00a0families of victims\u00a0have braved possible retaliation by the authorities to share evidence with the project.",
    "In the predominantly Tamil Northern and Eastern Provinces, the areas most affected by the war, there has been no apparent reduction under the Dissanayake administration in police and intelligence agencies\u2019 efforts\u00a0to monitor and intimidate victims\u2019 families\u00a0and human rights defenders.",
    "A woman whose son was forcibly disappeared in army custody in 2008 said that in June, Terrorism Investigation Division police officers questioned her at her home for three hours. They asked her about her visits to Geneva, where she has engaged with the Accountability Project and the Human Rights Council.",
    "\u201cMany mothers [of the disappeared] are mentally affected by the [police] inquiries, monitoring, and intimidation,\u201d she said. She believes that surveillance, including by the police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has increased. \u201cThe monitoring by the CID is tighter now,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they approach our children to get information about us. That is a type of threat.\u201d",
    "The police sometimes discourage people from attending events for war victims, and intimidate people there by filming\u00a0memorial events. In August, counterterrorism police\u00a0summoned Kanapathipillai Kumanan, a prominent Tamil journalist and rights defender,\u00a0for questioning. One activist said that the authorities also \u201ccreate isolation\u201d by paying informers in communities to report on activists, while threatening others not to associate with certain campaigners or organizations. The monitoring is often directed at those who engage with the UN, including around the recent visit by T\u00fcrk.",
    "The Sri Lankan authorities continue to use counterterrorism powers to arbitrarily detain members of minority communities and harass activists. Police from the Terrorism Investigation Division have repeatedly questioned administrators of nongovernmental organizations about their funding. Administrators say they are sometimes unable to receive bank transfers due to the misapplication of rules purportedly intended to counter terrorist financing. In September 2023, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0found\u00a0that \u201cbroad application of counter-terrorism rules\u201d restricted\u00a0civil society\u00a0scrutiny of official corruption.",
    "Sri Lanka is being evaluated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that combats money laundering and terrorist financing. Activists have raised concerns that the government is violating FATF\u2019s code, which calls for \u201cfocused, proportionate and risk-based measures,\u201d and warns against \u201cunduly disrupting or discouraging\u201d legitimate work by nonprofit organizations.",
    "Since 2015, successive Sri Lankan governments have pledged to repeal the notorious\u00a0Prevention of Terrorism Act\u00a0(PTA), which has been used to enable arbitrary detention and torture since it was introduced as a temporary measure in 1979. The pledge has also been a\u00a0condition\u00a0of Sri Lanka\u2019s beneficial trading relationship with the European Union since 2017. Dissanayake made the same commitment during his election campaign.",
    "However, the PTA is still being used to detain people without any evidence of involvement in terrorism. According to data in an August 2025 UN\u00a0human rights report\u00a0on Sri Lanka, 38 people were arrested under the law in 2024, and 49 in the first four months of 2025.",
    "Mohamad Liyaudeen Mohamed Rusdi\u00a0was\u00a0arrested\u00a0under the PTA on March 22 with a detention order signed by Dissanayake. When he was\u00a0released\u00a0on April 7, Dissanayake signed an unprecedented \u201crestriction order,\u201d including to report regularly to the police. Rusdi\u2019s alleged crime was pasting a sticker opposing Israeli government policies. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka\u00a0found\u00a0a \u201ctotal lack of evidence that Mr. Rusdi had committed any offense\u201d and said it was \u201ca stark example of the inherent dangers of the PTA and the propensity of law enforcement officials to deploy the PTA\u2019s provisions in bad faith.\u201d",
    "Police held Mohamed Rifai Suhail, a 21-year-old student, for\u00a0nine months without charge\u00a0because he criticized Israel on social media. Although the police are required by law to notify the Human Rights Commission of all PTA detentions, they did not do so.",
    "The Sri Lankan government should immediately and publicly direct security agencies to end the surveillance and harassment of victims\u2019 families and activists, and announce a complete moratorium on the use of the PTA, Human Rights Watch said. The government should invite international experts to assist in the excavation of the Chemmani mass grave.",
    "Sri Lanka should also support a resolution at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council session, scheduled to begin on September 8, to renew the Accountability Project and the UN\u2019s ongoing monitoring and reporting for two years.",
    "\u201cFamilies of the disappeared in Sri Lanka have been fearless in their campaign for truth and justice, but they face government harassment every step of the way,\u201d Ganguly said. \u201cForeign governments should press harder for credible investigations of mass graves and the prosecution of those responsible for serious crimes in Sri Lanka, wherever they can be brought to justice.\u201d"
