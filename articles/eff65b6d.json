    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka has embarked on a major initiative to design a National Export Strategy (NES) for 2025\u20132029, in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Export Development Board (EDB).\u00a0State Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe said this is the first export strategy under the current government, aimed at addressing long-standing structural weaknesses that have hindered export growth for decades.\u201cSri Lanka has had many export plans in the past, but most failed due to weak implementation and lack of political will,\u201d Abeysinghe noted. \u201cToday, our exports stand at just USD 13 billion. Countries like ours are exporting USD 500\u2013600 billion annually. We\u2019ve been stuck in the same position for 40 years. This strategy is about finding solutions to that problem.\u201dThe new NES will be developed through broad stakeholder consultations, including exporters and industry representatives, over the coming months. The State Minister stressed that building national consensus around the plan is a top priority.\u201cOur goal is to make this not just a government plan, but a people\u2019s plan,\u201d he said, adding that the strategy will focus on competitiveness, diversification, and sustainable growth."
