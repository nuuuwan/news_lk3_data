### Paradigm shift needed in economic thinking, policies and strategy

*2025-10-08 06:33:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Paradigm-shift-needed-in-economic-thinking-policies-and-strategy/4-782698) · `en`

Sri Lanka has to develop its economy in order to provide a fair, equitable, healthy, knowledgeable and dignified lifestyle for its citizens and its future generations

Sri Lanka GDP growth rate needs to rise above 8% over 10 years to achieve a GDP of $ 200 million and a GDP per capita of $ 9,000 to qualify as an upper middle-class status. A high-income status requires a per capita of $ 13,846 or more. Can Sri Lanka achieve these targets? It is noteworthy that Singapore GDP in 2024 was $ 547.4 billion and per capita $ 90,674.07 while Sri Lanka’s GDP was $ 98.96 billion with a per capita of $ 4,515.57. Singapore’s projected GDP will be $ 900 billion in 10 years with a per capita of $ 130,000. Sri Lanka must decide where it wishes to be in 10 years

### Don’t just tick the box: Strategic imperative for Sri Lankan corporates to integrate sustainability

Embedding sustainability in business models for future-proofing Sri Lankan enterprises

Sustainability has emerged as one of the most critical strategic imperatives of our era, particularly in nations acutely exposed, with economies closely tied to delicate natural and social ecosystems. Sri Lanka, with its rich agricultural exports and thriving apparel sector, finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. As we approach tangible evidence of sustainability progress from both nations and corporates, Sri Lankan enterprises must recognise that the foundations they lay today will determine their ability to respond credibly to these demands.

Non-compliance of EUDR would shut EU market for local rubber export, shrinking GDP by 0.07%

Reduction in labour demand from rubber industry a significant 15.6% in event of non-compliance

While regional peers investing in EIPs, Sri Lanka has no functioning EIPs

Shift from compliance to competitiveness needs to be national political choice

Leading industry experts last week underscored the urgency of strategic collaborations to support exporters, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), to navigate challenges and help them remain competitive in the European market.

They emphasised that if Sri Lanka’s struggling exports are to transform from challenge to opportunity, compliance needs to be tapped as a unique selling proposition (USP).

These and other useful insights were shared at a program jointly hosted by Verité Research and the EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives under the theme ‘From Compliance to Competitiveness – Securing Sri Lanka’s Place in the Global Market.’

Wijepala added that providing protection for former presidents remains a State responsibility. He noted that if any requests are made for security vehicles or other assistance, the Government is prepared to supply the required resources.

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) yesterday launched a new digital Case Tracking System aimed at improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability.

“Corruption thrives where there is opacity, delay, and inefficiency. Transparency and accountability are the strongest deterrents,” Justice Iddawala said, calling the new system “an instrument of reform” that will strengthen public trust.

The Case Tracking System integrates automation and centralised digital recordkeeping to improve accuracy, enable real-time case monitoring, and streamline workflows. It also introduces data-driven decision-making tools to enhance institutional performance.

### Jaffna lawyers protest Police action

*2025-10-08 05:37:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Jaffna-lawyers-protest-Police-action/56-782690) · `en`

Lawyers in Jaffna yesterday staged a strike to protest what they described as an illegal search carried out by Police at the residence of a fellow attorney without court authorisation.

The protest followed an incident on Sunday in which police officers reportedly entered the home of a lawyer accused of involvement in land deed fraud and conducted a search in an attempt to arrest him. The search was allegedly conducted without a court warrant or prior judicial approval.

The incident comes amid ongoing police investigations into several lawyers suspected of participating in land deed fraud cases in the Jaffna area.

In response, members of the legal community gathered outside the Jaffna courts to condemn what they called a violation of legal procedure and professional rights.

Lawyers facing related allegations are expected to submit anticipatory bail applications to court today to prevent possible arrests.

### Police warn of rising online fraud via Telegram, WhatsApp

Sri Lanka Police have issued a public warning about an increase in online scams being carried out through popular messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp.

According to Police, cybercriminals are using deceptive methods to gain access to users’ online accounts, including tricking victims into revealing their usernames and passwords through fake links and QR codes. Once the information is obtained, the fraudsters block the original owners from their accounts and use them to carry out further scams.

Investigations have revealed that these criminals often lure victims by offering fake job opportunities and requesting payments under various pretexts.

The Police urged the public to exercise caution when responding to unsolicited messages or offers circulated through social media groups, even if they appear to come from known contacts or familiar platforms. They also advised against clicking on links or visiting websites shared through such messages.

He further stated this at a press conference held at the PA office in Colombo on Tuesday (7).

Sarath Fonseka has said a few things with great excitement and hatred. In it he mentioned my name. He must learn about two animals who want to teach Sarath Fonseka: one animal lion, the other is Devang. Sarath Fonseka must realize the biggest difference between the lion and the Deva.

Whether the lion is old or sick, it will never eat grass. But although Devang is generally known to be a meat -eating animal, some Devangs eat bark. There are opportunities that go becoming a dog. But I would like to tell Sarath Fonseka the fact that the lion will never be a dog.
