    "SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam urged Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa to act maturely without being childish regarding the matters involving the Parliamentary Committee to probe reasons for the country's financial bankruptcy.",
    "He said the Speaker has appointed those who are committed to truth-seeking and have the potential to do so as the members of the committee.",
    "\"If a select committee of this nature acts on political agendas, it will not do any good to the country or the people. There are various opinions about the reasons for the bankruptcy of the country. This Committee is appointed with the objective of achieving that. Both Government and Opposition MPs have a duty and responsibility to summon all the responsible parties and question them and reveal the truth to the people,\u201d Kariyawasam said.",
    "He said if there was any issue involving the Committee, it should be resolved within the committee and that the Opposition should not act immaturely and play with people\u2019s lives instead of resolving their issues.",
    "The MP said the committee was appointed following the request of the government side and that the Opposition also moved a proposal regarding the matter.",
    "\u201cHowever, the Opposition delayed for a month to nominate their representatives to the Committee. They sent in their nominees only after the matter was raised in the Parliament Business Committee meeting several times,\u201d he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
