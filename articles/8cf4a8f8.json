    "This was stated by State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday.",
    "\u201cAs the country is headed for a presidential election and different political parties are vowing to adopt different economic policies, it would be best to not present a budget for the full Year of 2025. Instead, we would present a budget applicable for the first three / four months of 2025 to keep the fiscal and monetary operations uninterrupted. And the new administration would have to take things from there according to their economic policies and forecasted expenditures and revenues for the full period of 2025,\u201d he said.",
