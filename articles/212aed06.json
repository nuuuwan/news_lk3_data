    "Dr. Paul Dahlke (25 Jan. 1865 \u2013 29 Feb. 1928) was a German physician and one of the pioneers of Buddhism in Germany. Dahlke was born in East Prussia as the son of a civil servant. He completed the Gymnasium (high school) in 1883 and proceeded to study medicine in Berlin. He received his MD degree in August 1887 and soon took over a Homeopathic medical practice.",
    "In 1898 he started a journey around the world and was fascinated by the South Pacific. He also stopped over in Ceylon, where he encountered Buddhism. He had read about Buddhism when he studied Schopenhauer. Two years later he went on his second journey, this time specifically to Ceylon to learn more about Buddhism.",
    "He learned Pali and met local Sinhala Buddhist monks, among them Ven. Hikkaduwe Sumangala, Ven. Suriyagoda Sumangala, Ven. Nyananissara and Ven. Wagiswara Theros. He returned a Buddhist and in the following years made several more journeys to Asia primarily to Ceylon, but also to China, India, Burma, Thailand and Indonesia. When the first World War started he was in Germany and was unable to travel to Ceylon as he had planned.",
    "Dahlke had realized that studying and writing on Buddhism alone was not enough. He therefore decided to found a Buddhist Community right in the heart of Germany. Acquiring an extent of 11 acres land in the Berlin suburb of Frohnau in 1919, he proceeded to construct \u2018Das Buddhistische Haus\u2019 which he completed in 1924.",
    "It was his intention that the property should be a Buddhist center. Besides the house proper, containing living quarters and library, a meeting hall was built close by, and separate rooms and cells for accommodating guests. Therefore, it was to be a midway solution between a monastery and layman\u2019s habitation.",
    "Before long Dr. Dahlke had a group of disciples around him prepared to live according to the Dhamma, and the Buddhist House soon become the center of German Buddhism. Anagarika Dharmapala, a good friend of Dr. Paul Dahlke, spent 10 days in the Buddhist House on his way to England in 1925.",

Nyanatiloka Maha Nayaka Thera. The Island Hermitage was a little island on the Ratgama Lake near Dodanduwa, that gradually became the home of a small band of European and Asian Buddhist monks.",

He has authored Buddhist books namely, \u2018Buddhism Essays (1903)\u2019 \u2018Buddhism and Science\u2019, \u2018Buddhism and it\u2019s place in the Mental Life of Mankind (1924)\u2019 \u2018Buddhism as a Doctrine of Actuality and way of Life\u2019.",
    "Dr. Dahlke died on February 29, 1928. With his death the Buddhistische Haus ceased to be a center for the Theravada Buddhist activities. His work was continued in a small house called \u2018Holzhaus\u2019 close to the premises of the Das Buddhistische Haus, built by Dr. Kurt Fischer, Dahlke\u2019s secretary and editor of the magazine \u2018\u2019Buddhist Life and Thought\u2019.",

    "After the flight of Rudolf Hess to England in May 1941, the Nazi German Government (1933 \u2013 1945) began to frown on Buddhist activities. DBH later became a center for war refugees towards the closing stages of WW2. Bartha Dahlke left DBH in 1944 for the island of Sylt in Denmark and died in 1947.

They were the leading importers of Swiss watches to Sri Lanka.",
    "In 1951 Asoka Weeraratna undertook his first business visit to West Germarny, meeting many people who had lost their families, wealth and possessions. This left a deep impression in him. In post-war Germany, the widespread sentiment was one of desperation and resignation \u2013 \u2018kaput, kaput, alles kaput\u2018 (finished, finished, all is finished). He recognized the growing thirst for an alternative moral and spiritual philosophy.",

The three monks in this mission comprised Venerable Soma, Venerable Kheminda, Venerable Vinta of the Vajiraramaya Temple, Bambalapitiya.
