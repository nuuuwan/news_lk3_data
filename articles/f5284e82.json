    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The International Monetary Fund has approved Sri Lanka\u2019s program review allowing the disbursement of 330 million US dollars, while calling for monetary policy to be used only for stability.",
    "\u201cMonetary policy should continue prioritizing price stability, supported by a sustained commitment to refrain from monetary financing and safeguard central bank independence,\u201d Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair said in a statement.",
    "The call comes as inflationists are calling for rates cuts to support \u2018growth\u2019 and early noises are starting to be made about \u2018positive real interest rates\u2019 based on historical inflation.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation is currently low as anchor conflicts have not yet re-emerged, though the operating framework of the monetary authority remains deeply flawed without a credible anchor, critics have said.",
    "Sri Lanka has legalized an inflation target of as much as 7 percent (domestic anchor), without a clean float, including through an explicit reserve collection target.",
    "Since the end of a civil war anchor conflicts have emerged as soon a private credit recovered from the previous currency crisis as attempts are made to suppress rates along the yield curve with liquidity tools, including through extensive sterilization of fx interventions to suppress rates, which are then characterized as \u2018monetary financing\u2019.",
    "Meanwhile the IMF said there were risks to an economic recovery.",
    "Growth is projected to recover moderately in 2024-25 given constrained bank credit and fiscal consolidation, while facing uncertainties around the debt restructuring and policy direction following the elections the statement said.",
    "Inflation is expected to temporarily increase due to one-off factors.",
    "\u201cImportant vulnerabilities associated with the ongoing debt restructuring, revenue mobilization, reserve accumulation, and banks\u2019 ability to support the recovery continue to cloud the outlook,\u201d the statement said.",
    "\u201cStrong reform efforts, adequate safeguards, and contingency planning help mitigate these risks.",
    "\u201cTo restore fiscal sustainability, sustained revenue mobilization efforts, promptly finalizing the debt restructuring in line with program targets, and protecting social and capital spending remain critical.\u201d",
    "The IMF also called for removing a gradual removing of external controls.",
    "\u201cContinued exchange rate flexibility and gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures remain critical to rebuild external buffers and facilitate external rebalancing,\u201d the statement said.",
    "Sri Lanka has had capital controls for decades due to flawed operating frameworks involving central bank re-financing operations or targeting interest rates rates without a clean float.",
    "There is also exchange rate volatility including during short periods surplus balance of payments achieved with deflationary policy, due to large interbank liquidity build-ups following central bank unsterilized dollar purchases combined with an \u2018exchange rate as a first line of defence\u2019 policy.",
    "Washington, DC \u2013 June 12, 2024: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the second review under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement, allowing the authorities to draw SDR 254 million (about US$336 million). This brings the total IMF financial support disbursed so far to SDR 762 million (about US$1 billion).[1] The Executive Board also concluded the 2024 Article IV Consultation with Sri Lanka. [2]",
    "The EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka was approved by the Executive Board on March 20, 2023 (see Press Release No. 23/79) in an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about US$3 billion. The first review of the EFF was completed by the Executive Board on December 12, 2023 with disbursements of SDR 254 million (about US$337 million; see Press Release No. 23/439).",
    "The EFF-supported program aims to restore Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigate the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, rebuild external buffers, safeguard financial sector stability, and strengthen governance and growth potential.",
    "Signs of economic recovery are emerging. Real GDP expanded by 3 percent (y-o-y) in the second half of 2023. May 2024 inflation was 0.9 percent and gross international reserves increased to US$5.5 billion by end-April 2024. The primary balance improved to a surplus with tax revenue increasing to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2023. Despite improvements in non performing loans, pockets of vulnerabilities remain in the banking sector.",
    "The recovery remains gradual, and the medium-term growth potential hinges on appropriate policy settings. Growth is projected to recover moderately in 2024-25 given constrained bank credit and fiscal consolidation, while facing uncertainties around the debt restructuring and policy direction following the elections. Inflation is expected to temporarily increase due to one-off factors. The current account is expected to remain positive in 2024, driven by improved tourist arrivals and remittances.",
    "Domestic risks could arise from waning reform momentum, especially on revenue mobilization. External risks are associated with intensified regional conflicts, commodity price volatility, and a global slowdown. Slow progress in debt restructuring could widen financing gaps.",
    "Following the Executive Board\u2019s discussion, Mr. Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s performance under its Fund-supported program remains strong. All quantitative targets were met, except for the marginal shortfall of indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks were either met or implemented with delay. Reforms and policy adjustment are bearing fruit.",
    "The economy is starting to recover, inflation remains low, revenue collection is improving, and reserves continue to accumulate. Despite these positive developments, the economy is still vulnerable and the path to debt sustainability remains knife-edged. Important vulnerabilities associated with the ongoing debt restructuring, revenue mobilization, reserve accumulation, and banks\u2019 ability to support the recovery continue to cloud the outlook. Strong reform efforts, adequate safeguards, and contingency planning help mitigate these risks.",
    "\u201cTo restore fiscal sustainability, sustained revenue mobilization efforts, promptly finalizing the debt restructuring in line with program targets, and protecting social and capital spending remain critical. Advancing public financial management will help enhance fiscal discipline, and strengthening the debt management framework is also needed.",
    "\u201cMonetary policy should continue prioritizing price stability, supported by a sustained commitment to refrain from monetary financing and safeguard central bank independence. Continued exchange rate flexibility and gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures remain critical to rebuild external buffers and facilitate external rebalancing.",
    "\u201cRestoring bank capital adequacy and strengthening governance and oversight of state-owned banks are top priorities to revive credit growth and support economic recovery.",
    "\u201cThe authorities need to press ahead with their efforts to address structural challenges to unlock long-term potential. Key priorities include steadfast implementation of the governance reforms; further trade liberalization to promote exports and foreign direct investment; labor reforms to upgrade skills and increase female labor force participation; and state-owned enterprise reforms to improve efficiency and fiscal transparency, contain fiscal risks, and promote a level playing field for the private sector.",
    "Executive Directors commended the authorities\u2019 strong performance under the Fund supported program, noting that reforms are bearing fruit. The economy has started to recover, inflation remains low, revenue collection is improving, and reserves continue to accumulate. Directors underscored, however, that important vulnerabilities and uncertainties remain, including with respect to the ongoing debt restructuring and the upcoming elections. Against this backdrop, they called on the authorities to continue strengthening macroeconomic policies to restore economic stability and debt sustainability and to sustain the reform momentum to promote long term inclusive growth.",
    "Directors underscored that restoring fiscal sustainability requires additional revenue measures underpinning the 2025 Budget, further tax administration reforms, as well as limiting tax exemptions and making them more transparent. They called for protecting growth enhancing and social spending, and for improving the social safety net. Directors welcomed the submission of the new Public Financial Management bill to Parliament, which would strengthen fiscal discipline and establish a solid fiscal framework. They noted that further efforts to strengthen the debt management framework are also needed. Directors welcomed the progress on achieving cost recovery in energy pricing, noting its criticality for containing risks from state owned enterprises (SOEs).",
    "Directors welcomed the progress made to advance debt restructuring to restore Sri Lanka\u2019s debt sustainability. They called for a swift finalization of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Official Creditor Committee and final agreements with the Export Import Bank of China. Directors stressed the importance of seeking comparable, transparent, and timely completion of restructurings with external private creditors consistent with program targets.",
    "Directors emphasized that maintaining price stability remains the top priority for monetary policy, which requires anchoring inflation expectations, continuing to refrain from monetary financing, and the gradual unwinding of government security holdings as markets allow. They also stressed the importance of strengthening central bank independence. Directors underscored the need to continue building external buffers, while maintaining exchange rate flexibility to facilitate external rebalancing and preserve the credibility of the inflation targeting regime. They called for gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures.",
    "Directors underscored the need to strengthen financial sector resilience to support the recovery. They called for swift completion of the restructuring of remaining domestic law, foreign currency loans and for adequate recapitalization of commercial and state owned banks. Directors welcomed the enactment of the Banking Act amendments and emphasized the importance of their effective implementation to enhance supervision and the governance of state owned banks. They also called for further efforts to strengthen the anti money laundering and counter terrorism financing framework.",
    "Directors stressed that pressing ahead with governance and structural reforms, supported by development partners and IMF capacity development, is crucial to unlock growth potential. They welcomed the publication of the authorities\u2019 action plan on the key governance reforms recommended in the Governance Diagnostic Report and called for its steadfast implementation. Directors also recommended prioritizing reforms to further liberalize trade, improve the investment climate and SOE efficiency, reduce gender gaps in the labor market, and mitigate climate vulnerabilities."
