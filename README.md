### Politics and the Plantation Wage

*2024-07-01 11:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-and-the-plantation-wage/) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon Workers’ Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workers’ daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.

In a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.

### US says elections in Iran ‘not free and fair’, won’t change regime’s direction

Iran’s elections are not ‘free and fair,’ the US State Department told Iran International on Sunday, in its first comments on the results of Friday’s votes that led to a runoff between a moderate and a hardline candidate.

The June 28 presidential election marked the lowest voter turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic, with only 39.92 percent participation. This breaks the previous record set during the last election, in which the late President Ebrahim Raisi won with a turnout of 48 percent.

“The elections in Iran are not free and fair,” a State Department spokesperson said.

“Unfortunately, we have no expectation that these elections, whatever the outcome, will lead to fundamental change in Iran’s direction or more respect by the Iranian regime for the human rights of Iran’s citizens,” the spokesperson added, as the Iranian government prepares for a runoff presidential election slated for July 5.
