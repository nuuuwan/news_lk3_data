    "The Government of Norway is further extending its support to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Sri Lanka\u2019s flagship portfolio on SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions project for the period 2023-2026, advancing efforts to strengthen a strong foundation to support efforts through a multi-stakeholder approach in Sri Lanka. The Ambassador of Norway to Sri Lanka and Maldives, H.E. Trine J\u00f8ranli Eskedal and UNDP in Sri Lanka\u2019s Resident Representative Azusa Kubota signed the partnership agreement recently, amounting to NOK 12 million (approximately $ 1.2 million).",
    "The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Sri Lanka\u2019s Flagship Portfolio on SDG 16: on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, provides a cohesive and integrated framework that guides support to the Government of Sri Lanka working closely with stakeholders including Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). The portfolio which was first formulated for the period 2018-2022, and amended to respond to changes in the operating context, supports the strengthening of key institutions to be more people-centred, responsive, transparent and conflict-sensitive; providing vulnerable communities with increased and equitable access to justice so as to strengthen the social contract between the Government and its citizens; and address conflict drivers and thereby contribute to achieving sustainable peace and development in Sri Lanka."
