    "Beira Lake gates were not functioning, its tributaries and output channels were blocked and the unauthorised settlements and buildings on its borders had severely polluted the water. Instead of being an attraction, Beira Lake had become an eyesore. It was rehabilitated to restored to former splendour and enhancing its utility. The developed Beira Lake Linear Park is important in the city\u2019s flood management system, whilst being the site of many recreational and economic activities, is a centrepiece in revitalised city of Colombo.",
