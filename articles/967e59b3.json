  "original_title": "India hits back at US, EU duplicity over its Russian oil imports",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Government of India says targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable",
    "Says India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security",
    "Points to how both US and EU continue to maintain extensive trade relations with Russia",
    "Asserts that US and EU continue to import energy, metals, fertilisers, uranium and other chemicals and high-value industrial goods from Russia",
    "The Government of India has strongly rebutted criticism from the United States and the European Union over its continued imports of Russian oil, calling the stance unjustified and marked by double standards.",
    "Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on India. \u201cIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cBecause of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.\u201d The US has already slapped a 25% tariff on Indian exports to the US.",
    "In an official statement on Monday, India\u2019s External Affairs Ministry pointed out that India\u2019s energy purchases were driven by necessity, after traditional suppliers redirected shipments to Europe following the Ukraine conflict. At the time, the United States had even encouraged Indian purchases to help stabilise global energy markets.",
    "The Government noted that while India is being singled out, both the US and EU continue to maintain extensive trade relations with Russia, covering energy, metals, fertilisers, and high-value industrial goods, without facing similar scrutiny.",
    "India has been targeted by the United States and the European Union for importing oil from Russia after the commencement of the Ukraine conflict. In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict. The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.",
    "India\u2019s imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer. They are a necessity compelled by the global market situation. However, it is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion.",
    "The European Union in 2024 had a bilateral trade of \u20ac 67.5 billion in goods with Russia. In addition, it had trade in services estimated at \u20ac 17.2 billion in 2023. This is significantly more than India\u2019s total trade with Russia that year or subsequently. European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5 million tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.21 million tonnes in 2022.",
    "Europe-Russia trade includes not just energy, but also fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.",
    "Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals.",
    "In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security."
