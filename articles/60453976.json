    "Mar. 26 (ICC) - South Africa Women are prepared to play six limited-overs games against Sri Lanka at home starting Wednesday.",
    "South Africa will host Sri Lanka in a three-match T20I series, followed by as many ODIs, that will also form a part of the ICC Women\u2019s Championship 2022-25 cycle.",
    "As the preparations begin for the bilateral series, Proteas skipper Laura Wolvaardt has insisted that the series is \"very crucial\" for the hosts in the build up towards the ICC Women's T20 World Cup later this year in Bangladesh.",
    "\u201cWe don't have much cricket left as a group before the World Cup, so these three T20Is are very important just to try different combinations and to finalize that starting XI that we'd like to have for the World Cup,\u201d Wolvaardt said in the pre-match press conference.",
    "This is the first time South Africa are hosting Sri Lanka Women in a bilateral series since 2019. However, the two sides recently met in South Africa last year in the T20 World Cup where Sri Lanka triumphed by three runs in a thrilling contest.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not a series that we're taking lightly at all,\" Wolvaardt said.",
    "\"Sri Lanka has been very good in the past couple of months, beating England as well in the T20I series, so we're going to be looking to start strong on the front foot.\u201d",
    "On her personal form, Wolvaardt said that she had been working on the technical side of things after an ordinary series against the Aussies.",
    "\u201cI didn't have my best series in Australia, especially in the ODIs and the Test match but I was able to have one or two good knocks in the WPL, so I was very grateful to get a few games over there and just to have fun and enjoy the experience.",
    "\u201cWhat I did differently, I think not too much, which is what's probably a bit frustrating from a cricketing point of view, because I feel like I didn't try too much different, I just had a bad Australian series.",
    "\u201cMy focus has been just to sharpen up on some technical things and overall, I am feeling good, feeling fresh and really enjoyed batting again at the WPL.\"",
    "Wolvaardt also commeted on senior star player Sune Luus, who is set to become the most capped T20I player for South Africa Women.",
    "\"She's been a part of the side for probably as long as anyone can remember and has been performing well with the bat lately. She's put a lot of hard work into her batting, especially in the recent off-season. It's been great to see her sort of reap the rewards in the past couple of games.",
    "\u201cHaving captained the side in the past, having that experience and having that many T20Is, helps a lot. With the advice that she can give and the information she can share, it's been great having her around the group.\""
