Females comprised 64% of all state university enrolments for medicine, dentistry, law, science, IT, education, management and arts

Even at the primary school level, girls’ attainment outperforms boys’ with cut-off marks for grade 5 scholarship entrance exams consistently higher for prestigious girls’ schools compared to boys’ schools

But the trend is reversed in the workplace where men earn on average more than women for every level of education in Sri Lanka in every occupational category; the disparity is a symptom of deeper structural issues

Integrating work-related initiatives into the curriculum, such as vocational training, work placements or entrepreneurial opportunities that come with a stipend or other incentive, may be a way to show that learning is worthwhile

However, other sources denied any such move and said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured that elections would be held. So, while President Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government are focused on elections, they should also dedicate time for issues such as climate change as it no doubt affects the entire country and its people.
