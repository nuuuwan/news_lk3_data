    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)\u2019s ousted general secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara can come back into the party\u2019s fold anytime and can even take up a position, SLFP chairman Maithripala Sirisena said.",
    "\u201cHe can talk to us in parliament when we meet. Parliament hasn\u2019t met in two or three weeks.",
    "\u201cI have no problems with him coming back. He can come back and even take up a position in the party,\u201d Sirisena said speaking to reporters on Sunday January 03.",
    "Jayasekara, meanwhile, speaking at an event on Sunday reiterated his complaint that the SLFP has not taken any decisive action on where it stands with regard to the party members who joined the government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a group in our party who have joined the government as ministers. The party must decide where it stands: either in the government or in the opposition. We ask the leader to take a decision,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked about Jayasekara\u2019s comments, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, one of the senior SLFP members who joined the government, hinted that his former colleague would be making a move of his own in the near future.",
    "\u201cSee where he is in the coming days. We\u2019ll respond then,\u201d said Amaraweera.",
    "Amaraweera was also seen at a memorial orgnaised Monday January 04 morning organised by the SLFP to commemorate the party\u2019s founder and former prime minister S W R D Bandaranaike. Former SLFP chair and President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was also at the event, with Sirisena also in attendance.",
    "In a related development, Jayasekara said recently that he wants back in, insisting that he can help rebuild the SLFP.",
    "Commenting on the much-celebrated recent departure of Galle District MP and SLFP Senior Vice President Shan Wijyelala de Silva to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Jayasekara said other crossovers are also likely.",
    "\u201cHe left the SLFP because he felt he had no future in it. It started with Shan Wijelal. The others are gradually displacing to other places,\u201d said Jayasekara.",
    "The Kurunegala district MP said that for this not to happen, the SLFP should take him back in.",
    "\u201cBy taking me back to the party and allowing me to [carry out my duties], I believe I can build this party again,\u201d he said.",
    "The SLFP removed Jayasekara as the party\u2019s general secretary and has also suspended his party membership in September 2023. (Colombo/Jan08/2024)"
