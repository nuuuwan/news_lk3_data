    "In a landmark achievement, Sri Lanka has seen a 75% increase in female representation in Parliament following the recent election, with a total of 22 women now set to serve as Members of Parliament.",
    "This number is just over 9% out of the total MP representation in Parliament, up from the previous 6%. The previous Parliament had just 12 female MPs, but this election has ushered in 21 newly elected female candidates.",
    "Additionally, the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has appointed Attorney-at-Law Lakmali Hemachandra to one of its 18 National List seats, further boosting the figure to 22.",
    "The number could potentially rise if other political parties, such as the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), decide to allocate one of their National List positions to a female candidate, further enhancing gender representation in the legislature.",
    "Among the newly elected female MPs, 19 are from the ruling NPP party. The NPP\u2019s nominations included a significant number of women candidates, with representation from nearly every electoral district across the country, which reflected the party\u2019s commitment to increasing female participation in politics and enhancing gender balance within the Parliament.",
    "The newly elected NPP MPs include Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, an academic and sociologist. Samanmalee Gunasinghe, representing the Colombo district, is a career politician who began her political journey with the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a university student. She is a graduate of the University of Peradeniya. Dr. Kaushalya Ariyaratne, also from the Colombo district, is an Attorney-at-Law and academic.",
    "In the Kalutara district, NPP MPs included Attorney-at-Law Nilanthi Kottahachchi and Oshani Umanga, an entrepreneur. First time MP Hemali Sujeewa, from the Gampaha district, is an educator, while Sagarika Athauda, representing the Kegalle district, is a lawyer by profession. NPP candidate Attorney-at-Law Nilusha Lakmali will enter Parliament as an MP representing the Ratnapura district, while fellow lawyer Thushari Jayasinghe will represent the Kandy electoral district.",

MP Deepthi Wasalage, who won having contested from the Matale district, is an educator and a graduate from the University of Peradeniya. She will be joined in Parliament by fellow educators Saroja Paulraj from the Matara district and Chathuri Gangani from the Monaragala district.\u00a0 Attorney-at-Law Hasara Premathilake from Galle also secured a seat in Parliament under the NPP ticket.
