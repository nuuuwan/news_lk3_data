  "original_title": "Are AI tools making students smarter or lazier? New study warns of hidden risks",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The rise of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT is changing how students write essays and create videos faster than ever before. These tools make tasks easier and more creative, but experts warn they can also hurt students\u2019 ability to think and learn if used without care.",
    "A recent study by researchers at MIT, called Your Brain on ChatGPT, found that students who relied too heavily on AI showed less brain activity and remembered less of what they learned. Scientists call this problem \u201ccognitive debt,\u201d where depending too much on technology makes our minds weaker\u2014similar to how overusing calculators can make basic math skills rusty.",
    "The research doesn\u2019t suggest banning AI from schools. Instead, it recommends teaching students how to use these tools wisely, with guidance from teachers. Students need to build strong skills on their own first, so AI becomes a helper\u2014not a crutch. The same concerns apply to AI programmes that make graphics, videos, and other media: they can open doors for creativity but can also reduce hands-on learning.",
    "Experts agree that AI should support human thinking, not replace it. Schools need to update how they teach, making sure technology empowers students while keeping their brains active and growing.",
    "In classrooms and campuses across the world, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how students learn, write, and think. Tools, like ChatGPT, capable of generating essays, solving problems, and answering questions in seconds, are becoming as common as calculators once were in math class.",
    "But while these AI tools make learning faster and more accessible, some educators are worried. Could we be trading convenience for critical thinking?",
    "Just as calculators made it easier to skip memorising multiplication tables, today\u2019s AI tools might be encouraging students to skip the hard work of thinking, reasoning, and expressing themselves. Many teachers have noticed a drop in students\u2019 ability to write clearly, think critically, and retain information\u2014especially when AI is doing most of the work for them.",
    "Recent brain research backs this up. Studies show that students, who rely too heavily on AI for writing tasks, actually use their brains less. They remember less of what they learn and show weaker mental connections, compared to those who write and research on their own. Experts call this \u201ccognitive debt\u201d\u2014when depending too much on technology weakens the mind.",
    "So what should schools do? Some argue for banning AI tools altogether in classrooms. But many others say that would be a mistake. Instead, they believe AI should be used in moderation\u2014only after students build strong thinking and writing skills without digital help.",
    "The conversation doesn\u2019t stop with essays. AI is also being used to create graphics, videos, and presentations. These tools open up creative possibilities, but they can also reduce the need for hands-on skills, like drawing, editing, or designing from scratch.",
    "The bottom line? AI is here to stay, and it\u2019s not all bad. Used wisely, it can support learning and spark creativity. But it should never replace the thinking, effort, and imagination that true learning requires.",
    "ChatGPT and similar AI tools are changing how students read, write, and learn\u2014just like calculators once changed how we do math. While these tools make life easier, they can also make us too dependent. Remember how calculators led many people to struggle with simple math? Experts worry the same thing might happen with writing and thinking skills when we rely too much on AI.",
    "A recent study found students using ChatGPT wrote faster but thought less, remembered less, and felt less connected to their work. This \u201ccognitive debt\u201d means their brains weren\u2019t as active during the learning process.",
    "But should we ban these tools? Probably not. Like calculators, AI can help if used properly\u2014after we\u2019ve learned the basics ourselves. Banning AI completely could also hurt students in places with fewer resources, where AI might help teachers reach more kids.",
    "Instead, schools should teach when and how to use AI responsibly. They could have some assignments without AI and others where students work with it but still show they understand what they\u2019re doing. Teachers can also encourage students to reflect on their AI use, so they stay in control of their learning.",
    "AI doesn\u2019t just affect writing. New tools can make videos, graphics, and animations almost instantly. That\u2019s exciting\u2014but also risky. Students might skip learning creative skills if AI does everything for them, and questions about who really owns AI-made work are already causing legal and ethical headaches.",
    "The bottom line? AI can be an amazing helper, but only if we use it to boost our abilities, not replace them.",
    "In response, social media users were quick to respond, flooding the comment section with name suggestions for the Indian Monalisa. The comment section was quickly filled with humorous and creative names.\u00a0(See Figures 1 and 2)",
    "Many recent studies make timely and important contribution to the growing discourse on AI\u2019s impact on cognition. It rightly raises alarms about passive dependency and diminished mental engagement. Yet, the solution is not to reject the tool but to reframe its role. Education must evolve not to resist AI, but to guide learners in using it intelligently, ethically, and creatively.",
    "As with calculators, books, or even the internet, the power of LLMs lies not in what they do for us, but in what they help us do with more purpose, understanding, and agency. The future of learning depends on nurturing minds that can think critically with AI, not ones that simply think through it.",
    "Meanwhile, AI-assisted multimedia work offers immense potential for innovation and inclusivity. Yet, without guided pedagogical strategies and critical engagement, it may replicate the same patterns of cognitive outsourcing seen in other domains of AI application. Education systems must, therefore, ensure that the convenience of automation does not come at the cost of diminished creative agency and weakened skill foundations.",
