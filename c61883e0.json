    "The SLPP MPs who did not oppose President Gotabaya Rajapaksa granting a 681-billion-rupee tax concession to big companies were also responsible for bankrupting the country, Chief Opposition Whip and Kandy District MP Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.",
    "Kiriella said that Gotabaya Rajapaksa had granted tax concessions to big companies that funded his election campaign and that had contributed to the country\u2019s bankruptcy. \u201cThe Supreme Court determination has pointed out that the decision to please mega companies resulted in a loss of Rs 681 billion to the national economy. The MPs who were in the SLPP then should have opposed it.",
    "They did not do so. As such they too are responsible for this crisis.",
