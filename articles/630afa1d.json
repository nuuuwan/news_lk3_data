  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet has given approval for the Ceylon Electricity Board to acquire a stand by power system to cool a coal plant when it trips off the grid, a government statement said.",
    "Standby power will be used to keep the cooling systems of capacitors and also water feeder of the boiler also running, the statement said.",
    "During emergency tripping, steam is released quickly to protect components by bursting a rubber seal called a diaphragm as cooling system lose power during a large power failure.",
    "The replacement of the diagram takes a long time as 4 to 5 days are required for the boiler related components to cool sufficiently for technicians to approach to components. (Colombo/Aug27/2025)"
