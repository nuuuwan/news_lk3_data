    "Prathibha Liyanaarchchi, Miss Intercontinental Sri Lanka 2024, is back in town after participating in the 52nd edition of Miss Intercontinental held at the Sunrise Remal Resort, Sharm El-Sheik, in Egypt.",
    "There were nearly two weeks of activities, connected with this event, and Prathibha says she enjoyed every minute of it.",
    "\u201cIt was wonderful being in the company of over 52 beautiful girls from around the world and we became great friends.",
    "\u201cMy roommate was Miss Greece. She was simply awesome and I even taught her a few Sinhala words.",
    "\u201cMost of the contestants were familiar with Ceylon Tea but didn\u2019t quite know much about Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "However, having won a special award at Miss Intercontinental 2024 \u2013 Queen of Tourism \u2013 Prathibha says she is seriously thinking of working on a campaign to show the world that Sri Lanka is a paradise island and that tourists would love to experience our scene.",
    "Although our queen was not in the final list, she made it into the Top 22 and was quite a drawcard wherever she went.",
    "\u201cI guess it was my tan complexion and my height 5 ft. 10 inches.\u201d",
    "She even impressed an international audience with her singing voice; the organisers were keen to have a contestant from the Asia Oceania group showcase her talent, as a singer, and Prathibha was selected.",
    "She sang Madonna\u2019s \u2018La Isla Bonita\u2019 and was roundly applauded.",
    "Even in the traditional costume section, her Batik Osariya and the traditional seven-piece necklace impressed many.",
    "The grand finale was held on 6th December with Miss Puerto Rico being crowned Miss Intercontinental 2024.",
    "\u201cI would like to say a big thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this journey. I\u2019m honoured to have been named a Top 22 Finalist at Miss Intercontinental 2024 and awarded the Special title of Miss Tourism Queen. It was a challenging yet unforgettable experience competing in Egypt. Preparing, in just three weeks, and performing, was no easy feat, but I\u2019m so proud of what I accomplished.\u201d",
    "For the record, Prathibha, who celebrated her birthday on Christmas Day (25), is a technical designer at MAS holdings, visiting lecturer, model, and a graduate from the University of Moratuwa.",
    "Unlike most beauty queens who return after an international event and hardly think of getting involved in any community work, Prathibha says she plans to continue serving her community by expanding her brand \u2013 Hoop The Label \u2013 and using it as a platform to create a positive change for the underprivileged community.",
    "\u201cAt the same time, I am committed to furthering my education in fashion design and technology, aiming to combine creativity with innovation to contribute to the evolving fashion industry. By blending these passions, I hope to make a lasting impact, both in my community, and in the world of fashion.\u201d",
