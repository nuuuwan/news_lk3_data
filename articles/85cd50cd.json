    "Denies allegations regarding Royal College rugby team in both newspapers and on social media as unfounded",
    "Says if a genuine complaint is made, will ensure comprehensive inquiry takes place",
    "Insists will not be drawn into addressing historical grievances over discipline-related issues at Royal College unrelated to his tenure",
    "Following Daily FT\u2019s assertion that the responses to a recent spate of articles in this newspaper on multiple issues concerning Royal College, Colombo should come first from the Principal of the school and not the Royal College Union (RCU), the Principal Thilak Waththuhewa this week issued the following statement.",
    "In light of recent articles published by Daily FT, I, as the Principal of Royal College Colombo, find it necessary to address certain points and offer clarity on the matters raised. First and foremost, Royal College, since its inception, has prided itself on a balanced approach that champions both academic excellence and sporting prowess. This dual commitment is deeply ingrained in the culture of the institution and continues to thrive under my administration.",
    "Royal College has consistently upheld the principle that students should be nurtured to excel in both intellectual and athletic pursuits. The school\u2019s mission has always been to develop well-rounded Individuals capable of contributing to society both as scholars and sportsmen. This long-standing tradition is not merely historical but a living, active practice supported by generations of educators, coaches, and administrators.",
    "My administration firmly continues this legacy. We have designed programs that ensure academic excellence without compromising on the development of sporting talent. Royalists are encouraged to engage fully in both arenas, reflecting the institution\u2019s commitment to producing leaders who excel not only in the classroom but also on the field.",
    "Recent articles have drawn attention to discipline-related issues at Royal College. I want to make it unequivocally clear that my administration takes all complaints of misconduct very seriously. Since taking office, I have ensured that any complaint regarding discipline within the school is handled with the utmost integrity and thoroughness. Investigations are conducted, and appropriate action is taken where necessary.",
    "However, it must also be emphasised that this administration will not be held accountable for complaints or incidents that occurred prior to my tenure. As the current Principal, my duty is to ensure that Royal College operates at the highest standards during my time in office. My administration remains committed to addressing all valid concerns, but I will not be drawn into addressing historical grievances unrelated to this tenure.",
    "I am also aware of recent unfounded allegations regarding the Royal College rugby team, which have appeared in both newspapers and on social media. Let me categorically deny these false claims.",
    "Furthermore, my comments or responses were not sought prior to publishing these allegations. This is both deeply disturbing and disappointing. Royal College holds its sports teams, including rugby, to the highest standards of conduct, and any legitimate concern will be addressed with transparency and due diligence. If a genuine complaint is made, I will ensure a comprehensive inquiry takes place.",
    "However, baseless accusations and anonymous statements that seek to tarnish the reputation of our institution, its teams, coaching staff and volunteers will not be entertained.",
    "At the heart of my leadership is a vision that focuses on the future of Royal College, an institution that continues to thrive and uphold its values, unshaken by unfounded rumours or controversies. The administration\u2019s focus remains on steering the school forward, nurturing the next generation of Royalists who are built on a foundation of progress, integrity, and discipline.",
    "In closing, I remain deeply committed to upholding the standards and values that have made Royal College an unparalleled institution in both academic and sporting excellence. Let us continue to look forward, ensuring that our focus is on the present and the bright future that lies ahead for every Royalist."
