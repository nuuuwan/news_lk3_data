    "\u201cIf mindfulness experts wish to make others also benefit from their expertise, it\u2019s time they acted promptly to let others reap the said benefits. For example, they can use their increased grey matter and fine-tuned brains to put out the fires of war fuelled by bigotry?\u201d",
    "The simple answer to this question posed by Susantha Hewa in the article \u2018Mindless violence: Need for more thought?\u2019 (The Island, 26 June) has to be in the negative, unfortunately. By its very nature, though mindfulness practice can change \u2018your world\u2019, it is not able to change the world unless a vast majority of inhabitants of planet Earth indulge in mindfulness practices, which seems to be an impossibility, considering the fact that only a small percentage of even Buddhists practice it. Though commonly referred to as mindfulness, the practice introduced by the Buddha was Vipassana or insight; an insight into your own mind, which you have to experience yourself. Even the Buddha could not pass this insight onto another though he showed the way.",
    "Vipassana meditation spread around the world due to the efforts of S. N. Goenka, who pointed out that it is a practice for all and that you do not have to be a Buddhist to practice it, pointing out that Dhamma  is universal whereas the rituals associated with Buddhism, the religion built around, is for Buddhists. His Holiness the Dalai Lama, too, has highlighted this fact and, in addition, has aroused the interest of Western scientists to investigate the core teachings of the Buddha. The website on Goenka\u2019s work \u2018www.dhamma.org\u2019 explains Vipassana as follows:",
    "\u201cVipassana is a way of self-transformation through self-observation. It focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind. It is this observation-based, self-exploratory journey to the common root of mind and body that dissolves mental impurity, resulting in a balanced mind full of love and compassion. The scientific laws that operate one\u2019s thoughts, feelings, judgements and sensations become clear. Through direct experience, the nature of how one grows or regresses, how one produces suffering or frees oneself from suffering is understood. Life becomes characterised by increased awareness, non-delusion, self-control and peace.\u201d",
    "As indicated, mindfulness can achieve internal peace; unfortunately, not peace to the world! Mindfulness practice has been adapted for the treatment of a number of psychiatric conditions the best-known being Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) which has been shown to be as effective or superior to drugs for the prevention of relapses of depression. Further, mindfulness has been shown to improve performance of children and behaviour of criminals. It has been used successfully for smoke cessation.",
    "In October 2015, an all-party parliamentary group of UK produced a report titled \u2018Mindful Nation UK\u2019 and \u2018The Mindfulness Initiative\u2019, a policy institute that works with parliamentarians, media and policymakers to develop recommendations on the role of mindfulness in public life, was formed. In their website, they state:",
    "\u201cScientific research is generating substantial evidence of the benefits of mindfulness to well-being. There is a great public interest in the field, but access to quality training is patchy. Despite recommendations by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) for the use of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to prevent relapse in depression, NHS implementation rates are low, and there is little understanding of how mindfulness could help in other areas of policy. In an era dominated by statistics, case studies can really bring to life the potential that mindfulness can have for a diverse range of individuals. From schoolchildren to NHS staff, policemen, and members of parliament, mindfulness courses have offered significantly improved wellbeing by reducing stress, fostering compassionate care and providing greater clarity in prioritising the demands of life.\u201d",
    "Further, there is emerging data that mindfulness could be of help in two major health problems affecting the world. Though it may not be a big problem at the moment in Sri Lanka, due to the prevailing economic situation, obesity is a worldwide problem and it leads to many other problems including diabetes and heart disease.",
    "According to a report published in \u2018mindfulnessmeditationinstitute.org\u2019 in January 2023: \u201cA growing body of research has found that mindfulness helps people lose weight and keep it off. Researchers at North Carolina State University have evaluated several peer-reviewed studies that show a direct link between mindfulness and weight loss. And four out of the five studies that followed up months later found that research participants were able to keep the weight off. In another systematic review, researchers also found the link between mindfulness and weight loss in 13 out of 19 studies. The reasons for some of them not showing a link are likely due to methodology of the studies, such as the nature of the mindfulness intervention.\u201d",
    "It continues to state: \u201cAccording to Judson A. Brewer, psychiatrist and director of research and innovation at the Mindfulness Centre at the Brown University School of Public Health, the reason mindfulness helps people lose weight is that overeating has more to do with the brain than the body. As he explains it, the cause of the extra pounds is eating based on emotions. Those who are overweight tend to eat when they feel stressed, lonely, or bored, and over time, they create deeply entrenched habits. One mechanism by which mindfulness works is that the practice helps build the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is responsible for willpower to say no to unhealthy foods. In addition, mindfulness helps us understand the reasons for our eating behaviour, and gives us the strength to address those reasons. These two mechanisms are essential for changing old eating habits.\u201d",
    "It was the Buddha who advocated mindful eating, as well stated in Donapaka Sutta. When King Pasenadi of Kosala came to see the Buddha, he was breathless. Buddha, noticing that he was obese due to overeating, advised him on mindful eating and the king lost weight as a result. This is something we all can do. Instead of gulping our food till becoming breathless, we should learn to smell the food, taste each constituent and enjoy the food. In no time you would realise that small meals taken with mindfulness are more satisfying and less fattening!",
    "One of the biggest health problems facing the world today is dementia. According to WHO, there are 55 million people with dementia worldwide, 60% of whom live in low and middle-income countries, nearly 10 million cases being added every year. Drug treatment is in its infancy and economic burden is tremendous. Interestingly, there are many reports indicating that mindfulness meditation can retard cognitive decline.",
    "A recent trial in Canada on 261 nondemented older adults with a family history of Alzheimer dementia showed that mindfulness meditation not only reduced cognitive decline but also showed less beta-amyloid, a biochemical marker, in the brains. A French study of 137 patients showed that participants assigned to an 18-months course of meditation did better than those assigned to learn English as a stimulus to the brain. There are many other trials showing similar results but some may argue that these are small trials. However, we cannot overlook the fact that there are practical difficulties in conducting mega-trials.",
    "Of course, there are other measures that will prevent dementia like a healthy diet and regular exercise. On top of these, at least a few minutes of mindfulness, a couple of times daily is bound to keep our brain functioning well. Loving-kindness meditation, as you are falling asleep may help good sleep, which is also important in preserving cognitive function.",
    "Mindfulness, if practised regularly, can enrich our daily lives even if it does not change the world!",
