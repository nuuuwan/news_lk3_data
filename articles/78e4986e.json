    "A fundamental rights petition has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the candidacy of former MP Ranjan Ramanayake in the upcoming 2024 General Elections. A member of an independent group contesting in the Gampaha district lodged the petition today, seeking to disqualify Ramanayake from running as a candidate representing the United Democratic Voice Party.",
    "The petitioner has requested the Supreme Court to reject Ramanayake\u2019s nomination, asserting that he lacks both the right to vote and the right to hold Parliamentary office. Named respondents in the petition include Ramanayake, the National Election Commission, and Gampaha District Election Officers.",
    "Ramanayake, an actor-turned-politician, was convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to four years in prison in January 2021 after making statements outside Temple Trees in 2017 that were deemed disrespectful to the Judiciary. Although he received a conditional pardon in August 2022 from then President Ranil Wickremesinghe after submitting an apology to the Chief Justice and the judiciary, his civic rights, including the right to vote and contest in elections, were not fully restored.",
    "In early October, Ramanayake formally appealed to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake for a full restoration of his civic rights under Article 34(1) of the Sri Lankan Constitution, which grants the President authority to pardon convicted persons. Ramanayake has expressed optimism that President Dissanayake will consider granting a full pardon, enabling him to resume full political participation. However, until a decision is reached, his eligibility to contest remains in question."
