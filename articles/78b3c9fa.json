    "Despite a recent uptick in economic indicators, a senior economist has cautioned that Sri Lanka\u2019s current growth trajectory is inadequate for a full recovery, calling for a decisive push towards 8-10% expansion in the coming years.",
    "The warning from University of Peradeniya\u2019s Wasantha Athukorala follows data showing the economy grew by 4.9% in the second quarter of 2025, an improvement from the 4.1% growth recorded a year earlier.",
    "Prof. Athukorala acknowledged a recent vote of confidence from the global market, referencing S&P Global Ratings\u2019 upgrade of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign currency sovereign credit rating. However, he stressed that the \u2018CCC+\u2019 rating still signifies high risk and does not qualify the country for easy credit.",
    "\u201cThis upgrade reflects a positive start for stability and growth,\u201d he stated, noting it should boost investor confidence and improve access to global capital. \u201cBut the current 5% economic growth is not sufficient.\u201d",
    "The economist outlined a challenging path forward, arguing that achieving high growth requires implementing difficult structural reforms. He emphasised that the Central Bank must simultaneously maintain low inflation, ensure currency stability, build foreign reserves, and keep interest rates low.",
    "The message is clear: while the economy shows nascent signs of stabilisation, reaching the 8-10% growth necessary for lasting prosperity will demand consistent and disciplined economic management.",
