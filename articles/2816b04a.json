    "The much-awaited parliamentary election came to pass yesterday, and its outcome was not known at the time of going to press. Unofficial reports were coming in from some counting centres in different parts of the country; speculation is rife in political circles that it\u2019s all over bar the shouting, but it ain\u2019t over until the fat lady sings, as a popular saying goes. Most of all, this is the age of fake news and one has to wait until the Election Commission (EC) announces the final result officially in the course of today.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appealed to the public to ensure that the next Parliament would be full of NPP MPs so that he and his colleagues could cleanse the legislature. He urged the public to vote for the NPP in such a way as to make its opponents cry! The Opposition asked for a mandate to form a government and act as a countervailing force against the Executive President. The people have spoken and the EC will figure out what they have said, and all we can do is to hope that the winner will have a working majority in Parliament to form a stable government.",
    "A hung parliament will be inimical to political stability, which is a prerequisite for economic recovery. Never do Sri Lankan political leaders cooperate for the sake of the country. They resumed fighting even in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami disaster, after holding hands for the camera at a public function and pledging to work together to help the victims.",
    "Clashes invariably erupt between the President and the Prime Minister when they happen to be elected from two different political parties. This situation comes about because we are without statespersons, and our political culture is rotten to the core.",
    "Winning an election is one thing but living up to the people\u2019s expectations is quite another. The party that gains control of the 10th Parliament will face daunting challenges. The economy is not out of the woods yet, and the people are crying out for relief. The IMF will not soften its stand, and the new government will have to abide by its dictates.",
    "Interestingly, Il Full Moon Poya falls today, and there could not have been a better day for the winner of a general election to be announced. Sri Lankan politicians never miss an opportunity to flaunt their religiosity, and their vehicles look like mobile shrines. Many of them are Buddhists and have pirith nool around their wrists; President Dissanayake, who leads the Marxist JVP, is no exception. They are often seen in Buddhist temples. During pre-election television debates many Opposition politicians lamented that they could not take part in religious functions during the katina season owing to the general election.",
    "Moreover, in the run-up to the September presidential election, the NPP and its rivals fought quite a battle, with the latter accusing the former of a sinister move to deprive Buddhism of the foremost place guaranteed by the Constitution. The NPP\u2008leaders vowed to ensure that Article 09 of the Constitution, which accords the foremost place to Buddhism, would remain intact under an NPP government. They visited the Maha Nayake Theras in a bid to counter hostile propaganda and enlisted the support of some prominent Buddhist monks for that purpose. They succeeded in their endeavour, as evident from their impressive win in predominantly Buddhist areas. Their critics have embarked on a campaign to protect Buddhism. So, they ought to determine themselves to be guided by the tenets of Buddhism.",
    "Let the NPP leaders and their rivals be urged to be mindful of a well-known blessing quoted in the Constitution:",
