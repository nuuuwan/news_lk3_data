  "original_body_lines": [
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Berlin on Wednesday for a German-hosted virtual meeting with Donald Trump and European leaders, two days before the U.S. president meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
    "Europe\u2019s leaders are trying to drive home the perils of selling out Kyiv\u2019s interests at the first U.S.-Russia summit since 2021.",
    "Trump has said the Alaska talks will be a \u201cfeel-out\u201d meeting as he pursues a ceasefire in Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine, having said last week, to consternation in Kyiv and Europe, that any deal would involve \u201csome swapping of territories\u201d.",
    "Zelenskiy will meet German Chancellor Friedrich Merz before a video conference with the leaders of Germany, Finland, France, Britain, Italy, Poland and the European Union at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT), the hosts said.",
    "Trump and Vice President JD Vance will join the call at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT).",
    "The unpredictability of the summit in Alaska has fuelled Europeans\u2019 fears that the U.S. and Russia could take far-reaching decisions over their heads and even seek to coerce Ukraine into an unfavourable deal.",
    "\u201cWe are focusing now to ensure that it does not happen - engaging with U.S. partners and staying coordinated and united on the European side. Still a lot of time until Friday,\u201d said one senior official from Eastern Europe.",
    "European leaders, wary of angering Trump, have repeatedly said they welcome his efforts while stressing that there should be no deal about Ukraine - almost a fifth of which Russia has occupied - without Ukraine\u2019s participation.",
    "Trump\u2019s administration tempered expectations on Tuesday for major progress toward a ceasefire, calling his meeting with Putin in Alaska a \u201clistening exercise\u201d.",
    "Trump\u2019s agreement last week to the summit with Putin was an abrupt shift after weeks of voicing frustration with Putin for resisting the U.S. peace initiative. Trump said his envoy had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d at talks in Moscow.",
    "Half a dozen senior European officials told Reuters that they see a risk of a deal being struck that is unfavourable for Europe and Ukraine\u2019s security. They said European unity would be vital if that happened.",
    "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday the summit would be a \u201clistening exercise\u201d for Trump to hear what it would take to get to a deal.",
    "After the meeting with Trump, the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d, a group of countries working on plans to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, will also convene online.",
    "A Gallup poll released last week found that 69% of Ukrainians favour a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible. But polls also indicate Ukrainians do not want peace at any cost if that means crushing concessions.",
    "Ahead of the calls, Zelenskiy said it would be impossible for Kyiv to agree to a deal that would require it to withdraw its troops from the eastern Donbas region, a large swathe of which is already occupied by Russia.",
    "That, he told reporters on Tuesday, would deprive Ukraine of a vast defensive network in the region, easing the way for a Russian push deeper into Ukraine in the future.",
    "He said territorial issues could only be discussed once a ceasefire was in place and Ukraine had received security guarantees.",
    "Moscow\u2019s troops have recently ramped up pressure on the battlefield, tightening their stranglehold on the cities of Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka in eastern Ukraine."
