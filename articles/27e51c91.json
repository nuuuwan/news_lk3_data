    "The Sri Lanka Police yesterday confirmed that its official website was not compromised during the recent cyber-attack on its social media accounts.",
    "Addressing a media briefing organised by the Government Information Department, Police Media Spokesman SSP Buddhika Manatunga explained that while the Police\u2019s YouTube, Facebook and Twitter accounts were targeted, the website remained secure. \u201cWe were able to recover all four social media accounts within four to five hours. Additional time was needed to recover the YouTube account, but the website was neither hacked nor compromised,\u201d he said.",
    "He said the initial investigations into the cyber attack have revealed that it was conducted from overseas targeting multiple entities. \u201cIt was not an isolated attack on Sri Lanka Police, there were similar incidents reported from India. The Police Cyber Crimes Division is conducting further investigation into the incident,\u201d he added.",
    "SSP Manatunga also assured the public that its new \u2018eTraffic\u2019 app prioritises data security, whilst announcing that the app will be available for download on the Play Store and Apple Store next week.",
    "Addressing concerns raised by journalists about data security, he stressed that no private data will be entered into the app\u2019s system. \u201cThere is only a connection through an account. The Police have no ill intention and only seek public contributions to ensure law and order. If there are any identified weaknesses, they will be addressed in future,\u201d he assured.",
    "Responding to surveillance concerns, SSP Manatunga said that experts were consulted during the app\u2019s development to ensure data protection."
