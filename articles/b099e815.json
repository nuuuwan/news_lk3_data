    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s LTL Holdings is planning to raise up to 20 billion rupees, subject to regulatory approvals, in what could be the largest initial public offer in the Colombo Stock Exchange, an official said.",
    "LTL Holdings is an affiliate of Ceylon Electricity Board, which originally made transformer but expanded into the independent power generation business after the original foreign investors in the firm exited in a management buyout.",
    "The firm plans to sell around 22 percent of the shares in the IPO.",
    "The idea is to raise 16 billion rupees and an addition 4.0 billion rupees through a green shoe option, Chief Executive Nuhuman Marikkar said.",
    "The Colombo Stock Exchange said the issue would open on September 10 at 14.50 rupees a share with an initial issue of 1,103,448,300 ordinary shares and an option to sell another 275,862,100 shares.",
    "About 14 billion rupees will go to fund part of the equity component of a new 350 MegaWatt combined cycle to be called Sahasdanavi.",
    "The power plants come under the subsidiary Lakdhanavi Ltd, of which LTL Holdings has 82 percent. The O&M contracts are also with the firm, Marikkar said.",
    "About 5.5 billion rupees would go 100 MW renewable plant to be built with Sri Lanka\u2019s Windforce.",
    "On Wednesday, the 220MW gas turbine (open cycle) component of the another 350 MW power plant (Sobadanavi) was commissioned.",
    "The full plant with steam turbine is expected next year. Until liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies are available it will run on diesel.",
    "The plant built with Siemens technology can also run with 30 percent green hydrogen, should it become available, Marikkar said.",
    "LTL also operates another combined cycle, also in Kerawalapitiya, which runs on furnace oil. But the new plant is more efficient, he said. (Colombo/Aug29/2024)"
