    "Sri Lanka has slipped sharply in global gender equality rankings, according to findings presented by UN Women to the Women Parliamentarians\u2019 Caucus recently. The country, which ranked 18th out of 115 nations in 2006, has fallen to 130th among 148 countries in 2025.",
    "The study assessed women\u2019s economic empowerment, participation in governance and decision-making, roles in peace and security, and efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. While acknowledging that some of the region\u2019s most influential figures are women, the research highlighted persistent disparities between men and women across these areas.",
    "Chairing the session, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj called for the final report to be shared with the caucus and proposed that, in addition to allocations for the Women and Child Affairs Ministry, each Ministry should set aside funds in the upcoming Budget to support women\u2019s empowerment.",
    "She also announced plans for a study, with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, on challenges faced by women in public office from Local Government to the Presidency.",
    "Discussions also included the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, which outlined initiatives to strengthen women\u2019s participation in politics at local, provincial, and national levels. Paulraj invited the Foundation to present its proposals to the Caucus.",
    "Several Parliamentarians, including Deputy Chairperson of Committees Hemali Weerasekara and MPs Kaushalya Ariyaratne, Oshani Umanga, Krishnan Kalaichelvi, and others, attended the meeting."
