    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s current gross foreign exchange inflows have exceeded imports of 2,411 million dollars in August have exceeded imports of 1,654 million US dollars in August 2024, official data released by the central bank show.",
    "Current inflows include merchandise exports of 1,224 million US dollars, the highest since August 2022, remittances of 577.5 million US dollars, and gross service (including 282 million of estimated tourism earnings) of 609.3 million US dollars.",
    "Travel aboard was reported as 99.7 million US dollars for August and air transport, 61.2 million dollars.",
    "When inflows are spent by their recipients, like export factory workers, families of expatriate workers, tourism sector workers or staff of information technology firms, imports are generated.",
    "Since inflows come from areas other than merchandise exports, like tourism or remittances, there is usually a trade deficit.",
    "When foreign funded projects resume (an inflow through the financial account) imports will be boosted (a current account outflow).",
    "Since most people save, for all foreign exchange earnings to be turned into imports, savings have to be invested via private credit, which will generate more imports as building materials are brought in and workers are paid.",
    "When interest or dividends is paid, or debt is repaid or foreign reserves are built from savings (which is the same as repaying debt), domestic investments will fall and the current account deficit would narrow.",
    "There will be a balance of payments surplus if the central bank does not cut rates with printed money and runs deflationary open market operations at an appropriate interest rate. The BOP surplus up to August 2024 was about 2.1 billion US dollars.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation stopped in its tracks in September 2022, when the central bank\u2019s deflationary policy started to show up in the BOP.",
    "The central bank has also allowed the exchange rate to appreciate amid deflationary policy, and the fall in traded goods have somewhat offset services price rises to account for earlier depreciation and also VAT.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has a foreign reserve target under an International Monetary Fund program. In order to collect and retain reserves, and new rupees generated from dollar purchases being invested domestically, some central bank held assets have to be sold to banks (OMO has to be deflationary).",
    "Analysts have warned that when private credit recovers, if the central bank cuts rates claiming inflation is low, and prints money to enforce a policy rate the BOP will turn into deficit, the rupee will depreciate and Sri Lanka will default on restructured bonds. (Colombo/Oct04/2024)"
