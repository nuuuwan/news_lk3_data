    "Sri Lanka and Iran will sign five Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) today, in a bid to bolster the bilateral relations between the two nations.",
    "The signing of the agreements will coincide with the one-day visit of Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "At the invitation of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Iranian president is set to arrive in Sri Lanka today after wrapping up his three-day visit to neighbouring Pakistan.

Moreover, the areas of Badulla, Monaragala, and Hambantota will benefit from 39 million cubic meters (MCM) of water for drinking and industrial purposes, while generating and adding 290 GWh of electrical energy annually to the National Grid.",

    "Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed between the Sri Lanka and Iran on 27 November 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers had approved the execution of the contract agreement between the executing agency, Ministry of Irrigation and Water Management of Sri Lanka and Farab Energy and Water Projects (Farab Company) of Iran dated 28 April 2008 to implement the UOMDP by Farab Company, as an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract."
