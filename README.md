### Sri Lanka could get hit from a disorderly US tumble

*2024-04-16 06:53:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-could-get-hit-from-a-disorderly-us-tumble-158583/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is recovering fast but the country could get hit from an unravelling of advanced economies, particularly the United States, which is skating on very thin ice, after exceptionally bad monetary policy, which has destroyed fiscal metrics as well.

The US was running bad to atrocious monetary policy since 2001, when Ben Bernanke misled Alan Greenspan into printing money to run an 8-year cycle, firing a commodity and housing bubble which collapsed after rates were kept at around 5 percent for about a year.

That was the end of the Great Moderation started by Paul Volcker and continued with some skill under Greenspan, until the Fed was infected by Bernanke, the depression scholar. Keynes was also a ‘depression scholar’, in essence.

Gold prices fell from 800 to 284 dollars an ounce under Volcker-Bernanke, until Bernanke cooked up a false deflation scare with a healthy banking system and started to reverse it, firing the housing bubble and the Great Recession in its wake.

### Global expansion of single-origin Sri Lankan chocolate a major struggle: Mendis

Chocolatier Mendis points out shortage of cocoa beans and poor cooperation of authorities as key challenges

Says local growers stand to gain higher prices, due to limited availability of cocoa globally

Sri Lanka’s celebrity chocolatier, chef and agriculture enthusiast Gerard Mendis faces an uphill battle in his bid to take single-origin Sri Lankan chocolates global. This is primarily due to the shortage of cocoa beans and absence of active cooperation of authorities.

“In Sri Lanka, we have our own cocoa beans but we don’t have a sufficient quantity to cater to the demand of the local market. I took some (local) cocoa beans to a factory in Switzerland. Their feedback was that it (Sri Lankan cocoa) was one of the best they had ever tried and were keen on getting more. Unfortunately, we don’t have the quantity,” Mendis told Mirror Business.

### Central Bank’s March dollar purchases hit record high

*2024-04-16 02:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Banks-March-dollar-purchases-hit-record-high/108-280732) · `en`

The Central Bank has purchased the most amount of dollars for a single month in March, a sign that the country is currently in a very comfortable position in its foreign currency liquidity, after two years into the worst currency crisis in the country.

According to the data released last week, the Central Bank purchased US $ 715.1 million in March, which is the highest ever in the last decade. While the monetary watchdog sold none, the dollar purchase is a sharp increase from the roughly US $ 240 million purchased from the banking system in February, on a net basis.

In January, the Central Bank purchased US $ 245.3 million and thus, the March net absorptions brought the first three months’ purchases to US $ 1,199.0 million.

The Central Bank later last month said it would intervene in the foreign currency market to prevent excessive volatility, as the rupee has in recent times appreciated quite significantly after it plunged to its lowest levels in 2022.

### Political accounts in the presidential election

*2024-04-16 01:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181186) · `ta`

Minority parties, including Tamil, Muslim, and Upcountry groups, are negotiating political deals for influence, focusing on parliamentary victories and ministerial positions. Douglas Devananda, a key figure in the North, supports Ranil, influenced by past support from the TNA and his desire for autonomy. Ranil's potential support from SKK members and the All Ceylon People's Congress could secure his position in the UNP. Despite this, the UNP's chances in parliamentary elections are slim, leading to a strategic shift. Ranil is firm in the Vanni district, potentially leaving the PA for the UNP, with no immediate crisis for the UNP in Vanni. The Eastern Province's support for Ranil is also noted, with plans for ministry status in future elections. Other parties, including the Ceylon Workers Congress and the Tamil Progressive Alliance, have their positions, with the latter supporting Sajith. The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) plans to boycott the presidential election in the North and East, highlighting the complexity of uniting Tamil parties.

🟩

The minority nationals, the Tamil, Muslim and Upcountry parties, have put political accounts for bargains in accordance with their influence, like the political account centered on the main candidates of Ranil, Sajith and Anura.

In particular, all these parties make a final resolution, focusing on their victories in the parliamentary election, and the ministry and the ministry of the Ministry of State.

In that respect, Douglas Devananda in the North took a decision to support Ranil before the political parties or individuals in the country decided.. There are two reasons for this.

The first reason was during the 2015 regime change, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) supported the Ranil Federation. Even if Ranil wanted to incorporate Douglas, the federation did not allow it.

Even if the federation is currently in action, its membership parties are still in operation;Douglas may have thought it was appropriate to announce resolutions before such conditions occur.

### Nettles Needing To Be Grasped By Future Leaders Of Sri Lanka

The New Year celebrations this year were low key compared to the past. The loud sound of crackers and other fireworks that traditionally accompany the dawn of the New Year were less than in the past. The economic burden on the people has begun to tell and was evident in the reduced purchase of new clothes and other items in preparation for the New Year. It can be surmised that the general population has less savings to utilize due to those savings being consumed in earlier months when people’s expenditures exceeded their income. The latest World Bank publication titled ‘World Bank Update: Bridges to Recovery’ released on April 2 shows that poverty has increased over the past four years—from 11 percent in 2019 to almost 26 percent in 2024 in Sri Lanka. According to it, approximately 60 percent of Sri Lankan households have decreased incomes, with many facing increased food insecurity, malnutrition and stunted growth.
