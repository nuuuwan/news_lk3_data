    "Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has requested the government to suspend the recent Cabinet decision which approved local students to gain admission to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University's medical degree programme.",
    "Under the endorsed proposal, which received the nod from the Cabinet, aspiring medical students from Sri Lanka will have the opportunity to commence their studies at the renowned institution from the upcoming academic year.",
    "Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, spokesperson for the GMOA, called on the government to suspend the decision, citing concerns over its lack of consultation with relevant stakeholders and transparency.",
    "\"The relevant authorities have not provided sufficient reasons for implementing this decision,\" Dr. Wijesinghe stated. \"As a professional body, we are concerned about the potential impact on the quality of medical education.\"",
    "Furthermore, the GMOA announced plans to address their concerns with the President's Office, seeking clarification on the decision-making process.",
    "As such, the GMOA has called for the suspension of the decision until further clarification is provided by the government.",
