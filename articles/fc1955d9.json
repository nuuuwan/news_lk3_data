    "Speaking at the fifth mid-point review meeting held today (07) at the Presidential Secretariat with an IMF delegation, the President stressed that the government\u2019s reform agenda is focused on achieving long-term stability, inclusive growth, and investor confidence. The sixth tranche of IMF assistance is scheduled for release in December.",

He noted that while the IMF\u2019s continued support has been instrumental in restoring confidence and stability, ensuring robust infrastructure and a conducive investment environment is vital for sustaining growth.",
