    "The Presidents\u2019 Entitlements (Repeal) Bill has been approved after consideration by the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Governance, Justice and Civil Protection.",
    "The approval was granted by the Committee during a meeting held in Parliament under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament Dr. Najith Indika, today (09).",
    "Commenting on the Bill, officials of the Ministry of Justice and National Integration said that, as stated in the Government Policy Statement, the Presidents\u2019 Entitlements (Repeal) Bill is expected to remove non-economic entitlements granted to former and future Presidents and their families, taking into account the economic conditions of the country.",
    "The officials further noted that retired Presidents or Heads of State in other countries receive pensions and privileges similar to those in Sri Lanka because they often continue to perform certain official duties or responsibilities even after leaving office. They added that the repeal Bill includes provisions to limit the pensions and extensive privileges of former Presidents and their families who have not been assigned any official responsibilities.",
    "Accordingly, as decided in the Committee on Parliamentary Business held today, the Presidents\u2019 Entitlements (Repeal) Bill is scheduled to be debated for the second reading in Parliament tomorrow (10)."
