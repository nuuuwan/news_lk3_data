    "Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to mangrove conservation is a strong backdrop for Hayleys Fentons\u2019 \u201cRoots of Resilience\u201d programme.",
    "Hayleys Fentons Limited celebrated the inauguration of the \u201cRoots of Resilience\u201d biodiversity conservation programme. The project began with the signing of the MoU on November 7, 2023. This significant endeavour was carried out in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka and the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management (CCCRMD).",
    "The \u201cRoots of Resilience\u201d biodiversity conservation programme aims to reinstate the vital mangrove ecosystem in the Bolgoda River. This river, a valuable natural treasure, was selected due to its ecological importance and the environmental threats it faces. The project witnessed the planting of 1,000 mangrove saplings on the banks of the river, an initial step towards the project\u2019s long-term goal of enriching biodiversity and supporting local communities.",
    "\u201cMangroves are highly productive but extremely vulnerable ecosystems found in the intertidal zone of coastal environments, including lagoons. In Sri Lanka\u2019s Coastal Zone and Coastal Resources Management Plan (CZ&CRMP), mangroves are listed as one of the most important coastal habitats. Hayleys Fentons Limited\u2019s \u201cRoots of Resilience\u201d is closely aligned with the country\u2019s goals for mangrove protection and restoration, as replanting schemes are one of the CZ&CRMP\u2019s core actions. Mangroves act as large filters, removing pollutants, excess nutrients, and sediment from inland municipal and industrial wastewater as well as stormwater runoff. The planting of 1000 mangrove saplings will have a major positive impact on the function of the habitat,\u201d stated Eng. R.A.S. Ranawaka, Director General of CCCRMD.",
    "\u201cAs this initiative also combats climate change effects on the habitat, it will improve ecosystem services, providing additional benefits to local fishermen communities through increased natural production. Community participation, public awareness, and close monitoring of progress are critical for the success and sustainability of the project\u2019s five-year plan.\u201d",
    "Expressing his views, Hasith Prematillake, Managing Director of Hayleys Fentons Limited, highlighted the initiative\u2019s dual purpose. \u201cBy undertaking this initiative, we wish to take meaningful action to benefit our valuable local environment while contributing to the global effort in preserving biodiversity and combating climate change, leaving a positive impact for the future generation.\u201d",
    "Sujith De Alwis, CEO of Hayleys Fentons Limited, emphasised the company\u2019s consistent dedication to environmental stewardship, saying, \u201cWe understand the critical role that biodiversity conservation plays in ensuring the sustainability of our planet. Fully aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the \u201cRoots of Resilience\u201d initiative has a wide-ranging effect. Through mangrove replanting, it is anticipated to counteract climate change by removing 5.9 tonnes of atmospheric carbon per year. Furthermore, within two years, the preserved and regenerated mangrove ecosystems will support regional fisheries, promoting a robust ecosystem.\u201d",
    "Pamudith Gunawardana, Director Finance and the custodian of ESG efforts at Hayleys Fentons Limited, commented, \u201cThis endeavour is a critical step towards enhancing biodiversity conservation and contributing to ecosystem restoration.",
