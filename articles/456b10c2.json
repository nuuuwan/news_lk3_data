  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has denounced the recent statement issued by the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles at the Katukurunda STF training camp\u2019s passing out parade, which garnered widespread attention across various media platforms.",
    "According to media reports, the Minister asserted, \u201cEliminating criminals from the country is not a sin. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the weapon in your hand for the right thing, and we stand by you.\u201d",
    "Issuing a statement today (29), the BASL expressed grave concern over the aforementioned statement, deeming it in direct contradiction to the fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution and the established procedures governing the criminal justice system.",
    "It said the dispensation of justice, including the imposition of penalties upon wrongdoers, is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts as mandated by the Constitution and that such actions must adhere strictly to due process, including thorough investigations and fair trials conducted in accordance with the law.",
    "\u201cGiven the alarming increase in extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, and incidents of torture perpetrated by law enforcement in recent times, the Minister\u2019s statement perpetuates a dangerous misconception that justice, sentencing, and punishment lie beyond the purview of the judiciary and can be administered arbitrarily, without adherence to due process,\u201d the BASL said.",
    "The Bar Association further stressed that the recurring pattern of irresponsible, arbitrary, and misleading remarks by the Minister underscores the urgent need for corrective action. As a custodian of public security, the Minister is duty-bound to serve the interests of the populace. However, the repeated dissemination of such misguided messages not only undermines public trust but also misguides law enforcement personnel, it said.",
    "Therefore, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka emphatically called for the immediate retraction of the Minister\u2019s statement.",
    "The BASL also called upon the President to forthwith remove Minister Tiran Alles from the portfolio of Public Security as he, \u201cby his repeated statements encouraging impunity and callous disregard for the rule of law, demonstrates that he is no longer suitable to hold that office.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, the BASL reaffirmed the sacrosanct principle that the authority to mete out punishment must remain vested solely in the courts, operating within the bounds of established legal procedures.",
    "Additionally, the BASL reiterated the fundamental right of every individual accused of an offence to undergo a fair and diligent investigation and to receive a fair trial, as guaranteed by the law and international conventions adhered to by any civilized legal system."
