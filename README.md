If one thinks new in the hill country will make him political revenge. After the last time I heard the election, I had a lot of political casualties.

Made revenge on those who worked for us. So I thought I had to be silent;Sometimes in some politics we have to be silent. That's what I did.

I was hiding in the parliamentary election when I was hiding.

### Sri Lanka’s export economy heavily concentrated around apparel: IPS

*2024-10-22 13:32:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-export-economy-heavily-concentrated-around-apparel-ips-184407/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s goods and services exports accounted for nearly 20.4 percent of GDP in 2023, with manufacturing exports contributing 14 percent, the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) said, noting however that the country’s export economy remains heavily concentrated around industrial goods, particularly apparel.

IPS said in a statement that industrial goods—primarily apparel—make up 77 percent of export income, while agricultural exports contribute just 22 percent. This lack of diversification has left Sri Lanka vulnerable, with its economy highly dependent on apparel and traditional agricultural sectors like tea and rubber, the institute said.

These vulnerabilities, exacerbated by recent economic challenges, raise the critical question of whether reforms in trade, energy, and agriculture can provide the boost needed for recovery, IPS said citing talking points raised at a recent event organised by institute to launch its State of the Economy 2024 report.
