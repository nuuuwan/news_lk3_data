    "Sri Lanka has won a historic legal battle. In a long-awaited judgment, the Supreme Court has ordered the owners of the X-Press Pearl container ship to pay USD 1 billion in initial compensation for the catastrophic marine disaster caused when the ship caught fire and sank off the coast of Colombo in 2021. But even as environmentalists and legal advocates celebrate the ruling, a pressing question looms: How will this money be used?",
    "Senior environmentalists and legal experts warn that without transparency, public oversight and a long-term vision, the billion-dollar windfall could quickly dissipate\u2014leaving the damage to Sri Lanka\u2019s coastal communities, fisheries and ecosystems largely unaddressed.",
    "Following are some views expressed to The Island Financial Review: \u201cThe compensation must not disappear into the Treasury\u2019s Black Box, cautioned Hemantha Withanage, co-founder of the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), which spearheaded the litigation. \u201cThis is not just money\u2014it is an opportunity to begin repairing what has been lost, restoring marine life and supporting the people whose livelihoods were destroyed.\u201d",
    "The five-judge Supreme Court bench made it clear: the USD 1 billion must be treated as compensation for environmental and socio-economic harm, not general revenue. The ruling, rooted in the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle, also recommended criminal proceedings against the ship owners for deliberately concealing the hazardous nature of their cargo.",
    "\u201cThis money should never be used to pay off debts or plug budget deficits, said Dr. Ravindranath Dabare, senior attorney and lead counsel for CEJ. \u201cIt must be placed in a dedicated and transparent fund for environmental rehabilitation and community support.\u201d",
    "He proposes the creation of a special-purpose trust fund, overseen by an independent board comprising representatives from the Auditor General\u2019s Department, marine scientists, environmental lawyers, civil society and the fishing community.",
    "\u201cThe model we need is like the Deepwater Horizon fund in the U.S.\u2014a transparent, monitored, ring-fenced mechanism that ensures every cent is tracked and spent in the public interest, Dabare added.",
