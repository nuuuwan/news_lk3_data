### French President dissolves parliament and calls a snap election

PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France’s parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.

The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union’s parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron’s pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.

Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron’s Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.

Macron himself wasn’t a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.

### Tourism trade remains robust despite seasonal softening in May

The tourism trade is going through an expected softening due to the seasonality tied to the arrivals, but it has managed to eke out an income of US$ 154.0 million in May, data showed.

This was down from US$ 225.7 million in April but up from US$ 100.0 million a year ago when the trade was recovering from repeated crises.

Sri Lanka’s economy weakened due to waning inflows from tourism and other foreign currency inflows due to the 2019 Easter attacks, two years of pandemic induced restrictions over travel and in-person events, and then by the ‘Aragalaya’ in 2022.

It added to the challenges faced by tourism in its efforts to revive while the global travel industry started picking up from two years of pursuing stay at home orders due to the worldwide pandemic.

This caused many countries to put up travel advisories against their people who were thinking of taking flights to Sri Lanka, delaying what looked like a continuous recovery in the trade.

### wokers’ remittances continue to plough ahead with US$ 544mn in May

Remittance income from Sri Lankans working abroad has continued to remain robust through May as the country received US$ 544.4 million in the month. This is both, higher from a month ago levels as well as the year earlier levels.

Sri Lankan received US$ 543.8 million as remittances in April this year while in May last year the receipts were US$ 479.7 million.

For the five months through May, the country received US$ 2, 624.4 million from remittances, up 11.8 percent from the same period a year ago.

Sri Lanka’s remittances started normalising when the authorities began cracking down on the informal money exchanges that were offering substantial premiums to the official exchange rate.

The rupee depreciation also helped emigrants to re-route their earnings via banks which until then were repatriated via informal channels.

*2024-06-10 06:24:52* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c0ww1537rv0o) · `si`

Based on the detailed account you've provided, here's a summary of the fundamental rights cases against Maithripala Sirisena and the rulings issued against him:



### Fundamental Rights Cases Against Maithripala Sirisena



1. **Dissolution of Parliament**: Maithripala Sirisena, while serving as the Executive President, dissolved the Parliament on November 9, 2018, leading to a general election held on January 5, 2019. This action led to several fundamental rights petitions being filed against him, challenging the legality of the dissolution.



2. **Violation of Constitutional Provisions**: The Supreme Court examined the petitions and issued a divisional injunction against the gazette notification issued by President Sirisena, preventing the dissolution of Parliament. The court ruled that the dissolution was unconstitutional because it did not comply with the required procedures outlined in the Constitution.



3. **Misuse of Power**: The Supreme Court further found that President Sirisena had abused his powers by not adhering to the legal requirements for dissolving Parliament. Specifically, the dissolution did not occur after the expiration of four and a half years following the previous general election, nor was it preceded by a vote of no-confidence in the government.



4. **Constitutional Violations**: The court concluded that President Sirisena's actions were in direct violation of the Constitution, particularly Article 70(1), which outlines the conditions under which the President may dissolve Parliament.



### Rulings Issued Against Maithripala Sirisena



1. **Compensation Order**: Following the Supreme Court's ruling, Maithripala Sirisena was ordered to pay Rs. 103 million as compensation for violating the fundamental rights of citizens through his unconstitutional actions.



2. **Interim Injunction**: This was the first time the Supreme Court issued an interim injunction against the President, suspending the gazette notification that led to the dissolution of Parliament.



3. **Constitutional Interpretation**: The Supreme Court provided a significant interpretation of the Constitution, clarifying the limited circumstances under which the President may dissolve Parliament. This ruling set a precedent for future cases involving presidential powers.



4. **Judicial Oversight of Executive Actions**: The case underscored the Supreme Court's role in protecting the Constitution and the fundamental rights of citizens from potential abuses of power by the Executive President.



These cases and rulings highlight the importance of judicial oversight in ensuring that the powers vested in the Executive President are exercised within the bounds of the Constitution and in the best interests of the nation.

### Lawyers’ Collective opposes President’s proposal to extend AG’s term

Lawyers’ Collective, a civil society group comprising legal professionals, has voiced its opposition to the recent recommendation by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend the term of Attorney General Sanjaya Rajaratnam beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. In a letter addressed to the members of the Constitutional Council, the Prime Minister, and other key figures, the letter outlined several serious concerns regarding the proposal.

The Collective recalled a similar situation in 2008 when an attempt to extend the term of an Attorney General resulted in a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court. They noted that this legal challenge ultimately led to the Attorney General in question opting for retirement rather than accepting the extension. According to the Collective, the Constitution does not empower the Constitutional Council to approve extensions for officials who are subject to a mandatory retirement age, thereby rendering such a proposal legally questionable.

### Gaza health ministry says Israeli hostage rescue killed 274 Palestinians

BBC: The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says an Israeli raid on a refugee camp – which led to the rescue of four hostages – killed 274 people, including children and other civilians.

On Saturday Israel’s forces, backed by air strikes, fought intense gun battles with Hamas in and around the Nuseirat refugee camp, freeing the captives.

Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrei Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, who were abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October have been returned to Israel.

The Israeli military has estimated that fewer than 100 people died in the operation.

People living in the densely-populated area have described the terror of coming under intense bombardment and heavy gunfire.

One man, Abdel Salam Darwish, told the BBC he was in a market buying vegetables when he heard fighter jets from above and the sound of gunfire.

### Poverty and homelessness stare elders in the face - EDITORIAL

Not many decades ago, our country was held up worldwide for its welfare state policies. Today, unfortunately, such praises are but a distant dream. Poverty rules the day-to-day life for a large number of our citizens.

Yet none of the political parties who are now canvassing for our vote, have come out with a single concrete proposal of how they intend to get this country out of its present dilemma.

In these columns, we have highlighted times out of number, the huge difference between the average wage and the cost a family of four needs to bear if they are to have two square meals a day. That cost amounted to over rupees one hundred thousand a month!

On the tea and rubber plantations -until the president recently forced owners to pay workers Rs. 1,700 per day workers were paid less than Rs. 1,000 per day. Daily paid or casual workers elsewhere in the country who form a majority of the country’s workforce receive less than Rs. 55,000 per month.
