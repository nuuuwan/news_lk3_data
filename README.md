ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who rose to the helm through a parliament vote two years back, has lost the presidential election for the third time in the Saturday poll after implementing two years of tough and unpopular economic reforms including tax hikes and state-owned enterprise restructuring.

Wickremesinghe lost the 2020 parliament election, but became a legislator in 2021 through a solitary national list vacancy his party secured in the poll.

He accepted the challenge of resurrecting a bankrupt economy in 2022 after former leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa invited him to take over as the Sri Lankan Prime Minister for the sixth time.

After he was elected as the parliament through a parliament vote, he stubbornly implemented some unpalatable economic reforms under an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led bailout package.
