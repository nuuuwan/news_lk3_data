    "Claims both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake are colluding to defeat him",
    "Says the President has already conceded he cannot win at the elections",
    "Accuses Wickremesinghe of acting as though he is Dissanayake\u2019s private secretary",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa has accused his rivals, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), of conspiring together through a secret pact.",
    "Speaking at a rally in Talawakelle yesterday, Sajith Premadasa alleged that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is acting as though he is Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s private secretary, implying that Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake have formed a secret political alliance.",
    "Premadasa accused the pair of collaborating to mount a significant campaign aimed at defeating him in the upcoming election.",
    "Premadasa accused Wickremesinghe of mimicking the promises he himself made on the campaign trail. \u201cHowever, the President has admitted he cannot win,\u201d Premadasa said. \u201cIt seems his only ambition now is to become Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s private secretary. That\u2019s why they are employing various tactics and investing resources to defeat Sajith Premadasa,\u201d he added.",
    "He also accused Wickremesinghe of attempting to sell the Nuwara Eliya post office. In response, Premadasa pledged to improve the lives of those living in line rooms and unemployed youth in Nuwara Eliya by providing them with land and helping them become smallholder tea estate owners.",
    "Meanwhile, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader Mano Ganesan addressing the rally said his party\u2019s support for Premadasa is not driven by personal gain. Instead, he said, it is motivated by the desire to fulfil the hopes of the people. Ganesan emphasised that a Sajith Premadasa administration would represent a golden opportunity for the Malaiyaha Tamils in Sri Lanka."
