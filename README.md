### Selling, Global Connections & Travelling

*2024-10-13 01:03:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/selling-global-connections-travelling/) · `en`

In the early 1990s, as the General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) and its Catering Company, which handled all event catering at Sri Lanka’s national convention centre, the BMICH, I found myself deeply immersed in sales and promotion. I worked closely the sales team to drive the hotel’s success. Together, we developed strategies to boost room sales, group bookings, and special events, ensuring that MLH remained a top destination in the country.

The hotel industry is all about creating unique experiences, and I made it my mission to promote MLH’s food festivals, stage productions, and other special events. I took the lead in media briefings and public relations campaigns, forming close working relationships with advertising agents to get the message out. My efforts extended to reimagining the iconic “Little Hut” nightclub, which quickly became the most popular night club in Sri Lanka during the early ’90s.

I joined Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI), a US development agency, in 1988 after serving the Sri Lankan government for 15 years. I left the government service because of political and bureaucratic meddling in research administration. The DAI recruited me as the resident water-user organisation specialist of the Mahaweli Agricultural Rural Development (MARD) Project, funded by USAID, in the Mahaweli System B Region.

The DAI was a good employer, and it gave me a well-furnished bungalow at Aralagawila (four miles from Dimbulagala) and a brand-new Pajero Jeep. I was happy to be away from Colombo after the difficult times with politicians and bureaucrats. Also, I was excited to move from doing research to project planning and implementation.

I had no place to go, because I was wedded to the agriculture sector – by my own choosing.

But I had to pay a career-price for doing this, because it involved my working under a non-civil servant and under someone whom I outranked in the Civil List – which was simply not done in those days.

### Brands … and brand names

*2024-10-12 23:06:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/brands-and-brand-names/) · `en`

I’m at the age where parties have become a chore rather than an outright pleasure.That is not quite true. There are some which I look forward to of course, but they tend to be small affairs with just close friends around, entailing minimal ‘fashion dressing’ with the accent on comfort rather than haute couture.

The ‘in crowd’ today, throw around brand names for every garment they wear, and it would not be an exaggeration to say most of my generation have not heard of them. We know of Christian Dior, Prada, and maybe Oscar de la Renta. but the ‘in crowd’ think very little of my clothes sense. In fact, they assume (quite rightly) that I have none at all as far as name brands go. Last year my USA living grand offspring, KitKat, viewed my six year old wallet with distaste.

“Rubbish. I paid Rs. 6000 for this and it is perfect. It was expensive five years ago and it looks new. Everyone wants to know where I bought it,” I bristled at her disbelieving look.

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

The Prime Minister had brought in Mr. Tissa Wijeyaratne, a lawyer, and one who had long antecedents in the Communist Party as the Additional Secretary Foreign Affairs, in the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs. Tissa had a good mind and was a witty speaker. I remember once. when I was an undergraduate at Peradeniya University, Tissa addressing a packed “Room A”, the largest hall in the University on some political topic.

Most of the undergraduates were almost equally divided between Communists and Trotskyites during this time, so that Tissa was well aware that his audience consisted of a large number of Trotskyites. His opening sentence was “Trotskyites of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your brains!” This was of course an invitation to pandemonium, which duly reigned for quite sometime, until a harassed presiding officer restored some degree of order and silence. That was Tissa.
