  "original_title": "Harvard heads to court to argue Trump administration\u2019s $2.6bn cuts were illegal",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Harvard University will appear in federal court Monday to make the case that the Trump administration illegally cut $2.6bn from the storied college \u2013 a pivotal moment in its battle against the federal government.",
    "If US district Judge Allison Burroughs decides in the university\u2019s favor, the ruling would reverse a series of funding freezes that later became outright cuts as the Trump administration escalated its fight with the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university. Such a ruling, if it stands, would revive Harvard\u2019s sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.",
    "\u201cThis case involves the government\u2019s efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard,\u201d the university said in its complaint. \u201cAll told, the tradeoff put to",
    "Harvard and other universities is clear: allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution\u2019s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.\u201d",
    "A second lawsuit over the cuts filed by the American Association of University Professors and its Harvard faculty chapter has been consolidated with the university\u2019s.",
    "Harvard\u2019s lawsuit accuses Donald Trump\u2019s administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism task force.",
    "The letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view. The letter was meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment on campus.",
    "Alan Garber, Harvard\u2019s president, pledged to fight antisemitism but said no government \u201cshould dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue\u201d.",
    "The same day Harvard rejected the demands, Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2bn in research grants. Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.",
    "As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies.",
    "Harvard, which has the nation\u2019s largest endowment at $53bn, has moved to self-fund some of its research, but warned it can\u2019t absorb the full cost of the federal cuts.",
    "In court filings, the school said the government \u201cfails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism\u201d.",
    "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the April demand letter was sent. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons.",
    "\u201cIt is the policy of the United States under the Trump administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,\u201d it said in court documents.",
    "The research funding is only one front in Harvard\u2019s fight with the federal government. The Trump administration also has sought to prevent the school from hosting foreign students, and Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status.",
    "Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism \u2013 a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard\u2019s federal funding, including federal student loans or grants."
