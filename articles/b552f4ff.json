  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Court of Appeal has ordered that a petition challenging the Parliamentary seat of Jaffna District Independent Group MP Ramanathan Archchuna be considered on 15 January. The petition seeks a writ of certiorari to nullify his position as a Member of Parliament.",
    "The petition by Abhinava Niwahal Peramuna Chairperson Oshala Herath was taken up today before a bench comprising Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and Mahen Gopallawa yesterday. After initial deliberations, the court scheduled the petition for 15 January to examine the facts in detail.",
    "The petitioner contends that MP Ramanathan Archchuna submitted his nomination papers during the last General Election while still serving as a doctor employed in the State sector. Herath argues that this act is illegal as it violates the Elections Act, which prohibits individuals holding Government office from contesting elections without first resigning.",
    "The petition further claims that such a nomination breaches constitutional provisions, rendering MP Archchuna unqualified to hold a Parliamentary seat. Accordingly, the petitioner has requested the court to declare the respondent\u2019s seat invalid."
