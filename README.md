ECONOMYNEXT – The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has condemned the government’s efforts to ‘illegally subvert the course of justice’ in relation to the Supreme Court interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon functioning as Inspector General of Police (IGP).

“The claim that the Supreme Court does not have power to call into question appointments made by the President which are approved by the Constitutional Council is, in the view of the BASL, totally untenable,” BASL said in a statement.

Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending Tennakoon from his office and suggesting that an acting appointment be made. The Court gave this verdict after granting leave to proceed for nine fundamental rights petitions filed against Tennakoon’s appointment as IGP.

However, Tennakoon remains in office, as there are no legal provisions for President Ranil Wickremesinghe to make an acting appointment now that polls have been declared, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardana has said.

### Harris tells Netanyahu ‘it is time’ to end war in Gaza

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said she urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home.

Harris said she had a “frank and constructive” conversation with Netanyahu in which she affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself but also expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza over nine months of war and the “dire” humanitarian situation there.

With all eyes on the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Harris largely reiterated President Joe Biden’s longstanding message that it’s time to find an endgame to the brutal war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have died. Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed “total victory” against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.

### Chavakachcheri Hospital Saga: The Tip Of The Iceberg Of A Broken & Outdated Health System – Part II

In Sri Lanka, 95% of physicians and staff are duty-conscious and have been doing their work diligently, even with the constrained environment and limited resources. However, the exiting system has been in place for over a century and the outdated concept with focus on centralized hospital-based health system is showing cracks.

In the 80s, I recall a cartoon in the Island newspaper captioned with the newspaper, stating “Sri Lanka has the best telecommunication system” -Minister of Telecommunication. The picture showed a man talking to himself looking at the phone: “I want to congratulate the minister, but this damn thing is out of order”

Now, about the health system in Sri Lanka, first thing comes to the news is that the Health Minister is in jail for corruption of illegal procurement. However, recently, it’s all about the misdeeds, competing behaviors and name calling with health care workers Strike En-Masse in Chavakacheri is the leading news.

### My Family’s “Black July” Experience: A Personal Memoir.

*2024-07-27 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84405) · `en`

The anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983 is an unforgettable chapter in the post-independence history of Sri Lanka.  The catastrophic events of that dark month  drastically affected  the lives of large numbers of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

As a Sri Lankan Tamil journalist, Black July did have an effect on me in both personal and professional capacities. Furthermore my family – like thousands of other Tamil families – was also affected and displaced during those turbulent times.

Although I have been writing  extensively about Black July in the past, I did not write about those happenings from a personal perspective  for many,many years.

I  refrained for a long time  from writing about the impact of Black July on our family for two reasons. Firstly I was spared the full blast of that violence because I was not in Colombo then. I was on assignment to cover the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) party convention in Mannar.

So, it is decision time for Deshabandu Thennakoon, and it is decision time for the Government. And, of course, it is decision time for the people of Sri Lanka

Hearing a set of Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several petitioners including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging the appointment of Deshabandu Thennakoon to the post of Inspector General of Police by the President of Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court has issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Thennakoon from performing the duties of Inspector General of Police. It also ordered that a suitable person be appointed (to act in the post of) IGP.

It is a remarkable decision by the Supreme Court. The interim order will apply until the final determination of the FR petitions challenging the appointment of Deshabandu Thennakoon  as ‘IGP’.

Deshabandu Thennakoon should promptly comply with the SC order. Orders of higher judiciary cannot be ignored except on a pain of punishment by way of contempt of court.

### Democracy should be about ethics, morality and social values, not just regime changes

No doubt many are questioning the moral and ethical values of politicians in general and the limitless price they will pay to achieve their ultimate objective, power

Democracy today is the dominant principle and practice throughout the world to legitimate political power through the choices expressed by people and yet its relationship to moral and ethical values and traditions does not seem to be an integral part of democracies. Moral and ethical theories are universal theories, whether they are on account of religious faiths or otherwise as they based on basic human values of kindness, compassion, fraternity and a sense of the wellbeing of a community rather than the individual. This thinking appears to be in contradiction of how people think and act when it comes to what is generally understood and practiced as democracy

The Aragalayists were not a bunch of romantically attached revolutionaries representing any dead leader or outdated theories. Instead, they were eye witnesses to a system of governance which for decades promised one thing but delivered quite another

If there is one glaring failure of Sri Lanka’s 76 years of democratic experience, it is the failure to produce good governance. That was made clear when IMF, after reviewing the economy’s performance over the last two years and under its direction, stressed the importance of serious reforms in governance if the economy were to move forward and achieve sustainable growth. The reasons for bad governance are several to enumerate and discuss here, but they all stem from the one single root – the political preoccupation to subvert Sri Lanka’s democracy into a Sinhala Buddhist supremacist ethnocracy
