    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka must either retain its provincial councils (PCs) with powers adequately devolved as provided for by the 13th amendment to the constitution or abolish the PC system entirely, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "At an all-party conference (APC) called by Wickremesinghe on Wednesday July 26 to discuss the full implementation of the 13th amendment as a solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-long ethnic issue, he said as president he has no authority to pass laws and it is up to parliament to do so.",
    "Citing common criticisms of the PC system, Wickremesinghe said provincial councils drain a lot of state funds as the central government, the PCs and even local government bodies are allocated vast amounts of money for essentially the same.",
    "\u201cIt would be great if we can reduce this amount by 25 percent. There is a mix up here. We allocate funds to the government, to the PCs and to the local government bodies to dig ditches when it can be given to just one of them,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cIt has to be one of the two. We have to either keep the PCs or remove them. All political parties went into elections saying the system must be retained. So I can\u2019t come here and say abolish it,\u201d he said.",
    "The president said when he proposed the full implementation of the 13th amendment, the matter of sharing police powers was raised. The fact of the matter, however, is new police legislation would need to be introduced before police powers are dissolved to the provinces, he said.",
    "\u201cThe minister is now formulating that,\u201d he said, presumably referring to either Public Security Minister Tiran Alles or Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.",
    "If Sri Lanka is to continue the PC system, said Wickremesinghe, provincial councils must be maintained properly. Given the friction between the councils and the central government, he said, no adequate development activity has been carried out even in the Sinhalese-majority seven provinces either in 10 to 15 years.",
    "\u201cThere was more work done when there were district development councils,\u201d he said.",
    "However, noting that provincial councils cannot be abolished just like that as the system is now well entrenched, President Wickremesinghe said he called the all party conference to discuss the full implementation of the India-backed 13th amendment, which resulted in the birth of the PC system in 1987.",
    "\u201cPeople say this is a white elephant. We must focus and give an answer. Everyone is trying to avoid this issue,\u201d he said.",
    "Chief ministers and opposition leaders in the seven PCs not including the northern and eastern provincial councils, said the president, has submitted a report indicating support for increased power sharing.",
    "\u201cIf that\u2019s not good, then they\u2019re all traitors too who want to divide the country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s not play this game, which we have been playing all this time,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cI have no mandate to bring these laws. It is the parliament that has the mandate to pass laws. All I can do is present them. Let\u2019s speak the truth. Let\u2019s decide whether we want to give this or not.",
    "\u201cIf you don\u2019t want this to be implemented, then remove the 13th amendment entirely. You can\u2019t be in two minds about this saying you want this but not that,\u201d he said, adding that the PC system is a \u201cheavy burden\u201d financially.",
    "Another APC will likely be called in one month\u2019s time, prior to which a decision must be reached, said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cOr we\u2019ll make draft bills and present them to parliament,\u201d he said.",
    "Another proposal made, according to the president, is to allow members of parliament to contest for PCs while retaining their parliamentary seat and vice versa.",
    "\u201cIf the people want, opposition MPs can become CMs of PCs. They can come to parliament and sit in the opposition as CM. We can go for that too.\u201d",
    "\u201cLike other countries, let\u2019s devolve power to all nine provinces. The work is already done in the other seven. I can\u2019t do this on my own. I have only one vote. You have the ultimate power,\u201d he said.",
    "A statement from the president\u2019s office said on Thursday July 27 that Wickremesinghe had stressed the significance of discussing the 13th amendment with all parties, as it is a matter that affects the entire country, noting that a decision on this matter should involve input from all relevant parties.",
    "The APC was organised to update parliament\u2019s party leaders on the National Reconciliation Program and the North-East Development Plan, the statement said.",
    "Shortcomings in PCs must be addressed, the president was quoted as saying, suggesting that the PCs be granted powers over subjects currently under the central government, including grassroots activities like agriculture and tourism.",
    "The central government should formulate policies for the country, while provincial councils should provide the necessary facilities for the successful implementation of development activities in all fields. Collaboration between all parties and levels of government was crucial for progress and development, he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party and a number of other parties joined the APC while a few smaller parties boycotted the event.",
    "Sri Lanka opposition SJB to attend all-party talks on reconciliation; others to boycottSee more",
    "Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) general secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara, who attended the conference, told reporters on Thursday that MP Sagara Kariyawasam, general secretary of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), has said President Wickremesinghe does not have the mandate for devolution of power.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and",
    "Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment would see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more hardline parties. In February, sections of the Buddhist clergy took to the streets against the proposed full implementation of the constitutional amendment. (Colombo/Jul27/2023)"
