### Sri Lanka’s economy stabilized, reforms critical – World Bank

Sri Lanka’s economy has stabilized, with growth expected to reach 4.4 percent in 2024, surpassing earlier forecasts. This positive outlook follows four consecutive quarters of growth driven by the industrial and tourism sectors and supported by critical structural and policy reforms, says the World Bank.

Released today, the World Bank’s bi-annual Sri Lanka Development Update, titled Opening Up to the Future, cautions that the recovery remains fragile and hinges on maintaining macroeconomic stability, successfully restructuring debt, and continuing structural reforms to increase medium-term growth and reduce poverty. Key reforms aimed at boosting exports, attracting foreign investment, enhancing female labor force participation, improving productivity, and addressing challenges such as poverty, food insecurity, and vulnerabilities in the financial sector are crucial for achieving more inclusive and sustainable growth.

### Workplace Mental Health: A Foundation For Growth & Inclusivity

Does mental health and well-being impact productivity, creativity, and absenteeism in the workplace? The answer is a resounding yes. Poor mental health can significantly hinder an employee’s ability to focus, innovate, and collaborate effectively, leading to decreased productivity. Depression and anxiety alone result in the loss of approximately 12 billion workdays each year, costing the global economy around US$1 trillion annually. On the other hand, when employees are mentally healthy, they tend to be more engaged, resilient, and creative, contributing to higher organizational performance.

Recently, I was involved in a project with the World Health Organization (WHO) that reviewed scientific evidence on what works in improving the mental health of health and care workers—an area that was often neglected but gained significant attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.
