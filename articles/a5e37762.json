  "original_body_lines": [
    "It is high time for Sri Lanka to break free from the shackles of corrupt political culture that prioritises personal gain over public welfare",
    "In the bustling chambers of Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament, a disheartening spectacle unfolds with disturbing regularity \u2013 elected officials engaged not in constructive debate for the betterment of the nation, but in heated exchanges and even physical altercations. Yet, behind the fa\u00e7ade of discord lies a disconcerting unity among MPs when it comes to safeguarding their own interests and privileges, even at the expense of the struggling populace.",
    "The recent decision by the Government to grant duty-free vehicle permits to Members of Parliament serves as a stark example of this entrenched culture of self-serving politics. SJB economic maestro Dr. Harsha de Silva, at a recent press conference, contended that denial of these perks could lead parliamentarians to resort to corruption, illustrating the unanimity among MPs when it comes to privileges. However, there are exceptions, notably the three MPs representing the National People\u2019s Power (NPP). They have consistently opted for modest Toyota Double Cabs over luxurious Toyota V8s or Mercedes Benzes, reflecting their commitment to integrity amidst a sea of entitlement.",
    "Ironically, these very MPs who decry fiscal irresponsibility in public institutions spare no opportunity to indulge in extravagance at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. They admonish public sector workers for seeking fair compensation while themselves enjoying the luxuries of duty-free vehicles and other lavish privileges. The postponement of Local Government elections due to purported fund shortages stands in stark contrast to the unbridled entitlements enjoyed by elected officials.",
    "The current economic woes plaguing Sri Lanka cannot be divorced from the actions of its political class. Years of mismanagement and disregard for fiscal prudence have led the country to the brink of a debt default, yet MPs continue to revel in excesses funded by taxpayer money. The sale of duty-free vehicle permits, once illegal to transfer before five years, now legalised, epitomises the impunity with which politicians enrich themselves.",
    "The NPP is the only party that has precisely stated its intention to dismantle the prevailing system of privileges. The NPP Leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has publicly declared both inside and outside Parliament that once the NPP takes over the Government, they will scrap all perks and privileges assigned to politicians. This includes pensions, official residences, and other comforts enjoyed by politicians. Furthermore, he has asserted that all assets of politicians and other high-profile State officials, acquired without proper accountability, will be forfeited. This bold stance has stirred controversy among other political factions, who perceive it as a threat to their entrenched positions of power.",
    "It is high time for Sri Lanka to break free from the shackles of corrupt political culture that prioritises personal gain over public welfare.",
    "The abolition of laws facilitating the sale of duty-free permits and stringent measures to ensure transparency and accountability are imperative steps towards fostering a political landscape that truly serves the interests of the people.",
