මෙම සන්ධිස්ථානය ගෝලීය තාක්ෂණික අංශයේ ප්‍රතිවාදීන්ට වඩා බොහෝ ඉදිරියෙන් සිටින ලොව ධනවත්ම පුද්ගලයා ලෙස මස්ක්ගේ තත්ත්වය තවදුරටත් තහවුරු කරයි.

ෆෝබ්ස් ප්‍රකෝටිපතියන්ගේ දර්ශකයට අනුව, ඔරකල් නිර්මාතෘ ලැරී එලිසන් ලොව දෙවන ධනවත්ම පුද්ගලයා වන අතර ඔහුගේ ධනය ඩොලර් බිලියන 350.7 ක් පමණ වේ.

මස්ක්ගේ දැවැන්ත ධනය, ටෙස්ලා හි ඔහුගේ 12% කට වඩා වැඩි කොටස් සමඟ සමීපව බැඳී ඇති අතර, එහි කොටස් මෙම වසරේ තියුණු ලෙස ඉහළ ගොස් තිබේ.
