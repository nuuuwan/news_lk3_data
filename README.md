### Knowing When To Step Aside: Mark Of True Leadership

*2024-08-27 19:04:43* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/knowing-when-to-step-aside-mark-of-true-leadership/) · `en`

Presidential aspirant Wickremesinghe’s recent appeal to Sri Lankans to vote for the Gas Cylinder symbol, with the ominous warning that failure to do so will result in long queues for essentials, reflects a troubling mindset.

This statement, which seems to equate the temporary resolution of gas shortages with his qualification to lead the nation, is out of touch and a poor Marcom strategy. It suggests that Wickremesinghe and his advisors believe that merely avoiding crises is enough to secure the presidency, ignoring the deeper, more pressing needs of the country.

Wickremesinghe’s approach is similar to his previous attempts to appeal to the masses with shallow gestures, such as his infamous offer of chewing gum to farmers, a tone-deaf proposal that highlighted his disconnection from the realities of rural life.

*2024-08-27 17:25:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101550/tuberculosis-on-the-rise-in-kandy-50-cases-reported-so-far-in-2024) · `en`

The Chief Medical Officer of Kandy, Dr. Pasan Jayasinghe revealed that around 50 tuberculosis (TB) patients have been diagnosed within the Kandy city limits during the period which has elapsed so far this year.

Dr. Jayasinghe also highlighted that the most pressing infectious disease threat in Kandy is not dengue, but tuberculosis.

While dengue cases are typically identified within six days and the treatment can be commenced, tuberculosis presents a much greater challenge, as diagnosis of the disease can take up to six months, according to Dr. Jayasinghe.

Meanwhile, he highlighted that symptoms such as persistent coughing, weakness in body and the loss of appetite is significant in TB patients, but they often go untreated, as many individuals seek short-term remedies for these symptoms instead of undergoing proper screening for TB.

With tuberculosis cases on the rise in Kandy, Dr. Jayasinghe urged the public to be vigilant and prioritize their health.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was charged Tuesday with sedition over a speech he made that allegedly questioned the integrity of the country’s previous king.

Nine ethnic Malay state rulers take turns as Malaysia’s king for five-year terms under the country’s rotating monarchy, which began when Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but are revered by the nation’s majority Muslims.

In his speech on Aug. 14, Muhyiddin had questioned why then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah didn’t invite him to be prime minister following a hung Parliament in November 2022. Muhyiddin had claimed he had the backing of majority lawmakers.
