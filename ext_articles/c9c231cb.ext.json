    "\"Towards for oil in oil\" seems to be a phrase without clear context. It could refer to efforts towards extracting oil from oil sources, but it lacks specific details about methods, locations, or goals. Without additional information, it's difficult to provide a more precise summary. If you have any specific context or details about this phrase, please share them so I can offer a more accurate interpretation."
