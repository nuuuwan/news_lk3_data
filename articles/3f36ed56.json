    "Sri Lankans\u00a0voted for a new direction in leadership\u00a0on Sept. 22, 2024, electing a leftist anti-poverty campaigner as President of the South Asian nation.",
    "The ascent of Anura Kumara Dissanayake marks a break with the past and from the establishment parties and politicians blamed for taking the country to the\u00a0brink of economic collapse\u00a0in 2022.",
    "Dissanayake\u00a0characterized the victory as a \u201cfresh start\u201d for Sri Lanka \u2013 but he will nonetheless need to address the economic baggage left by his predecessors and the impact of an International Monetary Fund loan that came with painful austerity demands. The conversation turned to\u00a0Vidhura S. Tennekoon, an expert on Sri Lanka\u2019s economy at Indiana University, to explain the task facing the new President \u2013 and how Dissanayake intends to tackle it.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u00a0leads both the National People\u2019s Power alliance, or NPP, and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP. Rooted in Marxist ideology, the JVP was founded in the 1960s with the aim of seizing power through a socialist revolution. But after two\u00a0failed armed uprisings in 1971 and 1987-89\u00a0\u2013 which resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of lives \u2013 the party shifted toward democratic politics and has remained so for over three decades.",
    "Until this election, the JVP remained a minor third party in Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape, while power alternated between the alliances led by the two traditional political parties \u2013 the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party \u2013 or their descendant parties.",
    "In 2019, under Dissanayake\u2019s leadership, the NPP was formed as a socialist alliance with several other organizations. While the JVP continues to adhere to Marxist principles, the NPP adopted a center-left, social democratic platform \u2013 aiming to attract broader public support.",
    "Despite these efforts, Dissanayake garnered\u00a0only 3% of the vote in the 2019 presidential election.",
    "But the political landscape shifted dramatically\u00a0during the economic crisis of 2022. Many Sri Lankans, frustrated with the two traditional parties that had governed the country for over seven decades, turned to the NPP, seeing it as a credible alternative.",
    "The party\u2019s anti-corruption stance, in particular, resonated strongly because many people blamed political corruption for the economic collapse.",
    "While a significant achievement, it also marks a historic first for Sri Lanka \u2014 Dissanayake is the first President to be elected without majority support; the remaining 58% of votes were split between candidates from the two traditional parties.",
    "His immediate challenge will be to secure a parliamentary majority in the upcoming elections, a crucial step for his administration to govern effectively.",
    "Two and a half years ago, Sri Lanka experienced the worst economic crisis in its history. With foreign reserves nearly depleted, the country struggled to pay its bills, leading to severe shortages of essential goods. People waited in\u00a0long lines for cooking gas and fuel, while regular blackouts became part of daily life. The Sri Lankan rupee plummeted to a record low,\u00a0driving inflation to 70%. The economy was contracting, and the country defaulted on its international sovereign bonds for the first time.",
    "This sparked a massive protest movement that ultimately forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign. In July 2022,\u00a0Parliament appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0to complete the remainder of Rajapaksa\u2019s term.",
    "In the two years that followed, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy made an unexpectedly rapid recovery under Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership. After securing an\u00a0agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the currency stabilized, the Central Bank rebuilt foreign reserves, and inflation fell to single digits. By the first half of 2024, the economy had grown by 5%.",
    "The government successfully restructured its domestic debt, followed by a restructuring of its bilateral debt \u2013 that is, government-to-government loans, mostly from China but also from India and Western counties, including the United States. Just days before the election,\u00a0an agreement was reached with international bondholders\u00a0to restructure the remaining sovereign debt.",
    "Despite these achievements, Wickremesinghe was overtaken in the presidential race by both Dissanayake and Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. Wickremesinghe\u2019s unpopularity stemmed largely from the harsh austerity measures implemented under the IMF-backed stabilization programme.",
    "Dissanayake now inherits an economy that, while more stable, remains vulnerable. He will have limited room to maneuver away from the carefully planned economic path laid out by his predecessor, even as voters expect him to fulfill popular demands.",
    "As a leader from a Marxist party, Dissanayake will likely pursue policies to reflect collective decisions made by the politburos and central committees of the NPP and JVP, rather than his individual views. He advocates for an economic system where activities are coordinated through a central government plan, emphasizing the importance of \u201ceconomic democracy.\u201d",
    "His party believes\u00a0prosperity should be measured not just by economic growth\u00a0but by the overall quality of life. They argue that people need more than just basic necessities \u2014 they require secure housing, food, healthcare, education, access to technology and leisure.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s long-term vision is to transform Sri Lanka into a\u00a0production-based economy, focusing on sectors like manufacturing, agriculture and information technology rather than service industries. One of the key policies is to promote local production of all viable food products to reduce reliance on imports. To support these activities, the NPP plans to establish a development bank. Additionally, the NPP proposes increasing government spending on education and healthcare, in line with Sri Lanka\u2019s tradition of providing free, universal access to both.",
    "Historically, Dissanayake\u2019s party has been critical of the IMF and its policy recommendations. Given the severity of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, Dissanayake has acknowledged the need to stay within the IMF programme for now. But he has\u00a0vowed to renegotiate with the IMF\u00a0to make the programme more \u201cpeople-friendly.\u201d Dissanayake\u2019s proposals include raising the personal income tax exemption threshold to double its current level and removing taxes on essential goods. Dissanayake\u2019s party also plans adding jobs to the public sector, despite the ongoing effort to reduce the government workforce to manage the deficit.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s populist policies, aimed at attracting mass support during the campaign, will inevitably strain government revenues while increasing expenses. However, the IMF programme requires Sri Lanka to maintain a primary budget surplus\u00a0of at least 2.3% of gross domestic product\u00a0to ensure debt sustainability. Dissanayake has promised\u00a0not to jeopardize the country\u2019s economic stability\u00a0by deviating from this target. His strategy is to improve the efficiency of tax collection, which he believes will generate enough revenue to fund his policies.",
    "Additionally, his party has criticized the deal struck by Wickremesinghe\u2019s government with international lenders, calling it unfavourable to the country. Dissanayake has promised to seek better terms. However, since these agreements are already in place, it remains uncertain whether the new government will attempt to renegotiate them.",
