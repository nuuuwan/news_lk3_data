    "The Government has decided to develop the 102 acre site Kahatagaha graphite mine, the country\u2019s deepest graphite mine through a new public-private partnership (PPP) framework, to attract international investment and strengthen the sector\u2019s long-term competitiveness in global markets.",
    "The proposal to this effect presented by Industries and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunneththi was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday.",
    "Announcing the decision at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said it was decided to repeal the Cabinet decision taken on 11 December 2023 regarding the restructuring of Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Ltd., and to call for proposals for Expressions of Interest (EoIs) following the approved procurement procedure.",
    "\u201cIt was approved to implement the entire procedure of exploring the graphite reserve of the mine, mining, processing and adding value under the PPP, while keeping the ownership of the graphite of the Kahatagaha mine with the company itself,\u201d he added.",
    "Operated by the wholly State-owned Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka, the mine produces and exports high-quality graphite, a critical mineral for both domestic use and international markets.",
    "\u201cThe move aims to enhance the value of the country\u2019s graphite industry, attract international investment, and strengthen the sector\u2019s long-term competitiveness in global markets,\u201d he added.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa also said this new approach will secure the jobs of existing employees, ensuring that workforce stability is maintained while modernising operations and expanding production capacity."
