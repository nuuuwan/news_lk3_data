### Who do we not/want to see in the next Parliament?

Those we have voted for hitherto and elected to represent us at the highest House of Representatives for a good 75 years, have left us high and dry with a bankrupt debt-ridden country

The number 2-2-5 is a peculiar number. It adds up to 9 which is believed to be bad and unlucky and is kept away when starting something auspicious. When one dials 2-2-5 a message comes through the wire: “This number is exclusively for e-channeling. Please note you will be charged Rs. 20 plus tax for a minute.” And we pay Rs. 20 plus tax while listening to jingles and promotional material played by the service provider till we are connected to a customer care officer. Once you are successful in getting the appointment you are told that Rs. 5,000 will be charged. After seeing the doctor and completing all tests, x-rays, MRIs, scans, etc., and buying medication you are done with half of your savings.

Spa Ceylon: Blending ancient ayurveda with modern luxury, captivating global markets

Showcasing Sri Lanka’s iconic destinations: A testament to the nation’s potential as a premier tourist hub, ready to captivate the world

In brief, international marketing is the process of planning and conducting transactions across national borders to create exchanges that satisfy the objectives of individuals and organisations.

It comes in forms of export/import trade to licensing, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries, turnkey operations, and management contracts.

With the prevailing economic crisis in Sri Lanka and depreciation of the rupee, the only way to address this issue is to increase exports. Sri Lanka exports amounted to Rs. 4,234,913 in 2022 according to Central Bank of Sri Lanka statistics.

Are we doing it right? Is this our potential? Is international marketing done in a proper way when it comes to branding Sri Lanka and its products and services to the world?

### Amendments to tax policy imperative for better prospects

*2024-10-30 05:52:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Amendments-to-tax-policy-imperative-for-better-prospects/14-768582) · `en`

Tax policy must be reflective of real market conditions for consumers and the public

Sri Lanka’s new Government and executive brings with it a new dimension of thinking to policy and governance. Therein lies significant opportunity, albeit laden with challenges, to change the way Sri Lanka does business and how we are perceived by the world.

In this post-crisis milieu, Government has a difficult balancing act to ensure a positive trade balance, manage its primary account considering IMF expectations, all whilst providing relief to a burdened public in the run up to 2028, when debt payments must resume. Reform should encompass better governance – combat corruption, drive exports and investment, stop wastage and a review of tax and industrial policy to strengthen returns. The Government led by the new President must adopt a fact-based approach towards policy, as opposed to strategy and actions that were often driven by political whims and favouritism.

Former JAAF Chief says job of Government is to protect both the employer and employee

The Sri Lankan apparel sector has faced many challenges in recent years. Beyond the well-documented local challenges, the industry has also had to grapple with challenges originating from afar such as COVID-19 and the resultant economic uncertainties in the subsequent years and the geopolitical tensions which have added to the complexities surrounding global maritime logistics which have a direct impact on Sri Lanka’s favourability as a production location. As international demand waned, many manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized businesses, were forced to reduce operations. However, outdated termination laws in Sri Lanka have hindered local industries’ ability to adapt, leaving many with no choice but to shut down their factories entirely.

A sustainable debt strategy rooted in transparency and collaboration with international stakeholders is essential to restore economic confidence and secure a brighter future for Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s debt burden has been a persistent challenge, driving the country into numerous fiscal crises over the past few decades, including the 2022 crisis that brought the country to bankruptcy. The country’s high levels of external and domestic debt have been exacerbated by political mismanagement, economic shocks, COVID pandemic, and global financial pressures. The recent crisis underscores the need for a comprehensive debt sustainability strategy, particularly with a new President in place. Several key options could help Sri Lanka better manage its debt, support long-term economic stability, reduce money printing and regain investor confidence to attract top FDI.

As I reflect on Sri Lanka’s recent Government change, I see not just a political shift but a pivotal moment for our nation — a chance to redefine our economic and environmental future.

The question remains: will we seize the opportunity to become a leader in marine conservation, or will we let this moment slip away?

Sri Lanka stands at the crossroads of unique opportunities that can redefine its trajectory. This moment calls for bold reforms and visionary leadership, especially in aligning our nation with global sustainability standards. For business leaders, Government officials, and practitioners across various sectors, one of the most significant ways to contribute to this progress lies in adopting the High Seas Treaty — a global agreement designed to protect marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable use of international waters.

### What Is Wrong With Us?

*2024-10-29 19:07:29* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/what-is-wrong-with-us/) · `en`

We are convinced (or conditioned to believe,) that we are an under-developed country and are destined to ever remain so. Should it really be such? Importantly, what should we do to erase this patronizing and degrading label? This mental complex has led us to be a cynical, despondent people. The past seven decades of Independence have driven us into the depths of despair. The worst part of this is that we have so driven our thoughts, to make this fear to become our reality.

We have failed to utilize our potential – be it in climate, human resources or other “development criteria”. This clearly needs to change. Perhaps, we are not the cat’s whiskers, nor certainly are we everybody’s chronic “dog’s body”.

### Public alerted over surge in fake messages on WhatsApp and other social media

These deceptive messages are designed to fraudulently obtain personal and financial information by impersonating credible institutions, including banks, commercial organizations, and international bodies, according to the SL CERT.

Recent observations by Sri Lanka CERT indicate that cybercriminals are using social media platforms, fake websites, SMS, and even postal services to reach potential victims. In many cases, these messages falsely promise donations, monetary rewards, high-value products, or services and request sensitive information, including One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

By interacting with these fraudulent messages or clicking on embedded links, individuals risk exposing their personal data to criminal misuse, including financial fraud and identity theft, it added.
