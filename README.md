### Gaza ceasefire talks show no sign of progress, US says onus on Hamas

Hamas on Thursday left Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo where there was no sign of progress just days before the start of Ramadan, while the U.S. said the onus was on the Palestinian militant group to strike a deal on Israeli hostages.

Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the lack of agreement after four days of talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt about a 40-day ceasefire amid fears violence could escalate during the Muslim fasting month.

Egyptian security sources said talks, taking place without an Israeli delegation in Cairo, would resume on Sunday, the expected start of Ramadan.

Senior U.S. administration officials said the onus was on Hamas to complete a hostage deal and attributed the delay to what they described as Hamas so far not agreeing to release sick and elderly hostages.

A Hamas official told Reuters the United States was in partnership with Israel and that such comments were misleading. Hamas has insisted that a ceasefire deal include a process toward ending the war altogether.

### Battle against corruption

*2024-03-08 08:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/battle-against-corruption/) · `en`

We as a nation had many names officially and many unofficially such as Pearl of the Indian Ocean, Teardrop Isle, Serendipitous Land, Paradise, Land of the Lotus Eaters. We were famous for our smiles and friendliness; the modest charm of our youth; scenic wonders and the fast and easy accessibility of vastly different climatic conditions, vegetation and terrain. Ceylon was known for its tea. Most of those complimentary names are now obliterated by what we are currently recognised for: corruption; being a country with people up to all sorts of dishonest practices and corruption rife from top to bottom. Well known was a Cabinet Minister asking for a santhosam from a country to accept a project! He still sits in Parliament, nodding many times.

### #InspireInclusion – “Count Her In”

*2024-03-08 06:02:01* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/InspireInclusion-Count-Her-In/4-759290) · `en`

The International Women's Day (IWD) is a global celebration of achievements of women in a multitude of spheres – economic, social, cultural, and political.  As we celebrate IWD 2024 with the theme #InspireInclusion – “Count Her In”, it may be worthwhile to reflect upon what ‘inclusion’ means.

Inclusion is the state of being valued, respected, and supported for one’s authentic self.  Therefore, it is essential that we embrace women as their authentic selves and reaffirm our commitment to creating a world where women are valued, empowered and included.  The theme recognizes that, despite progress, women face significant obstacles to achieve equal participation in the economy and calls for ensuring equal opportunity for women and girls to build their capabilities and strengthen their capacity to learn, earn, and lead.

### Freedom from political bondage

*2024-03-08 05:53:26* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Freedom-from-political-bondage/14-759287) · `en`

We have given up hope of escaping from this bondage because we have tried many times and failed every time

With the disappearance of queues for essential items, and the steadfast repression of any descent, it appears as if most of us have settled down to the realities of economic hardships with resignation and despondency. This being a society that was dominated by colonisers for centuries and shaped by beliefs in fate and mystic powers for millennia that kind of thinking can be expected. But giving up any hope of overcoming this adversity and bracing things to get worse as if we are in an inescapable bondage of sort is inexcusable.

### NPP and bird cage economy

*2024-03-08 05:51:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/NPP-and-bird-cage-economy/4-759286) · `en`

NPP’s bird cage economy would be realistically grounded on a rejuvenated real sector rather than on an IMF stabilised financial sector

It was Chen Yun, a theoretical economist and a Chinese Communist Party Politburo member from 1934 to 1987 who rejected Mao Zedong’s reliance on the revolutionary enthusiasm of masses to promote rapid economic growth, and propounded the theory of a bird cage economy characterised by a dominant plan and subordinate local markets. Yun stressed the importance of the market to improve agricultural production and productivity. And it was that model which was later picked up by Deng Xiaoping and put into practice.

### Economic concerns surrounding salary increases at Central Bank of Sri Lanka

*2024-03-08 05:46:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economic-concerns-surrounding-salary-increases-at-Central-Bank-of-Sri-Lanka/4-759285) · `en`

Reports of substantial salary hikes at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raise concerns regarding the economic implications of these decisions. Led by Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the CBSL has defended these raises as lawful under the Central Bank Act, citing the need for competitive salaries to retain skilled personnel. However, several economic arguments suggest that these salary increases may not be in the best interest of economic stability in the nation.

n The salary hikes at the CBSL could set a precedent for similar demands across the economy. Trade unions have already seized upon this case to press for wage increases for their members. As the public sector often sets the tone for wage-setting practices, the CBSL’s actions risk undermining its primary mission of maintaining price stability. Widespread wage increases could fuel inflationary pressures, ultimately eroding the purchasing power of consumers and destabilizing the economy.

With a dangerous Donald Trump just one hurdle away from breasting the 2024 presidential tape after his sweeping victory at the Super Tuesday poll to pick the Republican Party candidate, the Palestinian people, if they are fortunate enough to survive Israel’s genocide, are likely to see a worse catastrophe than they are being inflicted now under his presidency.

Hours after his Super Tuesday feat, in an interview with Fox News, Trump voiced explicit backing for Israel’s war on Gaza until “total victory”. When asked whether he was on board with the way Israel was “taking the fight to Gaza”, Trump responded, “You’ve got to finish the problem”. He expressed no concern over the civilian deaths. “You had a horrible invasion that took place that would have never happened if I was president,” he boasted.
