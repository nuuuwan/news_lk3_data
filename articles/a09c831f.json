    "Mr. Louis Edmund Blaze\u2019 started his school, which he named Boys\u2019 High School at No. 11, Pavilion Street in the Kandy town itself (the premises were secured by Mr. JW Samaraweera) with 11 boys \u2013 quite a coincidence between the school roll and its address \u2013 on May 4, 1891 with the intention that it should be run as far as possible on the lines of the old British Public Schools. Later, when the number of students grew, the school was shifted to Brownrigg Street (now Yatinuwara Veediya).",
    "As the rooms in Pavilion Street became too small with increasing number of students, the school was shifted to a house in Brownrigg Street, which had been built by Mr. William Staples about 50 years before. The school began academic activities on January 12, 1898. In December 1897 the school moved into larger premises in Browrigg Street, where the school hall was built and the Boys\u2019 High School took the name of Kingswood College.",
    "In 1925, Kingswood College moved into the buildings it occupies at present on what is known as Randles Hill, at Mulgampola, halfway between Kandy City and Peradeniya. As such, this year marks the 100th year the college has been at Randles Hill. This move was possible because of a generous gift by a Wesleyan philanthropist, Sir John Randles, who was a Member of the British Parliament at the time. The location was named after him to show the school\u2019s gratitude towards a very generous gift from a well-known British philanthropist. A large photograph of Sir John hangs in the College hall.",
    "The buildings were constructed on the sloping hill with hostel on top accommodating the dormitory for senior boys with the junior dorm below it. On the left of these two buildings were the bucket latrines (Kandy did not have a proper sewerage system at that time, and all residences and business places had this system of toilets) and beyond them was the sickroom. On the right hand side of the hostel buildings were the bathrooms and playground below them. To reach the hostel the boys had to climb a steep set of steps.",
    "The Matron in charge of the hostel was Mrs. Peiris and the Assistant Matron was Miss Kreltszheim. The hostel masters at the time when we were hostelers were Messrs. BA Thambapillai, AP Samarajiwa and Mr. Leonidas James. For one year, the hostelers in the junior dormitory were shifted to a temporary hostel on the upper floor of the junior school with Miss Wjesinghe as our matron.",
    "Below the steps. On the right was an octagon-shaped building which had two floors, the top floor housing the school and principal\u2019s offices with a concrete bridge connecting them. On the other side of the road from this building was the huge bell, housed in a small shed. This bell was rung to begin the school day and its close and in-between marking the study periods.",
    "A path from this building led to the college hall, also connected with a concrete bridge. The bottom floor of the octagon building was the staff-room, where the teachers relaxed till the commencement of their teaching periods. Some of the masters, enjoyed a smoke during the free time, many smoking cigarettes while one or two would enjoy puffing a pipe.",
    "The octagon-shaped building was at the top pf the road leading from the College gate. As you enter the school premises from the main road, on the right was the lower school building, which had classes from the baby class to the fifth standard when we were in college. On the hill on the right was the building which housed the college hall and the classes from form one to the University entrance class (as the Advance Level class was known then). The Biology, Chemistry, and Physics laboratories were also on the ground floor of that building.",
    "There were two playgrounds at that time, with the upper playing field being used for senior matches and the lower one for junior matches. At present the lower playing field has given way to another building built in the same design as the other buildings. Above right of the lowers school building was the tennis courts, which has now given way to the swimming pool.",
    "The principal\u2019s bungalow was on a side near the entrance to the upper playground. During the period that we were students, Mr.PH Nonis and his family occupied this bungalow. And for a short period Mr. Luterz and his nieces were the occupants when Mr. Luterz was the acting principal during Mr. Nonis\u2019 sojourn in England for his higher studies.",
    "My elder brother and I were boarded in college with me in the upper kindergarten and my brother in standard two. An interesting incident happened on my first day in the hostel. We were gathered near the door to the dining hall to have our lunch when a classmate of mine named Kanakalingam said something that annoyed me. Without thinking twice I gave him a really hard punch on the face and one of his front teeth dropped! I got the punishment I deserved.",
    "It was the practice of most of the young boys to run down the steps when going down to attend classes or for anything else. I wonder now how no one got injured running down those steps.",
    "At bath-time, were taken by the two ayahs, Letchimi and Biso Menika for our baths. Our hair too was cut outside the bathrooms as the barber used to come regularly. After the haircut, a bath was a necessity.",
    "The food for all meals was prepared by Karupiah (Lethcimi\u2019s husband).We had our breakfast and dinner after the two periods of study supervised by a prefect. For dinner on some days we used to get hoppers and stringhoppers. When the first session of classroom work ends, the hostelers would run up the flight of steps and wait outside the dining hall till the bell is rung to get in and have their lunch.",
    "The college had two playgrounds, the one on top was the senior playground and at the bottom the junior playground. While the senior students in the hostel played games on the senior playground, we used to play on the junior playground. Now the lower playground does not exist as another building has come up on that land.",
    "It was compulsory for all hostelers to attend the church service on Sundays. Two buses from the then PS Bus Company would arrive in time in the morning to take us to the Methodist Church on Brownrigg Street for the morning service. Then again, after tea in the afternoon another trek to Church for Sunday school. We all enjoyed it as it was a trip to the Kandy town.",
    "It is also noteworthy that in recognition of Randles Hill, then then Ceylon Government Railway had a rail stop for rail-cars named Randles Hill at Mulgampola, opposite the school.All in all, all the boys, whether they were hostelers or day-scholars, enjoyed their stay in the well-loved school on Randles Hill.",
