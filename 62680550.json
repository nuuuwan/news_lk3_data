    "In a letter directed to the Ceylon Electricity Board\u2019s chairman, the coordination secretary of the parliamentarian dismissed the allegations as \u2018defamatory\u2019 and \u2018condemning\u2019.",
    "Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) member Nalin Hewage, at a recent press conference, disclosed that Namal Rajapaksa owes Rs. 2.6 million in arrears on an electricity bill related to his wedding reception in 2019.",

    "He revealed that the RTI response from the state-owned electricity company mentions that outstanding electricity tariffs to the tune of Rs. 2.6 million remain unpaid to date after providing electricity to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s residence in Weeraketiya on his request.",
