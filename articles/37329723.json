    "Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed serious concern over recent remarks made by Minister Tiran Alles, and urging President Ranil Wickremesinghe to remove him from the portfolio of Public Security.",
    "During its council meeting, the BASL condemned Minister Alles's statement at the passing out parade of the Katukurunda STF training camp, where he stated, \"Eliminating criminals from the country is not a sin. Don't be afraid to use the weapon in your hand for the right thing, and we stand by you.\"",
    "In response, BASL President Kaushalya Navaratne and Secretary Chathura A. Galhena expressed grave concern, noting that such remarks contradict fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution and established criminal justice procedures.",
    "The BASL emphasized that justice, including penalties for wrongdoers, falls exclusively within the courts' jurisdiction as mandated by the Constitution, requiring adherence to due process, thorough investigations and fair trials.",
    "The Minister's statement, amidst rising extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths and incidents of torture, perpetuates the misconception that justice lies beyond the judiciary's purview and can be administered arbitrarily, undermining public trust and misguiding law enforcement personnel.",
    "Calling for an immediate retraction of the Minister's statement and his removal from office, the BASL asserts that Minister Alles's repeated encouragement of impunity and disregard for the rule of law renders him unfit for his role in public security.",
    "Furthermore, the BASL reaffirms the sacrosanct principle that the authority to mete out punishment must remain vested solely in the courts, operating\u00a0within the bounds of established legal procedures.",
    "Additionally, the BASL reiterates the fundamental right of every individual accused of an offense to undergo a fair and diligent investigation and to receive a fair trial, as guaranteed by the law and international conventions adhered to by any civilized legal system."
