    "Of all the local political leaders it was Premadasa who was the most sympathetic to the JVP. He made a well noticed entrance to follow the proceedings of the Criminal Justice Commission that tried Wijeweera and his fellow leaders of the 1971 insurrection. He set up clandestine groups to negotiate with the leaders of the JVP who were underground, even offering them three portfolios in his Cabinet. But the JVP did not respond positively. He was thwarted and when the smooth passage of his administration was undermined by the JVP he turned to Ranjan Wijeratne, who had a military background and was considered to be a ruthless operator, to launch an all out attack on them.",
    "The President remained in the background. Wijeratne as Deputy Minister of Defence put the army on a war footing. The approaches to the city were riddled with army checkpoints. As I had to travel abroad often on WIF business, going to and returning from Katunayake was an unpleasant experience which still remains in my memory. The JVP was called \u201cthe second government\u201d because they seemed to call the shots in the city. There were several of us who used to exercise in Independence square in the mornings. Among this group was K. Gunaratnam, the famous businessman and film mogul. One morning he was shot dead on the walking track. It was alleged that he was importing films from India notwithstanding the JVP embargo. This was a double tragedy as his Wijaya studios in Hendala had been burnt to the ground by Cyril Mathew\u2019s goons in the 1983 communal riots.",
    "With the JVP organizing hit squads and shutting down establishments, private armies were set up particularly by the leftists who were sitting ducks since they did not have government protection. Leftist University students also established defence squads as they had been specially targeted. The JVP would not tolerate any rival political organizations on campus. The first to be murdered were the office bearers of the Independent Students Union led by Daya Pathirana. Ranjan Wijeratne provided these leftist outfits with weapons and they too began to hunt down JVP cadres. We spent many evenings at the Kanatte cemetery to attend the funerals of leftist friends.",
    "With all the goodwill in the world towards the JVP, Premadasa was not prepared to permit a state of insecurity which was affecting his efforts at achieving social amelioration and rapid economic growth on his watch. He stayed aloof even when the armed forces went on a killing spree in which not only JVPers but their kith and kin were eliminated. His close Police contact at one stage was DIG Katugampola who was well known as a killer of JVPers since they had mercilessly tortured and killed his aged mother and close relatives. But the President fell out with him later.",
    "At last the Ops Combine\u2019s systematic inquiries began to bear fruit and they were able to roll up the top echelons of the JVP who were in hiding. Premadasa gave the \u201cgo ahead\u201d to Ranjan to eliminate the militants. The Ops Combine then broke up the JVPs top leadership\u2019s \u201corder of battle\u201d finally tracking down Wijeweera himself who was hiding out in an estate near Gampola. He and the senior JVPers were all eliminated in brutal fashion. It is said that Wijeweera\u2019s last request was to be taken to Premadasa as he could appeal to him for clemency. However Ranjan refused this request and he was killed before the President could intervene.",
    "The country and investors sighed with relief but the President was muted in his celebrations. With the elimination of Wijeweera the JVP spluttered for a few more weeks and then went out of existence. A major hurdle in the President\u2019s pursuit of economic progress was thereby eliminated. It must also be noted that Premadasa was successful in eliminating the JVP \u2013 a deed which eluded JRJ no matter how hard he tried. The JVP could not recreate among the populace a hatred for Premadasa which they succeeded in the case of JRJ with the slogan \u201ckill the old man\u201d. Buddhist monks and the Sinhala Buddhist electorate did not look on the new president as a leader who would betray their interests. Premadasa was the right man in the right place.",
    "However a major impediment by way of the ethnic problem remained. What began as a war between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE was further complicated by the presence of the IPKF which had arrived at the invitation of JRJ in terms of the Indo-Lanka Agreement signed by the two parties in 1987. Premadasa had opposed both the agreement and the presence of the IPKF which now virtually administered the north and east as the Sri Lankan military was confined to barracks. He was further embarrassed as the Indians refused to accept him as the commander in chief of all the military forces in the island including the IPKF. The IPKF worked directly under its overall command headquarters which was based in Chennai under an Indian army general. This was a situation that no Sri Lankan President, leave alone a pugnacious Premadasa, could accept.",
    "President Premadasa\u2019s stand was very clear. In his election manifesto he had promised that the IPKF would be asked to withdraw from Sri Lankan soil at the earliest opportunity. In his view the solution to both the ethnic war and renegotiating constitutional arrangements with the Tamils was purely an internal matter. Whatever had been agreed with his predecessor had to be renegotiated, preferably leading to a new treaty with India which in his opinion was not \u201ccoerced\u201d, as he described the Indo-Lanka agreement. These were hard demands to swallow for the Indians who had come on the invitation of the earlier President and had lost over 1,000 Jawans and had over 3,000 Jawans wounded. Their reputation as an invincible fighting force was in tatters and the whole Sri Lankan operation had to be financed out of the Indian budget.",
    "Now they had to endure the further humiliation of Premadasa setting the timetable for their departure. The writings of Indian officials regarding this period highlight the embarrassment of Rajiv and his officials at this unexpected turn of events. With the exit of JRJ they were left at the mercy of their enemies in the Sri Lankan Cabinet. The exchange of letters, the contents of which have been published recently, clearly depict the sense of frustration and lack of confidence both leaders had of each other.",
    "Let us look at some of the letters exchanged which show a coldness not usually seen in exchanges between two heads of state, leave alone the uneven strengths of the two correspondents. Wrote Premadasa \u201cI as Presidential candidate incorporated in my manifesto a pledge to secure the withdrawal of the Indian armed forces as a necessary prelude to political negotiations and a durable settlement. The people of Sri Lanka, by an overwhelming majority endorsed this principle both at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections. You state that \u201cthe situation in North-East Provinces is far more settled and peaceful than elsewhere in Sri Lanka.\u201d If this be so, there would be a lesser need for offensive action by the armed forces in those areas\u201d [July 19, 1989].",
    "This was a prompt reply to Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s letter of July 12, 1989 which stated \u201cWe both agree that the IPKF should be withdrawn. Both of us agree that we had commenced the withdrawal even before you asked for it. A broad time frame for IPKFs withdrawal had in fact been discussed. Discussions on finalizing the details were proposed by your Foreign Minister at Harare, only a few days prior to your unilateral announcement of 1st June. I have repeatedly said that the IPKFs withdrawal schedule should be worked out through joint consultations along with a simultaneous schedule for the implementation of the Indo-Lanka agreement.\u201d",
    "The correspondence between the two leaders continued in that tone. But what did happen was that the withdrawal of the IPKF that had begun prior to this correspondence was halted till the time schedule was agreed to by both parties. According to High Commissioner Mehrotra the withdrawal of 6,000 soldiers had begun by June 7, 1988, probably without much fanfare. No wonder that the Sri Lankan President was getting more and more frustrated and even suspicious of his Foreign Minister\u2019s negotiations which were more accommodative of the Indian side and understanding the practical considerations which arise when an army has to move out of its location after three years.",
    "Premadasa had demanded that all the Indian troops should leave by July 29, 1989 which was an anniversary of the signing of the Indo-Lanka pact. The Indian position was that this was not practically possible and the earliest date would be March 30, 1990. This was not to Premadasa\u2019s liking but there was nothing he could do. He expressed a fear that the Indian side would continue their occupation to humiliate him and threatened to call the SL army out of its barracks if no early solution was found. India in the meanwhile had elected a new Janatha government and had adopted a more conciliatory approach.",
    "Says Mehrotra \u201cI had the opportunity to meet the [new] External Affairs Minister I. K. Gujral in New Delhi. He informed me that the Government of India had accepted the Sri Lankan request to advance the completion of IPKF\u2019s withdrawal by one week from March 31 to March 24. That put at rest any doubts that the Sri Lankan government still had about the real intentions of the IPKF to leave Sri Lanka\u201d. With the departure of the IPKF Premadasa made a gracious statement thanking India and stated that he was looking for-ward to future cooperation. This gesture was appreciated by the new Indian government.",
    "However Premadasa\u2019s attempt to woo the LTTE failed. In spite of his personal intervention the LTTE, now relieved that the IPKF was gone, resumed their attacks. It was said by our security forces that Prabhakaran had used the ceasefire period to strengthen their clandestine operations in the south, including infiltrating the President\u2019s entourage. Pottu Amman had set up a network of LTTE \u201csleepers\u201d who could be activated at will. They were used by the LTTE later to eliminate the top leadership of the TULF including Amirthalingam. A few years later Ranjan Wijeratne, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, Neelan Tiruchelvam and Lakshman Kadirgamar were also killed in Colombo by LTTE operatives. In 1993 they employed a suicide bomber to kill President Premadasa himself. It is a melancholy thought that but for Premadasa\u2019s fruitless dalliance with the LTTE, which had decided to give him no quarter in the negotiations, these leaders may have lived to take this country on a different and more fruitful path.",
    "Having antagonized the Indian leadership and bureaucracy, Premadasa then tookup cudgels with other foreign representatives. He declared the British High Commissioner Gladstone \u201cpersona non grata\u201d for interfering in the conduct of a local government election by visiting a polling station in the south and airing his criticisms. He then accused Israel of supporting Lalith and Gamini and appointed a Commission of Inquiry into the relations between Israel and the local defence establishment. Hoping to rope in Gamini he wanted the use of Israel agricultural experts in Mahaweli development probed. By simultaneously antagonizing India [RAW], the UK [MI5], Israel [Mossad] and Non-Governmental Organizations to probe which he appointed yet another Commission, Premadasa was skating on thin ice.",
    "The only warnings he got regarding a conspiracy to kill him \u2013 secret information which foreign intelligence agencies usually pass on to their local counterparts \u2013 was from local astrologers who warned him to stay indoors as malefic planets were at work. He ignored these warnings with the same impatience he showed to the advice of senior ambassadors.",
