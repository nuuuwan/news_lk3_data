    "After what seems to have been an eternity, it was refreshing to hear a Prime Minister who knew what she was talking about and whom she was talking to. Last Friday, 26 September, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya was the Chief Guest at the Sri Lanka premiere of the 4K restoration of Gehenu Lamayi. Reflecting on the film, Amarasuriya noted its director Sumitra Peries as a trendsetter and a trailblazer. She went on to add that she was more than a director, arguing that she broadened our understanding of feminism in South Asia.",
    "I thought the tribute was well articulated, because it touched on three points which scholars of the Sinhala cinema have missed out. The first is that Sumitra\u2019s ascent as a film director followed a trajectory that was very different to all her contemporaries, bar none, in Sri Lanka and South Asia. Unlike the other distinguished figures of women\u2019s filmmaking in the region, Sumitra was educated in the West as an editor and found employment in Sri Lanka as an editor and an assistant director. In this, as I noted in my tribute to Sumitra after her passing in 2023, she became a precursor to the likes of Mira Nair.",
    "The second is that in her choice of source text for her first film, she deliberately overlooked the conventional choices of the day. When Lester Peries selected Golu Hadawatha as the first of three films he made for Ceylon Theatres, in 1968, Karunasena Jayalath tended to be viewed negatively by the country\u2019s critical establishment. One of Sumitra\u2019s overarching achievements \u2013 which almost no biographer or critic has commented on \u2013 was her ability to transform the most mundane, sentimental texts into living works of art. Jayalath\u2019s novels resonated well with popular readers, and in Sumitra\u2019s hands, Gehenu Lamayi became more than just a teenage romance, a morality tale of class and love.",
    "The third point is Sumitra\u2019s ability to even out the political and popular aspects of the story. Watching Gehenu Lamayi on the big screen, I was struck at some of the scenes which were suffused \u2013 there is no other word for it \u2013 by a feminine sensibility.",
    "Note that very first sequence between Kusum, played by Vasanthi Chathurani, and Padmini, played by Shyama Ananda. The British filmmaker Mark Cousins, with whom I spoke about Sumitra, said that she \u201cprobed shyness and tentative love\u201d well. That sequence with these two girls mingling with each other, which ends with another classmate describing Padmini as \u201calmost Kusum\u2019s partner\u201d, showed how Sumitra was able to delve into a world and an experience \u2013 in a word, girl-girl friendships \u2013 which, as Prime Minister Amarasuriya noted in her speech, \u201cnone of her contemporaries could.\u201d",
    "When the film was screened in Mannheim, Germany, one critic commented on its \u201caura of pessimism\u201d and its \u201cunobtrusive photography.\u201d Reflecting on the review with me \u2013 I think somewhere back in 2016 or 2017, when I had deep conversations with her \u2013 Sumitra noted that she had to restrain herself from being obtrusive with the camera.",
    "You see this tension throughout Gehenu Lamayi; it crops up in some of her other films as well, prominently Ganga Addara, where sequences that otherwise add very little value to the narrative \u2013 like the protagonist\u2019s wedding \u2013 go on endlessly. Sumitra herself admitted that she had a tendency to \u201cprettify everything.\u201d But as Mark Cousins has noted, this only added layers and layers of depth to her work.",
    "What distinguishes Gehenu Lamayi from Ganga Addara \u2013 the latter had the luxury of a rich producer and all the time and freedom Sumitra wanted \u2013 is how essentially innocent the former is. The latter is a bolder and more expressive work: emotions are not kept back, they gush out in torrents, sometimes in hysterics.",
    "In Gehenu Lamayi, only the audience is privy to Kusum\u2019s inner thoughts: almost no other character \u2013 except Padmini \u2013 pays much attention to what she is thinking and feeling. When Nimal\u2019s mother, played by Chitra Vakishta (who also played Dhammi\u2019s mother, incidentally, in Golu Hadawatha), discovers Kusum\u2019s affair, and reproves her for it, Kusum cries by a tree; when Nimal\u2019s mother comes back with a cup of tea and notices the tears, all she can say is, \u201cHow can you go on the road looking like that? Here, wipe those off.\u201d",
    "Ultimately, Gehenu Lamayi became to Sumitra\u2019s career what Rekava was to Lester\u2019s, Ahas Gawwa to Dharmasena Pathiraja\u2019s, and Palagetiyo to Vasantha Obeyesekere\u2019s. When you compare these debut works with their later films, you notice a rawness of style and vision, a somewhat jagged edge, which you don\u2019t in their later years. Commenting on Ahas Gawwa, Regi Siriwardena noted its \u201cinevitable technical roughnesses.\u201d It\u2019s like what Randall Jarrell wrote of Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry: \u201c[t]here are faults in this passage, and they do not matter.\u201d Pauline Kael wrote the same of some of Brian De Palma\u2019s early films.",
    "I think this is applicable to Gehenu Lamayi as well. There is a certain slowness in the second half, especially in those scenes at the school, which might disarm younger audiences today. The dialogues, most of which I believe were taken from Jayalath\u2019s novel, have a sentimental and highfalutin quality which only Jayalath was capable of. Yet ultimately, they do not matter. There is a wider social and political relevance in the narrative, which I feel transcends these limitations. I can do no more than quote the rest of Jarrell\u2019s judgment on Whitman\u2019s poetry; in his words, I think, we can find a true and honest reading of Sumitra\u2019s film.",
    "\u201c\u2026 the serious truth, the complete realization of these last lines, make us remember that few poets have shown more of the tears of things, and the joy of things, and of the reality beneath either tears or joy.\u201d",
