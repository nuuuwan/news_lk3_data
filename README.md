### Sri Lanka private credit down in Jan 2024

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s private credit fell 52.2 billion rupees in January 2024, after climbing 97.5 billion rupees in December and 62.9 billion in November, while central bank credit was overall deflationary, supporting monetary stability and reserves, official data shows.

Sri Lanka’s private credit spiked in December amid anecdotal evidence that import containers also surged ahead of a value added tax hike.

If the credit surge was linked to consumption imports, the loans will be liquidated as goods are sold.

Before the ‘age of inflation’ and chronic balance of payments deficits (aggressive outright purchases through open market operations to maintain a bureaucratically decided policy rate), some classical economists (including Adam Smith, in line with the the so-called ‘real bills doctrine’) supported limited note issue banking on a similar principle, analysts say.

Before the 1860s, Bank of England customers were bill brokers and discount houses, not banks which gave investment credit.

### Putin wins Russia election in landslide with no serious competition

(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin won a record post-Soviet landslide in Russia’s election on Sunday, cementing his already tight grip on power in a victory he said showed Moscow had been right to stand up to the West and send its troops into Ukraine.

Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who first rose to power in 1999, made it clear that the result should send a message to the West that its leaders will have to reckon with an emboldened Russia, whether in war or in peace, for many more years to come.

The outcome means Putin, 71, is set to embark on a new six-year term that will see him overtake Josef Stalin and become Russia’s longest-serving leader for more than 200 years if he completes it.
