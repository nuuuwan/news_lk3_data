    "In a significant move aimed at safeguarding public health, the Indian government has banned 156 fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs, including a variety of antibiotics, painkillers, multivitamins, and medications for treating fever and hypertension.",
    "This decision marks the largest crackdown on FDCs since 2016, when 344 such drugs were prohibited. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a gazette notification on Thursday, officially prohibiting the manufacture, sale, and distribution of the banned FDCs.",
    "The ban was based on the recommendations of an expert panel that reviewed a total of 324 FDCs.",
    "The banned FDCs include popular combinations such as mefenamic acid and paracetamol injections, commonly used for pain relief and fever, and omeprazole magnesium with dicyclomine HCl, used to treat abdominal pain.",
    "The ban is expected to impact major pharmaceutical companies, including Sun Pharmaceuticals, Cipla, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, and Alkem Laboratories."
