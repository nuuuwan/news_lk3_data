As a Government that recognises that rights come hand in hand with duties and responsibilities, we remain firmly committed to protecting and upholding the rights of children. We have also taken practical measures to more effectively define childhood and to intervene meaningfully in promoting and securing children\u2019s rights.",
    "In this regard, we are dedicated to ensuring the physical and mental wellbeing of all children, while guaranteeing their development through equal access to education, guidance, social protection, protection from abuse, discrimination and all forms of violence, as well as the provision of proper nutrition and improved healthcare services. We firmly believe that no child of school-going age should be deprived of an education on the basis of ethnicity, economic background, or any other factor. Accordingly, in this year\u2019s Budget, we placed particular emphasis on improving healthcare, education and other support services for children with developmental challenges, including autism.",

Likewise, we extend our deepest respect and gratitude to our elders for their invaluable contribution to the progress of our country.",
