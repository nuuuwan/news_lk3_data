    "A malicious attempt is underway to prevent me from becoming the Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) and conducting my duty correctly, as only a higher court of law could suspend my duties, Colombo JMO Dr. Ruhul Haq exclusively told the Daily Mirror.",
    "Responding for the first time against the recent media reports against him, the senior Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Ruhul Haq said yesterday that nobody could prevent him from acting as a state witness for dozens of medico legal cases, which are being heard at numerous courts in the country at present.",
    "\u201cI have clearly stated in my verdict of the Cause of Death Report on the three-year-old boy Hamdi Fazleen, who unfortunately died of a failed renal surgery that the boy\u2019s \u2018single functioning kidney had been removed\u2019. I have elaborated much on this case on an eight page Post Mortem Report, which was being finalized to be sent to the Colombo Magistrate Court,\u201d Dr. Haq said.",
    "\u201cThis is very clear if one looks at the Histo \u2013 Endoscopic Biopsy report prepared by the Consultant Histopathologist of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital. Instead of probing the medical officer who committed the erroneous surgery the media has found fault in my Cause of Death Report,\u201d he further said.",
    "Since the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had suspended my registration number for eight months with effect from December 20th, 2022 I have filed an appeal to the Ministry of Health explaining my right to continue my duties as the JMO. Since, there was no response to the appeal from either the Minister of Secretary of Health I have the full right to practice and perform my duties without fail.",
    "There is a malicious act going on to tarnish my image and prevent me from being appointed the Chief JMO of the country. Because I have on many occasions acted against the instances of medical negligence and such practitioners.",
    "Moreover my own duties in my 23 year service, I have been entrusted with heaps of medico legal work of 12 other doctors who have left Sri Lanka for good. In most of these cases I work as a State Witness, a JMO and engage in numerous legal and medical duties committed and unbiased. Therefore, if somebody is to suspend me from carrying out my duties it has to be a higher and relevant court of law,\u201d the JMO said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)"
