  "original_body_lines": [
    "Shah Rukh Khan was very much in the news, the past few weeks, especially in Sri Lanka, with most Sri Lankans eagerly awaiting his arrival, in Colombo, on 2nd August.",
    "Of course, it didn\u2019t happen, and none of us know the real reason for his, let\u2019s call it, last minute cancellation.",
    "Officially, it was stated that the cancellation was \u201cdue to unforeseen and unavoidable personal reasons beyond his control.\u201d",
    "It was also mentioned that he was injured on the set of \u2018King\u2019 but that was reported as false by NDTV and \u2018Times of India\u2019.",
    "However, SRK is in the news again and this time it\u2019s mainly in India.",
    "Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s National Award win for \u2018Best Actor\u2019 for his performance in \u2018Jawan\u2019 has sparked controversy. Some people were surprised that it took him 33 years to receive this honour, while others are questioning the merit behind Khan\u2019s win.",
    "Veteran Indian actress Urvashi, while accepting her own award for \u2018Best Supporting Actress\u2019 for \u2018Ullozhukku,\u2019 hinted at a lack of fairness in the jury\u2019s decisions.",
    "Urvashi questioned the National Awards jury\u2019s decision to give Shah Rukh Khan the \u2018Best Actor\u2019 award, for his role in \u2018Jawan,\u2019 while Vijayaraghavan was categorised as \u2018Best Supporting Actor\u2019 for \u2018Pookkaalam\u2019.",
    "She highlighted the disparity in awarding Shah Rukh Khan \u2018Best Actor\u2019 while Vijayaraghavan was given \u2018Best Supporting Actor,\u2019 despite both playing significant roles.",
    "She expressed her dissatisfaction in an interview with  Asianet News, asking, \u201cHow did one become a supporting actor and the other the best actor? On what criteria?\u201d",
    "She also raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the selection process, stating that the jury\u2019s decision should be explained to the artists. Urvashi emphasised that awards shouldn\u2019t be accepted without question, saying, \u201cThis is not pension money that we should accept blindly\u201d.",
    "Additionally, she pointed out the inconsistency in categorising actors, noting that she was initially approached for a role in \u2018Pookkaalam\u2019 but declined due to the demanding physical transformation required.",
    "Veteran Indian actress Urvashi: Questioned the National Awards jury\u2019s decision to give Shah Rukh Khan the \u2018Best Actor\u2019 award",
    "Others questioned the jury\u2019s decision-making process and timing, wondering why Khan was awarded now, despite his long-standing contributions to Indian cinema.",
    "Some critics felt that Khan\u2019s win was overdue, given his impactful performances in the past, while some observers believe the award might be a strategic move to co-opt Khan, given the government\u2019s complicated relationship with Bollywood and Khan\u2019s refusal to conform to certain expectations.",
    "The controversy also highlights concerns about the devaluation of Indian cinema\u2019s diversity and the erasure of dissenting voices, with some filmmakers and audiences feeling that the National Awards have become an instrument of cultural control.",
    "Sometimes I wonder why Sri Lankans go gaga over Indian actors and actresses and treat them like royalty! Perhaps we believe in the Indian slogan \u2018Neighbourhood First.\u2019",
    "Indian film stars do enjoy a certain level of adoration, globally, but within specific regions, particularly where Indian culture, and Indians, are prominent,",
    "However, the notion of hero worship, across the globe, is not universally true.",
