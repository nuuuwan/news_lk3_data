    "The Engineering division of SriLankan Airlines continued its streak of firsts with the recent completion of a heavy maintenance check on a Cebu Pacific Air Airbus A330 (Trent 700), marking a foray into providing Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) services for wide-bodied aircraft from the Southeast Asian region.",
    "Cebu Pacific Air is the first Southeast Asian airline to sign up with SriLankan Engineering for heavy maintenance on wide-body aircraft, signifying the growing international demand and reputation of trust that SriLankan Engineering\u2019s MRO services have garnered in a short span of time.",
    "The heavy maintenance check on the Cebu Pacific Air aircraft was performed in SriLankan Engineering\u2019s dedicated European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approved wide-body hangar over a period of four days. It was also the third heavy maintenance by SriLankan Engineering for a customer airline during a busy May, with the other checks being carried out on two Airbus A330 (CF6) aircraft of Serene Air, who came aboard last year.",
    "SriLankan Engineering\u2019s achievements as a third-party base maintenance provider have been nothing short of remarkable considering their relative newness to the business. SriLankan Engineering has especially established a reputation for on-time performance, short turnaround times and quality of workmanship among its expanding clientele from South Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Africa, and now Southeast Asia.",
    "In this year alone, several new customers enrolled with SriLankan Engineering for line maintenance services in Colombo and the Maldives. The demand for base maintenance services has also been equally strong. Air-Sial and Salam Air enlisted for component maintenance services, while and Cebu Pacific Air and Jazeera Airways became the newest customers of heavy maintenance services in 2023. The increasing demand for its MRO services has also resulted in an increasing dollar revenue for SriLankan Engineering, which saw a 35 per cent jump in earnings between the last two financial years.",
