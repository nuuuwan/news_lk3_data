Sri Lankan banks‚Äô operating environment (OE) assessment and overall credit profiles will be supported by any improvement in the sovereign‚Äôs credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: RD, Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) following a completed debt restructuring, says Fitch Ratings.

Sri Lankan banks‚Äô current OE score of ‚Äòccc-‚Äô/stable is linked closely to the sovereign‚Äôs local-currency credit profile, given their predominant exposure to the domestic economy and government securities (local-currency treasury instruments: 33.4% of assets and foreign currency instruments: 3.4% at end-1H24) and lending to the broader public sector.
