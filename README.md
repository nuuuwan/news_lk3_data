With this, the greenwashing brigade arrived, talking about ‚Äòclimate change mitigation‚Äô and energy security. Converting wind into energy was a noble idea‚Äìwith a large asterisk.

*2024-12-13 01:00:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ajahn-brahmavamsos-advice-for-meditation/) ¬∑ `en`

Ven Mettavihari, who resides in the Narada Bauddha Dharmayatanaya, formerly the Narada Buddhist Research and Information Centre down Sarana Road, Colombo 7, is the advisor to the Brahm Society of Sri Lanka. They are preparing a visit from Ajahn Brahm to Sri Lanka in May 2025.

Ven Mettavihari sent me a verbatim transcription of a talk given by Ven Brahmavamso. Impressed and finding it useful in my attempts to meditate, I decided to redo the article and share it with others in this season of  Unduvap Poya. I will give Ajahn Brahm‚Äôs actual words within speech punctuation, attempting to retain the ‚Äòflavour‚Äô of his style of preaching. I may not succeed in this but his messages will be conveyed.

### MMDA reform is not repeal:  New Govt. must counter fearmongering and resistance to justice

*2024-12-13 00:20:20* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/MMDA-reform-is-not-repeal-New-Govt-must-counter-fearmongering-and-resistance-to-justice/4-770438) ¬∑ `en`

Justice in the context of MMDA reforms will entail treating women and children with dignity, providing equal protection of Sri Lanka law to women and children, ensuring that the MMDA is a Shari‚Äôah compliant Islamic law that strives for righteous living in the interest and wellbeing of Muslims, and realising constitutional guarantees for all Muslims of the country. Reform of the MMDA will represent all these progressive aspects: Islamic legal jurisprudence, constitutional protections, universal human rights and basic human compassion and fairness. Indeed the call for reform is one to strengthen and preserve the MMDA rather than repeal it

The new Government must recognise the current fearmongering campaign for what it is, and confidently advance MMDA reforms

It was the ITAK which introduced the demand for federalism into Sri Lanka‚Äôs post-independence political discourse. The birth and growth of the ITAK and its espousal of power sharing through a federal arrangement introduced a vibrant and colourful phase into the island nation‚Äôs politics. Though 75 years have passed since the party was born, the ITAK continues to remain wedded to the federal idea

The recently held Parliamentary elections have resulted in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) led National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) winning 159 seats and forming the Government. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) with 40 seats is the chief Opposition party.

The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.

Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017.

### Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children

The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.

The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to ‚Äúcommunity outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders‚Äù and will act as a deterrent.

But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.

The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.

The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the ‚Äúrights of victims‚Äù ahead of ‚Äúthe rights of criminals‚Äù.
