I want to tell my younger sisters and brothers: life is like a river\u2014it flows to the ocean no matter the obstacles. Face every challenge positively and you will win tomorrow.\u201dHer father, Dr. Shafi Shabdeen, also reflected on his past:\u201cI grew up in a small village near the historic Vijithapura temple. I see racism as a cancer. If we don\u2019t end it, we cannot move forward as a nation. We must live as Sri Lankans, preserving humanity. Otherwise, we cannot give our children the future they deserve.\u201dAuthor Suranga Senanayake explained the inspiration behind the book:\u201cI didn\u2019t meet Zainab by chance. I\u2019ve followed Dr. Shafi\u2019s case for five years. I believe we still have much to do for this society. This book is my tribute to my three children and to all children who dream of a vibrant, inclusive nation. A flower basket is beautiful because of its diversity. Let\u2019s build a colorful country together.\u201dChevaan Daniel, delivering the keynote address, emphasized:\u201cWe are here for a modern nation. Dr. Shafi reminded us of the damage caused by regressive ideologies. A modern country must be built on ability. Diversity is essential. This is not a nostalgic dream\u2014it\u2019s the only way forward.\u201d\u2018Ran Dhoni\u2019 stands as a testament to resilience, truth, and the power of humanity in the face of adversity."
