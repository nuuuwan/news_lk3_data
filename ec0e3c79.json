  "original_body_lines": [
    "The UK government has introduced measures it promised would deliver the biggest-ever cut in net migration after levels soared to a record high.",
    "Home Secretary James Cleverly announced a five-point plan to curb immigration, which he said was \u201cfar too high\u201d.",
    "The changes included hiking the minimum salary needed for skilled overseas workers from \u00a326,200 to \u00a338,700.",
    "Mr Cleverly claimed 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK last year would not be able to in future.",
    "The minimum income for family visas has also risen to \u00a338,700.",
    "In a statement to MPs, the home secretary said migration to the UK \u201cneeds to come down\u201d and there had been \u201cabuse\u201d of health and care visas for years.",
    "\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Mr Cleverly said. \u201cImmigration policy must be fair, legal, and sustainable.\u201d",
    "The migration plan comes after official figures last month showed net migration had soared to a record 745,000 in 2022.",
    "Conservative MPs have since piled pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government to bring down net migration, which is the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.",
    "The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since winning power in 2010, and \u201ctake back control\u201d of the UK\u2019s borders since the Brexit vote.",
    "The party\u2019s 2019 election manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000 when he was prime minister.",
    "Immigration is shaping up to be a key issue ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024.",
    "With Labour leading in opinion polls, Mr Sunak has vowed to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d to bring down net migration.",
    "On top of the new salary requirements, the government said it would:",
    "\u2022 Ban health and care workers bringing family dependants to the UK",
    "\u2022 End companies being able to pay workers 20% less than the going rate for jobs on a shortage occupation list",
    "\u2022 Increase the annual charge foreign workers pay to use the NHS from \u00a3624 to \u00a31,035",
    "\u2022 Raise the minimum income for family visas to \u00a338,700, from \u00a318,600 from next spring",
    "\u2022 Ask the government\u2019s migration adviser to review the graduate visa route to \u201cprevent abuse\u201d",
    "The home secretary told MPs the changes would take effect in the spring next year.",
    "\u201cIn total, this package, plus our reduction in students dependants, will mean around 300,000 fewer people will come in future years than have come to the UK last year,\u201d Mr Cleverly told MPs.",
    "The figure of 300,000 is an estimate, based on internal Home Office calculations.",
    "The Home Office believes the previously announced ban on most overseas students bringing dependents with them will account for almost half of the overall reduction.",
    "Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Monday\u2019s announcement was \u201can admission of years of Tory failure on both the immigration system and the economy\u201d.",
    "She said while net migration \u201cshould come down\u201d, the Conservatives were \u201cfailing to introduce more substantial reforms that link immigration to training and fair pay requirements in the UK, meaning many sectors will continue to see rising numbers of work visas because of skills shortages\u201d.",
    "Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said the \u201ccruel plans spell total disaster for the NHS and social care\u201d.",
    "\u201cMigrant workers were encouraged to come here because both sectors are critically short of staff. Hospitals and care homes simply couldn\u2019t function without them,\u201d she said.",
    "The plans were welcomed by some Conservative MPs, with former cabinet minister Simon Clarke calling the changes \u201cserious\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d steps.",
    "But Mr Cleverly\u2019s predecessor as home secretary, Suella Braverman, was less impressed.",
    "She said the package was \u201ctoo late and the government can go further\u201d on salary requirements and \u201cshortening the graduate route\u201d.",
    "Mrs Braverman claimed she had put forward similar proposals six times when she was home secretary \u201cbut the delay has reduced their impact\u201d.",
    "She has lambasted the government\u2019s record on immigration since she was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak last month.",
    "The latest statistics show the challenge ministers will face in reducing migration into the health sector, which has come to rely heavily on hiring workers from abroad.",
    "The government said in the year ending September 2023, 101,000 visas were issued to care workers.",
    "An estimated 120,000 visas were granted to the family dependants of those care workers, the government said.",
    "The care sector is facing staffing shortages and providers have resisted curbs on their ability to hire foreign workers.",
    "The government\u2019s migration advisers have previously said \u201cpersistent underfunding\u201d of local councils, which funds most adult social care, is the most important factor in the staffing crisis.",
    "Mr Cleverly acknowledged some care workers might be deterred from coming to the UK because they would not be able to bring families under the new rules.",
    "But he said he believed there would still be care workers who would be willing to work in the UK.",
    "Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said the decision to raise the family income threshold to \u00a338,700 was \u201cthe biggest surprise of the day\u201d.",
    "The government\u2019s changes to the minimum income for family visas mean that people may be blocked from bringing their relatives to stay in the UK under certain circumstances.",
    "\u201cFamily migration makes up a small share of the total, but those who are affected by it can be affected very significantly,\u201d Dr Sumption said.",
    "\u201cThe largest impacts will fall on lower-income British citizens, and particularly women and younger people who tend to earn lower wages.\u201d"
