    "Power of Play, a company utilising performing arts for advocacy has partnered with Advocata Institute and Sahana Social Development Alliance to provide Sri Lankan youth with an innovative opportunity to increase their economic literacy and communication skills, through performing arts.",
    "This project is a direct response to the disadvantages faced by youth, where traditional education systems fail to foster critical thinking skills so they engage meaningfully with complex socio-political issues. Through a three-phase approach, this project will educate youth on how to inform their decisions with facts (based on verified scientific/statistical evidence) and communicate their opinions effectively using creative, non-violent communication tools to inspire open dialogue for collaborative problem-solving.",
    "Phase 1 includes a national digital survey on economic awareness targeted at 18-35 year olds, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with selected youth communities in Galle and Matara. The goal of the survey and FGDs is to identify critical knowledge gaps of youth relating to the past, present, and future of the economic crisis of Sri Lanka. The research results will be used to inform the storyline of a puppet show to be devised by Power of Play, to raise awareness of the current economic issues and open an audience dialogue on viable solutions.",
    "Phase 2 will deliver a 12-day community workshop in Matara, where 30 selected youth will participate in intensive training in performing arts and supporting skills to create and maintain independent theatre companies that can serve the dual purpose of creating employment for youth through community empowerment programs.\u00a0 Phase 3 will see 5 separate community theatre groups (established in Phase 2) touring their original performances on socially critical issues in their communities.",
    "This project is funded by USAID through the Sri Lanka Engage program and supports opportunities to expand awareness, advocacy, and constructive civic engagement around important economic and governance issues related to reforms",
    "The national survey invites youth to participate and submit their responses before 10 April 2024. Youth in Galle and Matara can apply to be part of the phase 2 and 3 community theatre groups (the application deadline is 27 March 2024). Those interested are invited to visit www.powerofplay.lk for information."
