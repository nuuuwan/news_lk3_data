The report also features numerous compelling impact stories, illustrating how OrphanCare\u2019s funding and support has empowered orphans to overcome immense challenges, pursue higher education, initiate small businesses, and build brighter futures. These narratives powerfully demonstrate how, with the right support, these young individuals have been able to raise their heads with newfound confidence and purpose.",

We provide them with the foundational support they need to become contributing members of society, truly breaking a cycle of vulnerability. We are thankful to all our donors and partners for contributing towards the impact we have made.\u201d",

This allows us to maximise the impact of every contribution. Beyond the numbers we have achieved, the true impact of OrphanCare is reflected in the lives we are touching, the hope we are restoring, and the dignity we are protecting. The stories featured in this report offer a glimpse into these meaningful journeys. I extend my heartfelt thanks to our Board of Trustees and to the past and present Board of Directors of Amana Bank. A special note of appreciation goes to the dedicated staff of Amana Bank, who have not only volunteered their time and effort, but have also pledged monthly contributions through standing orders.\u201d",

    "Highlighting the Trust\u2019s guiding principles, Trustee Amarasekera stated: \u201cOrphanCare operates on fundamental principles that resonate deeply with universal human rights and social justice. Firstly, our work is fully aligned with Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of a Child, advocating for non-discrimination based on race, religion, gender, or ethnicity. Secondly, we contribute directly to UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 \u2013 Reduced Inequalities, by providing equitable opportunities to a profoundly vulnerable segment of our society. These principles are not just guidelines; they are the bedrock of our operations, ensuring every child is treated with dignity and given the chance to flourish.\u201d",
    "Further acknowledging the partners, Amarasekera said: \u201cThe Trust extends its heartfelt gratitude to Nawaz J. Vilcassim for his magnanimous gesture of donating all proceeds from the sale of his books\u2014an act that has helped spread the message of OrphanCare across multiple continents and countries. His contribution goes far beyond financial support; the time, personal networks, dedication, and passion to this cause is truly inspiring. We are equally grateful to all our valued partners for their continued contributions. It is through such collective generosity that the OrphanCare Trust Fund continues to grow, enabling larger disbursements to beneficiaries. This translates into more impactful stories of orphaned children whose lives have been meaningfully transformed\u2014just as we would wish for our own children.\u201d"
