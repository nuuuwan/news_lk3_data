    "On 14 November, Wickramasinghe issued a controversial statement, alleging that the adversities Sri Lankan cricket is facing at present were the result of \u2018multifaceted conspiratorial plans\u2019 that had been in operation at various levels over the past two and a half years.",
    "Expressing his views on the plight of the sport in the country, Wickramasinghe said the suspension imposed on Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by the International Cricket Council (ICC) was also a consequence of this scheme.",
    "Behind this conspiracy, he said were certain individuals who were vying for power in the cricket governing body, brokers involved in match-fixing, and the players who were trying hard to secure their spot in the national team. \u201cThe ultimate goal was to cause the downfall of the cricket administration.\u201d",
    "Wickramasinghe went on to dismiss the criticisms levelled against the national cricket selection committee over the past two and a half years, as untrue and destructive.",
