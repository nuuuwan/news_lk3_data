    "Who will it be? Ranil, Sajith or Anura? The hard copy version of this article will be public while the voting is going on. By the time it appears online the vote count will be on and at least who is in the lead, if not the actual winner, will be known. Writing a day before the vote, I do not have a crystal ball to say who Sri Lanka\u2019s next president will be. Suffice it to say that as the countdown week draws to a close there are strong assertions from the Ranil camp that he is going to be the winner. If those assertions are proven correct and if Ranil Wickremesinghe gets elected as the next president, then it will be political business as usual for the next few weeks, if not for the next few months, bar the shouting and ceremonies.",
    "On the other hand, if Ranil were to lose as mostly predicted, the immediate consequences will be interesting at the least, and even tumultuous \u2013 but hopefully positively. The shouting and ceremonies will be much louder and more triumphant no matter who the winner is \u2013 Anura Kumara Dissanayake or Sajith Premadasa. I am trying to be alphabetic here without showing any rank preference. The political consequences and even the immediate constitutional aftermaths could be different depending on who the winner us.",
    "Of more than interest could be the actions of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the outgoing president, which too likely would vary depending on who the winner is. Whether Anura Kumara Dissanayake \u2013 whom the President has been good naturedly calling \u201cmy good friend\u201d in parliamentary parlance. Or Sajith Premadasa \u2013 with whom the President shares a relationship of mutual loathing and contempt.",
    "There are speculations that Ranil Wickremesinghe would be devious and mischievous. Mr. Wickremesinghe could also be gracious and generous in defeat. And he should be, in my humble view. Funny as well, to some, like his comical look alike Mr. Bean. If you have not seen it, the very informal Colombo club of Ranil cynics has put online the last crowing scene from the Johnny English comedy film series starring Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean). You can watch it while browsing for election results.",
    "Levity and laughter are good for politics. Good antidotes to sulking and scheming. Otherwise, you will get lesser weirdos carrying guns and going for the larger weirdos \u2013as in the current version of American politics. Vice President Kamala Harris is going all out trying to bandy political joy but faces all but an uphill task against a brooding opponent.",
    "Adding mischief to the campaign cacophony in Sri Lanka, there have been speculations that Ranil Wickremesinghe might dissolve parliament as early as September 21. If he has already done it by the time you read this, so be it. Otherwise, read on! One of the NPP\u2019s legal luminaries has responded well to this potential, but in my view unlikely, scenario. As President, Ranil Wickremesinghe has the power to dissolve parliament anytime now. But why would he do it on the voting day of a presidential election?",
    "An abrupt dissolution of parliament as the parting act of a defeated and departing president is not going to change the election result. And there is no military mechanism like in Thailand, or the electoral college route as in the US, to thwart the outcome of a popular election. Any such unilateral act would be seen as provocation by the incoming president and may lead to outcries and protests by his supporters. All quite unnecessary and to no avail, certainly not of any benefit for Ranil Wickremesinghe. And there is no point in risking a repeat aragalaya especially after the turn it has taken in Bangladesh.",
    "As the departing president if Wickremesinghe wants to be of help to the incoming president, he could dissolve parliament in consultation with his successor. That would be wholly appropriate and a very welcome gesture. It may go well with Anura Kumara Dissanayake who wants to dissolve the current parliament immediately anyway. But it could be a different story with Sajith Premadasa, and therein is the rub. Mr. Premadasa has not indicated anything about dissolving parliament. And unlike Mr. Dissanayake who will have to manage with a caretaker cabinet of four ministers, Mr. Premadasa will have to give cabinet positions to dozens of parliamentarians who have chosen to support him instead of Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "The fundamental problem here is about the modality for Ranil Wickremesinghe relinquishing office if he does not win the election on Saturday. The constitution as it is today, after twenty amendments, stipulates the following: the president shall hold office for a term of five years and a maximum of two terms; the poll for electing the president shall be held not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the incumbent president; and the term of office of the elected president shall commence on the expiration of the term of office of the incumbent president.",
    "All of this would mean that the term of office of President Wickremesinghe will expire on November 18, five years from November 19, 2019, when Gotabaya Rajapakse assumed office as President three days after winning the election on November 16. In other words, if either AKD or SP were to elected as president, they will have to sit around twiddling their presidential thumbs if President Wickremesinghe decides to stay on until his term expires on November 18, nearly two months after the election.",
    "At the same time, the Constitution also provides for the assumption of office by the president elect \u2013 by taking the oath of office before the Chief Justice or any other Judge of the Supreme Court. Interestingly, there is no stipulation as to when this should happen and how it is to be arranged. It would be hilarious if Ranil Wickremesinghe decides to stick around, and regardless of it the president elect (AKD or SP) decides to take the oath of office.",
    "There will be two presidents in office. Unless Ranil Wickremesinghe decides to play Mr. Bean and instructs the Supreme Court Judges not to administer the presidential oath to the president elect until he (Ranil) authorizes it. But why would any Judge listen to Ranil after he loses the election? The absurdity of such scenarios should be enough to stop speculations about President Wickremesinghe pulling out a magical wand and undoing the results of the election. More importantly, President Wickremesinghe should desist from doing anything weirdly stupid and follow the now established precedents from the last two presidential elections.",
    "In January 2015 and in November 2019, the assumption of office by the president elect and the relinquishing of office by the outgoing president took place seamlessly and within days of the two presidential elections. In 2015, Mahinda Rajapaksa quit and Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in the day after the election. Similarly in 2019, the transfer of power from Maithripala Sirisena to Gotabaya Rajapaksa was executed within three days of the election. These are worthy precedents that any and all outgoing presidents should follow to facilitate the peaceful transfer of power as mandated by the people. There is nothing to suggest President Wickremesinghe will not abide by these precedents.",
    "It is worth mentioning that the original 1978 Constitution included clear provisions for presidential terms (six year term limited to two), expiry of office, and succession through election or to fill a prematurely vacated office. President JR Jayewardene, the first beneficiary of his own creation, assumed office as the first Executive President on February 4, 1978, the 40th anniversary of Sri Lanka\u2019s independence. The Constitution went further, stipulated February 4 as the date for assuming office for all future elected presidents and scheduled presidential elections to be held between one month and two months before February 4, that is between December 4 and January 4 in the preceding period.",
    "This was a neat arrangement that brought certainty to the process that was somewhat similar to the American presidential calendar of November election and January inauguration every four years. The longer interval in the US is needed for the transition phase involving the executive and a cabinet based on presidential appointees and not members of the legislature. In the Sri Lankan Constitution, JRJ insistently restricted the cabinet to members of parliament and continued the old office of the Prime Minister, even if it was given only \u2018name board\u2019 significance \u2013 as Prime Minister Premadasa, JRJ\u2019s only Prime Minister, disparagingly described it. Be that as it may.",
    "The whole arrangement fell apart when President Jayewardene started having different thoughts and wanted to have a politically convenient early election, two years before the expiration of his term. That was the cause for the Third Amendment to the Constitution, which enabled the September 1982 presidential election and precipitated the July-August calamity of 1983. Nothing in Sri Lanka has been the same since. Lost in the melee was the time table for conducting presidential elections and enabling transfer of power centered on February 4.",
    "The provisions for presidential terms, elections and assumptions, in the current electronic version of the Constitution are a remarkable sight \u2013 all slapped with asterisks, square brackets, and amendment footnotes indicating how many times these provisions have been changed and re-changed. Remarkably as well and for whatever reason, the drafters of the 19th Amendment did not think of rescinding the entire Third Amendment and cleaning up the schedule for presidential election and assumption of office. That is how things are \u2013 as indeed is the case with many things Sri Lankan.",
    "To permit myself a little digression, JRJ\u2019s selection of February 4 as the date for the assumption of presidential office was both symbolic and a sharp rebuke to the United Front government that for no reason stopped observing Independence Day on February 4 and started celebrating a new National Day on May 22, coinciding with the adoption of the First Republican Constitution in 1972. This was puerile political pettiness when the more grownup route would have been to follow India\u2019s example and start observing both milestone days \u2013 February 4 as Independence Day, and May 22 as Republican Day.",
    "When the UNP\u2019s turn came, JRJ returned the favour, restored February 4 to its due eminence, created the referendum requirement to make it irrevocable, and equally childishly removed May 22 from any official reckoning. Whose turn is it going to be in this year of grace or confusion \u2013 2024? The Saturday\u2019s vote will not give the full answer, which will only come after the parliamentary election is also completed. Until then you might sing with Bob Dylan, \u201cThe answer, my friend, is blowin\u2019 in the wind. The answer is blowin\u2019 in the wind.\u201d",
