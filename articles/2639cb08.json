    "United Nations (UN) Assistant Secretary General Kanni Wignaraja met with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat. The discussion primarily focused on governance, Constitutional reforms, and the country\u2019s electoral system.",
    "Wignaraja presented the report on \u2018Understanding Multidimensional Vulnerabilities: Impact on the People of Sri Lanka\u2019 to President Dissanayake. Based on the findings of this report, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) assured its support for Sri Lanka\u2019s development efforts.",
    "A key point of discussion was the low level of women\u2019s participation in the economy. The UNDP noted that rural women face significant challenges in financial literacy, limiting their involvement in economic activities. The farming sector, in particular, suffers from poor economic literacy, resulting in underrepresentation in the national economy. The UNDP expressed willingness to assist with digitalisation programs, highlighting it as a critical tool to minimise corruption.",
    "Discussing Sri Lanka\u2019s low agricultural productivity compared to other Asian nations, President Dissanayake explained that many farmers have small plots of land and do not view farming as their primary source of income. To address this, the Government plans to strengthen farmers\u2019 associations, which would help improve bargaining power and agricultural activities.",
    "Discussing reforms to the electoral system, President Dissanayake pointed out such reforms should ensure inclusive representation of ethnic and religious communities.",
    "Addressing concerns over the microfinance sector, the President explained the interests are unfair and that the current administration plans to establish a new development bank to support the microfinance sector, with a focus on greater involvement of women. The Government also plans to provide Treasury guarantees for the best proposals submitted by women entrepreneurs to help them secure capital. The UNDP reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the Government\u2019s reforms, anti-corruption efforts, and increasing women\u2019s participation in both the economy and Parliament.",
    "UNDP in Sri Lanka Resident Representative Azusa Kubota along with Strategic Engagement, Digital, and Innovation Team Leader Fadhil Bakeer Markar also participated in the discussion."
