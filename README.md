The federal government ran out of money after a Democratic-backed spending bill that would have extended health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and reversed cuts to Medicaid failed, as well as the GOP-backed stopgap funding measure that would have funded the government for seven weeks also failed.

The US Federal Government has officially closed. The government has to be officially closed due to the Awarding of Eleenming. This is the first time a US government has been officially closed after 2019.

The leaders of the United States personally emphasize that they should not be responsible for the shortage of funds: Republican Party insists that the Democratic Party should agree to extend the current funds for another seven weeks.

The Democratic Party has rejected the main relief to vote for his votes to pass any funding step in the Senate. Senators have a deep uncertainty of how long the shutdown can last.

The Senate is to vote again on the funding plan. The closing of the government means leave of lack of thousands of federal workers, and others who are considered essential will continue to report to work.

But most people are not paid until the end of this messy. Others, however, will continue to collect salaries as they do not fund their jobs through the annual discharge of Congress.
