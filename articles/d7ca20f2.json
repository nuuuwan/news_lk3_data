    "Among those rescued, two were children and four were seen by medical personnel for minor injuries, according to Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, who did not provide details on the fatality.",

Guests are provided hard hats, and are told to leave personal items like walkers and wheelchairs behind during the tour."
