He said that all would accept this, and then I accepted the challenge to meet the president.

When the parliament was surrounded by the presidency of the time, there was no one, and now all who demanded leadership fled.

People say that Anura Kumaratisanayake will hold office for three months. I do not do so. He must continue his post.. Do not do such things.

But I do not think that this government will last even three months.
