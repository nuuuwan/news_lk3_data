    "March 5, 2024, will go down as a red-letter day for the world\u2019s investor relations community. On this day, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, headquartered in Sri Lanka, integrated an AI-powered Annual Report Assistant (AIPARA) to their Annual Report 2023. It is probably the first of its kind.",
    "This innovation addresses a perennial issue and makes reading annual reports a true joy. Gone will be the days when readers had to wade through pages to find information of interest and significance to them. Readers can now simply ask questions from AIPARA and obtain answers.",
    "Commenting on Commercial Bank\u2019s annual report journey, Sanath Manatunge, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank said that integrating AIPARA to the Bank\u2019s Annual Report aligns perfectly with their ongoing investments in digital transformation, technological innovation, and data-driven decision-making. \u201cWe commenced our digital annual reporting journey more than fifteen years ago when we started presenting our annual report as an end-to-end HTML so that both human and machine readers could better discover, access and interact with our annual report\u201d, he added.",
