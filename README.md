*2024-12-26 10:11:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202177) ┬╖ `ta`

Financial fraud spikes during festivals: SLCERT warns public to protect accounts and avoid sharing sensitive info with unknown entities.

ЁЯЯй

Nirosh Ananda, the Chief Information Security Engineer of the Computer Emergency Ready Committee (SLCERT), said that financial fraud complaints have increased sharply during the New Year and New Year's Emergency.

More than 25 percent of complaints have been received regarding fraud for the Computer Emergency Committee.

Therefore, the public should not share their bank account digits or the once -used passwords (OTP) with the third party.

Requests may be asked for bank account details for reasons such as gift vouchers, cash payments or sharing of index numbers.

The public should be vigilant when getting links through popular social media sites such as Facebook or WhatsApp. These links can also be sent by SMS. Prizes and vouchers will be informed by individuals via phone calls.

He has requested the public to contact them directly and to share personal details with the unknown third parties in case of any such suspicious information.

Authorities in RussiaтАЩs southern Krasnodar region on Wednesday declared a region-wide emergency, saying that oil was still washing up on the coastline 10 days after two ageing tankers ran into trouble.

The oil is from the tankers which were hit by a storm on Dec. 15. One of the vessels split in half, while the other ran aground.

The pollution, which has coated sandy beaches at and around Anapa, a popular summer resort, has caused serious problems for seabirds and everything from dolphins to porpoises and over 10,000 people have been trying to clear it up.

Veniamin Kondratiev, governor of the Krasnodar region, said in a statement that he had decided to declare a region-wide emergency because oil was still polluting the coastline in the Anapa and Temryuk districts.

### Yes, itтАЩs Christmas timeтАж

*2024-12-25 19:30:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/yes-its-christmas-time/) ┬╖ `en`

ItтАЩs a well-known fact that with Christmas comes some kind of chaos. The build-up tends to be a blur of gift buying, party prepping and worryingly high workloads; itтАЩs understandably difficult to find, let alone make, the time for yourself тАУ but itтАЩs important that you doтАжto make your skin healthier this Christmas

Drinking plenty of water is always important. Dehydrated skin can look dry and flaky, with more visible fine lines and wrinkles. Water also rids the body of toxins, which is especially useful if you are having those Christmas drinks and eating more processed foods than usual.

Remove dullness and reveal your inner radiance with a gentle exfoliating scrub. Opt for natural ingredients, like brown sugar, oats, or even coffee grounds mixed with honey. Massage in circular motions, focusing on areas like your nose, chin, and forehead. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat your skin dry.
