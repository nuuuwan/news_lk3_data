  "original_title": "Premier Harini\u2019s  Blunder about Chichi\u2019s Rocket  and  Minister Wasantha\u2019s Damage Control  Statement.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Janatha  Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP)led National People\u2019s Power(NPP) Government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake known as AKD , has been in the saddle for close upon a year now. Given the  JVP-NPP\u2019s 159 members  of Parliament and the victories registered in the local authority polls, the chances of being dislodged from that saddle soon  seem remote.",
    "Yet many opposition leaders  seem to think otherwise.  These hopes are hinged around two possibilities.Some are  hopeful that the economy  will eventually  deteriorate, resulting  in a crisis situation of availability and affordability along with shortages of fuel,electricity, gas and essential food items. This in turn would cause an \u201cAragalaya\u201d type of situation that would topple the AKD regime.",
    "The  other line of thought is about internal dissension within the ruling party. There are tensions between the  hardcore JVP old guard and the new reformist NPP. Many of the NPP parliamentarians  resent the JVP domination and would  break  away is a fond belief. Furthermore there is  personal rivalry among some top JVP\u2019ers. This too  may lead  to a split in the party hopes the opposition.",
    "Rumour mills work overtime in this regard. It is being said that two senior ministers are eying the Prime minister post. Hence there is a cold war being fought against Prime minister Harini Amarasuriya. According to the rumour mongers, Harini may have been compelled to quit as PM by the internal forces arrayed against her, but for the solidarity and support extended by President AKD.",
    "It is not the intention of this column to  probe the real or imaginary power play within Govt  upper echelons at this juncture. However this column focuses this week on a bizarre turn of events concerning Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, Trade, Cmmerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development minister Wasantha Samarasinghe and  Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) Hambantota district Parliamentarian D.V. Chanaka. Their three way exchange has created a controversy fuelling many  conspiracy theories. Also it has strengthened the opinion  that there is  serious dissension within the  Govt.",
    "It all began with a seemingly innocuous question raised by Hambantota SLPP parliamentarian D.V.Chanaka . It was about the agreement signed in 2012 between the SupremeSAT pvt ltd and the Board of Investement(BOI) regarding a satellite project.",
    "Interestingly the question was addressed to Prime Minister Amarasuriya instead of the finance minister despite the BOI coming under the purview of the Finance ministry. In addition to being premier, Harini is the minister of Education,Higher Education and Vocational Education. President Dissanayake is the Finance minister.",
    "Prime minister Amarasuriya officially replied  to DV Chanaka on August 6th. PM Harini  stated at the outset that she was reading from data provided by the BOI officials. The essence of her reply as reported in newspapers was this \u2013",
    "\u201cSupreme SAT  entered into an agreement with the Board of Investment on 23rd May 2012 and invested Rs. 12.1 million for the satellite during 2013 and 2014. The investment was classified  as a project targeting the local market,  under clause 17 of the BOI Act.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe  objective of the project  was  for the establishment and operation of a satellite system at the Kandy Industrial Park, with an investment of Rs. 1,828 million. It was for  providing telecommunications and broadcasting services to local consumers. Commercial operations  began on August 27, 2015.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe  Sri Lankan government had not invested any  cash in the venture.Therefore",
    "Prime Minister, Harini Amarasuriya, also presented  details \u2013 based on BOI data \u2013 of revenue  earned by Supreme SAT in the past years.The breakdown  was \u2013",
    "According to the details presented by the Prime  Minister based on BOI data, the revenue generated  through the project in seven and a half years  was  343.9 billion rupees. This meant the annual average was over 40 billion rupees!",
    "According to a \u2018Newswire\u2019 report.  Hambantota district MP  Chanaka thanked the Prime Minister for  addressing what he described as one of the major allegations made against investors in Sri Lanka.",
    "He noted that the project was commonly referred to as \u201cChichi\u2019s rocket\u201d. \u201cThis is best known as Chichi\u2019s rocket, rather than Supreme Sat in Sri Lanka. The allegation was that USD 300 million was invested in this and then the project disappeared,\u201d  Chanaka said.",
    "\u201cBut now the Prime Minister has clarified that not a single Sri Lankan rupee was invested and that the project has generated substantial annual income and foreign direct investment,\u201d Chanaka said.",
    "He also referred to  earlier accusations by NPP members, who alleged  the project was a personal venture  for the  the sons of aformer president. He questioned whether such allegations made under parliamentary privilege were endorsed  by the Prime Minister.",
    "In response, Prime Minister Amarasuriya clarified that her statements were based solely on BOI data.\u201cI have not given any personal analysis on whether the project was large or small. This matter was publicly discussed for different reasons. If there are further questions on that, I can respond separately. But this is the factual information based on the official reports. Whether it is good or bad will be determined by the public,\u201d she said.",
    "The full impact and implications of the Prime minister\u2019s reply began to sink in after MP Chanaka\u2019s \u201cthankful\u201dresponse to the Prime Minister\u2019s reply.   It appeared that the Prime Minister had provided a clean chit to the SupremeSAT project and cleared  former President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s third son Rohitha Rajapaksa  known as \u201cChichi\u201dof any wrong doing regarding the project.",
    "Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been accused of  many instances of corruption,nepotism and abuse of power by his political detractors. Among these was the SupremeSAT project. According to various media reports published over the years, the project involved Rohitha Rajapaksa aka Chichi.",
    "On 23 May 2012, a Supreme SAT project was registered with the BOI in Sri Lanka. The stated investment was 1,828 billion rupees. Ownership of  the project was with Supreme Global Holdings (80%) and Supreme SL Investment (20%). The driving force behind the project  was an entrepreneur named  R. M. Manivannan who owned  Supreme Global Holdings, along with  two others, Jaya Sudhir and Alberto de Simone.",
    "Manivannan appointed Rohitha \u201cChichi\u201d Rajapaksa as chief technical director of SupremeSAT. He was  issued  shares through Dycer International, a company reportedly   owned by Rohitha Rajapaksa himself. There were media reports that the project envisaging  the launching of a Sri Lankan satellite  was a brainchild of Rohitha.",
    "Those reports were incorrect. SupremeSAT-1\u201d was not a separate Sri Lankan spacecraft. It was capacity leased on ChinaSat-12 (which had earlier been ordered as Apstar-7B). The leased capacity was then co-branded/marketed as \u201cSupremeSAT-1.\u201d  Nevertheless it was popularly referred to as \u201cChichi\u2019s rocket\u201d.",
    "This was because of Rohitha Rajapaksa\u2019s avowed interest  and desire to be an astronaut in outer space. Unlike his elder brothers Namal and Yoshitha, the third son  had different interests. He was somewhat romantic too. When he proposed marriage to his girl friend of nine years,  the young man travelled from Tangalle to Tanzania.Rohitha climbed  to the top of Africa\u2019s tallest mountain  Kilimanjaro with his significant other Tatyana Lee and proposed on bended knee. Elder brother Namal was present to record the event.",
    "Despite all the fanfare and publicity nothing much was heard about SupremeSAT dubbed as Chichi\u2019s rocket. It became a humorous topic. However opposition political parties utilised it as another stick to beat Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was accused  of squandering millions of dollars to fulfill the whimsical  impulses and fanciful desires of his youngest son.  It was a three in one allegation namely corruption, abuse of power and nepotism. The JVP was at the forefront, tearing into the Rajapaksas citing Chichi\u2019s rocket. For more than a decade the JVP had  derived much propaganda mileage by attacking the Rajapaksa regimes over the Chichi rocket issue.",
    "Former State Minister Janaka Wakkumbura expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister for correcting an allegation levelled against the Rajapaksa family for over a decade.  According to newspaper reports ,he made these remarks  at a media briefing held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Headquarters on August 7",
    "He said that during the last election campaign, claims were made that USD 323 million \u2014 an amount equal to the first instalment Sri Lanka received from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 had been spent to launch a rocket for the son of a Rajapaksa, and that the rocket was never found.",
    "Wakkumbura noted that the Prime Minister had clearly and effectively explained in Parliament that not a single cent from the Government was spent on the project, and that another company had funded it.",
    "Premier  Harini\u2019s response to what -with the wisdom of hindsight \u2013 seemed a loaded question  had delivered a fateful  and possibly fatal  blow to that charge. According to the Prime Minister , the Sri Lankan Govt had not invested even a rupee in the project The Country had not suffered any financiall loss. Moreover the project had earned more than 39 billion rupees in revenue. In one shot, Father Mahinda and son Rohitha had been absolved of any \u201csin\u201d.There must surely have been much mirth and merriment in Medamulana with Chanaka being toasted many times.",
    "In stark contrast,  the \u201cMalimawa\u201dcamp was down in the doldrums. The compass seemed to have lost direction.  After years of propaganda unleashed by the JVP that the Chichi rocket affair was a colossal fraud, the Prime minister was  now saying the opposite. The JVP led NPP Govt was looking foolish and was vulnerable to charges of having engaged false propaganda.",
    "The JVP-NPP Govt was totally flustered.It is reliably leant that several meetings were held among the top rungers in Pelawatte and elsewhere. It soon became obvious that Harini   had blundered and blundered  badly. She had not smelt a rat when she had been asked to address the question instead of the finance minister.",
    "Furthermore  The Chichi rocket issue had been an embarrassment for the Rajapaksas for many years. They had steered clear of making references to it for several years.Now a Rajapaksa loyalist DV Chanaka was asking a pointed question about it in Parliament. Why re-open a forgotten  matter now? The PM in Particular and the Govt in general had been caught napping.",
    "In a serious lapse of judgement ,Dr.Harini Amarasuriya had accepted the data provided by the BOI and not  vetted it at all. Furthermore she  mixed up million with billion as stated in the BOI data. Where it should be billion she said million and where it should be million she said billion. She was not  astute enough  to realise that there was  something wrong with the figures even as she was reading it. It was truly a major gaffe.",
    "Moreover there were serious questions over the loyalty,integrity   and  efficiency of a few  officials in the Prime minister\u2019s office, finance ministry and board of investment. In the case of this  particular question, the  customary procedure would have been for the Prime minister\u2019s secretary to refer it to the Finance ministry secretary who would have directed it to the BOI.  The BOI would have supplied  details of the  sought information back to the Finance ministry. Thereafter a high official of the Finance ministry would scrutinise and verify the data before forwarding it to the Prime Minister\u2019s office(PMO). This in turn would be  checked  by officials at the PMO before being given to the PM.",
    "Given these procedures, it is indeed a \u201cmystery\u201d as to how the Prime minister was  misinformed.  Was it due to her  personal carelessness in not vetting it herself or was it a case of misdirecting herself in good faith? There is also the possibility of political sabotage A good number of bureaucrats in top positions are Rajapaksa appointed oyalists. Their bona fides  are still suspect.  A rumour floating around is that a BOI official appointed during the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Govt was allegedly  responsible for deliberately misleading the PM.Under the present circumstances an intensive inquiry is required to elicit the truth.",
    "Meanwhile the  damage had been done and some urgent damage control was imperative . It is learnt reliably that a contrite Harini was prepared to resign but  the offer was rejected. In  a rare display of solidarity, the JVP and NPP upper echelons closed ranks and rallied behind Harini. AKD, Tilvin, Bimal and Vijitha were strongly supportive of her.",
    "It was then decided that Prime Minister Amarasuriya should issue a retracting statement in Parliament.  It would contradict what she  had said earlier but would set the record straight.  Harini understood and approved the need for damage control but was reluctant  to make the statement herself due to the potential  embarrassment it was likely to  cause her. This position was understood and accepted by the JVP bigwigs.",
    "The  procedure then would have been for the Leader of the House Bimal Rathnayake to make the statement on behalf of the Prime Minister. But there was a hitch. Since there had been much speculation in the media about the \u201crivalry\u201dbetween Harini and Bimal, the latter was reluctant to deliver the statement. Bimal to his credit did not want to be  portrayed as one who backstabbed Harini. This stance too was understood and accepted.",
    "The problem was resolved by JVP secretary -general and father figure , Tilvin Silva known as \u201cTilvin Aiya\u201d. He suggested that Trade, Cmmerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development minister Wasantha Samarasinghe should  deliver the retracting statement. As is well known the ebullient Wasantha is a combative personality .It was agreed that Wasantha  would make the  statement in Parliament and not   Harini or Bimal.",
    "Had Harini or Bimal made the retracting statement it would have been the official Govt position. The problem here was that the previous statement by Harini was based on official BOI figures. There was no other official figures from BOI contradicting the earlier figures . On what basis then could H=the PM or leader of the House made a statement refuting the previous one. This is where Wasantha fitted the bill. His unorthodox statement was not officially a Govt statement. Yet his maverick styled statement was  a useful instrument of  damage control.",
    "The JVP\u2019s Wasantha Samarasinghe  made his statement in Parliament  on August 7th . According to newspaper reports, Wasantha   contradicted the Prime minister on many counts but asserted that she hd been misled by the BOI. Accusing the BOI  of providing wrong information to the Prime Minister. Wasantha stated  the income  generated  was only Rs. 343.9  million not 343.9  Billion. \u201cAccording to our findings, the total revenue earned by SupremeSAT is only Rs 343 million over all these years\u2014not the billions that were presented,\u201d he said.",
    "According to media reports,Wasantha Samarasinghe told Parliament the real figures were a fraction of what the Prime Minister had announced. The correct numbers  were-",
    "The total was  Rs 342 million, not Rs 343.9 billion. The discrepancy, Samarasinghe said, was due to a formatting error in which  decimal points had been misread as commas, multiplying modest sums into astronomical billions.",
    "Samarasinghe also clarified that the income figures referred to the company\u2019s general operations, not directly to the satellite itself \u2014 which, he noted, remains untraceable. He raised fresh questions about the project\u2019s finances, including the reported USD 320 million cost, possible Chinese bank loans, and the disappearance of Rs 12 billion in satellite-related assets from the company\u2019s accounts between 2012 and 2015.\u201cThis data should have been properly verified before being presented,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mistake lies with the officials who compiled the information.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere was a reported investment of Rs 12 billion, but it\u2019s unclear who funded it or where it went. If this money was used, it should be reflected in the company accounts. But the accounts don\u2019t show it. Why?\u201d he asked, adding that USD 320 million was said to have been spent on the satellite project, partially through Chinese bank loans, which now must be verified.",
    "Samarasinghe  also said  that while the satellite was said to have been launched from China in November 2012, there was no trace of it in space or in any international satellite records. \u201cWhere is the satellite? If it belongs to Sri Lanka, why can\u2019t it be traced?\u201d he queried.",
    "Wasantha Samarasinghe \u201crectified\u201dthe political damage done by the Prime minister\u2019s statement the previous day. The facts stated by the PM were  attributed to the BOI but Samarasinghe\u2019statement was not attributed to any particular source. His references were to the company accounts and the internet in general.",
    "Responding to Wasantha Samarasinghe\u2019s explanation that Harini Amarasuriya had read out misleading information provided by the BOI, DV  Chanaka had a pertinent query-  \u201cDoes Wasantha Samarasinghe think the Prime Minister merely parrots whatever she\u2019s given to read in Parliament?\u201d",
    "The contradictory parliamentary statements by Prime minister Harini and minister Wasantha have created the perception  that the JVP led NPP Government is deeply divided and that the minister has openly defied the PM. The concept of collective responsibility of a cabinet has also been raised . The reality however  is that the Govt is acting unitedly. Samarasinghe  made his statement with the approval and concurrence of his cabinet colleagues including the PM.",
    "While there are stresses and strains within the Government and party ranks, the  SupremeSAT incident has actually  promoted greater solidarity  in the Govt.At least for the time being! Whatever the feelings towards Harini, the JVP led NPP cannot afford to throw her to the wolves at this juncture. It is a fact that President AKD and PMK Harini are of great value to the party and Govt. It is noteworthy that Bimal Rathnayake himself told the media that the president and Prime minister are great \u201cassets\u201d.",
    "Besides this is not the time to jettison Harini even if some in the JVP hierarchy want to do so.  This is the time to demonstrate that all is well within the Govt which is firmly united.As such the president,party and Government will stand by Harini  at this critical moment. If the opposition parties misread the situation and  submit a motion of no confidence, it would  be roundly defeated.",
    "Though the opposition is trying to project the Harini fiasco as a serious issue, in actual terms it is only a storm in a tea cup. The efforts of the opposition and sections of the media to magnify the episode cannot succeed. Perhaps it would be a tempest in a tea pot!",
    "Moreover the current triumph of the SLPP and Rajapaksas may be quite ephemeral and even counter productive. It is quite apparent that the entire  DV  Chanaka question exercise needs to be probed further. It is important to ascertain as to how and why the BOI officials gave wrong info to the Prime minister. Were they  being \u201cincentivised\u201dby interested parties?",
    "Interestingly enough the buyant attitude displayed by the SLPP camp after Harini\u2019s statement has  evaporated after Wasantha\u2019s statement. Obviously Harini\u2019s  faux pas has neither negated nor invalidated  the original allegations about Chichi\u2019s rocket. There is also a very pertinent point. If indeed the SuperSAT roject was above board and was generating billions of funds, why did not the Rajapaksas or their political ions not uttered a word prior to Harini\u2019s statement about this? They could have made their critics cringe by revealing the details?",
    "Furthermore the JVP-NPP Govt will now have to  launch a fresh intensive inquiry into the whole Supreme SAT affair with special emphasis on the roles played by Rohitha and Manivannan. The source of the original funding of 12 Billion rupees has to be traced. It has to be ascertained as to whether tax has been paid  or not on the revenue allegedly generated so far.",
    "What s necessary  now is for the AKD Government to conduct a  two intensive inquiries. In the short term the  matter of the BOI Officials  allegedly misleading the PM Must be probed.The black sheep must be penalised. In the long term an inquiry must be launched into the entire SuoremeSAT episode and Chichi\u2019s roket affair.",
