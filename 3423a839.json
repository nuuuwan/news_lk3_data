  "original_body_lines": [
    "A Ukrainian official has accused Moscow of orchestrating the coup in Niger, referring to alleged involvement as a \u201cstandard Russian tactic\u201d.",
    "Last Wednesday, President Mohamed Bazoum and his democratically elected government were removed by military leaders in the seventh military coup the country has seen in less than three years.",
    "On Tuesday, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Russia was behind the shocking takeover.",
    "On the social media outlet X (formally known as Twitter), Podolyak wrote, \u201cIt is now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the so-called \u2018military coup\u2019 in Niger. It is a standard Russian tactic: to divert attention, seize the moment and expand the conflict.\u201d",
    "\u201cRussia has a global scenario for provoking instability to undermine the global security order,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIts time to draw the right conclusion: only the removal of [Russian President] Putin\u2019s clan and sending Russia to the political rebirth can guarantee the inviolability of rules and stability to the world.\u201d",
    "The Kremlin said on Monday that the situation in Niger was \u201ccause for serious concern\u201d after the coup that was condemned by much of the world but welcomed by Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has extensive interests in Africa.",
    "In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia called for all sides in Niger to show restraint, and for the fastest possible return to legal order.",
    "Russia\u2019s Wagner Group has not claimed responsibility for the coup but Prigozhin has hailed the military takeover.",
    "Prigozhin\u2019s fighters have played a significant role in many African states, to the dismay of the West, and most recently arrived in the Central African Republic (CAR) ahead of a constitutional referendum. (Al Jazeera)"
