  "original_body_lines": [
    "French President Emmanuel Macron is seeking his fifth prime minister in less than two years after opposition parties united to kick out centre-right Prime Minister Francois Bayrou over his unpopular plans for budget tightening.",
    "Bayrou, handed a 364-194 defeat in a parliamentary confidence vote on Monday, will officially hand in his resignation to Macron during Tuesday.",
    "Whoever Macron picks to succeed him will face the near impossible task of uniting parliament and finding ways to get a budget for next year adopted.",
    "Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu\u2019s name was among those circulating, with other options being to pick someone from the centre-left, or a technocrat.",
    "There are no rules governing who Macron should choose, or how fast. Macron, 47 and in office since 2017, will appoint his new prime minister in the next few days, his office said on Monday.",
    "The Socialists were among those saying it was their turn to govern. \u201cI would like it to be the left, the greens. We need to claim power,\u201d Socialist Party chief Olivier Faure told France Inter radio.",
    "The far-right National Rally meanwhile repeated its call for a snap parliamentary or presidential election - both of which Macron has so far ruled out. The president\u2019s decision last year to call a snap parliamentary election only resulted in a more fragmented parliament.",
    "Market reaction was relatively muted in early trading on Tuesday, with Bayrou\u2019s ousting already largely priced in. The next test will be Fitch\u2019s decision on France\u2019s sovereign rating on Friday.",
    "The country is also gearing up for \u201cLet\u2019s Block Everything\u201d anti-government protests on Wednesday, which have mushroomed on social media. The lack of centralized leadership among protesters means it is hard to assess how big or disruptive these will be.",
    "\u201cNow that the change of the prime minister is a done deal, they need to get rid of what\u2019s higher up ... that\u2019s a message for Macron,\u201d 61-year-old protester Alain Petit said at a so-called \u201cfarewell drink\u201d for Bayrou organised in Clermont-Ferrand, in central France, late on Monday.",
    "Other such \u201cfarewell drinks\u201d for Bayrou were organised in front of city halls across the country, with people there saying they were gearing up for Wednesday\u2019s protests.",
    "Labour unions have announced a day of strikes and protests on September 18."
