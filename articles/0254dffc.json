    "Speaking at the event, Miami Ad School Sri Lanka Founder and President Kandeban Balendran told the graduates, \u201cCreativity is your superpower. Use that to grow your organisation. Make a difference through your brands. As you venture out into the professional realm, remember that the business, advertising or marketing, it is not just about selling products or services. It is about telling stories, connecting with people and making a positive impact. In an age of information overload, your role as creative is more important than ever.\u201d",

    "\u201cEight years ago, when I was at Harvard, my personal project was launching an education venture. I reached out to the founders, Ron and Pippa, with a dream of launching Miami Ad School in Sri Lanka, in Colombo. Not just for Sri Lanka and Maldives, but for the entire region. Four years ago, in October 2020, Miami Ad School was born in Sri Lanka. And today we are here. Over 600 students participated in our programs with various programs from eleven different countries,\u201d Balendran noted.",
