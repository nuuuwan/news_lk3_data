We greatly appreciate the respect that Sri Lankans receive in the Maldives. Likewise, we value Maldivians who consider Sri Lanka their second home, whether they are studying in our schools and universities, seeking medical treatment, or enjoying our island\u2019s tourism and hospitality. They are not merely foreigners residing in each other\u2019s countries but bridges connecting our nations.",

We are pleased to see an increase in arrivals of Maldivian tourists in recent years. We invite Maldivian tourists to visit Sri Lanka to experience a second home.",
    "Your Excellency, as we look to the future, it is my belief that our two countries will advance closely, not just as friends but as partners united by a common vision and purpose. I am confident that this visit will pave the way for deeper cooperation, broader understanding and an even stronger friendship between our two nations.",
