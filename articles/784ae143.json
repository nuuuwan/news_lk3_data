    "The Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) has reached a major milestone, with its Advanced Analytical Services Laboratory receiving ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accreditation from the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB). This internationally recognised accreditation confirms the laboratory\u2019s technical competence to perform critical food safety tests required by both domestic and global markets.",
    "The SLINTEC is now officially accredited to conduct aflatoxin testing, phthalate detection, and nutritional analysis in line with front-of-pack labelling requirements. These are key tests that help agri-food producers meet the stringent food safety and regulatory standards both locally and in export markets such as the EU, US, and Middle East.",
    "\u201cThis accreditation allows us to offer the food industry a trusted local partner to meet international requirements without delay or prohibitive costs,\u201d said SLINTEC Interim CEO Prof. Saman Seneweera. \u201cWe are grateful for the support provided through the Accreditation Readiness Programme of the EU-funded BESPA-FOOD (Best Standardised Practices for Agri-Food) project, implemented by the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).\u201d",
    "The timing is significant. In 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s merchandise exports totalled $ 12.7 billion, with tea contributing $ 1.4 billion, spices, concentrates, and essential oils generating $ 462 million, and food and beverage exports adding $ 478 million. Many of these products fall under high-risk categories for contaminants such as aflatoxins, which are naturally occurring toxins in spices, grains, and nuts, and phthalates, which are closely regulated in food contact materials. Failing to comply with these standards can result in costly shipment rejections or loss of market access.",
    "Beyond compliance, the SLINTEC views this milestone as a step towards building a stronger innovation ecosystem for Sri Lanka\u2019s food industry. By offering fast turnaround times, competitive pricing, and internationally accepted results, the Institute is positioned to support manufacturers, exporters, and entrepreneurs at all stages, from product development to regulatory clearance.",
    "\u201cThis is a practical tool for competitiveness and a strategic step forward for the country\u2019s export ambitions,\u201d added Prof. Seneweera.",
    "As global demand grows for safe, high-quality food, the SLINTEC\u2019s accredited services will help ensure that Sri Lankan producers can meet market expectations and compete confidently on the world stage."
