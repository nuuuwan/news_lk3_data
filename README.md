Former MP Rajitha Senaratne offers unconditional support to the government to address national issues, particularly Tamil and Muslim rights. He criticizes JVP's past racist policies, linking them to civil war. Senaratne urges President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to focus on intelligent decision-making rather than populist politics.

We are ready to provide unconditional support for the government's journey to resolve the country's national problem by providing the rights of the Tamil Muslim people. Former parliamentarian Rajitha Senaratne said that if the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) had taken the policy of not going to be racist, there would be no blood flow in the country.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the new Democratic Front office in Colombo on Sunday (24).

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in his policy speech that in this country, which had been a blood flowed by racism, he would not be able to re -allow it.. Welcome to this claim of the president. The solution to the country's development is the solution to the nationalization.

The Blood River flowed in the country by the Revolution that launched the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1980. If they had adopted the stand against racism, the country would not have flowed the blood river. There will be no separatist war in the North.

### Is the Muslim minister's demand racist?

*2024-11-24 14:04:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199546) ¬∑ `ta`

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



The question of whether a Muslim minister's demand is racist stems from historical context. In Sri Lanka's political history, there were no Muslim ministers. The current situation involves Muslim MPs elected under the National People's Power. Some argue they may be unsuitable for the new regime. However, questioning their suitability isn't inherently racist, as it's based on performance rather than religion.

üü©

In the past, there are no Muslim ministers to tear down so we see those who call it the Muslim Minister. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked the people to vote for newcomers, saying that all those who have been in the past have not managed the country properly.. If so, are Muslim MPs elected on behalf of the National People's Power, but are they inappropriate for new regime change?If they are inappropriate, it is not the crime of Muslims to contest them as candidates.

### Far right eye breakthrough in Romania presidential vote

Romanians were voting Sunday in the first round of a presidential election amid a surge in inflation and fears over the war in neighbouring Ukraine that could favour far-right leader George Simion.

The vote kicks off two weeks of elections in the poor NATO member country, including a parliamentary vote and a December 8 presidential run-off.

Social democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is leading a field of 13 hopefuls in the polls, with about 25 percent, followed by AUR leader Simion on 15 to 19 percent.

Simion is targeting people like Rodica, a 69-year-old who was among the first to vote in Bucharest‚Äôs chilly sunshine. The pensioner, who would not give a family name, was afraid of the Ukraine war and wanted ‚Äúbetter living conditions and peace‚Äù.

The stakes are high in the race to replace President Klaus Iohannis, a liberal and staunch Ukraine ally, who has held the largely ceremonial post since 2014.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) states that there will be no revision of electricity tariffs for 2024, citing delays in the submission of necessary proposals by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

The PUCSL Corporate Communications Director, Jayanath Herath pointed out that the CEB submitted an initial set of tariff revision proposals at the end of September. However, the PUCSL deemed the proposed reductions insufficient and requested a revised submission by November 8.

Despite the initial deadline, the CEB sought multiple extensions, most recently requesting an additional two weeks after failing to meet the extended deadline of November 22. Consequently, the PUCSL has planned to grant an extension until December 6.

Even if the CEB submits the revised proposals on December 6, the PUCSL clarified that it would take six to eight weeks to review and finalize the tariff adjustments. As a result, any potential revisions to electricity tariffs will be postponed to 2025.

### The Need to submit an electronic tax return and its challenges

The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has decided that compliant taxpayers who submit their Return of Income for 2023-24 (01 April 2023 to 31 March 2024) can only do so electronically by submitting an e-return.

Whilst it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, no consideration has been given to the fact that such a move should be made in a phased manner. In typically cavalier fashion, the department‚Äôs mandarins want to go from zero to a hundred, forgetting that many individual taxpayers have no experience submitting tax returns, let alone e-returns. I assume many new taxpayers who have not previously submitted tax returns annually have been inducted into the tax net.

Cyril had a sharp sense of humour. On one occasion, while discussing the maintenance challenges faced by historic seaside hotels like Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) and GFH, he quipped, ‚ÄúChandana, GFH is only 130 years old!‚Äù

Cyril was a master of public relations, capable of crafting newsworthy stories and engaging with leading international journalists. He turned what might seem like eccentric behaviour into captivating narratives for the media. His knack for creating publicity was not accidental but meticulously orchestrated, a lesson I was fortunate to learn first-hand.
