    "Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar\u2019s recent address at the FAITH Tourism Conclave in India was more than a promotion of travel and hospitality \u2013 it was a masterclass in soft power, national resilience, and strategic messaging.",
    "While his speech centred on India\u2019s tourism revival, the underlying themes: diaspora engagement, cultural pride, and navigating global turbulence hold profound relevance for Sri Lanka as it seeks to rebuild its own tourism sector amid economic and geopolitical challenges.",
    "In this context. The Island Financial Review spoke to a veteran in the Sri Lanka tourism sector to inquire how he perceived the high-calibre Indian minister\u2019s views on tourism and their relevance to Sri Lanka Tourism. The following are some excerpts from the interview.",
    "\u201cJaishankar framed tourism not merely as an economic activity but as a tool for shaping India\u2019s global identity. His emphasis on UNESCO heritage sites from the Hoysala temples to Gujarat\u2019s Statue of Unity mirrors Sri Lanka\u2019s own treasures: Sigiriya, Galle Fort, and Kandy\u2019s cultural triangle. Yet, India\u2019s systematic branding of intangible heritage \u2013 yoga, Kumbh Mela, even Bollywood nostalgia offers a blueprint. Sri Lanka, too, could amplify its festivals like Esala Perahera, Thai Pongal and crafts like mask-making, handlooms as part of a curated \u2018living heritage\u2019 experience.\u201d",
    "\u201cCrucially, Jaishankar highlighted the diaspora\u2019s role in tourism, urging overseas Indians to \u2018bring friends\u2019 home. Sri Lanka\u2019s diaspora, which is also significant and influential, could be leveraged similarly. Imagine targeted campaigns inviting Sri Lankans abroad to explore homestays in Jaffna or surf camps in Arugam Bay \u2013 blending emotional homecoming with sustainable tourism.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe noted that India\u2019s tourism boom , stems from infrastructure leaps: doubled airports, revamped railways, and initiatives like affordable regional flights and pilgrimage circuits. Sri Lanka\u2019s post-crisis recovery demands parallel strides \u2013 not just in highways and hotels but in decentralising tourism. Why not develop Trincomalee\u2019s beaches or Mannar\u2019s bird sanctuaries as alternatives to Colombo and the South?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Indian External Affairs Minister\u2019s praise for homestays and eco-tourism resonates deeply. Sri Lanka\u2019s community-based tourism \u2013 whether in Kandy\u2019s villages or the Knuckles range \u2013 could thrive with state support, blending livelihoods with conservation. Likewise, India\u2019s MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) push is instructive. Colombo\u2019s conference tourism potential could be enhanced with newly added infrastructure like City of Dreams \u2013 Cinnamon Life, positioning the city as a hub for South Asian business dialogues.\u201d",
    "\u201cJaishankar\u2019s acceptance of global volatility \u2013 from pandemic aftershocks to trade wars was striking. His solution: self-reliance, not as isolation but as resilience. For Sri Lanka, this echoes the need to diversify tourism markets beyond European arrivals and boost domestic travel, as India has done.\u201d",
    "\u201cEqually telling was his diplomatic choreography \u2013 hosting G20 events across India, from Kashmir to Kerala, and welcoming leaders like Macron in Jaipur. Sri Lanka, with its compact diversity, could adopt this \u2018whole nation\u2019 diplomacy. Imagine showcasing Trinco\u2019s port to Indian investors or Jaffna\u2019s revival to Tamil diaspora leaders \u2013 turning tourism into strategic storytelling.\u201d",
    "\u201cJaishankar\u2019s speech was a reminder that tourism is more than revenue \u2013 it\u2019s identity, unity, and geopolitical leverage. Sri Lanka, at a crossroads, must heed these lessons. As the Indian minister rightly said, \u2018Tourism connects the world to a nation, and the nation to itself.\u2019 For Sri Lanka, that connection could be the key to revival,\u201d he said.",
    "In conclusion, the Sri Lankan tourism veteran listed out key takeaways from Jaishankar\u2019s speech:",
    "1. Brand the intangible: Celebrate culture, food, crafts, and local festivals.",
    "2. Engage the diaspora: Make them ambassadors for \u2018come home, bring friends\u2019 campaigns.",
    "3. Decentralise growth: Invest in rural tourism, homestays, and eco-adventures.",
    "4. Diplomatic storytelling: Use tourism to reframe Sri Lanka\u2019s global narrative \u2013 resilient, diverse, open.",
