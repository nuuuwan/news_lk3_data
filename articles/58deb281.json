    "Nadun Chinthaka Wickramaratne, also known as \u201cHarak Kata\u201d, a prominent underworld figure allegedly linked to large-scale drug trafficking, is to remain in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) until the conclusion of legal proceedings, as per a detention order issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, the Attorney General informed the Colombo High Court today (08).",
    "This submission was presented by Senior State Counsel Sajith Bandara, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, during today\u2019s hearing before High Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "During a previous hearing, the State Counsel informed court that after the expiry of the initial detention order, the suspect would be produced in remand custody. However, due to security concerns, the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence has decided to extend his detention under the PTA.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Jaliya Samarasinghe, appearing for the suspect, strongly objected to the decision, pointing out that his client has already been held in detention for nearly two years. He argued that instead of continuing under PTA detention, the suspect should be placed in judicial remand custody.",
    "Despite the objections, court was informed that \u201cHarak Kata\u201d will continue to be held under the custody of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) at the Old Tangalle Prison, in line with the Defence Secretary\u2019s order.",
    "\u201cHarak Kata\u201d was presented before court via Zoom, and the case has been postponed to September 24, for further proceedings.",
