    "Secures most votes; a total of 17,295, winning 15 seats out of 29 up for grabs",
    "Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa claims SJB has struggled to reorganise and strengthen support, even for a small election, resulting in fewer seats",
    "Stresses while NPP expects better competition, SJB will likely lose seats rather than gain in upcoming Parliamentary poll",
    "Says SJB\u2019s criticisms are tactic to downplay defeat in recent elections",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Kalutara district leader Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa has criticised the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) for its comments following the recent Pradeshiya Sabha election, where the SJB suggested that the results indicate a decline in support for the NPP.",
    "The election, held on Saturday, saw the NPP secure the most votes \u2013 a total of 17,295 \u2013 winning 15 seats out of 29 up for grabs. The SJB received 7,924 votes and gained six seats.",
    "In response to media queries, Jayatissa argued that the SJB has struggled to reorganise and strengthen its support, even for smaller elections, resulting in fewer seats. He highlighted internal conflicts within the SJB and questions about leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s capabilities.",
    "\u201cWe expect stronger competition from the runner-up party in the upcoming Parliamentary election, but if they continue like this, they risk losing seats from their last showing,\u201d Jayatissa remarked.",
    "He added that the SJB is now attempting to downplay its defeat at the Presidential election.",
    "\u201cThe NPP will continue to gain support in the Parliamentary election. Those who didn\u2019t vote or chose other parties will now turn to the NPP after seeing President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s actions as a leader and our approach to governance,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayatissa also suggested that Sri Lanka does not need a strong Opposition as claimed by the SJB, as even 10 MPs can fulfil opposition responsibilities effectively. \u201cTherefore, the people are waiting to vote in order to form a strong Government,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) garnered 3,597 votes and won three seats, while the People\u2019s Alliance received 2,612 votes, securing two seats at the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election."
