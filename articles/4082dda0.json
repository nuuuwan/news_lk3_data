    "Naturalz introduced a wide variety of high-quality Sri Lankan products, including fresh fruit pulps, spices, bottled fresh fruits, condiments, and a signature range of ice creams crafted from Sri Lankan fresh fruit pulp. The brand also facilitates the import of perishable items from Sri Lanka to the UAE, including fresh fruits, vegetables, and king coconut, as well as processed foods such as jackfruit.",
    "The ice cream range made exclusively with Sri Lankan fruit pulp, manufactured at a MENA region\u2019s 100% solar powered facility in Sharjah. This unique production facility adheres to the highest standards of sustainability and ensures that all ice cream products are free from preservatives and additives.",
    "Addressing the launch, Consul General Alexi Gunasekera emphasised the importance of diversifying Sri Lanka\u2019s export offerings through value-added products rather than relying solely on traditional exports and raw materials.",
    "He highlighted that initiatives like Naturalz align with inclusive development, supporting the value chain from farm to consumer. The Consul General also encouraged Sri Lankan professionals who are residing in the UAE to explore similar partnerships that foster mutual growth and strengthen economic ties between Sri Lanka and the UAE thus supporting the government\u2019s economic development initiative.",
    "Attendees of the launch event enjoyed the opportunity to taste authentic Sri Lankan flavours, including fresh king coconut and other fruit juices, desserts made up of Sri Lankan fruit pulps, and other delicacies such as cutlet, pizza, pastry made with processed jackfruit."
