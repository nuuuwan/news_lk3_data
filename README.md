Talks to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas are 90% complete, but key issues remain that need to be bridged, a senior Palestinian official involved in the talks told the BBC.

One of the main sticking points is the continued Israeli military presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategically important strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt.

The Palestinian official shared details of the discussions being held in Doha which include the potential creation of a buffer zone several kilometres wide along the length of IsraelтАЩs border with Gaza.

Israel would retain a military presence within this area, the official said.

With these issues resolved, a three-stage ceasefire could be agreed within days, they added.

The deal would include an exchange of 20 Palestinian prisoners for every female soldier released in the first of three stages of the ceasefire.

### Ministry assures quality of MOP fertilizer donated by Russia

*2024-12-22 10:43:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104413/ministry-assures-quality-of-mop-fertilizer-donated-by-russia) ┬╖ `en`

The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands, and Irrigation has issued a statement assuring the quality of the Muriate of Potash (MOP) fertilizer stock donated by a Russian state-owned company.

The statement addresses concerns raised by farmers and farmer organizations regarding the color of the fertilizer.

After analyzing the composition of the imported stock and verifying other standards, it has been confirmed that the fertilizer meets the required quality standards.

The ministry explained that the color of the fertilizer is influenced by the mineral salts in the deposit. Specifically, the presence of iron oxide gives the fertilizer a red color, while its absence results in a white color. The variation in color does not affect the fertilizerтАЩs functionality and provide the same amount of potassium, it said.

This clarification is based on findings from soil scientist Renuka de Silva, whose report confirmed that the fertilizer is safe and effective for use.

### Dynasties of Deceit: The PhilippinesтАЩ Curse

*2024-12-22 02:52:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dynasties-of-deceit-the-philippines-curse/) ┬╖ `en`

The 1987 Philippine Constitution, crafted in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution, was supposed to mark the dawn of a new democratic era. The ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., after decades of corruption, repression, and dynastic rule, was a victory for the Filipino people, or so they were told. Yet, the Constitution, supposedly a tool for dismantling the oppressive old order, contains a glaring, unimplemented clause: Article II, Section 26, which bans political dynasties. Nearly four decades later, this promise remains a cruel joke, the prohibition nothing more than a symbol of a nation shackled by its own feudal past. Political dynasties thrive unabated, and the Philippines remains trapped in a cycle of oligarchy, where power is passed down like a family heirloom, not earned through democratic means.

I first met Ronnie de Mel (1925-2024) less than six months before his passing. At the time, he was 98 years old and confined to a wheelchair, yet his memory and sharp intellect were as formidable as ever. The purpose of our initial meeting was to interview him for information about another former politician with whom he had worked somewhat closely in the legislature. De Mel hailed from a different eraтАФthree or perhaps four generations before mine. Despite the age gap, his critical thinking and incisive responses often made more sense than those of many of his successors. In his most recent book Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha commented de Mel was тАЬтАжintellectually head and shoulders above all subsequent Finance MinistersтАЭ. It is no exaggeration to say that de Mel was one of the architects of Sri LankaтАЩs Open Economy, introduced in 1977.

### Sri Pada тАУ certainties, myths, memories

The mountain rises from its foothills grown commercially with tea, and soars as a conical shaped single rock whose peak now has been flattened to accommodate viewing areas and buildings, including a temple where the monks in charge live. It is under the religious purview of the Saman Devale in Ratnapura. Needless to mention is the fact that its fame is due to the footprint at the very summit, gold painted.

I need now to recount my sailing adventures, or shall we say, misadventures. Although I had never sailed before, I did not think twice before I shoved off on my own. On my first effort, with the wind at my back, I unfurled my sails in goose-wing style and was soon hurtling along at a whistling pace. I cannot describe the exhilaration of being one with the water and the wind, with the wind at my back and the gurgle of water in my wake. After about two hours, I reached the other side of the lake near Trevignano, just as the sun was setting.
