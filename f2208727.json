    "When the Tigers Shot Down the Lionair Flight 602 in the Mannar Sea-PART TWO",
    "The focus of this two-part article  is the tragic plight of  Lionair 602  flight twenty-five  years ago.  The first part of this article published last week related how the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) shot down an Antonov 24 carrying 48 passengers and 7 crew on 29 September 1998. This  second and final part will describe the  prevailing circumstances before and after  the downing of Flight 602 in the seas off Mannar coast by the LTTE known widely as the tigers.The tragic incident of 1998 occurred during the long war between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE ended in May 2009.",
    "As stated earlier  the Sri Lankan Army  had re- captured Jaffna through \u201cOperation Riviresa\u201d in 1995-96.  Earlier the LTTE had been in control of the area. Even though  the Jaffna  peninsula  was controlled by the state, Jaffna remained  inaccessible by land from the rest of the country as the LTTE continued to control a major portion of the northern mainland, known as  the Wanni. Transport to and from the Jaffna peninsula was possible only by air or sea.",
    "Civilians were  earlier flown to and from Jaffna  in Air Force flights, for a fee. From August 1996, civilian air  transport was handed over to Lion Airlines, a private airline. The airline, which enjoyed a monopoly in this area, immediately increased the fare to almost double the earlier rate. Operating flights from Colombo to Jaffna and back was highly lucrative. The demand for transport to Jaffna was tremendous and there was always a long waiting list. Subsequently, a second private airline, \u201cMonara\u201d, was allowed to operate flights to Jaffna.",
    "The LTTE was then  in possession of  anti-aircraft missiles. The tigers had  from 1996 onwards brought down a few  Sri Lankan Air Force planes and helicopters by firing surface to air , SAM-7 missiles. As such SLAF aircraft  usually flew far out to the sea from Palaly and proceeded towards Colombo.",
    "When civilan flights  between Jaffna and Colombo commenced, the  planes were asked to observe the same safe routes in the interests of civilian passenger safety. This rule however was frequently observed in the breach by the airlines concerned.",
    "In a bid to cut down on fuel costs and reduce flying time, the passenger planes  regularly deviated from the safe route and flew  by the shorter route hugging the northern coast.  According to the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna)  report, this was known to Flight Control at Palaly and the Defence Ministry had been directly told about it. But no effective action was taken.",
    "As stated earlier  the Sri Lankan Govt began adopting in 1997  the controversial practice of mingling service personnel with civilian passengers aboard Lionair and Monara  flights. Sometimes the planes were chartered exclusively to transport troops and there were instances of passengers being offloaded at the last minute. This practice of mixing security personnel with civilian passengers was certainly a violation of the international humanitarian law, in spirit though not in letter.",
    "After awhile , the  LTTE began warning the Airlines concerned not to  carry security personnel on board or charter civilian planes to the armed forces. These warnings went unheeded. Thereafter the LTTE began to issue  dire threats. Again they were ignored. Although the LTTE had relocated en masse to the Wanni after \u201cOperation Riviresa\u201d, it continued to maintain a  clandestine presence in the peninsula with a local  \u201cheadquarters\u201d in Pungudutheevu.",
    "According to the UTHR (J) ,   the LTTE\u2019s warning to the airlines not to charter aircraft to the security forces had largely been  downplayed and suppressed by the Govt t and the airlines. The public was not apprised of the seriousness of the situation. No measures were  reportedly taken to enforce adherence to  secure routes.",
    "It is against this backdrop that the September 29 tragedy occurred. Here is a brief description of  the  events that preceded  the attack on the Lionair plane.",
    "The LTTE  sent letters dated August 9, 1998, to both Lion and Monara that they should stop allowing their planes being used to ferry security personnel to and from Jaffna. These were disregarded. The subject heading of the letters was\u201d notice of attack\u201d.",
    "Then on September 13th 1998 , a second letter on the letterhead of the Thamil Eelam Administrative Service, signed by Thooyavan, the Jaffna district leader of the LTTE, was delivered.The letter said as follows-",
    ": \u201cWe have already sent you a letter regarding the conduct of the airlines. You have not taken any action so far. On the contrary you have continued to cooperate with the armed forces.Therefore, as soon as you see this letter, please contact your management  and ask them to temporarily halt the services until further notice. If instead you continue the air service  and an aircraft is attacked resulting in danger to the Tamil people you must take full responsibility and would also have to take the due punishment administered by ourselves. Any aircraft flying after September 15 would be subject to our attack.  While informing  you of this with a heavy heart we are also informing  the people through leaflets\u201d",
    "On  17 September 1998 , Monara suspended its laffina flights. The EPRLF issued a statement on  the following day (September 18) criticising the LTTE for this disruption.",
    "On September 23, the Lion Airlines manager in Jaffna received a letter from the LTTE, which asked him to quit the post. He promptly did so.",
    "On September 24, another letter from the LTTE, signed by the chief of its political wing, Manimaran, was delivered to  the Tamil daily published in Jaffna Uthayan. Titled \u201cA request to the people\u201d, it was a warning and an appeal to the people to stop flying.",
    "Although the LTTE wanted it to be published prominently , the prevailing media  censorship  in force then prevented the paper from doing so.  Had the paper been allowed to do so by the authorities a very large number of civilians in Jaffna would have been made aware of the perilous situation. They may have been wary or cautious about flying to and from Jaffna.",
    "Later on,  handwritten posters, asking people to avoid air travel, appeared at several public places, with the caption, \u201cA warning to the common people \u201d. Letters warning against air travel were sent also to the  Jaffna University, the Traders Association and some schools.",
    "Another leaflet in Tamil under the heading \u201cA request to the people of the Jaffna peninsula who are subject to military oppression,\u201d issued by the LTTE\u2019S political wing, was  circulated in Jaffna. A paragraph of it stated  as follows:",
    "\u201cIn the guise of opening a road to Jaffna for the people, or of providing transportation for them, the Army is doing things to maximise its own interests. Under the pretext of running an air service for the people of the peninsula it is not only squeezing a great deal of money out of them but is using these services to fulfil its military aims\u2026. for this reason banning air travel and taking action against those defying this ban have become unavoidable. Therefore we inform those who travel by air that it would be safer for them in coming times to avoid air travel and to travel by sea..\u201d",
    "In the context of these threats and warnings by the LTTE being publicised,  it became crystal clear to many  Jaffna Tamils who were aware of the LTTE\u2019s warnings that it was the LTTE that was responsible for the shooting down of the plane. If the censorship had not circumscribed the  Tamil newspaper  Uthayan,more people would have known of the LTTE\u2019s warning and perhaps avoided air travel.",
    "Furthermore  it was apparent that  Lion Airlines itself had shown a callous disregard and lack of concern for the safety of both the passengers and the crew. The airline had  not  bother to warn the public of these developments despite the serious nature of the LTTE\u2019s threats.",
    "The  then Government too displayed a serious lack of concern for the people. It further hurt Tamil sentiment by not expressing one word of sympathy for the victims of the tragedy. There was also a visible lack of cooperation with the people in their efforts to recover the bodies of the passengers. The attitudes of both the state and the airline deserved condemnation.",
    "This  criticism of the Govt and Airline does not absolve the LTTE of the blame and responsibility for this horrendous tragedy. That it did warn the airines concerned is evident  but this fact cannot help condone the heinous nature of its crime against humanity, that too of a section with which it claims ethnic kinship.",
    "With the wisdom of hindsight, It became known  that the LTTE was in possession of some anti-aircraft missiles with a higher capability and  range compared to the ones  used earlier. Unlike the shoulder- fired ones with a limited range, these missiles were  capable of targeting planes flying at a high altitude, such as the AN 24.",
    "Moreover,  the firing of these missiles may have required a static platform. Using the St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Iranaitheevu  was ideal for this. Also the facts that the firing was from within LTTE territory and the plane had not fallen outside LTTE-controlled area enabled the LTTE to hush up the matter at that time.",
    "The most ominous indication that the LTTE was indeed responsible for the shooting down of the plane was the total silence it maintained over the incident. It neither denied its involvement nor accepted responsibility for bringing the plane down. Its news releases and broadcasts refrained from making any mention about the incident.",
    "If the LTTE had not   been responsible for the shooting down of the plane, that organisation and its propagandists would have gone to town condemning the Government for it. But the fact that it kept quiet indicated its culpability.",
    "For obvious reasons, the LTTE could not claim credit openly for shooting down a civilian plane carrying Tamil passengers. At the same time, it did not want to disclaim responsibility either. If it had done so, Tamils may  have continued to keep flying and the air service could  have continued.",
    "The Government and the airline concerned could have exploited the incident to gain propaganda mileage. But again,because of their own \u201cfailures\u201d in discharging their responsibilities, neither could do so. Moreover, the censorship that was in force helped black out the incidents.",
    "Whatever the reasons for the  visible lack of concern then , it  only helped alienate the Tamil minority further from the state then .",
    "Fifteen years after the incident  the Sri Lankan navy in May 2013  was able to salvage  the wreckage of the ill-fated plane in the Mannar gulf near Inranaitheevu. A team of 80 Navy frogmen recovered six big parts of the plane, 22  items of clothing and the bones of about 20 persons. The  navy had been informed of the wrecked plane\u2019s location by the Terrorism Investigation Division . The TID  claimed to have  obtained details from an LTTE cadre in TID custody.",
    "The University Teachers for Human Rights, in their  1998 report, drew  attention to international incidents where civilian flights have been shot at. The shooting down of a Korean Airlines aircraft by the Soviet Union and an Iranian Airways aircraft by the United States Navy over the Persian Gulf were some incidents highlighted. There was also a reference to an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) plane, being shot down deliberately by the Nigerian armed forces in 1969 during the Biafra secession war.",
    "What the UTHR  report stated in this context on the shooting down of civilian Flight 602 from Jaffna suffices for the moment as a brief epitaph on the human tragedy. The report said:",
    "\u201c The Lion Air disaster is unprecedented. This would be the first time a secessionist group or state power had shot down from the air deliberately and calculatedly an aircraft carrying its own civilians. Shooting down a civilian aircraft becomes big news because it is abhorrent. The victims are totally helpless, bereft of any means to save themselves.\u201d",
