    "In a letter dated Sep 17 to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Hun Manet said Thai forces had \u201cwidened the conflict zone by erecting barbed wire and barricades\u201d, and \u201cforcibly\u201d evicted Cambodian civilians from their \u201clong-settled lands\u201d in two border villages in northwestern Banteay Meanchey province since last month.",
    "\u201cTwenty-five families have already been blocked from their homes and fields,\u201d Hun Manet wrote, adding that a Thai military spokesperson had threatened more evictions, \u201cpotentially affecting hundreds of households comprised of about a thousand inhabitants\u201d.",
    "Thai army spokesperson Winthai Suvaree said in a statement on Thursday that the Cambodian civilians involved in the violent incident the day before had \u201cdeliberately and illegally occupied Thai territory for an extended period\u201d.",

    "Video released by the Thai military late Wednesday showed Thai security forces firing tear gas at several Cambodians, some of who flung long sticks towards Thai authorities and tried to remove barbed wire.",
    "In his letter, Hun Manet told the UN chief that the Thai military had \u201can intention of using forces to seize territory at 17 other locations\u201d along the shared border.",

    "July\u2019s military clashes between Cambodia and Thailand were their deadliest in decades, with 300,000 people also forced to flee their homes along the border."
