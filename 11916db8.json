    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) enjoys \u201cgreat demand\u201d from potential presidential candidates, and the party will have to take a call on working with incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, MP Namal Rajapaksa said.",
    "Speaking to reporters on Thursday December 07, Rajapaksa claimed several names have come up concerning the SLPP\u2019s candidate at next year\u2019s presidential election.",
    "\u201cThere is great demand: entrepreneurs, businessmen, politicians, are all there. There are presidents too, ready to come forward with our party,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOut of all these people, we will put forward on behalf of our party the candidate that can take the country forward while stabilising the economy,\u201d he added.",
    "Commenting on continued support for President Wickremesinghe, Rajapaksa said the while SLPP at present works with the former in the present government, the party will have to decide whether that relationship continues going forward.",
    "\u201cThe matter of whether we work with the United National Party (UNP) in the future \u2013 this is not a politics dependent on individuals; the SLPP is a party. We will talk as a party with other parties, but no discussions will be held centred around individuals,\u201d he said.",
    "Rajapaksa noted that Wickremesinghe was the only member of parliament representing the UNP at the time of his election by parliament following the resignation of his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa .",
    "\u201cIf we are to collaborate with the UNP in the future, we\u2019ll have to discuss that. Once the party has decided on that, we can get a start on those discussions. Today, we work with the president in the present government,\u201d he said.",
    "Last month, when asked to comment on President Wickremesinghe\u2019s 2024 budget, MP Rajapkasa sounded rather sceptical of the president\u2019s ambitions for turning the crisis-hit economy around.",
    "\u201cWe must study the budget. He had presented a lot of these proposals in last year\u2019s budget too. They don\u2019t seem to have been implemented,\u201d Namal Rajapaksa said, speaking to reporters after the budget presentation Monday November 13 afternoon.",
    "Rajapaksa\u2019s father and leader of the SLPP former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, however, spoke in favour of Wickremesinghe\u2019s budget.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cforward-looking\u201d 2024 budget will instill fiscal discipline: MRSee more",
    "While not without its shortcomings, the older Rajapaksa said, the 2024 budget is a forward-looking one that aims to ensure fiscal discipline and put Sri Lanka on the path to recovery. (Colombo/Dec07/2023)"
