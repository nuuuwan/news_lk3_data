    "In a significant development, Alliance Air has commenced daily commercial flights between Chennai and Sri Lanka\u2019s Jaffna city, taking travel and trade between the two countries to new heights.",
    "The increased frequency of flights comes as a welcome move, aiming to bolster connectivity between Chennai and the Tamil-dominated Jaffna city.",

    "Starting from Sunday, the Jaffna International Airport (JIA) welcomed the inaugural flight from Chennai, marking the beginning of daily flights on this route.",
    "Confirming this milestone, Chief Airport Manager Aruna Rajapaksa stated that the first flight arrived in Jaffna at 11:30 am. This increased frequency will provide passengers with greater convenience and flexibility for their travel plans.",
