Olga, MoWCA Additional Secretary Nilmini Herath, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka Resident Representative Azusa Kubota, and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Sri Lanka Country Representative Kunle Adeniyi.",
    "Under the leadership of the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, UNDP and UNFPA Sri Lanka over the past three years have provided the technical expertise required to formulate this National Action Plan with the invaluable support of the Kingdom of Norway and with the Government of Canada\u2019s support in operationalising the NAP through the \u2018Ensuring Justice for Victim-Survivors of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) in Sri Lanka\u2019 joint project.",
    "During the process of formulation, key findings from the implementation and subsequent evaluation of the First National Action Plan to address SGBV (2016-2020) were incorporated. The second National Action Plan to address SGBV (2024-2028) has 13 sectors and 5 sub-sectors belonging to the 13 ministries \u2013 ranging from Gender Empowerment, Economic Empowerment, Social Protection and Welfare, Justice and Law Reform, Labour and Foreign Employment, Health and Indigenous Medicine, Plantation, Child Affairs, Transport, Mass Media, Youth and Sports, Disaster Management and Education.",
    "This Cabinet-approved second National Action Plan was formulated through a comprehensive consultative process with the line ministries together with UNDP and UNFPA with wider UN agencies, CSOs, development partners and private sector partners which includes robust interventions to address SGBV, reaffirms the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to address SGBV and strengthen the rights of women, girls and gender minorities. The National Action Plan to address SGBV-II is a testament, to how addressing SGBV requires a multi-sectoral approach that closely and actively engages in many of these sectors, to promote gender equality and eliminate gender-based violence in Sri Lanka."
