ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s construction sector non-performing loans which peaked at 17.1 percent after a currency collapse, has eased to 14.1 percent despite a contraction in credit, according to the central bank data in a Financial Stability Review.

Construction investment credit is usually one of the big beneficiaries when central banks print money to target inflation or growth and collapse as soon as a ‘stabilization crisis’ starts as inflation ceases to accelerate.

Central banks typically ‘cut rates’ by printing money through open market operations, buying back government bonds from banks, allowing them to give loans without deposits.  The exercise tends to worsen loan to deposit ratios.

In the last crisis however some foreign banks, sharply curtailed all credit, including interbank lending due higher risk perceptions including on government debt, where an actual default or induced artificial default from debt restructuring was feared.

A Nevada man with a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trump’s rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, authorities said. He was released the same day on $5,000 bail.

The suspect, a 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, was driving an unregistered black SUV with a “homemade” license plate that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.

The driver claimed to be a journalist but it was unclear if he had the proper credentials. Deputies noticed the interior of the vehicle was “in disarray” and a search uncovered the weapons and ammo, along with multiple passports and driver licenses with different names, Bianco said.

The United States said on Sunday it will send U.S. troops to Israel along with an advanced U.S. anti-missile system, in a highly unusual deployment meant to bolster the country’s air defenses following missile attacks by Iran.

Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder described the deployment as part of “the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months” to support Israel and defend U.S. personnel from attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed groups.

For the first time in recent history, the newly appointed Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Priyantha Weerasooriya has announced a transparent selection process for Sri Lanka Police officers applying for foreign training courses and workshops.

In an official communique last week, Weerasooriya called for applications from police officers for foreign training programs to be held soon.

Moving away from the traditional method where officers were handpicked by the IGP or nominated by senior officers, Weerasooriya has introduced a mandatory interview process to select officers based on merit and qualifications.

The previous system had long been criticised for favouring officers close to the police top brass, sidelining others who might have been more deserving. Officers have often complained about the lack of clear criteria in the selection process, which undermined fairness and opportunities for growth within the force.

The people must realise though that with AKD at the helm only half the battle is won. He needs the people’s mandate to control the parliament. He must have an able crew to help him navigate the choppy waters ahead. At this point the NPP are doggedly sticking to their plan of nominating qualified and capable individuals to attract the attention of the voters. Already the names of high profile academics and professionals are emerging as candidates. This is leading the other parties to scramble and gather similar types to represent them and mirror the opposite camp. At least one thing is guaranteed – an increase in the IQ and capability of the next parliament which will be like none before

The opportunity to make significant change in Sri Lanka’s political, economic and governance landscape
