    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Net foreign reserves of Sri Lanka\u2019s banking system have started to go on reverse gear after April 2025, official data show, amid rate cuts and a pick-up in private credit, while central bank net reserves are also struggling to grow.",
    "Net foreign assets of the banking system peaked at around 3.3 billion US dollars in April 2025, just before a rate cut, central bank data show, amid a strong pick up in credit.",
    "In May bank NFA fell to 3.15 billion US dollars, in June to 2.96 billion dollars and in July to 2.90 billion dollars.",
    "Bank net foreign assets fell to a negative 6.4 billion US dollars until April 2022 as the central bank used its own reserves and borrowed reserves to finance imports and maturing debt in a bid to keep rates down.",
    "In April 2022 rates were hike steeply, but India gave ACU dollars to the central bank, which the central bank used in sterilized sales (printing money after intervention) which delayed a correction in the system.",
    "As a result, the net foreign reserves of the central bank continued to fall till India closed the tap.",
    "Commercial banks which had also borrowed from abroad and given loans domestically \u2013 including to the CPC when forex shortages emerged from earlier rate cuts \u2013 began to repay them several months earlier, and may have contributed outflows.",
    "In order for central bank to build unencumbered foreign reserves, it has to buy dollars outright from the market with deflationary policy which reduces its net domestic assets by extinguishing newly created money.",
    "In June 2025 after a rate cut the central bank\u2019s net foreign assets fell to 1.41 billion US dollars after peaking at around 1.54 billion US dollar in May.",
    "In July there was a slight pick up to 1.46 billion US dollars.",
    "In August the central bank bought 142 million dollars from the interbank market up from 81 million dollars in July.",
    "Sri Lanka central bank buys US$781mn less to August 2025 than last year",
    "The central bank has to settle its own reserve related liabilities \u2013 which are dollars borrowed to suppress rates earlier \u2013 of around 75 million dollars a month to India on account of ACU loans as well as payments to the IMF on the 2015/2018 currency crisis loans.",
    "The central bank recently shown increases in gross reserves with inflationary swaps, by effectively borrowing dollars from commercial banks, raising concerns of returning to earlier post-war policy that led to difficulties in settling debt with dollars bought from rupees.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Treasury does not buy its own dollars from the market and is hostage to deflationary policy of the central bank to maintain upward pressure on the currency, purchase dollars and give to the Treasury, through an apparently de facto requirement to supply dollars to fiscal authorities.",
    "Sri Lanka central bank makes over $750mn unsterilized forex sales to govt",
    "Sri Lanka Treasury should buy its own dollars to settle debt and avoid second default",
    "Though lending to the central bank through swaps may be a concern, commercial banks have also been lending in the domestic market.",
    "Some banks have bought Sri Lanka\u2019s international sovereign bonds, while others have also given dollar loans to private customers. These activities may also reduce net foreign assets of commercial banks without posing any danger to monetary stability.",
    "One positive factor has been that there is a scarce reserve regime in operation, and commercial banks are now borrowing slightly at higher rates to finance credit instead of large scale money printing through open market operations for the \u2018single policy rate\u2019.",

    "Analysts have pointed out that the single policy which implies an abundant reserve regime, is probably the deadliest operating framework that has come from the IMF technical assistance since Sri Lanka lost a credible anchor for the rupee after the Second Amendment to the Washington-based agency\u2019s articles.",
    "The loss of a credible anchor for the rupee led severe monetary instability and social unrest from the early 1980s with inflation going higher than the US, even as the Fed regained a credible anchor under Paul Volker, benefiting East Asian nations which maintained external anchors with fully unsterilized or largely unsterilized interventions.",
    "As a result the most radical economic reforms ever made in the country under J R Jaywardene to restore to people economic freedoms lost in the 1960s and 1970s, was discredited.",
    "Many Latin American nations, which had commercial debt, including Argentina \u2013 which has the archetypal sterilizing central bank \u2013 started defaulting like Sri Lanka in the 1980s.",
    "Analysts have warned that it is not a good idea to reject classical economic principles of sound money (primarily Hume\u2019s price-specie-flow mechanism, elaborated in greater detail by Ricardo, Thornton, Mill among others and also Smith) and embrace age-of-inflation statistics and \u2018full employment\u2019 policies that led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods, Great Inflation, the Housing Bubble and current troubles in the West stemming from abundant reserves.",
    "No country that operates a bank of issue with a money monopoly based on classical principles will have forex  shortages or depreciation (weakening againts notes issued by a bank with a better anchor and operating framework).",
    "In case of persistent depreciation and forex shortages, a parliament which acts on behalf of the people could break the money monopoly (legal tender law) and allow currency competition to short cut the flawed operating framework of the bank of issue and the deadly transmission mechanism through which asset price bubbles, mal-investments are fired and forex shortages are generated, analysts say."
