    "Police have apprehended a Buddhist monk in connection with a luxury vehicle found in the Mahiyanganaya area that reportedly had no valid registration or legal documentation. Officers suspect that the vehicle\u2019s license plate is also fraudulent, raising further concerns about the vehicle\u2019s legitimacy.",
    "Preliminary investigations have revealed that the \u201cTrooper\u201d Jeep in question had been transferred to the monk through an informal document, without any official or verifiable paperwork. Authorities state that no formal ownership records exist for the vehicle, adding to suspicions about its origins and use.",
    "However, police have also uncovered that the luxury vehicle in question bore the same license plate as another vehicle found in the Kurunegala area.",
