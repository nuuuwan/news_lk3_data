    "On July 14, Donald Trump had a televised meeting at the Oval Office with Mark Rutte, Secretary General of NATO, to discuss the tremendous progress made at the NATO Summit last month, to expedite a ceasefire in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky was in attendance at the Summit, while Russian President made his presence felt by raining bombs on Ukraine for the duration of the summit. Which made President Trump most disappointed with his old friend and mentor.",
    "\u201cThis war was not Trump\u2019s war\u201d, stated President Trump. \u201cIt was Biden\u2019s war; if I had been president, this war would not have even started. This was started by Biden and other people\u201d. He didn\u2019t mention the name of the man who actually initiated the invasion except express his \u201cdisappointment\u201d, consoling himself with the words, \u201cwe\u2019ll talk about that on a different day\u201d.",
    "He said that he will impose 100% tariffs on Russia unless Putin agrees to a ceasefire and a deal in 50 days. Nothing immediate, not even any economic sanctions, but he will express his disappointment with Putin by taking action against him in 50 days. Time enough for Putin to substantially destroy Ukraine, especially if Trump delays delivering the weapons he has promised to sell to NATO. Of course, the sale of the weapons to NATO for the use of Ukraine\u2019s defense comes with the condition that Zelensky does not attack Moscow or St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s two largest cities where Putin has his palaces and major business interests.",
    "Trump emphasized that the US had already spent over $350 billion on the war (another proven lie, that number is closer to $150 billion), and NATO will be paying for the weapons to be supplied to Ukraine, which will make a nice profit for the US Industrial Military Complex.",
    "Trump spent 30 minutes on a tirade on explaining how he would have ended the Russia Ukraine war, stopped the endless killing and brought peace to the region. Of course, the terms of his peace agreement would have led to the unconditional surrender of Ukraine and ceding much of that beautiful country to Putin.",
    "Trump then went on to air his other major grievance \u2013 that he had not been given the recognition of being the World\u2019s Peacemaker, which should have won him at least \u201cfour or five Nobel Prizes\u201d. Especially as that fraud, Barack Hussein Obama, who, with Biden, tied for the title of the worst president in US history, was awarded the Nobel Prize just for being black.",
    "Not counting the wars which would have never started had he been President, including the Vietnam War, which he was compelled to miss because of a life-threatening attack of bone spurs. In fact, on August 8, 2024, a post on X claimed that Trump had once referred to avoiding sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as his \u201cpersonal Vietnam\u201d. During a 1993 interview with Howard Stern, Trump said, \u201cyou know, in this era, if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam, we have our own Vietnam. It\u2019s called the dating game. Sex is my personal Vietnam. Dating and avoiding STDs is like being in Vietnam, it takes a lot of courage. I feel like a great and very brave soldier\u201d. Trump\u2019s bone spurs did not hinder him from carrying out his brave sexual duties during his self-described personal Vietnam war.",
    "Trump described himself as the \u201canti-war president\u201d during his 2024 election campaign, with the promise that he will stop the wars in the Gaza and Ukraine on the first day of his presidency. Today, six months into his presidency, he is helping his fellow war criminal, Netanyahu, to complete the genocide of the Palestinian people, as the Israel Defense Force continues with endless bombings on the Gaza strip. The besieged Palestinian civilians, men, women and children in the Gaza are even denied access to humanitarian aid. And the Russian assault on Ukraine shows no sign of abating.",
    "Predictably, Trump, the \u201canti-war president\u201d has overseen nearly as many air-strikes and bombs in the first five months of his second presidential term as Joe Biden launched in his entire presidency.",
    "Trump then began his tirade on his successes as a peacemaker, just in the last six months. During the meeting, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been very successful in settling wars. You have India and Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly\u201d.",
    "The implication being that he \u201cleveraged tariffs to stop the conflict from escalating and warned both India and Pakistan that he would not engage in trade deals if they continued to fight\u201d. And this worked. In his dreams. I will leave the explanation of the absurdity of this particular statement as I would like to save the best for the last.",
    "He had already spoken of his \u201cpeacemaking\u201d performances in the Gaza and Ukraine. Wars which are continuing to rage with little prospect of peace.",
    "He then moved on to the recent peace agreement signed at the White House last Friday by officials from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, aiming to end a conflict which had been running since the 1990s. However, this agreement is unlikely to endure, as it seems, like many other such previous agreements, to be designed not to ensure territorial integrity and justice and end the violence but for the US to exploit the mineral wealth of the Congo.",
    "The Serbia Kosovo peace agreement referred to by Trump was an \u201ceconomic normalization\u201d deal signed by Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti and President Aleksander Vucic, at a ceremony hosted by President Donald Trump at the White House ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2020. An opportunity by Trump to consolidate his image as a \u201cdeal maker\u201d in the run-up to the presidential election in NOVEMBER 2020. This agreement, hardly the \u201chistoric breakthrough\u201d claimed by Trump as deserving of that elusive Nobel Prize, was also used by Trump during last Friday\u2019s Oval Office meeting, to enhance his reputation as a Peacemaker.",
    "If you think that nothing can beat the use of a non-existent peace agreement, just an economic deal between two nations, in which the only role played by Trump, FOUR YEARS AGO, was to host the signing ceremony at the White House, to add to his record as a Peacemaker, you would be mistaken, but, knowing Trump, forgiven.",
    "I have saved the most Trumpingenuous peacemaking lie for the last.",
    "The recent India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025 was a brief but intense four-day military confrontation, triggered by a terrorist attack in the disputed state of Kashmir. Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire in the four-day conflict.",
    "Indian PM Modi said that \u201cIndia does not and will never accept mediation\u201d. Indian Foreign Secretary issued the following statement:",
    "\u201cPrime Minister Modi clearly conveyed to President Trump that at no point during tis entire sequence of events was there any discussion, at any level, on an India-US trade deal, or any proposal for a mediation by the US between India and Pakistan. The discussion to cease military action took place directly between India and Pakistan through the existing channels of communication between the two armed forces, and it was initiated at Pakistan\u2019s request. Prime Minister Modi firmly stated that India does not and will never accept mediation. There is complete political consensus in India on this matter\u201d.",
    "In fact, Indian officials confirm that they have had no dialog with the Trump administration on trade, tariffs or any other matter.",
    "Trump keeps lying about the trade deals he has made (zero), the wars he has successfully mediated (also zero), which are immediately and indignantly refuted by the nations and the persons about whom he makes up these lies. He lies when lying is even not necessary. He lies with the facility of breathing. And his gift is that many people, not just his base, believe him, against the evidence of their own eyes and ears.",
    "There is no one else on earth who will be able to make one sane person believe that the insurrection of January 6, the assault on the Capitol by armed, white supremacist thugs, was a legitimate, even patriotic act. That these insurrectionists have been mistreated by the justice system, and are political warriors, prisoners of war, worthy of pardon. Especially when the most violent political act in US history was enacted on TV live, right before our eyes.",
    "Trump did, and he so persuaded millions of educated people, all of whom are presumably born with a moral compass, who were blinded by his lies. That is a supernatural, even divine gift.",
    "Until today. Trump\u2019s stand on the release of the infamous Epstein files, has made even his most ardent followers of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) cult doubt his veracity.",
    "The Epstein Files refer to the myriad of court documents relating to the late, convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, who \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d while in prison during Trump\u2019s first presidential term, in the most suspicious and scantily investigated circumstances. These documents are alleged to include a list of an elite social circle of politicians, celebrities, even royalty, who have traveled with him on his private jet to his private island (later named Pedophile Island), and participated in sexual orgies with underage girls. Epstein was known to have described Trump as his \u201cbest friend\u201d during the 90s.",
    "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump said he would declassify the Epstein files, who was then in prison, awaiting his sex-trafficking trial. However, he now states that the Epstein conspiracy was never real, and he described some of his MAGA supporters as \u201cgullible weaklings\u201d for continuing to believe in the conspiracy.",
    "Trump does not want the Epstein List (which doesn\u2019t exist, anyway!) released for obvious reasons. Epstein and Trump were the best of friends during the turn of the century, and there are numerous tabloid photographs of him partying with the pedophile sex trafficker, Epstein and his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted sex offender, currently serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison.",
    "\u201cTheir (the Democrats\u2019) new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax (you know, like the Climate Change Hoax, the January 6 Hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and all those thousands of hoaxes which are part of the greatest witch hunt against Trump in history) and my PAST supporters bought into this \u2018b\u2026\u2026.., hook, line and sinker. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don\u2019t even think about our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don\u2019t want their support anymore\u201d.",
    "If Trump has decided that he can remain as the head of the Republican Party and the MAGA cult, that \u201che doesn\u2019t need their support anymore\u201d, then he has finally reached the ultimate stage of megalomania that he is convinced, as he has repeatedly claimed after his \u201cassassination attempt\u201d in Butler, PA a year ago, that he has been sent by God to Make America Great Again. He alone can do it.",
    "Maybe he is right. Maybe there is a God. Maybe Trump is part of that wonderful plan God has for us all.",
