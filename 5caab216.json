  "original_body_lines": [
    "Claiming that the government has misled the people that there would be no haircut on domestic debts, NPP MP Vijitha Herath said today that the Cabinet Paper presented on domestic debt restructuring clearly says that haircut on domestic debt is a prior condition of the international sovereign bond (ISB) holders.",
    "Speaking during the debate on the Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) process, the MP said the Finance Minister and the Central Bank Governor have misled the people for several months until the fact is revealed in the Cabinet Paper at the last moment.",
    "\"The Finance Minister and the CB Governor told a complete lie several months ago that they would guarantee that there will be no haircut on domestic debt. People have no faith on the government, finance minister and the CB governor,\" he said.",
    "The MP said international debtors stressed the government that there should be a transparent and equal treatment in the haircuts of international debt and government had to adopt such an approach and added that the government has not adopted any such transparent approach on DDR.",
    "He said primary dealers have been exempted in the DDR whereas the EPF and ETF of the working people have been targeted.",
    "\"The government has struck a deal with primary dealers. Working people have no chance to raise their concerns,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
