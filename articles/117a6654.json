    "As General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH), I led a diverse team of departmental heads. Some had been with the hotel for decades and held traditional views, while others were more adaptable to new trends. Among them was Executive Chef Publis Silva, who had worked at MLH since 1956, starting at the lowest level in the kitchen. Though rooted in tradition, Chef Publis had a flexible, collaborative approach and an unmatched work ethic. Leading his brigade of 80 chefs with distinction, he earned the respect of everyone. When the Chairman of the company, Sanath Ukwatte, decided to reward \u2018The Manager of the Year,\u2019 I recommended Chef Publis for the honour. It was awarded to him, with a car as the prize, a testament to his leadership.",
    "Chef Publis approached me one day with a novel idea: a mushroom promotion. \u201cSir, how about a Mushroom Week? We have many varieties of mushrooms in Sri Lanka that are virtually unknown.\u201d Intrigued by his enthusiasm and knowledge, I agreed. I even suggested that he compile a booklet on mushrooms. Within days, Publis found a sponsor for the booklet, always swift in turning ideas into action.",
    "The Mushroom Week, held from April 24-30, 1991, was a success, organized in collaboration with the Ceylon Tourist Board, the Mushroom Development and Training Centre, and the Export Development Board. Chef Publis\u2019s booklet sold for US$2.50 a copy, marking the beginning of his prolific journey into writing and publishing, with a focus on Sri Lankan gastronomy.",
    "The success of the mushroom promotion led me to encourage Publis further. I knew he had been researching dishes prepared for the royal families of the Kandyan kingdom before the British rule of the entire island commencing in 1815. I suggested that he compile a groundbreaking Sri Lankan cookbook. At first, Publis hesitated, citing his lack of formal education and limited English proficiency. I then encouraged him to write the book in Sinhala, but again, he was reluctant. Undeterred, I persisted. Eventually, after a year of gentle persuasion, he agreed on one condition: I would serve as his co-author. While Publis did the bulk of the work, I contributed an introduction and found a publisher.",
    "In 1992, we published Sinhala Bojana in Sinhala, followed by Traditional Sri Lankan Food in English in 1993. Although our collaboration on books ended when I left Sri Lanka in 1994, we each embarked on our own literary paths. Publis went on to author a wealth of books on Sri Lankan cuisine, while I focused on hospitality management, global tourism, and innovation. Between us, over the past 32 years, we have written and published 46 books.",
    "Even after leaving Sri Lanka, MLH has remained my home away from home during my visits. Over the years, Chef Publis has always ensured that I received a signed copy of each of his books, often with words of gratitude for encouraging him to begin writing. Despite my reminders that I did not deserve such praise, Publis persisted in his appreciation.",
    "One of his most remarkable works is Mahasupavanshaya: The Great Chronicle of Sri Lankan Culinary Art. This monumental book was the result of over a decade of collaboration with university researchers and a team of 12 MLH chefs. During my visit to Sri Lanka in April 2023, Publis presented me with a signed copy, and I was astonished to find it spanned 1,074 pages. His dedication and achievements continue to amaze me. The handwritten note he inscribed in the front of my copy deeply moved me. It read: \u201cPresented to you, who supported and encouraged me to write books.\u201d",
    "Since my first in-service as a Trainee Waiter at MLH (then Hyatt) in 1972 and 1973, for over 50 years, I\u2019ve had the privilege of working alongside Sri Lanka\u2019s greatest chef, a true national treasure.",
    "Inspired by the success of Traditional Sri Lankan Food, I turned my attention to another passion: promoting tourism and hospitality in Sri Lanka. In 1993, I edited Tourism, Hoteliering and Hospitality Education on behalf of the Sri Lankan Chapter of the Hotel Catering & Institutional Management Association (HCIMA). Drawing on my international network, I secured contributions from scholars and industry leaders across eight countries. I also encouraged prominent figures in Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry to submit chapters. I authored two of the 27 chapters included in the book.",
    "The book became the first-ever dedicated to tourism in Sri Lanka, and its launch at the BMICH was a grand affair, attended by key players in the country\u2019s tourism and hospitality sectors. I later travelled to the UK to promote the book, presenting a copy to HCIMA\u2019s main library in London. The then Worldwide President of HCIMA, John Aust, was impressed with the initiative, remarking that HCIMA should consider publishing books with contributions from its global community. He asked for my assistance, and I agreed to help",
    "In 1985, following my first management seminar co-presented with my mentor, Professor Richard Kotas, he suggested we turn my MSc dissertation into a textbook. At the time, Kotas had authored over 10 best-selling textbooks and numerous articles, while I had yet to publish anything. Given my busy career in hotel management, I decided to put the idea on hold.",
    "However, after my experience writing and editing three books in Sri Lanka, I was ready to move forward. Following the 1993 book launch at BMICH, I contacted Professor Kotas and told him, \u201cSir, I\u2019m now ready to co-write a textbook with you.\u201d Within a month, we signed a contract with the UK publisher Hodder & Stoughton. In 1994, we co-authored Profitable Food & Beverage Management. My experience as Food and Beverage Manager/Director of two large five-star hotels, managed by the Le Meridien and Oberoi hotel chains, enriched the content of the book. The book became a popular textbook in universities and colleges across the UK, Canada, Australia, Sri Lanka, Jamaica, and beyond.",
    "In 1995, I proposed to the HCIMA Board a textbook to commemorate the organisation\u2019s silver anniversary coincide with their silver anniversary, celebrating the merger of two major hospitality associations in 1971 to create HCIMA. This resulted in the co-editing of The International Hospitality Business alongside Professor Kotas, Professor Richard Teare, Professor John Bowen, and HCIMA\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Logie. The book featured 40 chapters written by 49 experts from around the globe and was published in 1996, by Cassell, a prestigious British publishing house founded in 1848.",
    "This experience opened many doors for me in the UK publishing world. To date, half of my 24 books and themed issues have been published in the UK, a journey for which I remain grateful to Chef Publis, Professor Kotas, and HCIMA (now the Institute of Hospitality, UK).",
