    "Two weeks have passed since the disastrous CNN debate on June 27, and the news cycle has been consumed with the controversy whether Biden should stay in the race for the presidency or whether his dismal performance was not a sign of a more serious malaise.",
    "At least 17 Democratic Congressmen and one Senator (and counting, just about every hour), have called on him publicly to withdraw. There are many more private murmurings that it would be best if he does hand over the torch to a younger, more electable candidate. Even Speaker Pelosi sent a carefully worded, lukewarm statement about Biden\u2019s chances in November. There are rumors that Pelosi and President Obama have been meeting privately to discuss this problem. After all, the basis of Biden\u2019s run for the Presidency in 2020 was that he would be a one-term president to defeat Trump and provide a bridge to the leadership of the younger generation of the Party.",
    "Another hit came last Wednesday, when Hollywood idol, George Clooney, who recently participated with President Obama and other celebrities in a star-studded Biden fund raiser which raised over $30 million, released an op-ed in the New York Times, urging the Democratic Party to choose a new nominee, after Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance. The fact that even major Democratic donors like Clooney are falling off the cliff indicates that the Party will run into serious financial problems ere long.",
    "Urging Democratic lawmakers not to wait and see if the dam breaks, Clooney says, \u201cThe dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth\u2026. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won\u2019t win the House, and we\u2019re going to lose the Senate. This isn\u2019t only my opinion; it is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor I\u2019ve spoken with in private\u201d.",
    "Clooney\u2019s comments were devastating. Mainly because they were true; there is little doubt that many more donors will follow his lead. Significantly, Clooney gave President Obama a heads-up before he submitted the op-ed to the New York Times. Sources familiar with the exchange say that while Obama did not encourage Clooney to write what he did, neither did he object to it.",
    "Even those who support Biden in a public show of loyalty are known to have a sneaking lack of private enthusiasm. Many have expressed fears, confirmed by current polls, that Trump will win re-election handily in November, and the Republicans will also gain control of the House and the Senate. With the Supreme Court completely suppliant to the conservative cause, the Trumpian Party will reign totalitarian supreme for the foreseeable future.",
    "This whole argument of whether to change the course of Democratic leadership seems to be a waste of valuable time, with the election just under four months away. The Democrats must concentrate on one objective only, that of keeping Donald Trump, who will destroy the democracy of the nation, away from the White House. As Senator Bernie Sanders said. \u201cWhat we are talking about now is not a Grammy contest song for the best singer. Biden is old. He\u2019s not as articulate as he once was. I wish he can jump up the stairs of Air Force One, but he can\u2019t. What we have to focus now is on policy; whose policies have benefited, and will benefit, the vast majority of the people of this country\u201d.",
    "After the debacle of the debate, the short-term aim for the Democratic Party was to remove the indelible impression of an old man, unable to articulate two very simple messages. One, the remarkable achievements of the first term of his presidency, which transformed a failing, criminally mismanaged Trump first term on the cusp of recession to the most robust economy in the world today \u2013 a record of bipartisan legislative achievements unparalleled in recent history. Two, the existential danger that another Trump presidency will threaten the democracy and the rule of law of the nation.",
    "What President Biden must emphasize is the obvious. That he is old. He is not the man he once was. He did have a terrible night during the debate where he made these facts painfully obvious to an audience of 51 million viewers, a spectacle of frailty, perhaps worse, which can never be unseen.",
    "But Biden must remind the American voters of the temporary amnesia they seem to be suffering about how they fared during the four years of Trump\u2019s first term. How he gave a tax cut of over $1 trillion which benefited mainly the super-wealthy and the corporations; how he mishandled the handling of the Covid pandemic, ignoring the advice of the greatest scientists in the world, which caused the avoidable deaths nearly a million Americans and tanked the economy to near recession; how he incited an insurrection that nearly brought down a democratically elected government; how he stole top-secret government documents to trade with the nation\u2019s adversaries; the list is endless.",
    "Trump\u2019s mind has become exponentially unhinged, with outrageous comments in his campaign rants, the latest being the explanation of his energy policy at a recent rally in Las Vegas, where he argued that he would prefer being electrocuted in a boat powered by an electric battery rather than being eaten by some imaginary shark! In truth, so would I.",
    "Biden gave a relatively energetic campaign rally speech in Raleigh, North Carolina the day after the disappointing debate, where he acknowledged that he was not a young man, but stated that his record and character prove that he\u2019s still the man for the job. He also made a forceful speech at the 75th Anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Alliance in Washington DC, quoting Reagan, \u201cIf our fellow democracies are not secure, we cannot be secure. If you are threatened, we are threatened. And if you are not at peace, we cannot be at peace\u2026.\u201dReagan knew it then, and we know it now. Our nations will continue to keep faith with what we\u2019ve pledged in the years to come\u201d.",
    "However, NATO leaders present at the meeting, are petrified at the prospect of the re-election of Donald Trump, who threatened to leave the Alliance during his first term, and has made no secret of his deep admiration for Russian strongman, Putin. They appeared to be distressed at how much more frail and aged Biden seemed, just a month after the G7 meeting in Italy.",
    "Both the North Carolina and NATO were strong Biden speeches, with no gaffes, but they were both scripted and made with the use of teleprompters, which did little to achieve what was intended: to convince us that the presidential debate was a one-off disaster. He did make a mistake when he introduced President Zelensky at the end of the NATO conference as President Putin, but he caught himself within seconds and made a joke of it.",
    "Thursday\u2019s crucial press conference went off relatively well for President Biden. He made a scripted 20 minutes speech about the success of the recently concluded NATO Anniversary celebrations, and listed the reasons why he is the best person to defeat Donald Trump in November; stressing that \u201cI am the most qualified to run for this job. I am not in this for my legacy. I am in this to finish the job I started\u201d. He articulated clearly his grasp of the economic and societal problems facing the country, and certainly spoke like a different person than the man we saw at the presidential debate.",
    "He then invited questions from the international press. He faced nearly an hour of probing questions, but started off badly right at the top. When asked about the qualifications of Vice-President Harris to do the job, he said, \u201cLook, I wouldn\u2019t have picked Vice-President Trump (!) if I were not sure she could do the job\u201d. But he answered questions about his policies if he wins a second term in remarkable detail, especially questions on foreign policy, which were right in his wheelhouse. But for a couple of minor errors, mistaking names which, as every octogenarian will tell you, is a constant problem, he did as well as could be expected.",
    "But the issues that have plagued him and caused all the doubts about a second term which make for his low poll ratings, and cause doubts among his Democratic colleagues, remained unchanged. He is too old, he is too frail, he is failing in cognitive acuity and physical health. And these problems will only keep getting worse with the passage of time.",
    "The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think-tank with deep ties to the Republican Party, especially its Trumpian incarnation, released a 922-page document titled \u201cProject 2025\u201d, which outlines the far-right Republican agenda which the federal government will carry out immediately after Trump wins re-election. Project 2025 is authored by numerous officials of Trump\u2019s first term, with contributions from conservative organizations intent on transforming the nation into a Christian white autocracy.",
    "According to the website of the project, \u201cIt is not enough for conservatives to win elections. If we are to rescue the country from the grip of the radical Left, we need both a governing agenda and the right people in place, ready to carry this agenda out on Day One of the next conservative administration. This is the goal of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project\u201d.",
    "As The New Republic notes, \u201cProject 2025 is a remarkably detailed guide to turning the United States to a fascists\u2019 paradise\u2026.a Christian nationalist nation of the United States, one in which married heterosexuality is the only valid form of sexual expression and identity, all pregnancies would be carried to term, even if that requires coercion or death, and transgender and gender-nonconforming people do not exist\u201d. And 90% of the poor and the immigrants, especially those from shithole countries, exist only to serve the wealthy, white 10%.",
    "In a post on his Truth Social platform last week, Donald Trump attempted to distance himself from the extreme agenda of Project 2025. Although, if he had the ability to read, the text of the document, a carbon copy of his plans for America\u2019s radical right, Christian white future, would have rewarded him with a wet dream of enormous pleasure.",
    "The Republican National Committee Convention starts tomorrow in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the course of which Trump will be gloriously anointed as the Party nominee for the monarchy, as the presidency has recently been defined by the US Supreme Court. Trump will also likely announce his running mate next week, who will be selected on the basis of their answers to two vital questions:",
