    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has provided agriculture tool kits to over 600 smallholder vegetable farmers in Sri Lanka\u2019s Badulla, Monaragala, and Mullaitivu districts to encourage the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), the agency said.",
    "The FAO said in a statement on Thursday June 27 that the initiative had focused on equipping targeted farmers with the tools and knowledge necessary to \u201ceffectively adopt modern, climate-resilient approaches to agriculture\u201d.",
    "Participants were provided with agriculture kits tailored for a land area of 0.25 acres. These kits comprised essential components such as drip irrigation systems, plastic mulch, insect-proof nets, and Galvanized Iron (GI) pipes, enabling efficient resource utilisation and cost reduction, the organisation said.",
    "The FAO said that it also facilitated capacity building through Farmer Field Schools (FFS), equipping farmers with the expertise necessary to achieve GAP certification.",
    "\u201cBy utilising extension approaches and organising exposure visits to successful GAP farms, participants gained a comprehensive understanding of modern agricultural methodologies. Furthermore, smallholder farmers received cash assistance through the World Food Programme (WFP), helping them meet their food and nutrition needs during the transition phase,\u201d the statement said.",
    "According to the FAO, over 71 percent of participating farmers have reported notable improvements in crop quality and a reduction in pesticide and agro-chemical usage. The implementation of insect-proof nets has led to a decrease in pest infestations and diseases while also reducing damage from wild animals such as monkeys, peacocks and wild boar, the organisation said.",
    "\u201cUp to 72 percent of farmers reported an increase in total income with over 24 farmers achieving profits exceeding one million rupees in a single cultivation season and more than 150 farmers surpassing 500,000-rupee mark. These figures underscore the significant economic impact of the programme. The initiative has also yielded significant environmental benefits with a 48 percent reduction in the average usage of chemical fertiliser per 0.25 acres of land.",
    "\u201cThis intervention is a part of a joint food security initiative, funded by the UN Sri Lanka SDG Fund. The Fund promotes innovative, catalytic, and transformative initiatives that align with the national priorities and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (2023-2027). It is supported by Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Peace Building Fund, and the Joint SDG Fund,\u201d the FAO said. (Colombo/Jun27/2024)"
