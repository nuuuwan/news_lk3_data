    "(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "In early 1972, the US government extended an invitation to me and to the Public Trustee, Mr. Barnes Ratwatte, to visit America under one of their leadership grants. The period was to be close upon a month. I was reluctant to ask the PM time off for such a long program. But she had heard about it, and wanted me to go. She was convinced that I needed a break, and said \u201cAt this rate you will fall ill.\u201d This was both unselfish and gracious of her.",
    "Preparations were therefore made to go. In the making of these preparations Miss Diana Captain of the United States Information Service in Colombo, did an excellent job with great energy, understanding and commitment. She spared no pains to make our forthcoming visit to the United States both useful and enjoyable. In the meantime, the Canadian government, hearing that we were to go to the States invited us to spend a week in Canada. They suggested that I spend at least three days in the Privy Council and Cabinet office in Ottawa, and then go on to Manitoba, which had at the time a left-of-centre government, and view how that Provincial Government functioned.",
    "A separate program was to be arranged for Mr. Ratwatte. When Tilak Gooneratne, our High Commissioner in London, heard about our visit, he telephoned the prime minister and told her that he was very keen that we spend about three or four days in London, where he was going to arrange a program for me in the Cabinet office and the Prime Minister\u2019s office at No. 10, Downing Street. He was going to arrange a separate program for Mr. Ratwatte. The Prime Minister approved both the Canadian and British programs. This meant that I would have to be away for about six weeks. I discussed this aspect with her. But she said \u201cYou need a break, and this program will be very useful.\u201d",
    "So, in July 1972, Barnes and I went to London, on the first leg of a fairly long tour. In London, I had a useful meeting in the British Cabinet office and met Lord Bridges, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister for Overseas Affairs, in the Prime Minister\u2019s office. Much was discussed during an interesting meeting. Tilak Gooneratne had arranged for us to meet the distinguished Lord Denning, Master of The Rolls, who was President of the Court of Appeal, and a friend of Tilak\u2019s. We had a most cordial and interesting meeting in his Chambers, after which he invited us to sit in his court.",
    "We spent a fascinating 45 minutes in court, with Lord Denning presiding with two other judges, listening to arguments in a complicated tax case. The court sat in a large room which was like a library full of law books and law reports neatly placed on shelves lining the room. Whenever counsel cited a case, three copies of the relevant law report opened to the correct page were placed before the three judges by assistants. It was an efficient process.",
    "We were also taken to The House of Commons, because arrangements had been made for me in particular to see the Prime Minister answering questions in Parliament. The Prime Minister was Sir Edward Heath. We were the guests of two members of Parliament, one Conservative and one Labour. The Conservative M.P. was Mr. Norman Tebbit later, to be a Senior Minister, as well as Chairman of the Conservative Party. He was a charming person, who told us that he knew Ceylon well because as a BOAC pilot, once upon a time he came to Colombo many times. The Labour M.P. was Mr. James Tim, who in fact, joined us later.",
    "By the time we took our seats in a viewing gallery, there was still time for the Prime Minister to answer questions. In fact, he was not yet in the chamber. But, there was someone answering questions, a lady. She was answering questions on education. The Labour benches were baiting her, and there was considerable noise. It was a very lively session. The most interesting feature however. was the style and manner in which she handled the supplementary questions, the interruptions and the general cacophony. She was impressively the master of her brief. She was confident and combative. What was hurled at her from the opposition benches, she hurled back with compound interest added.",
    "We inquired who this lady was, and was told that she was the Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State for Education and Science. I had heard that she was a grocer\u2019s daughter. Her parents presumably were in the retail trade. But this lady was clearly in the wholesale business. There were no rationed quantities delivered in her countering of opposition belligerence. It was marvelous parliamentary theatre. After her display, we found the Prime Minister\u2019s question time tepid and somewhat of an anti-climax.",
    "Later, when we got back to Sri Lanka, in discussing our visit with Mrs. Bandaranaike, I asked her, whether she had met Mrs. Thatcher. She said she had not. I then told her something which turned out to be prophetic. After describing her performance in the House of Commons that day, I said that if Britain was going to have a woman Prime Minister in the foreseeable future, it had to be Mrs. Thatcher. It was not a rash judgment. By this time, I had had occasion to meet a considerable number of Ministers, Prime Ministers and other senior political figures not only from Sri Lanka, but from several other countries as well. My judgement of Mrs. Thatcher was therefore based on perceived personality, confidence, thoroughness, clarity and obvious ability.",
    "The visit to Britain was a packed program. Besides the visits mentioned, there were other appointments, and official lunches where speeches had to be made. We saw much and met many during the course of quite a brief visit.",
    "The next leg of our journey took us to Canada. We were met at the airport in Ottawa by the High Commissioner William Silva, who had been a Cabinet Minister earlier in Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike\u2019s government, and Canadian officials. Here again, we had a packed program. Apart from calling on the Foreign Secretary, and other dignitaries most of my time was spent in the Privy Council office. Here, I was welcomed most warmly and cordially by Mr. Gordon Robertson, Secretary to the Cabinet, and Secretary to the Privy Council.",
    "Mr. Robertson was the senior Most public servant in Canada, and highly respected. He was a genial person with a sense of humour and we got on very well. On my first day, he escorted me to the conference room attached to his office, where four senior officials were waiting, including Mr. Michael Pitfield who succeeded Mr. Robertson in this key position. Against my protests, Mr. Robertson insisted that I take his chair at the head of the table, whilst he sat among the others and that is how we engaged in a fascinating discussion for the next hour.",
    "The Canadians were very open in their analysis and comments. They treated me as a respected colleague and an equal from another Commonwealth country, and assumed that confidences would be kept. I was encouraged to ask any question, and always received frank answers. One of the questions I asked was \u201cwhat do you regard as your most important responsibility?\u201d The answer was instant, \u201cmanaging Federal-Provincial relations.\u201d Canada has a Federal structure with entities called Provinces and not States. These provinces have considerable power and authority.",
    "According to the Privy Council team, there arise almost constant disputes between the center and the provinces, and managing these issues was a most important and sensitive task. These are matters which Sri Lanka should also address, in its pursuit of greater devolution. Models which look nice on paper and elegant legally may not be workable in practice. Reflecting on Canadian experience. one would urge caution and a thorough practical grasp of issues, which would require vision and an anticipation of how proposals would actually work out on the ground.",
    "My attachment to the Privy Council office also included meetings with the Deputy Secretaries and some of the Senior Assistant Secretaries. They were handling different areas of work. Even at Assistant Secretary level the office was staffed with senior and experienced people. In fact when I went to see one of them, I found that her previous assignment was as Canada\u2019s Ambassador to Poland. Such was the caliber of people even at Assistant Secretary level. All of them were very friendly and informal and virtually treated me as one of them.",
    "I remember one occasion. when the discussion was on the format of Cabinet papers, one of them pulled out a paper from a sheaf and handed it to me saying \u201cTake a look, this is going to Cabinet next week.- As I started reading it, I realized that it was a paper on defence, and promptly handed it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think I should read this.\u201d This was appropriately acknowledged, and I was handed a paper on social security this time. Such was the spirit in which things were done, during a most interesting and instructive week. The High Commissioner hosted a well attended dinner in our honour, and this together with the lunches and dinners hosted by many on the Canadian side, including Mr. Robertson proved rich in the opportunities for social interaction.",
    "From Ottawa we went on to Winnipeg, and were lodged in the excellent Fort Gary Hotel, by the Provincial Government. The Fort Gary was an old Fort built during the time of the Indian threat, and later it had become more like a trading post. The old timber structure suitably modified, with the addition of modern amenities had an excellent atmosphere, as well as very good guest comfort. Our stay here was only for a couple of days, and my program was a busy one. I had interesting and extensive discussions with the Secretary to the Prime Minister, and Secretary to the Cabinet of the Province of Manitoba. One person filled both posts, and in fact. this was another proposal that had come tip during our own constitutional changes. The province had also elected a socialist oriented government. So, I had much to discuss at my meeting with senior officials.",
    "From Canada, we flew on to the USA to begin our program there. Ambassador Neville Kanekaratne, whom I already knew, hosted a reception in our honour which was attended by three former American Ambassadors to Sri Lanka, Messrs. Satterwaite, Cecil Logan and Andrew Cory. Miss. Frances Willis was out of town and had sent in her regrets. In addition, there were officials from The State Department, AID, the IMF; The World Bank as well as prominent Sri Lankans and Americans within reach.",
    "After the reception, we had a wonderful meeting with Neville and the three former US Ambassadors. It was an excellent start to our program. Over the next few days in Washington D.C.. I had meetings in important American Agencies, such as the State Department, as well as with the President\u2019s Domestic and National Security Council staff at the White House. One of the more interesting discussions was with Mr. Harold Saunders of The National Security Council, considered to be an expert on Middle Eastern Affairs. One of the things that interested me most was the organizational aspects of running the White House and briefing the President. Here again, the senior officials 1 met were most co-operative and helpful.",
    "Our visit to the USA, took us to several States, and we got to visit many places of interest such as the Stock Exchange in New York; the Ford Motor Headquarters in Detroit; the Tennessee Valley Authority; the US Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, the Boeing Aircraft factory in Seattle; Hollywood; the Grand Canyon and the island of Puerto Rico. Visiting so many places, and talking to so many people in various areas of activity was an education in itself. But one of the most fascinating parts of the visit was the opportunity we got, in late August, when we happened to be in Florida, to witness the launching of an orbiting Astronomical Observatory, powered into space by an Atlas Centaur Rocket 135 feet tall.",
    "The Observatory which was named Copernicus, after the famous Polish Astronomer. was to study Planetary, Stellar, Inter-Stellar and Inter Galactic material. The actual launch from Cape Kennedy was to be at about 6.30 am. But we were bused in by 5.30 am. Seats were made available on a multi-tiered platform one and a half miles away, obviously for safety reasons. Anyone who had seen the launch of satellites or rockets on TV or film, cannot imagine what the real thing looked and sounded like.",
    "It was a magnificent spectacle in the pre-dawn darkness. The power of the rocket shook our tiered seats One and a half miles away and the entire sky was one fiery glow. The noise was almost deafening, gradually reducing to the puny sound of a motor cycle engine. What was finally left for sometime was a circle of white smoke like a fleecy cloud. We were very fortunate to see this, because as we later discovered, we had seen one of only six launches during the whole of 1972.",
    "Even in the 1970\u2019s Sri Lankans seemed to be omnipresent in almost all parts of the world. We met them in various parts of Canada and the USA. About their presence in Britain, one does not have to say much. But, one of the most interesting encounters we had was in distant Boulder, Colorado. We had got into town at about two in the afternoon, tired and very hungry. It was not easy to find a place to eat, and we were wandering down a street getting somewhat desperate, until in the distance I saw a sign that read very much like Weerasinghe.",
    "If in the desert, I would have put it to a mirage. But perhaps one also hallucinated in the rarefied air of mountainous Boulder. As we walked towards it, it became plain that we were indeed not seeing things. The board read Weerasinghe\u2019s and it was a restaurant. It appeared to be closed. We rang the bell, and a gentleman, slightly built for an American opened the door. it turned out that he had been a Peace Corps volunteer, working in Bandarawela, where he had met and married a Miss. Weerasinghe. Both of them had opened this restaurant and given it the exotic maiden name of the lady. They were very glad to see us, and most hospitable, although the restaurant itself was closed on that day. This encounter was certainly an instance of what is termed serendipity.",
    "We were in San Francisco, when I received a call from Susantha de Alwis, who was a senior diplomatic officer in our Embassy in Washington D.C. The Prime Minister had wondered, whether I could return a little earlier than originally scheduled, because she felt that WT Jayasinghe who was acting for me, was under considerable strain. By this time, I was out for almost five weeks, and had about a week more to go. Susantha emphasized that the Prime Minister did not ask me to come, but only wondered whether it was possible.",
    "I told him to inform her that I would return by the earliest available flights. She had been both gracious and liberal in permitting me to go for such a long period. I was also aware, that handling the dual duties of Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Secretary to the Prime Minister was extremely taxing and stressful, and the responsibilities and work load heavy. It was not surprising that WT was feeling the strain. Therefore. I booked my flights Los Angles/Honolulu/Manila and on to Singapore, and next day to Colombo. This proved to be an odyssey. Los Angles/Honolulu was some five and a half hours flying, followed by a 45 minute wait; then a ten and a half hour flight to Manila. a two hour wait there: and thereafter a three hour flight to Singapore. It was therefore about 19 hours of solid flying plus about five hours at airports, including Los Angeles. By the time I got into Singapore. I was in a daze. I went to bed and slept for 17 straight hours! I knew the condition I was in and I took the precaution of keeping the front desk informed that I did not wish to be disturbed for 24 hours, for otherwise they might have looked to see whether I was dead!",
    "There was much to attend to when I got back. The Prime Minister was apologetic about getting me back early. I assured her that the time spent out, and the rich experience gained were quite enough.",
