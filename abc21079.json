    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has cut its policy rate at which money is injected in to the banking system to 10 percent, and the lower corridor to 9 percent in a monetary policy meeting in November 2023.",
    "The central bank said there are likely to be no immediate rate cuts.",
    "\u201c..the Board viewed that with this reduction of policy interest rates, along with the monetary policy measures carried out since June 2023, sufficient monetary easing has been effected in order to stabilise inflation over the medium term,\u201d the statement said.",
    "\u201cHence, the Monetary Policy Board underscored the need for a swift and full passthrough of monetary easing measures to market interest rates, particularly lending rates, by the financial institutions, thereby accelerating the normalisation of market interest rates in the period ahead.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Board anticipates a swift, sizeable and broad-based reduction in overall market lending interest rates in line with the monetary policy easing measures effected since June 2023,\u201d the statement said.",
    "\u201cSuch adjustment in interest rates is imperative to ease the domestic monetary conditions further.",
    "\u201cThe Board stressed the need for all licensed banks to take swift measures to reduce market lending interest rates to ensure that the benefits of the series of monetary policy easing measures are adequately passed on to businesses and households.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s private credit has been slightly positive in recent months.",
    "In October the central bank was still a net buyer in forex markets with broadly deflationary policy involving selling down its Treasuries stock to the banking system.",
    "In the past policy rates enforced with inflationary open market operations amid a recovery in private credit in the past on the claim that inflation was low has led to renewed balance of payments deficits, missed IMF reserve targets, currency depreciation which push up food and energy prices leading to the ouster of incumbent administrations, analysts have pointed out.",
    "In January value added tax is to be hiked further, which can reduce pressure on the credit system though state salary hikes are kicking in from April.",
    "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka further reduces policy interest rates",
    "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on 23 November 2023, decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points (bps) to 9.00 per cent and 10.00 per cent, respectively.",
    "The Board arrived at this decision following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments in the domestic and global economy, with the aim of achieving and maintaining inflation at the targeted level of 5 per cent over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach and stabilise at the potential level. The Board took note of possible upside risks to inflation projections in the near term due to supply-side factors stemming from the expected developments domestically and globally. However, the Board viewed that such nearterm risks would not materially change the medium-term inflation outlook, as inflation expectations of the public remain anchored and economic activity is projected to remain below par in the near to medium term.",
    "Further, the Board viewed that with this reduction of policy interest rates, along with the monetary policy measures carried out since June 2023, sufficient monetary easing has been effected in order to stabilise inflation over the medium term. Hence, the Monetary Policy Board underscored the need for a swift and full passthrough of monetary easing measures to market interest rates, particularly lending rates, by the financial institutions, thereby accelerating the normalisation of market interest rates in the period ahead.",
    "Headline inflation continues to remain low, reflecting subdued demand conditions. Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2021=100), was recorded at 1.5 per cent in October 2023, compared to 1.3 per cent in September 2023.",
    "Food inflation continued to be negative (year-on-year) for the fourth consecutive month in October 2023. The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2021=100) based headline inflation (year-on-year) was recorded at 1.0 per cent in October 2023, compared to 0.8 per cent in September 2023. Both CCPI and NCPI based core inflation (year-on-year), which reflects underlying demand pressures in the economy, moderated further in October 2023, reflecting the subdued demand pressures in the economy.",
    "A one-off upward movement in inflation is expected in the near term, driven mainly by the changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed by the Government effective January 2024.",
    "The spillover effects of tax measures and other developments are likely to be muted due to subdued underlying demand pressures; hence, this rise in inflation is expected to be transitory. Accordingly, headline inflation over the medium term is expected to converge towards the targeted level of 5 per cent, supported by appropriate policy measures.",
    "Market interest rates are expected to normalise in the period ahead. Market interest rates continued to adjust downwards, and most benchmark interest rates have declined significantly.",
    "Meanwhile, the yields on government securities are also adjusting downwards with falling risk premia.",
    "The reduction of policy interest rates by 100 bps in this monetary policy review is expected to create further space for market interest rates to adjust downward and normalise in the period ahead.",
    "Reflecting the transmission of the relaxed monetary policy stance, outstanding credit to the private sector by the banking sector expanded on a monthly basis in September as well as in October 2023 based on provisional data. With the moderation of market lending interest rates, credit to the private sector is expected to increase further in the period ahead, thereby supporting the envisaged rebound of domestic economic activity.",
    "Policy interest rates are further reduced in view of the stable inflation outlook over the",
    "In consideration of the current and expected macroeconomic developments highlighted above, the Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on 23 November 2023, decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 bps to 9.00 per cent and 10.00 per cent, respectively. The Board viewed that, with this reduction of policy interest rates and based on the available information, further monetary policy easing will be paused in the near term, given the space for market interest rates to adjust downwards in line with the current and past monetary policy easing measures.",
    "The Board anticipates a swift, sizeable and broad-based reduction in overall market lending interest rates in line with the monetary policy easing measures effected since June 2023. Such adjustment in interest rates is imperative to ease the domestic monetary conditions further. The Board stressed the need for all licensed banks to take swift measures to reduce market lending interest rates to ensure that the benefits of the series of monetary policy easing measures are adequately passed on to businesses and households.",
    "The Monetary Policy Board will continue to assess risks to inflation projections, among others, and stand ready to take appropriate measures to maintain domestic price stability in the period ahead while supporting the economy to reach its potential."
