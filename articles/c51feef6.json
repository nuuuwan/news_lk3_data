  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government of India has released the first instalment, amounting to around $ 2.5 million (approximately Rs. 770 million), for the installation of an advanced signalling and telecommunication system along the Maho-Anuradhapura railway line. This marks another key milestone in India-Sri Lanka cooperation in the railway sector.",
    "The project was jointly launched by the Prime Minister of India and the President of Sri Lanka during the recent high-level visit in April 2025. Initially envisaged as a Line of Credit (LoC) project at a cost of $ 14.89 million, it was later converted into a grant by the Government of India during the State visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in December 2024. It is being executed by Indian Public Sector Undertaking, Ircon International Ltd.",
    "With Indian assistance, the tracks on the Northern Line have been upgraded to support train speeds of up to 100 kmph. Complementing this, an advanced signalling system will enhance passenger safety while increasing the frequency and efficiency of train services. The system also provides real-time tracking of train positions within each block section, ensures centralised monitoring of the entire section from a modern Control Centre, and facilitates the simultaneous reception and dispatch of trains at stations, optimising operations and reducing delays. Preliminary work has commenced, and the project is scheduled for completion by August 2026.",
    "Railways are a cornerstone of India-Sri Lanka development cooperation. India has supported multiple railway infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, including track rehabilitation, supply of rolling stock, and installation of signalling systems. India\u2019s cumulative financial assistance to Sri Lanka\u2019s railway sector stands at approximately $ 1.2 billion. Till date, India has constructed and rehabilitated nearly 500 km of railway track and provided signalling and telecommunication systems across approximately 400 km of railway network, thereby enhancing seamless North-South connectivity. In addition, India has supplied a wide array of locomotives, Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs), and mainline coaches, further strengthening the operational capacity of Sri Lanka Railways.",
    "This project reflects the human-centric approach of India\u2019s development partnership initiatives and reaffirms the Government of India\u2019s strong commitment to enhancing connectivity and infrastructure in Sri Lanka."
