    "Election fever is running high, and not many seem concerned about the sorry state of the economy. Politics has taken precedence over economics and blinded politicians and voters alike to the harsh economic reality. It is doubtful whether the disturbing news about a delay in the next review of the Sri Lanka-IMF programme has received adequate public attention. As things stand, the release of the next tranche of the IMF loan will be delayed.",
    "Curiously, one does not hear any government leader talking about state revenue boosting measures; the JVP-led NPP\u2008is in overdrive to grant subsidies and pay hikes to shore up its popularity and garner votes. Both the government and the Opposition are promising to reduce taxes and tariffs and increase welfare expenditure. There is no gainsaying that taxes and tariffs are unbearably high and they should be brought down to affordable levels, but that must be done cautiously in a sustainable manner without derailing the ongoing economic recovery efforts.",
    "Worryingly, the government and the Opposition are falling over themselves to please the state sector employees with an eye to postal votes; the NPP is promising to grant them pay hikes and the Opposition is urging the government to fulfil its pledge expeditiously. State workers no doubt deserve relief, but politically motivated salary increases for them will not help the public at large; such measures may help improve the state employees\u2019 lot marginally in the short term, but they are bound to aggravate the economic crisis by increasing state expenditure and making it extremely difficult to meet the revenue targets set by the IMF.",
    "The total number of employed Sri Lankans is about 8 million, according to official data, and pay increases for only about 1.5 million of these workers in the public sector will not benefit others. How do the government and the Opposition propose to grant relief to 6.5 million non-state workers as well as other Sri Lankans? It behoves the government, which came to power promising a system change, to abandon conventional, vote-catching expenditure commitments and remain intensely focused on expediting the process of straightening up the economy and enabling the country to exit debt default. The Opposition, which is raking the government over the coals for borrowing heavily, ought to refrain from calling for measures that will increase state debt further.",
    "When Ranil Wickremesinghe was the President, he rightly pointed out that the success of any strategy to revive the economy and ease the people\u2019s economic burden hinged on the government\u2019s ability to strengthen the rupee. Initially, he did not give in to trade union demands for state sector pay hikes, but subsequently he chose to subjugate prudent economic management to self-interest in a bid to win last month\u2019s presidential election, but in vain. His promise to grant a pay hike to state workers, closer to the presidential contest, was widely seen as a trap set for his successor because by that time he knew it was curtains for his presidency. Now, he is pressuring President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to walk into that trap!",
    "Asking the Opposition to stop daydreaming about a premature end to the NPP rule, President Dissanayake has said there will be no turning back until his administration resolves the economic crisis and achieves the country\u2019s development goals. If so, the government will have to be mindful of potential shocks the economy is likely to suffer. Warnings of possible terror attacks here and travel advisories some powerful nations have issued to that effect are likely to take their toll on Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector and foreign currency reserves. The raging conflict in West Asia is very likely to escalate further, driving Sri Lankan expatriate workers away, and causing a sharp drop in remittances. Petroleum prices will increase exponentially in case of the conflict disrupting the global oil supply. Sri Lanka\u2019s economy will suffer a multiple whammy in such an eventuality. Inflation, which dipped into negative territory last month could rebound and go through the roof, causing political upheavals, if the feared consequences of the West Asian conflict and travel advisories come to pass.",
    "One can only hope that both the government and the Opposition will act responsibly with foresight and make a concerted effort to expedite the country\u2019s economic recovery process instead of advancing their political agendas at the expense of the ailing economy.",
