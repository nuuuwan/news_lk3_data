This includes halting the supply of water and electricity, as well as discontinuing internet facilities. These disruptions will significantly impact various operations within the university system, he said.",
    "\u201cAlso, the authorities should take full responsibility for the destruction of samples maintained at the laboratory level in the university system. This kind of thing is happening to the university system because of the actions of this government. If the administration continues to avoid it, we should also rethink about the activities that we voluntarily carry out in the university,\u201d said Priyantha.",
