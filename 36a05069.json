    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka traders were given the go ahead of import 50,000 metric tonnes of rice by the cabinet of ministers, a statement from the government information department said.",
    "They will be allowed to bring GR II grade of rice which is similar to \u2018Keeri Samba\u2019.",
    "The imports are expected to moderate the price of \u2018keeri samba\u2019 a premium rice that critics claim is hoarded by millers to drive its price up.",
    "Sri Lanka has restrictions on the import of rice, keeping prices above the world market and discouraging competitive cultivation of globally traded grades.",
    "The proposal to allow the import was made by trade minister Nalin Fernando, the statement said. (Colombo/Dec19/2023)"
