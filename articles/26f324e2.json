    "WEConnect International, in partnership with the US Department of State, hosted the Sri Lanka Sustainable Trade and Economic Summit 2025 on 7 August at Shangri-La, Colombo.",
    "This high-level gathering convened over 200 key stakeholders, including women business owners, corporate leaders, Government officials, and trade experts, to accelerate economic growth through enterprise development and international business collaboration.",
    "The Summit featured policy dialogues, business matchmaking, and success stories of entrepreneurs who have grown their enterprises through trade. A central theme was unlocking new avenues for Sri Lankan small businesses to scale and participate in cross-border commerce.",
    "Sri Lanka Export Development Board CEO and Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe during his address at the Summit noted: \u201cThis is not just a Summit \u2014 it is a movement to elevate Sri Lankan entrepreneurship. Women-owned businesses are essential to our national recovery and long-term competitiveness.\u201d",
    "This Summit follows the successful rollout of WEConnect International\u2019s \u2018Power of Access\u2019 Roadshows, held earlier this year in Colombo and Kandy in May of 2025. These events offered a robust platform for over 150 women entrepreneurs and corporations to engage, exchange strategies, and form valuable business connections. The momentum continued with the third Roadshow scheduled for 9 August in Galle, designed to extend outreach to southern Sri Lanka.",
    "WEConnect International CEO and Co-Founder Elizabeth A. Vazquez during her special remarks stated: \u201cBehind every measurement of impact is a woman who made the leap to scale her business, hire more people, and serve broader markets. Today, we celebrate those achievements and reinforce our belief that access to opportunity must never be a privilege \u2014 it must be a right.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is home to over 230,000 women-led businesses, representing approximately 20% of the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector. These entrepreneurs play a crucial role in post-crisis economic resilience by generating jobs, innovating products and services, and reinvesting in their communities and families.",
    "By connecting Sri Lankan businesses with regional and global supply chains, the Summit contributes to job creation, stronger local economies, and a more stable and predictable environment for international commerce. The Summit Trade Show was officially inaugurated at One Galle Face Mall, offering a public-facing showcase of Sri Lankan innovation and business talent.",
    "As the Summit concludes, the path forward is clear: strategic partnerships, access to markets, and enterprise growth must continue to be priorities in Sri Lanka\u2019s development agenda. This collaborative platform strengthens US and multinational corporation alliances and supports the vision of a connected, resilient South Asia."
