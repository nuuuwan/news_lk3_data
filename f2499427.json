    "The Sri Lanka Federation of University Women launched its website on Thursday, 10 July, at its headquarters in Colombo.",
    "In her welcome address, the SLFUW President Colonel Dr. Udula Krishnaratne extended a warm welcome to the Chief Guest Dr. Ramya Chamali Jirasinghe, and thanked her for gracing the occasion. She also thanked and expressed her appreciation to all others present for their participation in this momentous event.",
    "Dr. Jirasinghe is the Country Coordinator for Kindernothilfe Lanka and a former Deputy Director of the Fulbright Commission Sri Lanka and also an award winning poet. Dr. Krishnaratne mentioned that it is interesting to note that, while the Fulbright Commission helped develop education by providing Sri Lankans with opportunities for postgraduate studies in America, it was an American lady, Clara Motwani, with a Masters Degree in Education, who helped to develop school education in Sri Lanka, and also set up the SLFUW in 1941.",
    "Thus the SLFUW is 82 years old, but the years have only made it stronger, with a large and influential membership, both here/in Sri Lanka and abroad."
