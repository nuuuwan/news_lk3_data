    "Colombo, June 7 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the announcement of the judgement, the family of victim Yvonne Jonsson, said this ruling is not only a victory for our family but also for all who believe in the rule of law.",
    "Her sister Caroline Jonsson who issued the statement on behalf of the family said it is also a significant step for all female victims in Sri Lanka, affirming that their lives and dignity cannot be compromised by arbitrary decisions.",
    "\u201cThe Supreme Court ruling that former President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s pardon of Yvonne's murderer is arbitrary and not valid in law brings us a profound sense of relief and justice.",
    "The tragic and brutal loss of Yvonne has left an unfillable void in our hearts, causing us immense and ongoing pain. The pardon felt like a deep betrayal, compounding our grief and anguish. This judgement reaffirms the importance of justice and accountability, emphasizing that decisions of such significance cannot be made on a whim.",
    "We are deeply grateful to the judiciary who worked tirelessly on this case and held integrity throughout the entirety of this matter.",
    "It is, however, imperative that the murderer is swiftly located and brought back to prison. This is not just about closure for our family; it's pivotal in ensuring that justice is truly served. We cannot allow a loophole in extradition agreements to impede the pursuit of justice. Holding the murderer accountable for his actions, regardless of where he chooses to hide, is non-negotiable.",
    "Thank you to everyone who has stood by us and supported us through this relentless journey. We will forever continue to honour Yvonne's memory. Every action we take, every step we make, is a tribute to her enduring spirit and the love she brought into our lives,\u201dshe said."
