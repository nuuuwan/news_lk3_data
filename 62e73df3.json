  "original_title": "Sri Lanka central bank sells dollars in June after \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019 panic: analysis",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has sold 91 million US dollars in June after the rupee rose to 295 to the US dollar and slid back to 320 levels, official data show.",
    "The central bank started operating an International Monetary Fund supported \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019, which is neither a clean float nor a hard peg, and is found in most defaulting countries and those that go to the agency repeatedly with balance of payments triggered by rate cuts enforced with liquidity injections.",
    "The monetary instability from liquidity injections \u2013 usually made when private credit recovers \u2013 are then blamed on budget deficits, though usually deficits are higher in the stabilizing year that follows. Imports are also blamed, and trade restrictions are imposed.",
    "In June the central bank was operating broadly deflationary open market operations, (not injecting money on a net basis) but the currency fell anyway, due an exchange policy error, analysts say.",
    "Under deflationary open market operation, there is a balance of payments surplus, making it easy to control an exchange rate and build reserves with marginal two-way interventions, if any.",
    "A flexible exchange rate involves operating a de facto peg to collect reserves (prevent appreciation), but staying away from intervening when temporary demand resumes, leading to uncertainty and loss of confidence and wild swings in the currency.",
    "It is a profitable activity for banks but expensive for external trade and leads to loss of investor confidence.",
    "The central bank had bought 77.5 million US dollars and sold 91.5 million dollars to commercial banks in June to stop the rupee falling beyond 320 to the US dollar, data show.",
    "In June, moral suasion was also employed to stop the rupee falling further, according to market participants.",
    "In July the rupee again fell to 320 to the US dollar after appreciating to 310 to the US dollar under the flexible exchange rate. Dollar sales have resumed, market participants said.",
    "RELATED  Sri Lanka bonds close down, rupee 322.00/324.00 to dollar",
    "Operating simultaneous exchange and money polices involve anchor conflicts and rejection of classical monetary theory (still employed in stable East Asian nations) articulated by economists including Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Henry Thornton, David Hume, Friedrich von Hayek, Milton Friedman as well as Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming (ISLM-BOP).",
    "Under a so-called flexible inflation targeting, the reserve collecting central bank eventually prints money to cut rates claiming inflation is low (inflationary open market operations) which leads to balance of payments deficits and permanent loss of confidence in the currency effectively operating ISLM policy, leading to BOP deficits.",
    "Analysts have warned that inflation is not the determinant of interest rates in a country with a reserve collecting central bank but the balance of payments and rates have to be higher than the equilibrium rate to build reserves under an IMF program.",
    "Related Sri Lanka can cut rates now, keeping them down as credit picks up will hit rupee",
    "In an IMF backed monetary law macro-economic policy (outlawed by then governor A S Jayewardene) is to be legalized again in the form of output gap targeting through the planned Section 6 (4), while flexible exchange rate and flexible inflation targeting is to be legalized under Section 11.",
    "Contradictory money and exchange policies are to be made possible under section 7 (1) (a) and (b).",
    "Countries with central banks that operate two anchors also tend to have high nominal interests due to the ensuing monetary instability.",
    "Social unrest then emerges and reformist governments are ejected from power, energy enterprises make losses and budgets are torn asunder.",
    "Net foreign debt may also accumulate as the country loses the ability to settle both current or capital transactions, eventually leading to default if open market operations are continued to keep interbank rates down and buy outright or through reverse repo securities from the secondary market.
