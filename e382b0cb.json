    "Judge Divani Nadaraja\u2019s journey to this prestigious position has been marked by a wealth of experience and dedication to the pursuit of justice.",
    "Judge Divani Nadaraja officially joined the Fairfax County of Virginia\u2019s Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court bench on 1 May bringing with her a remarkable background.",
    "Her career began as the Domestic Violence Attorney for Fairfax County at Legal Services of Northern Virginia, a legal aid organisation committed to ensuring access to justice for indigent and low-income individuals. In this role, she tirelessly represented countless victims and survivors of domestic violence, handling protective orders, as well as contested custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, and divorce cases. Her dedication earned her a reputation as a zealous and equitable advocate, respected by attorneys, prosecutors, law enforcement, victims\u2019 advocates, and various community and social services organisations.",
    "Following her tenure at Legal Services of Northern Virginia, Judge Divani Nadaraja transitioned to private practice, becoming an integral part of some of Northern Virginia\u2019s and Washington D.C.\u2019s most prestigious family law firms. Her expertise was sought after for complex divorce and custody cases, relocation matters, and even international kidnapping cases. Her clientele spanned a diverse spectrum, including celebrity clients.",
    "Before being appointed as a permanent judge, Judge Divani Nadaraja served as a Substitute Judge, a distinction reserved for a select group of attorneys who have consistently demonstrated the highest standards of integrity, competence, and professionalism throughout their careers. Judge Divani Nadaraja\u2019s educational background is equally impressive, having graduated from the esteemed University of Pennsylvania and earned her law degree from The George Washington University Law School in Washington D.C.",
    "Notably, Judge Divani Nadaraja\u2019s appointment is a historic one. As the granddaughter of the late Arunachalam Subramaniam, a prominent lawyer in Sri Lanka, and the daughter of Doctor Raveendra Nadaraja and Doctor Iswara Gowri Nadaraja immigrants from Sri Lanka, her family\u2019s legacy of excellence is a testament to her own accomplishments.",
    "She proudly stands as only the second Sri Lankan-American judge appointed to the judiciary in the United States of America and the very first female Sri Lankan American judge in the nation appointed at a very young age. Originally from California, Judge Divani Nadaraja now calls Northern Virginia home, where she resides with her husband and three children. Her remarkable journey and achievements serve as an inspiration to all, and we eagerly anticipate the positive impact she will continue to make on the judiciary and the community she serves."
