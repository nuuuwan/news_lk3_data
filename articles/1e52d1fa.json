    "(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Pieris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "When Wesak day approached that May, the situation was better. but much more had to be done. The prime minister decided that she would not forego her practice of going into retreat and observing sil on Wesak day. She told the service chiefs and the IGP, that she was going to observe sil, and that she was not to be disturbed that day unless they considered it absolutely necessary. They told her that they were certain, that it would not be necessary, and that they were happy that she would have a brief period away from the burdens and strains of Prime Ministerial office.",
    "They were impressed with her dedication, calm and decisiveness, as well as her womanly qualities of concern for them, and the hospitality she always remembered to accord, during the numerous occasions they had to visit Temple Trees. Amidst the seriousness and urgency of the crisis. she unfailingly saw to it that busy and harassed officers who came for meetings were well fed. In fact, some of them would not have known when they would eat next.",
    "There seems to be something in the Sri Lankan\u2019s temperament that is antipathetic to concerns of security. We not only forget easily, but are quite liberal and free with information to anyone, This was certainly so during this time. and it is still so now. Just to relate one example, from the early days of the insurrection. one day. Mr. Puri the Indian High Commissioner rang me. He said -Mr. Pieris, I thought I should tell you that security should be tightened all round.\u201d",
    "Then he went on to say, \u201cyou know. I telephoned Mr. Maithripala Senanayake\u2019s residence and wanted to speak to him. Someone there answered and told me where Mr. Senanayake had gone. what time he left, and what time he was due to return. He is a senior minister,\u201d continued Mr. Puri, Why are all these details given about his movements? Anybody can, say. lie is the Indian High Commissioner or that he is some important person, and obtain complete details.\u201d",
    "I thanked him. I did not want to get into a discussion about our open mouthed culture. I rang up the Secretaries, related the gist of this conversation and asked them to personally brief their ministers. I also kept the PM as well as the service chiefs and the IGP informed.",
    "Once the insurgency was brought under control, government turned its attention to the onerous task of rehabilitating the large number of youth who had surrendered to the authorities mainly because of the amnesty offered to them by the PM. Large numbers were accommodated at Boosa and elsewhere. And adequate arrangements had to be made for their education and welfare.",
    "The shock of the insurgency also led to a re-appraisal of government policy and matters such as poverty alleviation, land reform, employment generation and the nationalization of the plantations became critical issues. The government themselves became more radicalized as a result of the experience leading to a re-ordering of priorities. It was also decided that discussions on the new constitution be expedited, and a deadline set for it to be introduced before the end of the first half of 1972.",
    "In the meantime, certain strains were becoming evident within the government. Public expectations were high. resource constraints were many, and budget formulation not easy. The continuing foreign exchange crisis aggravated matters. The Finance Minister Dr. N.M. Perera clearly resented the planning function being, under the PM. Matters were compounded by the uneasy and sometimes prickly relationship between the finance minister and the Secretary to the Ministry of Planning Dr. H.A. de S. Gunasekera.",
    "Dr. Gunasekera had been an extremely able teacher of economics at Peradeniya University, where for sometime he held the post of professor. He had specialized in the area of Central Banking. He was also a lucid and effective communicator of the whole range of economics as a subject and a discipline. and his lectures in the large \u201cRoom A\u201d of Peradeniya University also attracted many undergraduates from other disciplines who had some time to spare.",
    "Dr. Gunasekera had also been a member of the LSSP for many years, and had done much political work with Dr. N.M. Perera and others during those times. Now, he had changed to being SLFP. This also naturally caused tensions between him and the LSSP ministers, but more so with the finance minister. The fact that Dr. Gunasekera possessed a very stubborn streak, was extremely sensitive and appeared at times to be alien to diplomatic conduct did not help either.",
    "He was a decent man, but a very complex character. One day, I was called into cabinet, to brief the ministers on some matter, and as I entered, I found the cabinet in an uproar. They were discussing some contentious economic issues and as I went in, I heard Dr. Gunasekera, who had been called in earlier, telling Dr. N.M. Perera, \u201cSir, whether under capitalism or socialism two and two is four!\u201d This caused further uproar. But that was Dr. H.A. de S. Gunasekera.",
    "This may be the place to make a passing reflection on cabinet meetings. I had never been cabinet secretary, so I had no experience of sitting through such meetings. But as a senior official I had been summoned to cabinet on many occasions under different governments, either to explain and elucidate some point, or to be consulted on some matter.",
    "What I vividly recall is that on all such occasions, one got the instant impression that one had entered a busy public market. Several ministers were talking at the same time and some heated debate seemed to be always going on. There have been occasions when I had gone into the cabinet room, but nobody seemed to have noticed me, largely built as I am. Such had been their preoccupation with the debate.",
    "As officials, we have been used to conduct our meetings, even large meetings somewhat differently. These experiences made one realize that there was a marked difference in the approach, tone, and decibel count of meetings of the political executive from those conducted by a passionless civil service.",
    "Towards the end of 1971 constitutional issues were gathering momentum and gaining in importance. A separate Ministry of Constitutional Affairs had been setup under the ministerial charge of Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. Many committees of MPs were busy at work on various aspects of the new constitution. There was also a continuous process of discussions with the PM in various fora, including the political committee of the three parties in government.",
    "Some matters were discussed in cabinet, whereas other matters were discussed\u2019 the PM\u2019s office, either as a follow-up to letters or memoranda sent by various ministers, or on the basis of formal meetings convened to discuss particular important aspects. These issues reaching the PM\u2019s office had to be dealt with by me, which meant reflection and study before discussing matters with the PM. Invariably such a prior discussion took place, before the summoning of a formal meeting.",
    "Sometimes these discussions led to my meeting the Attorney General, on the directions of the PM, to sort out issues before a formal meeting. The Attorney General at the time was Mr. Victor Tennekoon, Q.C., a soft spoken, a gentleman, and one who possessed a first rate legal mind. He was ably assisted by senior counsel such as Mr. Raja Wanasundera. Both of them reached eminence on the bench of the Supreme Court later, one as the Chief Justice and the other as second only to the Chief Justice in seniority.",
    "These discussions were educative and fascinating, and very often because of the confidentiality of the material restricted to the three of us . As work on the new constitution proceeded, greater time had to be devoted to many intricate and even contentious matters that were coming up from time to time The intricacies involved not only matters constitutional, but also issues political. There were perceived differences of opinion between the PM and some ministers of the left parties in government.",
    "There was a degree of suspicion that the left would engineer constitutional provisions disturbing the kind of balance that the PM and the main body of the government envisaged. There also were other issues that added to the strains of coalition government. The kind of work that had to be done by the PM\u2019s office is reflected in a letter dated 25/4/1972 addressed to the PM by Mr. Felix R. Dias Bandaranaike, Minister of Public Administration, Local Government and Home Affairs. It read as follows:",
    "As Dharmasiri Pieris would have told you over the telephone, (The Prime Minister was in Nuwara-Eliya), the discussions on the constitutional matters by the Cabinet Sub-Committee is proceeding, but in my view not entirely satisfactory! (Then there is a reference to certain views expressed by Dr. Colvin R. de Silva). The letter then goes on as follows:",
    "\u201cMr. Maithripala Senanayake and I have in accordance with your instructions had a conference with the Attorney-General and Dharmasiri Pieris, and worked out the further detailed amendments, a copy of which I annex. After the changes are made I shall submit the bill to you and if you approve, the bill Can then be submitted to Parliament.\u201d",
    "In my entire career, never have I visited an Attorney-General so often as during this fairly hectic period.",
    "The Democratic National Convention 2024 \u2013 \u201cHope is making a comeback\u201d",
