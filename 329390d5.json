  "original_body_lines": [
    "Ex-President Maitripala Sirisena\u2018s counsel told the Supreme Court that Jude Shramantha Jayahama was released from prison following the due Constitutional process which the petitioner had suppressed to Court.",
    "Faizer Musthapha PC contended this while challenging the Fundamental Rights petition filed by the organisation 'Women and Media Collective' against the pardon granted by former President Maithripala Sirisena to Jude Shramantha Jayamaha.",
    "Counsel further asserted that it is unfair to target President Maithripala Sirisena as he had followed the due process of law.",
    "Counsel underscored the fact on what the status would be of 69 other convicts whose death sentences were also commuted by the President.",
    "Counsel questioned whether any Fundamental Rights applications have been filed against the President in those instances. Counsel Musthapha said the process was initiated during the tenure of Ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa after which the death sentences imposed on 70 other convicts had been committed to life.",
    "He also emphasized that former Attorney General Palitha Fernando had given an opinion that there was no premeditation by Jaymaha to commit the murder.",
    "Counsel Musthapha told court that President Maithripala Sirisena had acted on the advice of the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice and the pardon granted to Jayamaha after three and a half years from commuting his death sentence into life imprisonment.",
    "Counsel Faizer Musthapha PC made these assertions before the three Supreme Court Judges, Justice S. Thurairajah, Yasantha Kodagoda and Janak De Silva during the inquiry into the FR petition filed by the Women and Media Collective against the decision taken by Ex-President Maithripala Sirisena to release Jayamaha from life imprisonment by allegedly violating the law.",
    "Counsel Sanjeewa Jayewardene PC appeared for the petitioner. Counsel Romesh De Silva PC appeared for the aggrieved parents of the deceased Yvonne Johnson.",
    "Further hearing was postponed to July 13. (T. Farook Thajudeen)"
