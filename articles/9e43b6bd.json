    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s government has recieved debt relief of around 8.4 billion US dollars from the time a default was declared in April 2022 to August 2024, but the banking system has repaid debt or collected reserves of 7.3 billion dollars, official data show.",
    "The debt relief over banking system repayments was about 1.11 billion US dollars.",
    "Sri Lanka stopped servicing bilateral and commercial debt on April 2022, and the central bank hiked rates previously kept artificially low rates low by printing money, helping ending the worst currency crisis in the 74-year-old history of the agency.",
    "The principal government debt arrears after default from April 2022 to August 2024 was 5.784 billion dollars and past due interest was 2.623 billion, or a total of 8.407 billion dollars, a Finance Ministry report showed.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank in the meantime had repaid debt or collected reserves (which is the same as repaying debt as it involves outflows to buy foreign assets rather than settle liabilities) from April 2022 (inclusive) to August 2024, of 3.693 billion dollars.",
    "The central bank repaid loans to the International Monetary Fund and settled swaps taken from the Bank of Bangladesh and Reserve Bank of India to effectively suppress rates and delay rate corrections.",
    "The default and the earlier forex shortages in the wake of the \u2018flexible exchanges rate\u2019 involving the loss of credibility of the peg, had also forced commercial banks to repay credit lines as lenders refused to re-finance them.",
    "Later commercial banks that had international sovereign bonds also had to build foreign reserves against provisions made for sovereign bond losses.",
    "Private banks had built reserves or repaid debt of 3.604 billion dollars from April 2022 (April inclusive) to August 2024 after the rate hike making the total outflows from the banking system 7.297 billion dollars.",
    "The excess of banking system outflows over the debt relief was only 1.11 billion dollars during the period. Sri Lanka has now started servicing China Exim Bank debt after gaining relief.",
    "Sri Lanka restructures China Exim Loans, recapitalizing US$200mn in interest",
    "Sri Lanka banking system repays debt or builds fx reserves of US$7.4bn since default",
    "The numbers do not necessarily mean that Sri Lanka could have avoided a sovereign default if there was extra financing of 1.1 billion US dollars, as rates have to be hiked to reduce domestic credit and generate resources to repay debt and restore the lost credibility of the exchange rate peg.",
    "Tax hikes also require time to work and lost market access from earlier exchange rate instability cannot be restored without a restructuring, as the IMF had already declared debt to be unsustainable.",
    "\u201cBut what it shows is that it is not that difficult to avoid a second default as long as inflationary open market operations of the central bank to target a fixed policy rate are prevented,\u201d says EN\u2019s economic columnist Bellwether.",
    "\u201cIt also show that any \u2018external resources gap\u2019 is simply a function of the domestic interest rates structure and whether a reserve collecting central bank is running deflationary or inflationary open market operations.",
    "\u201cThe practice of central banks repaying government debt pre-dated the invention of the policy rate.\u201d",
    "The outflows from private banks in particular came from the loss of confidence in the exchange rate peg and official reserve losses from money printing and had started before the actual default was declared, at least from around July 2021, data shows.",
    "Sovereign  yields soared in 2020 leading to a loss of bond market access.",
    "Sri Lanka has achieved substantial relief from bilateral creditors for the next few years that will help keep rates down as long as monetary stability is maintained.",
    "A central bank with a fixed policy rate that uses forex reserves to defend a currency automatically prints money to stop rates from going up and replaces lost rupee reserves of banks through open market operations, re-financing private credit and worsening a currency crisis.",
    "If there are no inflationary open market operations, banks have to choose between giving domestic credit and repaying debt, keeping the balance of payments unaffected by repaying debt or capital flight of any kind.",
    "There is a peculiar notion, in Sri Lanka and IMF prone countries (debunked by classical economists as far back as the early 19th century) that a central bank can somehow finance private imports or other payments (variously described as a reserves adequacy matrix or reserve for imports) without triggering a crisis under a fixed policy rate.",
    "Though Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign default was accelerated by tax cuts, Latin American countries run into debt crises purely due to rates suppressed by open market operations, usually involving failure to roll-over sterilization securities as private credit picks up including when budgets are in surplus.
