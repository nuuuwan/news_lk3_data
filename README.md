Proactive diplomacy should prioritize reassuring stakeholders of Sri Lanka‚Äôs commitment to economic stability and sovereignty while maintaining strong ties with traditional allies like China and India.

Despite its size, Sri Lanka‚Äôs location in the Indian Ocean makes it a vital player in regional and global geopolitics. The growing interest from major powers‚Äîwhether through China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative or India‚Äôs regional ambitions, controversial initiatives by the QUAD in the region‚Äîunderscores the need for Sri Lanka to carefully balance its foreign policy. A strategic and neutral stance that benefits national interests while maintaining independence is crucial.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Chemi Lhamo, Campaign Director of Free Tibet would like to see more international support for preserving the Tibetan way of life and Dharma.

Citing The Resolve Tibet Act, which US President Joe Biden signed into law in June this year, Ms Lhamo added that she was optimistic that European countries that constantly speak on human rights would not hesitate to pass similar legislation in support of Tibet.

Tibet has been under the control of China since 1951, with a government in exile, also known as the Central Tibetan Administration being set up in neighbouring India, by the 14th Dalai Lama following the Lhasa uprising of 1959.

Though he divested himself of all political authority in 2011, the Dalai Lama, who turned 89 this year, continues to be the spiritual head of Tibetans, who consider him the living incarnation of the Buddha. The search for a new Dalai Lama begins when he passes away, by senior disciples who look for visions and signs to identify the successor.
