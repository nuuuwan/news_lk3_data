  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah\u2019s headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.",
    "At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.",
    "Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.",
    "The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.",
    "After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel\u2019s intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue \u2014 further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.",
    "News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.",
    "Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.",
    "The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut\u2019s Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon\u2019s national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.",
    "Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.",
    "Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made \u201cBunker Buster\u201d guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.",
    "Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.",
    "Israel\u2019s air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.",
    "Israel\u2019s military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.",
    "To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah\u2019s senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah \u2014 successful or not \u2014 would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.",
    "Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.",
    "The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah\u2019s main headquarters, though it is located in the group\u2019s \u201csecurity quarters,\u201d a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.",
    "Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was \u201cin defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.\u201d",
    "The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.",
    "Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.",
    "The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.",
    "The scope of Israel\u2019s operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.",
    "At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to \u201ccontinue degrading Hezbollah\u201d until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.",
    "Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.",
    "An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military\u2019s goals are much narrower.",
    "In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas\u2019 military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border \u201cnot a high bar like Gaza\u201d in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.",
    "In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women \u2014 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan\u00a0 from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,\u201d one man cried out as her body emerged.",
    "Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah\u2019s weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel\u2019s military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.",
    "But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.",
    "Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut\u2019s suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group\u2019s drone unit, Mohammed Surour.",
    "People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, \u201cWe will never accept humiliation,\u201d as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group\u2019s yellow flag.",
    "Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah\u2019s top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.",
    "\u201cWe will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,\u201d Fadlallah said. \u201cThere is no place for neutrality in this battle.\u201d"
