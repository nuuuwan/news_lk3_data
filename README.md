### Why Sri Lanka needs stability, not diplomatic disruption, in London

London remains a critical hub for the financial and political community, and our High Commissioner‚Äîwhose qualifications and experience are well suited to such a complex diplomatic post‚Äîhas already been instrumental in strengthening Sri Lanka‚Äôs connections in this influential market. Removing him now would be short-sighted, not only disrupting essential progress but signalling uncertainty and inconsistency in our diplomatic priorities

As a Sri Lankan business leader with years invested in establishing our company‚Äôs presence in the UK, I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand the critical role a steady diplomatic presence plays in navigating Sri Lanka‚Äôs international standing‚Äîespecially in a place as significant as London. Recent news of the potential removal of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the UK after only one year is deeply concerning. This move risks undermining the very stability and reputation our country has struggled to regain following years of economic and political upheaval.

In Sri Lanka, mental health continues to be stigmatised, especially in educational settings. Schools are often ill-equipped to address mental health concerns, and the discussion around these issues is minimal or non-existent. Many students are reluctant to express their struggles due to fear of being labelled as weak or problematic. In turn, their distress often remains hidden until it escalates to dangerous levels

Veteran banker, Manoj Akmeemana, has chosen to share his decades long experience in banking and lending with bankers, students of banking and the public in the form of a comprehensive text under the title ‚ÄòLending: Concepts, Theory, and Practice‚Äô. The book has been produced by using modern technology of producing such texts ‚Äì two colours, graphs, flowcharts, and tables to make it user friendly. Insight capsules ‚Äì box articles in other cases ‚Äì have been added to elaborate on specific topics.

The thread-bound book in hard cover will ensure that the readers could use it for many years without running into the problem of offensive disentangled dog-eared pages which readers encounter in paperback books. But it has come in a hefty price of Rs. 4,500 (equivalent to about $ 15) which may make it only a reference book in libraries and not by many ordinary individual users.

Sri Lanka Police have launched an investigation to determine whether the recent fatal bus accident on Dunhinda Road in Badulla, was caused by a technical fault of the bus or driver error.

The incident, which involved a bus carrying a group of students of the Southern Campus of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) toppling across the road, resulted in the death of two female students, and injuries to 40 others.

The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in-charge of Badulla, Wasantha Kandewatta stated that a government analyst‚Äôs report on the bus is awaited to aid the investigation.

Preliminary assessments suggest the driver may have been operating the vehicle in third or fourth gear at the time of the accident. It is suspected that excessive speed on the steep, winding 4-kilometer stretch of road may have led the bus to skid out of control, according to police.

Moldovans were voting on Sunday in a presidential election that has been overshadowed by meddling allegations and could see Moscow claw back influence in the country at a time when it is trying to draw closer to the European Union.

Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu, who has accelerated the nation‚Äôs push to leave Moscow‚Äôs orbit and join the EU, faces Alexandr Stoianoglo, an ex-prosecutor general backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party.

The fortunes of Sandu, who set Moldova on the long path of EU accession talks in June, will be closely followed in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state hoping to join, re-elected a ruling party seen as increasingly pro-Russian.

Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).

Moldova‚Äôs future has been thrown into the political and diplomatic spotlight as the war in neighbouring Ukraine rages to the east.

### Sri Lanka crowned Hong Kong Sixes 2024 champions

Akhlaq was eventually dismissed by Madhusanka in the final over. The next highest score for Pakistan came from skipper Faheem Ashraf, who made 13 runs off four balls.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs bowling was impressive, with Lakshan and Tharindu Rathnayake taking two wickets each. Nimesh Vimukthi and Lihuru Madhusanka also contributed with a wicket apiece.

### The death penalty for children who protested against the cost of living in Nigeria?: Appeared in court

Children protest cost of living Nigeria face death penalty court case controversy

üü©

Shocking reports have revealed that 29 children who were involved in the struggle against the increase in livelihoods in Nigeria could be sentenced to death.

The Nigerian government has imposed several allegations, including treason allegations against 76 people who were protesting against the cost of living.

The public is engaged in a series of protests in Nigeria due to frustration over the increase in cost of living.

The death penalty came into effect in Nigeria in 1976, but no one has been convicted since 1996.

Nigeria's Child Rights Act has not been allowed to investigate children and produce a court, a lawyer said.

Therefore, it is wrong to bring the boys to the court.
