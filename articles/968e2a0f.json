    "Asserting that India is on the path to becoming the world\u2019s third-largest economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the country must remain alert to its own economic priorities amid the instability and uncertainty facing the world economy.",
    "Modi\u2019s remarks came just days after US President Donald Trump called India a \u201cdead economy\u201d after announcing a 25% tariff on the import of Indian goods along with an unspecified \u201cpenalty\u201d for buying Russian military equipment and crude oil.",
    "Addressing a public meeting in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi on Saturday, Modi said, \u201cAs we talk about economic progress, I want to draw your attention to the current global scenario. The world economy is facing instability and uncertainty. In such times, countries are focusing solely on their own interests. India, too, is on the path to becoming the world\u2019s third-largest economy and must remain alert to its own economic priorities.\u201d",
    "The prime minister also made a renewed push for \u2018Swadeshi\u2019, stressing that every party, leader and citizen must work to promote indigenous goods if \u201cwe want India to become the third-largest economy\u201d.",
    "Making a special appeal to traders and shopkeepers, the prime minister said, \u201cAt a time when the world is going through uncertainty, let us take a pledge to sell only Swadeshi goods from our shops and markets. Promoting made in India goods will be the truest service to the country.\u201d",
    "He also urged people to be conscious consumers, saying, \u201cWhatever we buy, we should ask ourselves -- has an Indian toiled to make this? If it has been made by the sweat of our people, with their skills, that product is Swadeshi for us. We must adopt the mantra of \u2018Vocal for Local\u2019.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe feeling of Swadeshi in every action will define our future. This will also be a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. Only through collective effort can we fulfil the dream of a developed India,\u201d Modi said.",
    "The prime minister, who was addressing a massive public gathering on Saturday in Banauli village, highlighted the government\u2019s farmer-centric policies in detail. He said the government is constantly working for the well-being of farmers.",
    "Calling for a national movement to support local products, the prime minister said, \u201cThis is not just about Modi saying it, every Indian should say this -- if we want India to become the third-largest economy, every political party and every leader, keeping aside their hesitations, must work in the nation\u2019s interest and awaken the spirit of Swadeshi among the people.\u201d",
    "The US tariff action is being seen as a pressure tactic to get New Delhi to agree to demands made by the US, which has, in recent days, got favourable trade deals with major partners like Japan, the UK and the European Union.",
    "India has especially toughened its stance on extending duty concessions on agri products, dairy and GM foods in the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US.",
    "With the US not able to finalise a deal with India so far, Trump on Thursday announced the imposition of an additional 25% import duty on Indian goods entering American markets from August 7. Earlier, this duty was to be imposed from August 1.",
    "The President has also not specified the penalty that he announced against India for buying crude oil and military equipment from Russia. In the backdrop of Trump\u2019s \u201cdead economy\u201d barb at India, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had told Parliament on Thursday that India is the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy and widely expected to be the \u201cthird largest economy\u201d in a few years.",
    "Goyal also said India will take all necessary steps to safeguard and promote national interest and that the implications of the US tariffs are being examined. In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.\u201d His remarks were echoed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who said President Trump has stated a \u201cfact\u201d, prompting a strong condemnation from the BJP. While announcing the tariff, Trump described India\u2019s trade policies as \u201cmost strenuous and obnoxious\u201d."
