    "ECSL chairperson says as of 3 December, only 1,985 out of 8,361 candidates and 106 out of 690 political parties or independent groups have complied",
    "Stresses ECSL cannot extend deadline due to provisions under the Election Expenditure Act 2023",
    "Says non-compliance will lead to legal action with files referred to AG and police",
    "Warns possible candidacy in upcoming LG polls may also be affected if legal action is initiated for non-submission of expenditure reports",
    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) has revealed that only 23% of Parliamentary election candidates have submitted their expenditure reports, with the deadline set to expire at midnight today.",
    "In a statement issued on Thursday, ESCL Chairperson R.M.A.L. Ratnayake expressed concern over the low compliance rate, highlighting that as of 3 December, just 1,985 out of 8,361 candidates had submitted their reports. Among political parties and independent groups, the figures were equally disappointing, with only 106 of the 690 required submissions being made.",
    "Ratnayake emphasised that the ECSL has no authority to extend the deadline, as stipulated by the Election Expenditure Act 2023. \u201cThe relevant time period allowed under the Act cannot be extended,\u201d he clarified, urging all candidates to meet the midnight deadline to avoid legal repercussions.",
    "He also warned that failure to submit the reports would result in serious consequences. \u201cUnder Section 8(a), legal action will be initiated upon the instructions of the Attorney General, and files will be handed over to the police for action under the Penal Code,\u201d he said. Additionally, persons who fail to comply may also be barred from contesting in the upcoming local government elections, he noted.",
    "The ECSL reiterated that all candidates, not just those elected, are obligated to submit their reports. To facilitate last-minute compliance, the ECSL has established special units in all districts to receive reports. These units, which are typically open until 6 p.m., have extended their hours to midnight today. Submissions sent via registered post on the deadline will also be accepted, the Chairperson confirmed.",
    "The Commission reminded candidates that failure to comply constitutes an offence under the Election Commission Regulation Act and called on all concerned to fulfil their legal obligations promptly."
