Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Voting matters regardless of political views. Economic policies affect daily life, including housing, transportation, education, healthcare, and taxes. Political decisions impact personal freedoms, opportunities, and quality of life. Voting gives citizens a voice in shaping their country's future.

🟩

Why do you need to vote, even if you like politics?

Are you like this, "I don't like politics,"?"I don't care about politics, I am living,"?

Do you think you don't have to afford to politics?But did you know that politics would affect your everyday life?

Today, young people have the same problem with stabilization.

Many people have still been a dream that many have still been a dream of buying a car, buying a car, rent their own home or rent home.

With the economic situation in the country, you may not be able to meet your expectations on the salary you take. How do you get involved with your expectations this year?

Politics intervenes until selecting a land for building a house. When you get a loan to create a home, the debt interest rates you have to pay for the economic situation in the country. It is through the decision to make your home and the prices of the products and services needed to make.

### Politicisation of Foreign Service: Multidimensional and systemic challenge

Much of what is sought to be achieved on the foreign relations front would depend on who the ‘right persons’ are to be entrusted with the responsibility of representing Sri Lanka. This is not about missions only, it is also about what should have been the diplomatic powerhouse of Sri Lanka – the Foreign Ministry. I mean the collective, not one individual. It would do well to consider merit alongside probity, astuteness, temperament, maturity and resilience as among criteria for appointment of right persons. These are missing attributes in the Foreign Service nowadays, temperament undoubtedly topping the list. What is denoted by ‘right’ here is the right mix, and not being politically on the right side. The latter of course was the cause of many diplomatic misadventures in the recent past

I have worked with all the Executive Presidents except President Gotabaya Rajapaksa (I have no idea whether it was his luck or mine) in different capacities during my tenure in the public service and even afterwards. The way they managed or rather mis-managed the economy was different from one to the other. Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa’s management style was unique, flawless and foolproof.

The National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force (NAHTTF) has issued a warning regarding a spike in cases of Sri Lankans being referred to cybercrime camps in Myanmar.

According to the NAHTTF, recent reports have revealed that Sri Lankan citizens, particularly those living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), are being targeted by human traffickers who falsely promise high-paying jobs, particularly in the IT sector.

As per NAHTTF’s latest findings, traffickers lure skilled IT professionals under the pretense of lucrative foreign job opportunities. Victims are taken to places like Dubai for supposed interviews, only to be illegally transported and forced into cybercrime operations in Myanmar.

Investigations into these cybercrime camps have uncovered severe human rights abuses, with detainees facing both mental and brutal physical torture, including electrocution, the NAHTTF said in a statement.
