    "Leader of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance and Gampaha District candidate, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera stated that the public should entrust the responsibility of forming a strong opposition to the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance after the upcoming parliamentary elections.",
    "He made these remarks during a public meeting held yesterday (20) in Panadura.",
    "\u201cNow our President Anura Kumara is in a lot of trouble because he became President without an economic plan.\u201d He stated that someone else had the plan, but they are not giving him the book, and that a few pages are missing from it.",
    "\u201cNow, the President needs to call and ask what to do next. We are not like that,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe propose to Anura Kumara that we are coming to the opposition, and you will form your government. We will help you with any good work.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe has already said that the salary of government employees will be increased every six months. We will help with that. He also promised petrol at Rs. 200, and we will support that too,\u201d the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 leader added.",
    "Jayaweera mentioned that they had advised Anura Kumara not to make statements about stolen funds hidden in Uganda, as it could be perceived as a joke.",
    "He added that while there may be no funds hidden in Uganda, his alliance is aware of the funds that were taken out of Sri Lanka.",
    "He further explained, \u201cOur program outlines how to bring it back, what legal measures are necessary, and how commissions should be established. It\u2019s all in our plan.\u201d",
    "Jayaweera expressed that Anura Kumara has the ability to take necessary measures to recover the lost wealth. He further stated that there is no reason to appoint Sajith Premadasa as the leader of the opposition again.",
    "\u201cTherefore, it\u2019s up to the people to decide that we don\u2019t need him as the leader of the opposition,\u201d he said."
