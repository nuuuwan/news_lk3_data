  "original_body_lines": [
    "For generations, the water level of the Iranamadu Reservoir has been the true measure of northern Sri Lanka\u2019s fortune. This ancient tank, a cornerstone of life in Kilinochchi, tells a story of heritage, conflict, and now, an extraordinary rebirth facilitated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).",
    "Once a casualty of a decades-long civil war, Iranamadu is today a powerful symbol of post-conflict renaissance, fueled by strategic investment and a revolutionary community-led model that is turning subsistence farmers into agri-business owners.",
    "The conflict from 1983 to 2009 shattered the region\u2019s infrastructure. Iranamadu, the largest reservoir in the Northern Province and the lifeline for 40% of Kilinochchi\u2019s population, was severely wounded. Even before the war peaked, its decay had begun. A major slip in its downstream embankment in 1983 forced authorities to curtail its storage capacity to just 70%, crippling the livelihoods of thousands of farm families who depended on it to irrigate over 20,000 acres of paddy and upland crops.",
    "With peace in 2009 came the daunting task of rebuilding. At the request of the government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with its mandate for critical infrastructure, identified the resurrection of Iranamadu as an urgent priority. Then under the Jaffna Kilinochchi Water Supply Project, a comprehensive reconstruction was undertaken between 2010 and 2016.",
    "The mission was clear: restore not just the structure, but its potential. Engineers strengthened the 2.75km embankment, rebuilt spillways, and restored sluice gates. The result was a tangible victory: the reservoir\u2019s capacity expanded by 12.5%, raising its full supply level and unlocking millions of gallons of lost potential.",
    "Life-giving water from the Iranamadu system flows through the canals",
    "A local farmer utilszes water from the Iranamadu project to nourish her crops",
    "Yet, the true success of this rebirth lies beyond its construction. It is found in the innovative, sustainable governance model that was revived and enhanced.",
    "The project restored an abandoned lift irrigation scheme but powered it with a modern twist: solar panels. This forward-thinking move eliminated energy costs, ensuring the system\u2019s long-term viability. More powerfully, the project empowered the very people it was built to serve.",
    "The Provincial Irrigation Department provides administration, but the financial and operational maintenance of the asset is entrusted to the farmer beneficiaries themselves. This is not a burden they bear, but an investment they proudly make.",
    "\u201cWhen we look at the calculations in a purely economic perspective, the yield per acre now significantly outweighs the maintenance cost,\u201d one farmer told The Island Financial Review.",
    "\u201cSecured water has transformed us from subsistence farmers into commercial agri-businesspeople. We now cultivate high value crops ; paddy, vegetables, fruits, groundnuts with confidence. The cost we bear is a direct investment into a system that generates substantial returns and we are happy about this operation model,\u201d he said.",
    "The story of Iranamadu is a hybrid narrative. It is a story of how ADB\u2019s post-conflict investment, when executed with respect for local context and community, can do more than rebuild a broken structure; it can restore a broken economy and empower a people to write their own prosperous new chapter.",
    "It is a living testament to what a public-community partnership can achieve, proving that the most sustainable resource is not just water, but human hope and ingenuity.",
    "The Asian Development Bank approved an additional loan of $120 million for the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply Project. This supplemented an initial $90 million loan approved in 2010. The overall project cost was estimated at $266 million. The financing supported the construction of a desalination plant and associated infrastructure. A separate technical assistance grant of $500,000 was also provided for institutional capacity development. The project is now under operation as expected.",
