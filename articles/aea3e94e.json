    "Speaking after assuming duties at the Ministry of Public Security today (19), Minister Wijepala emphasized the need for a disciplined and law-abided police force to build a fair and just society.",
    "The Minister also highlighted the importance of addressing challenges faced by junior police officers and resolving public grievances related to police services.",
    "\u201cWe need to create a law-abiding and disciplined police force. Without that, achieving a fair society is challenging. There are several issues with the recruitment process. After a thorough review, we will ensure proper recruitment to bring in the personnel needed to empower the police. Without adequate manpower, tackling crime, drug trafficking, and underworld activities will remain difficult,\u201d he stated.",
