    "The 45th National Conference of Chartered Accountants took place yesterday (16) in Colombo, featuring a rare gathering of three former Presidents of Sri Lanka\u2014Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Maithripala Sirisena, and Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2014on the same stage.",
    "The former leaders shared their views on the country\u2019s political landscape and answered questions presented to them at the conference, making the event a highlight in the nation\u2019s political discourse.",
    "Speaking during the event, former President Maithripala Sirisena reflected on the political state of the country, emphasizing the need for integrity at all levels of government.",
    "He remarked: \u201cA country cannot progress simply because its ruler is good. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet must also be clean. There must be no room for corruption and fraud. I don\u2019t like some people blaming politicians that the country has been corrupt for the last 74 years. I completely reject that. It\u2019s not just about blaming politicians.\u201d",
    "\u201cPoliticians should also be trained from the beginning, from the Ministry Secretary to the President\u2019s Secretary. The citizens must also play their part in building a better nation. Now when you go to vote, you can\u2019t work without alcohol. You need a good meal, you need a good bus. That\u2019s the situation\u201d, Sirisena added.",
    "When asked to offer advice to a future president, each former leader shared their thoughts:",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke on leadership, drawing a comparison between corporate and political leadership. \u201c Mr. Panditaratne became the President of UNP. He was actually like the right hand of the President. Mahaweli project was successful because of him. If they join the United National Party, these people can go up. A CEO and a president have different roles. Steve Jobs could never be President of the United States. Only Donald Trump managed to cross that line,\u201d he said.",
    "Maithripala Sirisena expressed optimism about the future, humorously saying, \u201cNone of you have run for election yet, but I hope that someday one of your Chartered Accountants will become the President of this country.\u201d",
    "Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga emphasized the need for educated and capable individuals to enter politics. \u201cDoors should be opened for everyone. Educated and competent people should be encouraged to lead. I am no longer involved in politics but am focused on building new leaders,\u201d she said.",
    "Maithripala Sirisena addressed the issue of corruption within ministries, noting that it is often a collaborative effort. \u201cThere are educated individuals who steal. Ministers can\u2019t engage in corruption without the knowledge of ministry secretaries and chief accountants. It becomes a chain reaction, and then they all get involved,\u201d he explained.",
    "When asked about his decision to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister during the \u201cGood Governance\u201d government, Sirisena humorously deflected, stating, \u201cI could answer that, but I\u2019m not sure if Mr. Ranil will be pleased. If anyone wants to know, they can ask me privately. It wasn\u2019t solely my decision, but I take responsibility. Being a leader means facing many tough decisions.\u201d"
