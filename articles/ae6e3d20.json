  "original_body_lines": [
    "Twenty Indian crew members and a Sri Lankan are stranded on board the Dali, the container ship that collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. For the last seven weeks, they have been confined to the vessel due to an ongoing probe. With their phones confiscated, they cannot even pay bills for their families back home, the Indian media reported.",
    "\u201cThey can\u2019t do any online banking. They can\u2019t pay their bills at home. They don\u2019t have any of their data or anyone\u2019s contact information, so they\u2019re really isolated right now. They just can\u2019t reach out to the folks they need to, or even look at pictures of their children before they go to sleep. It\u2019s really a sad situation,\u201d Joshua Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, a non-profit organisation that works to protect the rights of mariners, was quoted as saying by the BBC.",
    "Twenty-one sailors, 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, are stuck on board the Dali, a container vessel that collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, since March 26 due to the ongoing investigation. That\u2019s seven weeks.",
    "The 21 on board were left without communication for weeks with their families, causing significant hardship for crew members with young children at home, and the outside world, as their mobile phones had been confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a part of the investigation into the crash.",
    "Tuesday\u2019s initial report by federal safety investigators raises several unanswered questions.",
    "For instance, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) outlined four power failures experienced by the 290-metre-long ship, reported ABC News.",
    "The causes of three of these failures remain unclear, including two that happened just before the crash.",
    "Despite explosives being used to remove part of the bridge from the ship\u2019s hull on Monday, the crew still cannot leave the ship.",
    "The crew of 21, including 20 Indians, will remain on board until the probe into the incident is completed, reported ABC News.",
    "The US authorities have already begun interviewing the crew members on board the vessel, and have collected documents and voyage data recorder extracts as part of their investigation.",
    "The crew, consisting of 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan, couldn\u2019t leave the ship due to visa restrictions, reported the BBC.",
    "The 21 crew members on the Dali are facing emotional distress, and they are also fearful of personal criminal liability.",
    "The sailors\u2019 situations caught the attention of their two unions -- the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen.",
    "In a statement together on May 11, they mentioned that \u201cmorale has understandably dipped\u201d, driven by \u201cunfounded fear of personal criminal liability\u201d and emotional distress.",
    "The unions also asked for the quick return of the sailors\u2019 mobile phones so that they could connect with their family and make other arrangements at home, like paying their bills.",
    "Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, stressed that regardless of how long the investigation lasts, the rights of crew members and their welfare should not be infringed upon.",
    "\u201cWe call on the authorities to be mindful that seafarers utilise mobile devices to conduct personal business for bill payments, and, more important, transfer money to their home country to sustain families. Crew members are becoming demoralised without the basic tools we all take for granted,\u201d said Heindel, reported BBC.",
    "Andrew Middleton, from the Apostleship of Sea -- a programme that ministers to ships coming through Baltimore -- shared his experience visiting the sailors two weeks prior.",
    "\u201cOnce we broke the ice and got everyone to say their name and what part of India they were from, and talk about if they were married or had children, we got the ball rolling. They were willing to kind of poke fun at one another a little bit.... we did our best to get them laughing and joking, hopefully to take their minds off things for even a few minutes,\u201d Middleton was quoted as saying by BBC.",
    "For now, the phones of 21 crew members on the ship, Dali, have been replaced with new ones, and Synergy Marine -- Dali\u2019s Singapore-based management company -- said that the crew members had unlimited use of satellite communication so that they could be in touch with the family, reported the ABC News.",
    "The crew members were also given care packages, including Indian snacks and handmade quilts.",
    "Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, Dali\u2019s Singapore-based management company, said the crew is \u201cholding up well\u201d and that company representatives dispatched to Baltimore have been \u201cchecking on them constantly, from day one\u201d, reported BBC.",
    "The Dali collided with the 2.6-km-long four-lane Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26. The 984-foot cargo ship was bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka.",
    "Six construction workers who went missing after the Francis Scott Key Bridge in US\u2019s Baltimore city collapsed are presumed dead.",
    "The ship contained thousands of tonnes of steel and cement. After the hit, the cement and steel fell into the Patapsco River and left the ship stranded.",
    "The bridge was 8,636 feet (2,632 m) long and carried an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually.",
    "The Francis Scott Key Bridge serves as a crucial transportation link in the Washington metropolitan area. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore, which is 40 miles from Washington. The bridge was built at an approximate cost of $60.3 million."
