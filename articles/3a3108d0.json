    "According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Rs. 25,000 per farmer is being provided as a subsidy for the purchase of fertilizer required for paddy cultivation during the ongoing \u2018Maha\u2019 Season.",
    "However, reports indicate that despite more than 20 days having passed since the start of paddy cultivation in the eastern region, including Ampara, farmers are yet to receive the fertilizer subsidy.",
    "The government has completed the first phase of the fertilizer subsidy, covering 86,162 hectares across 23 districts.",
