    "Says letter reaffirms the crucial role of UN in mediating global conflicts and reflects growing call for justice and peace",
    "Recalls SL\u2019s consistent backing of Palestinian rights at the UN and says country has proud history of upholding international peace and justice",
    "Stresses refusal to sign letter signals unfortunate shift away from such values when global instability demands SL remain committed to multilateral diplomacy",
    "Requests SL to reconsider position and align foreign policy with efforts that uphold dialogue and fairness",
    "Former Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar expressed deep concern over Sri Lanka\u2019s recent decision not to sign the joint letter issued by 105 countries condemning Israel\u2019s ban on UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres from entering the country.",
    "He said the letter reaffirms the crucial role of the UN in mediating global conflicts and providing humanitarian assistance, particularly in the ongoing Middle East crisis, and reflects the growing international call for justice and peace.",
    "In a statement released over the weekend, Bakeer Markar emphasised Sri Lanka\u2019s longstanding tradition of supporting multilateralism, justice, and peace at the international level, particularly in its consistent backing of Palestinian rights at the UN. He noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s refusal to sign this joint declaration represents a stark departure from its historical diplomatic stance.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka has a proud history of upholding international peace and justice, especially in conflict resolution and standing up for the oppressed,\u201d Bakeer Markar said. \u201cOur decision not to sign this letter signals an unfortunate shift away from those values at a time when global instability demands that we remain committed to multilateral diplomacy,\u201d he added.",
    "He urged the Sri Lankan Government to reconsider its position and align the country\u2019s foreign policy with efforts that uphold dialogue, fairness, and respect for international law. \u201cSri Lanka cannot afford to remain silent on matters of global importance, especially when it comes to supporting institutions like the UN, which play a critical role in safeguarding peace and human rights worldwide,\u201d Bakeer Markar noted.",
    "The former MP\u2019s statement also called for Sri Lanka to reassert its place on the world stage as a consistent voice for peace, justice, and multilateral cooperation."
