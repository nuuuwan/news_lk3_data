    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) parliamentarian Vijitha Herath stepped down yesterday as a member of the special parliamentary committee to probe the country\u2019s financial bankruptcy.",
    "In a letter to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene, Herath said that expecting a committee primarily composed of individuals who contributed to the country\u2019s financial bankruptcy to thoroughly investigate its true causes and provide relevant recommendations would be fruitless.",
    "On 6 July Herath along with 12 other MPs were named as members of the committee chaired by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam. Other members include State Minister D.V. Chanaka, Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, MP Eran Wickramaratne, MP Ashok Abeysinghe, MP Jayantha Ketagoda, MP Harshana Rajakaruna, MP Pradeep Undugoda, MP Sanjeeva Edirimanna, MP Nalaka Kottegoda, MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, and MP Ranjith Bandara.",
    "In his letter, Herath told the Speaker it is no secret that the names proposed by the ruling party to this committee have now given rise to controversy. \u201cIn this situation, it is futile to participate in or represent such a committee.\u201d the NPP MP said."
