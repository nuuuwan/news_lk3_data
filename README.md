### Pearl ship accident: Singapore shipping company refuses to pay a billion US $ 1 billion

*2025-09-23 10:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/225816) · `ta`

The X-Bruss Feeders Shipping Company, headquartered in Singapore, has refused to pay a billion US $ 1 billion compensation by the Sri Lankan court for the environmental impact of the MV X-Press Pearl, which was submerged in the Colombo port of Sri Lanka in 2021.

In an interview, X-Brussy CEO, Schmuel Yoscovits, said that the compensation would have a negative impact on global shipping.

He also noted that the payment of such a huge amount of money would cause a "dangerous precedent" for such incidents in the future.

MV X-Brussy Pearl, registered in Singapore, set fire to the sea near the Colombo port in May 2021.

The fire caused by nitric acid leaks, which lasted about two weeks. The ship then sank into the Sri Lankan waters. The accident led to the worst maritime environmental pollution in Sri Lanka's history.

The denial is expected to further increase the legal and diplomatic issues between the Sri Lankan government and the shipping company.
