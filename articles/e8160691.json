    "Leading stationery manufacturer ProMate Sri Lanka participated in an impactful book collection drive recently to help visually impaired students pursue their studies, engage in communication, and interact with the world. ProMate is a product of one of the most famed and oldest pioneer book publishers in Sri Lanka, Ratna Publishers.",
    "Due to rapid inflation and rising costs, the price of school supplies has also increased by a staggering 300%. This has exacerbated existing challenges for students, especially schools for the blind across the country faced with sourcing the necessary paper for their students.",
    "It is a known fact that the enrollment of visually impaired students at schools is dismal and few receive a proper education. Braille paper is expensive and often in short supply. ProMate identified the importance and urgency of upcycling used exercise books for their education, and also as a means to expand access to learning. After all, to a visually impaired student, a used exercise book is like brand new.",
    "Supporting this worthy cause, ProMate lent its extensive branch network as collection points for the public to donate used CR notebooks. It was noted that each book provides six pages that can be used for Braille writing. By upcycling used books, ProMate realized that it could maximize resources for visually impaired students\u2019 education.",
    "ProMate estimates that papers worth LKR 500 million are discarded annually in Sri Lanka. Upcycling them for social good is also environmentally and economically beneficial. ProMate collected used books, trimmed the pages to A4 size, and distributed them to the special schools most in need. ProMate supplied the A4 sheets to schools based on the number of students.",
    "The company also aims to deliver papers using cast-off books to aid Braille education nationwide, as the materials will help hundreds of students continue their studies despite fiscal challenges.",
    "As part of the campaign to create awareness for the cause and educate the public on upcycling used books, the company also collaborated with advertising agency Ogilvy to create a heartwarming video. The video depicts how students can pass down used books to benefit those who are visually impaired, just as families hand down toys or clothes between siblings.",
    "Volunteer Sri Lanka, a non-profit, also partnered to expand the reach of drop-off locations using its volunteer base across provinces, widening the collection network. The initiative enables Sri Lankans nationwide to come together and support the education of visually impaired children, enabling the public to uplift disadvantaged communities.",
