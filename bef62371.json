    "A former Sri Lanka Army sniper has been arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), over his suspected involvement in the plot to help notorious underworld figure \u2018Harak Kata\u2019 to escape from the custody of the CID.",
    "The 33-year-old suspect, a former Commando Sniper, was arrested by officers of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) at Godagama in Matara, and has been handed over to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) for further investigations.",
    "On 10 September, Nadun Chinthaka, alias \u2018Harak Kata\u2019, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers\u2019 teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable, who is still evading arrest.",
    "The police officer in question, named Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara, remains at large since 10 September.",
    "During the questioning, \u2018Harak Kata\u2019 had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice \u2013 the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspect\u2019s protection.",
    "Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officer\u2019s firearm leading to a scuffle.",
