    "The country\u2019s largest humanitarian organisation, Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) said it is gravely concerned about the escalating flood situation caused by the Southwest monsoon rains, which have affected over 250,000 individuals and 66,000 families across the country.",
    "The catastrophic weather conditions have resulted in 24 fatalities, with one person still reported missing.",
    "The monsoon rains have wreaked havoc, particularly in the districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Matara, Galle, Ratnapura, and Puttalam. Thousands of families have been forced to evacuate their homes and seek refuge in safe locations such as temples, churches, and other public places, with many inaccessible areas in the country. Many homes have sustained severe damage, power supplies have been disrupted, and children are unable to attend school due to closures.",
    "In response to the disaster, SLRCS swiftly deployed its experienced relief teams across the affected districts. These teams are providing immediate first-aid assistance, supporting the evacuation process alongside public authorities, and addressing the urgent needs of the displaced populations. Critical requirements include safe drinking water, sleeping mats, bedsheets, sanitary napkins and other hygiene products, clothing, medical aid, mosquito nets, food, school stationery and more.",
    "Sri Lanka Red Cross Society Director General Dr. Mahesh Gunasekara said: \u201cThe monsoons are active, and heavy rains are expected in the upcoming week, even though the rains have stopped for the time being. Thereby, coordinated relief efforts are crucial, because of the high and overwhelming magnitude of this disaster. Our volunteers are working tirelessly to support the affected communities, but we urgently require additional resources to continue our life-saving work. We call upon the generosity of individuals and organisations to join us at this crucial time.\u201d",
    "The SLRCS is appealing for immediate donations to sustain its relief operations and provide essential aid to those impacted by the floods. Contributions can be made through the GiveAsia platform, ensuring that every donation directly assists those in dire need.",
    "For more information or to make a donation, please visit the SLRCS website: www.redcross.lk or contact +94 714333331 for direct donations."
