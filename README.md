Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is under fire after buying a multi-million-dollar cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis.

Albanese made the purchase months out from an election in which the cost of living and housing are key issues.

The move has sparked backlash from across the political divide - with his opponents calling it “tone deaf” and some within his own party anonymously telling local media it left them “gobsmacked”.

Albanese defended his decision, saying he “knows what it is like to struggle” but bought the luxury property to be close to his fiancee Jodie Haydon’s family on the New South Wales Central Coast.

Property records show the four-bedroom, three-bathroom, and three-carport property in Copacabana - which has panoramic views - was sold for A$4.3m ($2.9m, £2.2m) last month, but the purchase is yet to settle.

### Govt. to present Vote-on-Account amid election constraints

*2024-10-16 04:27:23* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Govt-to-present-Vote-on-Account-amid-election-constraints/56-768011) · `en`

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday confirmed that the Government will present a three-month Vote-on-Account, citing time constraints due to the upcoming General elections on 14 November.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said the Vote-on-Account will serve as a temporary financial measure to cover Government expenses till a comprehensive Budget can be presented in early 2025.

“As Parliament scheduled to reconvene on 21 November, there is no sufficient time to prepare and present a Budget for 2025 in December itself. The idea now is to present a Vote-on-Account,” he explained.

Herath pointed out that Sri Lanka, which usually presents its annual Budget in November is taking this step to ensure smooth Government operations during the transition following the elections.

### This election is about the “Opposition”

*2024-10-16 04:26:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/This-election-is-about-the-Opposition/4-768010) · `en`

This election is therefore about having a politically serious and a critically sharp, effectively “national” people’s Opposition – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Nominations for the 2024 November 14 parliamentary elections were closed island wide, on 11 October. Altogether, around 690 nomination papers have been accepted for the 52 electoral districts. Phenomenal rise to power of the JVP/NPP at the September Presidential elections has sealed the fate of over two dozen politicians, some of whom would not have wanted to leave politics yet. Not very surprisingly, since the 1936 State Council elections when D.M won the Hambantota seat, Rajapaksas are wholly absent in Hambantota for the first time, this election. On the wild side of it, there are numerous amoebic groups that have come out as “new” political parties and independent groups contesting most districts.
