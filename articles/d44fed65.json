  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lankan satellite operator SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Ltd. has welcomed the long-awaited public acknowledgment, after 13 years, confirming that the SupremeSAT satellite was successfully launched and that no government funds were used for the project.",
    "In an official statement, its Chairman R.M. Manivannan emphasized that these facts have been a matter of public record since 2012. However, politically motivated narratives have sought to deny them for over a decade.",
    "Despite this overdue recognition, certain individuals continue to make unfounded claims about the company, focusing particularly on the satellite\u2019s location and SupremeSAT\u2019s corporate accounts, he said.",
    "For clarity, SupremeSAT confirmed that the satellite remains in orbit at 87.5\u00b0 East, precisely where it was positioned upon launch.",
    "\u201cDiscussions about our private company accounts, conducted without our participation, are both inappropriate and misleading, especially when driven by those lacking the technical understanding and operational insight necessary to comment on a complex, globally integrated business such as ours,\u201d the statement said.",
    "SupremeSAT operates under stringent contractual, regulatory, and technical obligations across multiple jurisdictions. Its operations meet and exceed internationally recognized standards in performance, compliance, and transparency, consistent with leading global satellite operators, it said.",
    "\u201cWhile we remain unaffected by baseless claims, we are firm in expressing our dissatisfaction with the continued misrepresentation of our work. SupremeSAT will remain focused on delivering its projects, honoring its commitments, and upholding its reputation as a trusted, world-class operator in the space sector,\u201d it added."
