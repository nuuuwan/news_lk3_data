Peruvian former President Alejandro Toledo was convicted of taking bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht and sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison on Monday.

The verdict marks Peru’s first high-profile conviction related to Brazil’s continent-spanning Lava Jato corruption scandal.

Toledo, a 78-year-old economist who holds a doctorate from Stanford University, governed the Andean nation between 2001 and 2006.

He was convicted of taking $35 million in bribes from the company formerly known as Odebrecht, according to prosecutors, in exchange for letting it win a contract to build the road that now connects Peru’s southern coast with an Amazonian area in western Brazil.

During the year-long trial, Toledo denied the money-laundering and collusion charges.

Odebrecht, now known as Novonor, was at the center of Latin America’s largest graft scandal, after admitting in 2016 that it bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts.

### Sri Lanka’s export economy heavily concentrated around apparel: IPS

*2024-10-22 13:32:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-export-economy-heavily-concentrated-around-apparel-ips-184407/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s goods and services exports accounted for nearly 20.4 percent of GDP in 2023, with manufacturing exports contributing 14 percent, the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) said, noting however that the country’s export economy remains heavily concentrated around industrial goods, particularly apparel.

IPS said in a statement that industrial goods—primarily apparel—make up 77 percent of export income, while agricultural exports contribute just 22 percent. This lack of diversification has left Sri Lanka vulnerable, with its economy highly dependent on apparel and traditional agricultural sectors like tea and rubber, the institute said.

These vulnerabilities, exacerbated by recent economic challenges, raise the critical question of whether reforms in trade, energy, and agriculture can provide the boost needed for recovery, IPS said citing talking points raised at a recent event organised by institute to launch its State of the Economy 2024 report.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has generated a 2,184 million dollar balance of payments surplus up to August 2024, running slightly ahead of last year, official data show.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate amid deflationary policy since scrapping a surrender rule in 2024.

A pegged central bank has to run deflationary monetary policy (selling securities held by the agency to the banking system to curtail domestic credit from rupees generated through from dollar purchases) to generate a balance of payments surplus.

When a BOP surplus (every day or every week) is generated by the central bank it is easy to allow the exchange rate to appreciate by purchasing less than the excess dollars created by deflationary policy.
