    "\u201cFrom Panama to Pandora\u201d will still read like a road that bends away from Hulftsdorp",
    "Despite new laws and action plans, Sri Lanka\u2019s response to the Pandora Papers has yielded press releases but no prosecutions \u2014 leaving Hulftsdorp absent from the accountability trail",
    "ICIJ\u2019s leaks sparked loud announcements, interagency hand-offs and new laws. Four years on, Sri Lanka has asset portals and press releases \u2014 but still no public indictments from Pandora. Where, exactly, does this investigation lead?",
    "Four years after the ICIJ\u2019s Pandora Papers exposed offshore holdings linked to Sri Lankan political figures, the country\u2019s legal response remains stalled. While the Anti-Corruption Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2025\u20132029) have expanded the formal framework, no indictments or tax outcomes tied to Pandora have been brought before court. The article uses the Lasantha Wickrematunge case to illustrate how prosecutorial volatility erodes public trust and underscores the wider pattern of announcements without enforcement. With a new Chief Justice and sharper statutory tools, the institutional architecture exists; yet outcomes depend on whether charge sheets are filed, defended and seen to conclusion. Unless reforms are tested in open court, Sri Lanka risks repeating the cycle where global leaks produce committees and portals but not convictions, leaving Hulftsdorp absent from the story.",
    "\u201cFirst came the Panama Papers then the Pandora Papers,\u201d Groundviews warned in December 2021 \u2014 and, as usual, \u201cafter the furore\u2026 the charges are all but forgotten.\u201d[1] The names were public; deadlines were proclaimed; committees were formed. Yet Hulftsdorp remains conspicuously absent from the story.",
    "The ICIJ files tied Nirupama Rajapaksa and Thirukumar Nadesan to offshore companies and trusts holding high-value overseas assets; later, Tiran Alles \u2014 then Public Security Minister \u2014 was identified as owning London flats via two BVI companies, the first sitting Sri Lankan minister flagged in the trove.[2][3] None of this is per se illegal; the public-interest questions are source of wealth, tax treatment, money-laundering risk, and conflicts with asset declarations.",
    "CIABOC opened a probe in October 2021 and filed an interim report in November 2021 while bank records were still being gathered; strands were referred to the CID for treatment under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. No Pandora-linked indictments have been publicly filed.[4]",
    "The Inland Revenue Department was tasked in October 2024 to run a special investigation into Pandora-named persons and companies. The IRD said it had begun \u2014 \u201cresearch stage\u201d \u2014 but has published no outcomes.[5]",
    "In early 2025, Attorney-General Parinda Ranasinghe Jr advised that several suspects connected to proceedings around the Lasantha Wickrematunge case be released \u2014 triggering public outrage from media-rights groups and the victim\u2019s family. Within weeks, the decision was reversed and court was informed that the discharge would not proceed. The AG\u2019s Department said the earlier advice related to a connected abduction case, not the murder itself; the murder investigation, it said, continues.[6]",
    "Whatever one\u2019s view of the merits, the episode illustrates a broader problem: trust is an outcome, not a presumption. When consequential decisions appear, then retract, the public infers volatility at the apex of prosecution \u2014 a pattern incompatible with steady rule of law. (For the record: Ranasinghe Jr has served as AG since mid-2024, succeeding Sanjay Rajaratnam after an extension was not granted.)[7]",
    "Since early 2024, CIABOC has been chaired by Justice W.M.N.P. Iddawala, appointed by the President on the Constitutional Council\u2019s recommendation, as required by the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023. The same statute sets terms and disqualifications. Yet the reappointment of CIABOC\u2019s Director-General in April 2024 has been challenged in court, with petitioners arguing it did not comply with the new Act\u2019s criteria.[9]",
    "In April 2025, the Government launched the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP) 2025\u20132029, intended as a strategic roadmap for implementing the Act. CIABOC has since called for greater public involvement, institutional reform and legal literacy to make the plan credible.[10]",
    "Sri Lanka ranked in the mid-seventies out of more than 140 countries on the WJP Rule of Law Index 2024, with a small year-on-year improvement, but the Corruption Perceptions Index 2024 placed the country at 121 out of 180 with a score of 32/100.[11][12]",
    "The institutional environment is also shifting: in July 2025, Preethi Padman Surasena became Chief Justice, succeeding Murdo Fernando. This leadership change at Hulftsdorp has yet to be tested against major corruption or accountability cases, but it will shape whether new laws are enforced consistently.",
    "Acemoglu and Robinson argue that where extractive institutions concentrate power and shield elites, accountability erodes and growth under-performs.[13] Sri Lanka\u2019s own IMF governance diagnostic flagged macro-critical vulnerabilities \u2014 asset declarations, procurement, prosecutorial independence \u2014 all central to the Pandora story.[14]",
    "The Proceeds of Crime Act, No. 5 of 2025 has now given the State sharper tools to freeze and forfeit illicit assets. Yet as with earlier laws, enforcement is the hinge. Passing legislation is not the same as producing charge sheets.[8]",
    "Tax enforcement (IRD). If the 2024 special probe matures, expect amended assessments and penalties; severe cases could be referred for false returns. A first visible signal would be IRD-acknowledged assessments tied to Pandora findings.[5]",
    "nFinancial-crime route (CID/FIU referred to the Attorney-General). If CID traces tainted flows, prosecutors can file money-laundering charges and seek restraint or forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This requires mutual legal assistance with the UK and BVI to secure beneficial ownership and property trails.[4][8]",
    "Illicit enrichment/declaration breaches (CIABOC). Discrepancies between public declarations and offshore evidence open paths under the Anti-Corruption Act \u2014 independent of the original Pandora file.[10]",
    "A new Online Safety Act (No. 9 of 2024) empowers a commission to regulate online statements deemed \u201cprohibited.\u201d Critics warn it risks chilling investigative journalism and whistleblowing, both essential for sustaining accountability around offshore secrecy and illicit enrichment. If citizens fear reprisal for questioning declarations or leaks, then reforms may remain paper-bound.",
    "Four years after Pandora, Sri Lanka has new laws, an action plan, a public declaration portal, and a busier CIABOC calendar \u2014 but no public indictments arising specifically from Pandora. Until charge sheets (tax, laundering, illicit-enrichment) are filed and defended in open court, \u201cFrom Panama to Pandora\u201d will still read like a road that bends away from Hulftsdorp.",
    "The fix is uncomplicated to describe, hard to do: publish IRD outcomes, file CID cases with MLA-backed evidence, and enforce declaration breaches without fear or favour. That is how institutions start to feel inclusive rather than extractive \u2014 and how trust stops being a sermon and becomes a record.",
