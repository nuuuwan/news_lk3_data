    "Stresses need of Govt. stance on those detained for 72 hours",
    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday highlighted the need for repealing or amending the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which was temporarily enacted in 1979 to suppress LTTE terrorist activities in the country.",
    "Questioning the Government as to why it is still not taking action to repeal the PTA, he said it was now being used to suppress the voices of political opponents, protests, strikes against the Government and journalists. \u201cToday, continuation of this law has become a problematic issue and I ask why it is still in existence even after 15 years of ending the civil war. It has also created a conflict between the international agreements and conventions, which Sri Lanka has ratified,\u201d Premadasa explained.",
    "Making a statement in Parliament questioning the Government on PTA under Standing Order 27 (2), Premadasa said that since members of the NPP Government had previously expressed their opinions in and outside the Parliament against the PTA, now it was the responsibility of the Government to clarify its stance regarding repealing, bringing amendments or a completely new bill to the PTA.",
    "\u201cWe need to know the alternatives to the PTA that the Government proposes and what are the actions taken by the Government for it so far,\u201d he said requesting the Government to submit a report on those arrested under the PTA during and after ending the war, court cases filed against those suspects who have been arrested under the PTA, those suspected arrested under the PTA and directed for rehabilitation and those who have been released so far.",
    "Premadasa further requested the Government to explain its stance on those, who are arrested under PTA, detained for 72 hours, and also provisions given under this act to arrest people without a warrant.",
    "\u201cWe also want to know whether the Government intends to implement these provisions in accordance with international human rights standards,\u201d he stressed."
