    "Colombo, March 15 - Anunayaka of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Thera said it would rain in the due season bringing a bumper harvest and making the people happier, fuller and pleasanter provided the country had just rulers at the helm.",
    "Addressing the Special Conference of the Mahasangha of the Asgiriya Chapter held at Manelwatta Maha Vihara Conference Hall in Kelaniya the Ven. Thera pointed out the march forward of the country could be ensured by establishing a fair and just rule in the country and not through politically motivated activities.",
    "The conference was held under the chairmanship of Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Thera.",
    "\u201cIf the rulers were giving priority to their political achievements the country would be stagnating in this mire of degradation for another 75 years. The successful rulers including kings depended on the guidance of the Mahasangha King Dutugemunu, King Saddhatissa, King Walagamba, and King Parakramabahu, were outstanding rulers among them. Every ruler in Sri Lanka should receive the blessings of the Mahasangha. It is the age-old tradition of the country.\u201d",
    "\u201cPublic representatives came into power and they formed several governments at times for the last 75 years of independence. They turned into a privileged class and violated the rule of law and resorted to illegal activities to gain cheap political mileage. The entire state administration has been politicized and this situation has been extended to the selling of state property. The country would get deeper and deeper into this mire of degradation if the state property were privatized or alienated to the foreigners.\u201d Ven. Upali Thera said",
    "Ven. Anunayake Thera further said the prevailing situation would demand a radical change to eliminate corruption and malpractices and to establish the rule of law and that the country would be free of debt servicing if frauds, malpractices corruption and official grafting were eliminated.",
