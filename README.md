Dr. Sanjeewa presented a document signed by the Health Ministry Director of Supplies indicating that a decision had been made to discontinue the use of the immunoglobulin due to quality issues. He revealed that during a meeting of the Health Ministry’s Safety and Risk Committee, it was decided to withdraw the entire stock from use.  He further noted that despite previous arrests, including that of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and at least 15 other officials, questions remain about how such low-quality medicines continue to enter Sri Lanka.

*2024-09-30 23:41:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/A-political-and-policy-tightrope-awaits-Sri-Lanka-s-new-president/14-767366) · `en`

Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe came in a distant third, with 17.3% of the votes. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, came fourth with a mere 2.6% of the votes.

### Triumph of an independent commission – a role model

A peaceful, fair, and corruption-free national election is a rare achievement for a developing, financially struggling country. However, we should take pride in our Election Commission, which excelled in planning, executing, counting, and releasing the results of a significant and complex election in a remarkably short time. Additionally, the Commission effectively mitigated post-election celebrations, preventing the violence and intimidation that often follow.

First, we must congratulate the Chairperson, R.M.A.L. Rathnayake, the Election Commission board members, and all staff for their outstanding work. Such recognition is seldom seen, even in the media, which tends to focus more on inflammatory stories that threaten peace.

What has to be understood is the fact that over the years, what has happened is that Governments have only ‘managed’ the economy, and that too not very well, and not developed the economy. This indicates that a fundamental change in thinking is required. To do so, a great change in thinking is urgently required. Though the political will to do so has been expressed, I am not too certain, that the process to achieve has been understood

“There were discussions as UNP and as the majority group of the SLPP, and then the group led by former prime minister Dinesh Gunawardena had a discussion outside. The consensus among all of them is that there should be a common alliance under a common symbol.

“There is still room for the SJB to enter talks. But there is a question about whether the talks are going forward to the extent we had anticipated,” said Ratnapriya.

### Reflecting on the results through railway promises

Is it reasonable for the Government to take on more debt to build tracks and commit taxpayer funds to a service that is incapable of even covering operational costs?

An outspoken activist justified his support for Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) because of the superiority of the manifesto proposals on public transport, especially railways. It’s possible that the actual decision was taken on some other basis, but the railway proposals shed light on a larger problem. I had studied the manifestos in detail but paid little attention to sector proposals, considering them irrelevant in the context of the financial constraints any successful candidate would have to work within in 2024-29.

In plain language, IMF is only about getting back to the rotten and festering past. The “change” that AKD and NPP promised should be a better socio-economic life with peace and decency around and the security forces back in barracks. Perhaps, AKD needs a new open discourse outside the NPP before formulating his 2025 annual budget

“Many steps have to be taken during a considerably long period, to achieve the ‘change’ we aspire. They nevertheless need ensuring stability and trust in this present economy. We have therefore decided to begin discussions with the IMF as soon as possible to move ahead with the Extended Fund Facility” – President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his first address to the nation on 25 September 2024 (translated from Sinhala script).

### The change started, but it will not be ending

Generally, changes are fundamental, dynamic, and demanding, so they are not time-bound. Some changes can be quick, others take time, and some are long-term. AKD/NPP will make changes on priority and step by step, along with what he promised. However, the impact of any change on the masses and the country must be positive; people must be able to feel, understand, and be convinced. Only then could the welfare and well-being of the masses be enhanced, step by step, in the right direction

Since March 2024, I have written 24 articles about the change Sri Lanka and its people have wanted since 1948, and the AKD/NPP has committed accordingly. The change that the people and the country want to witness is massive in terms of economic, social, political, cultural, and many more. A peaceful or nonviolent Presidential election marked the beginning of the realisation of change, while the opposition advocated violent polls because of their bankruptcy in many ways.

Over the past few decades, people witnessed disruptive politicians who governed the country returning to power. However, this change somewhat in 2024, voters are making decisions based on policies than just for a party. This sentiment is reflected in the over 4.7 million voters (out of 6.9 million) who previously voted for the former President but have now supported the current President, Anura Kumara Dissanayake. This is a clear objection and a mandate to keep them out and initiate a complete system change. Additionally, those who voted for the current President on September 21st, along with a growing number of others, are advocating for legislation that would permanently disqualify corrupt politicians from holding any elected or appointed positions in the future.

Israel is planning a limited ground operation in Lebanon that may start imminently, Israel has told the United States, the Washington Post reports citing an unidentified US official.

The operation will be smaller than Israel’s 2006 war against Hezbollah and will focus on security for border communities, the official says.

Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday said ground forces could be used against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, adding military operations will go on despite the killing of the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Gallant made the comments while speaking to Israeli troops deployed to the northern border where cross-border fire with Hezbollah continued for nearly a year but escalated this month.

“We will use all the means that may be required -- your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land,” Gallant said.

“The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the final one”.

### Corruption In Sri Lanka: A Historical Overview Of Political Mismanagement

*2024-09-30 22:01:00* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/corruption-in-sri-lanka-a-historical-overview-of-political-mismanagement/) · `en`

For the past 76 years, Sri Lanka has grappled with pervasive corruption that has deeply entrenched itself within the political fabric of the nation. Successive regimes, particularly the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the Rajapaksa family, have been accused of mismanagement and theft, leading to the deterioration of the country’s assets and the suffering of its citizens.

The political landscape of Sri Lanka has largely been dominated by a few powerful families whose governance has often prioritized personal gain over national welfare. These regimes have systematically depleted the country’s resources, leaving Sri Lanka in a precarious economic position. Many citizens believe that the wealth generated by the country’s natural resources and public enterprises has been siphoned off, with assets being transferred to foreign lands.

The strongest man is never strong enough to be always master, unless lie transforms his power into right, and obedience to duty.

At the time my story begins, a routine civil service transfer had me moved as Assistant Secretary in the prime minister’s office which was without doubt the most exalted and powerful institution in Sri Lanka. For the first 30 years of the new state’s existence, its place in the political structure remained unchallenged and unchanged. The role of the prime minister as the keystone of the arch in a Westminster-style government was paramount. It was only much later, after the second Republican Constitution in 1978 and the creation of the Executive Presidency with its enormous concentration of power, that the position of the prime minister became as it now is, devoid of constitutional authority, largely decorative’ and what its holder is able to make of it.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has produced almost no inflation for 24 months since September 2024, when its deflationary policy began to show up in the balance of payments.

In March 2023, the central bank lifted a surrender rule, that had led to a collapse of the currency during a failed float in 2022, and allowed the exchange rate to appreciate from 360 to around 300 sharply bringing down traded goods and food prices, even as services went up to make up for the currency collapse.
