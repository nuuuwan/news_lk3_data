The dizzying presidential contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris hurtled toward an uncertain finish on Tuesday as millions of Americans headed to the polls to choose between two sharply different visions for the country.

A race whipsawed by unprecedented events - two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden’s surprise withdrawal and Harris’ rapid rise - remained too close to call, even after billions of dollars in spending and months of frenetic campaigning.

Trump’s campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected.

Murukesu Chandrakumar emphasizes Tamil nationalism, calling for self-sufficiency and rejecting corrupt politicians. He advocates for economic development through factories and protecting land rights.

🟩

To create a position where one can live on own land. To work politically for that. The national task is to actually do so. Murukesu Chandrakumar, a former parliamentarian and the chief candidate of the United People's Power of the Kilinochchi Election District, Jaffna, said that it was the lifeblood of Tamil nationalism.

He said this while addressing a public meeting in Udayanagar, Kilinochchi.

The Tamil people ask whom to vote. Asking whom to choose. We say, the people, you vote for you. Yes, for you, it means to take advantage of your votes for you to win.

It was only because you forgot to think clearly in the past, or voted on the basis of hope. The wrongdoers were able to seize political power.. That is what happened today.

Now the people of South Sri Lanka - the Sinhalese people - are ready to correct that mistake. So there has been a new political environment. There is a situation where people are successful in politicians who are concerned about corrupt and concerned people.

The prime ministers of India and Canada condemned violence that broke out on Sunday at a Hindu temple near Toronto at a time of escalating diplomatic tensions between the countries.

Videos posted on social media appeared to show people hitting each other with flagpoles and throwing punches in the Toronto suburb of Brampton. It was unclear who instigated the violence and Reuters could not independently verify what happened.

The incident happened weeks after Ottawa expelled six Indian diplomats, linking them to the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in 2023 in Canada. Canada has accused the Indian government of conducting a broad campaign against South Asian dissidents in Canada, which New Delhi denies.

Police said there were demonstrations at multiple locations in the region. Sikh activists said one demonstration was at a Hindu temple where pro-Khalistan activists protested the presence of Indian diplomats and another was at a Sikh temple.

### Special Bundle Extension for Imported Chinese

*2024-11-05 11:04:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197917) · `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



"Special commodity tax extended for imported Chinese goods. Tax rate: 50 rupees per kg. Validity: Extended until Dec 31. Gazetted by Finance Minister. Contradicts promise to cut taxes on essentials."

🟩

For imported Chinese, the special commodity tax has been further extended.

One kilogram of imported Chinese was levied on a special trade tax of 50 rupees for a year from the first of November last year.

As its validity period ends on November 1, the government has taken steps to extend the special trade tax on the 31st of December.

The tax has been extended by the Gazette Notification issued by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the Finance Minister.

Although he was previously promised to reduce taxes on essential commodities, he criticized the same thing without cutting the taxes on them.

He pointed out that the government has publicly promised to relax the tax burden on food items, while steps have been taken to retain the tax on the importation of sugar.
