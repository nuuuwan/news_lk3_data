    "Chief Prelates of the Malwathu and Asgiriya chapters of the Siyam sect, along with those of the Amarapura-Ramanna sect, have called on President Ranil Wickremesinghe to grant a Presidential pardon to the incarcerated Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, on Vesak Poya Day. In a letter dated 13 May to the President, the Chief Prelates highlighted that Gnanasara Thera had advocated for Sinhala Buddhist nationalism and had alerted Sri Lankan forces to various extremist activities occurring in the country. They noted that his actions assisted security officials in curbing the spread of certain extremist elements throughout the country.",
