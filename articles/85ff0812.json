    "The Article titled \u2018Choosing between Robert Wilmot Horton and Ponnambalam Arunachalam\u2019 regarding the change of street name from Horton Place to Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha,\u2019 which appeared on January 23rd, implies that both figures are equally important to Sri Lankans.",
    "The writer says, \u2018\u2026the change cannot take place without an acknowledgement of the contribution of Sir Robert Wilmot Horton to Ceylon.\u00a0 Both Horton and Arunachalam contributed to Ceylon\u2019s all-round development each in his own way and as per the opportunities available in their time. Sir Robert Wilmot Horton was Governor of Ceylon between 1831 and 1837, and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, was a polymath, lawyer, educationist, public intellectual and political leader in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\u2026\u2019",
    "Under British rule, Ceylon, acknowledged as \u201cthe premier colony,\u201d served as a testing ground for British ideals in social and political institutions. In fact, Sri Lanka had been proposed as the prototype and model for the new Commonwealth in the latter part of the 20th century. -- Evolution of Social Policy in Sri Lanka 1833-1970: British Colonial Legacy: Laksiri Jayasuriya -- Journal of the RAS, Vol. 46 (2001), pp. 68.",
    "The Europeans, perceiving themselves as the dominant white race, believed in the natural conquest of \u201cinferior\u201d people \u201cfor the betterment of mankind\u201d, viewing it as an expression of nature\u2019s law. While national heroes like P Sirisena and Tibatian Mahinda Thera, as well as Indian legend Rabindranath Tagore [in his poetry collection \u201cGitanjali\u201d] explored themes of freedom, spirituality and nationalism, inspiring nationalists, Sir Arunachalam and Gandhi to resist colonial invaders, Europe produced poets like Rudyard Kipling, who wrote \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden\u201d in 1897. This poem framed imperialism and colonialism as a moral duty for the white race to uplift non-white civilizations.",
    "During Robert Horton\u2019s tenure in Ceylon, he was tasked with implementing the recommendations of the Colebrooke\u2013Cameron Commission, a result of pressure exhorted by local agitators in the early 19th century, which led to the establishment of Ceylon\u2019s First Legislative Council and Executive Committee. Horton, 3rd Baronet (1784\u20131841), a British politician, sociopolitical theorist, and colonial administrator, served as the Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1821 to 1828; he later assumed the role of Governor of Ceylon from 1831 to 1837. His notable contributions extend to his writings on the subject of assisted emigration to the colonies within the British Empire. The practice of disposing of national assets to foreign businessmen was initiated by Horton, marking a regrettable trend.",
    "Arunachalam, the first Ceylonese to enter CCS was deprived of the position of Government Agent in Colombo and posted subsequently to judicial posts across the island. This reflected an unofficial policy of the British Government at the time, which systematically prevented exceptional Ceylonese individuals from assuming prominent roles within the government. In 1906, Arunachalam was appointed to the Legislative Council. His groundbreaking Census Report of 1901 was hailed by The Times of London as the \u201cmost comprehensive authority on the ethnology of Ceylon and of its varied people, their history, their religions, languages, and literature.\u201d --\u00a0 James T. Rutnum, \u201cSir PonnambalamArunachalam \u2013 Scholar and Statesman 1853-1924\u201d, 1953, pp 11.",
    "In 1913, a new phase in Arunachalam\u2019s life began. In this year he joined a political movement demanding self-governance for the people of Ceylon. In an historic lecture entitled \u2018\u2019Our Political Needs\u201d, given at the insistence of D.R. Wijewardene, Arunachalam crystallised the arguments for self-government.",
    "In 1915, he was elected as the inaugural President of the Ceylon Social Service League, dedicated to uplifting the poorer classes in Ceylon. In 1917, Arunachalam founded the Ceylon Reform League. In 1919, he delivered an address at a Sinhalese conference, supported by F.R. Senanayake, with the aim of organizing Peoples\u2019 Associations across Sinhalese districts for political, social, and economic improvement. This initiative directly led to the establishment of the Lanka Maha Jana Sabha.",
    "Arunachalam was the Father of the Ceylon University Movement: played a pivotal role in establishing the Ceylon University Association in January 1906. In a memorandum to Governor Sir West Ridgeway, he requested the formation of a commission to assess educational progress and need, surging the creation of a \u201cCeylon University\u201d, only to receive a negative response from the Governor.",
    "Following his death, the \u201cCeylon Daily News\u201d described him as \u2018the most powerful personality in Ceylon,\u2019 and the \u201cTimes of London\u201d hailed him as the \u2018Founder of modern Ceylon.\u2019 The next significant acknowledgement of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam came from the late and esteemed Mr. D.R. Wijewardene, a close friend and admirer. In 1948, on the occasion of Ceylon\u2019s independence, Mr. Wijewardene, despite being in retirement and unwell, rose from his sick bed. Reflecting on events over three decades earlier in the \u201cCeylon Daily News,\u201d he wrote: \u201cIn those days, the national consciousness was dormant, and there was nothing in the spirit of the times to stir it to life and activity. Later, largely as a result of Arunachalam\u2019s work, the fire of the national soul was quickened.\u201d",
    "Discussing Horton\u2019s tenure in detail, in a paper titled, \u2018Governor Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and the Reforms of 1833 in Ceylon\u2019, Vijaya Samaraweera says, \u201cThere is no doubt that he particularly disliked the creation of the legislature, for at the time of his appointment, as Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1812 to 1827 stated, he had the \u2018satisfaction of being free from legislative assemblies. Instinct and experience had their place, but what emerges more clearly is that he acted with a conscious need to safeguard the power and privileges as the Governor. This perhaps is understandable; as the Governor of Ceylon he received far less than what he originally desired, for when seeking a colonial appointment he was not attracted to Ceylon but to Canada.\u201d",
    "Under British rule, Ceylon, acknowledged as \u201cthe premier colony,\u201d served as a testing ground for British ideals in social and political institutions. In fact, Sri Lanka had been proposed as the prototype and model for the new Commonwealth in the latter part of the 20th century",
    "--The Historical Journal, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Jun., 1972), pp: 220",
    "While representing an oppressive regime, Horton may have played a positive role in implementing certain democratic and social reforms recommended by the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, a responsibility assigned to him. This distinguishes him from more infamous governors such as Chalmers, Torrington, MacDonald, or William Rogers. However, it is crucial to note that Horton, the colonial agent was also instrumental in promoting the arrack industry through free distribution of arrack.",
    "The commission recommended the abolition of the feudal practice of compulsory labour; abandon government\u2019s claims to free service (Rajakariya); recognising the right to private property; ending of the government\u2019s monopoly of the Cinnamon trade, starting the first newspaper of Ceylon, the Colombo Journal, and the first mail coach in Asia; reformed the education system, reforms to the Civil Service, and established Ceylon\u2019s first public school, the Colombo Academy, which was renamed in 1881 as the Royal College. It also recommended a drastic reduction on powers of the Governor. The credit for the aforementioned reforms belongs to the Commission and the national heroes who advocated for them, rather than Horton.",
    "While Horton acquiesced to the changes in 1831, two years later, he was no longer willing to do so. Importantly, in opposing the reforms of 1833, Horton\u2019s motivations were not solely driven by the self-interest of preserving the power and position of the Governor. He opposed specific reforms beneficial to the colony, deeming them detrimental to the Empire\u2019s interests. This principled stance was notably evident in his negative approach and resistance to the reforms in the civil service of Ceylon. The direction in which the Colonial Office was moving at this juncture was clearly indicated to Horton himself at the time of his appointment. He was aware that in these days of Reduction measures, he had to accept the governorship at a reduced salary.",
    "During the Age of Imperialism (16th to 19th century), European nations aggressively expanded, driven by economic needs stemming from the Industrial Revolution. This era of scientific and technological development transformed rural societies into industrialized ones. Imperial powers set up trading posts, gained footholds, and collaborated with local rulers to protect European economic interests. Motivated by political aspirations for national greatness and beliefs in Western superiority, they employed military force, economic influence, and annexation to dominate Africa and Asia. By 1914, Great Britain controlled the largest number of colonies, symbolized by the phrase, \u201cthe sun never sets on the British Empire.\u201d",
    "Colonialism was, and remains, a wholesale destruction of memory. Lands, the sources of identity, stolen. Languages, ripped from mouths. The collective loss to humanity was incalculable, as cultures, ideas, species, habitats, traditions, cosmologies, possibilities, patterns of life, and ways of understanding the world were destroyed. Countless ecological traditions \u2013 involving diverse ways of being with nature \u2013 were swept away.",
    "The majestic mountainous terrain, initially known as \u2018Maha Eliya Thenna,\u2019 was renamed Horton Plains National Park in 1834 by Lt. William Fisher of the 78th Regiment and Lt. Albert Watson of the 58th Regiment. The legitimacy of the two military men to rename it is questionable.",
    "Let \u2018Horton Place and Plains\u2019 remain unchanged if that is the preference of residents and aligns with tourism demands. However, upon the inauguration of the proposed Colombo-Jaffna Highway, let us honour this great personality by naming it after him.",
    "In the past, local communities were inclined to venerate the white invaders, actively seeking their favour in exchange for privileges such as \u2018nindagams,\u2019 [free grant of thousands of acres of crown land], and coveted Mudliar/Muhandiram positions. This historical practice of seeking patronage from colonial powers became deeply ingrained in the collective mindset of the locals. Breaking free from this entrenched historical mentality requires a conscious and concerted effort."
