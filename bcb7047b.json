    "Separate operations conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy in Jayanagar with the assistance of the Kuchchaveli Police in the Poduwakattu sea area on July 31 and August led to the apprehension of a suspect in possession of five sticks of commercial explosives, 14 chargers and 17 non-electric detonators.",
    "The use of explosives for fishing poses a serious threat to the marine life and can cause long-lasting damage to the marine ecosystems. Thus, the Sri Lanka Navy has been conducting regular operations to crack down on fishing using explosives and other illegal fishing practices in the island's waters.",
    "As an extension of these efforts, SLNS Walagamba of the Eastern Naval Command carried out a coordinated operation with Kuchchaveli Police and searched a house in Jayanagar on suspicion on July 31. During the search, they recovered five commercial explosive sticks, three set-up chargers and four non-electric detonators from the house. Further, a suspect in connection with the incident was also nabbed during this search operation.",
    "Meanwhile, the explosive items recovered are in the custody of the Navy till they are handed over to authorities for onward action.",
    "It is believed that these commercial explosives have been secretly hidden to be used later for illegal fishing."
