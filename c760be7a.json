    "Accuses MPs of hosting extravagant gathering as public grapples with effect of increased VAT",
    "Expresses dismay on utilisation of public funds to organise such event at a critical juncture for SL",
    "Claims event was held illegally in a high security zone and calls for a probe",
    "Shipping experts raise concern regarding lack of safety measures during event",
    "The Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday slammed the alleged lavish function held on two ships at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) for a group of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs recently.",
    "While the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has maintained that the occasion was not a party but rather an inspection tour, Premadasa nonetheless criticised the event. He expressed disapproval, pointing out that at a time when the public is enduring the effects of the increased Value Added Tax (VAT), a specific group of MPs is hosting extravagant gatherings.",
    "He conveyed his dismay at the utilisation of public funds for organising such events at this critical juncture. He called for an immediate investigation into the occurrence, asserting that the party was unlawfully conducted in a high-security zone. The Opposition Leader also accused a former President of orchestrating the arrangement to acquire the ships for hosting the event.",
    "\u201cI am the voice of the people, and I pose these questions. Why have public funds been spent on hosting parties in mid sea? How can the Government justify such expenditures? Is it appropriate to utilise ships owned by the public and the Port in this manner? Should whiskey and food be indulged in at lavish parties when the country is facing financial distress? This is unforgivable.. Attempts to silence us when we address these concerns will not be tolerated. While the lives of the people are in turmoil, a former President is accused of hosting a party on a ship,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, shipping experts have also highlighted safety concerns associated with hosting an event on the vessel in question. They pointed out that in the event of an accident, harbour craft may lack life-saving and firefighting appliances or the capacity to accommodate more than a small crew of four or five SLPA-trained personnel.",
    "\u201cEvery rule in the book related to Life Saving Appliances and Fire Fighting Appliances has been disregarded. It is strange how the present Harbour Master and his Deputy, both senior seafarers have turned a blind eye to carrying so many people when these tugs are designated for only around 10 persons. No extra life-saving equipment was carried for the extra crowd. All safety regulations have been disregarded. If this was done in any other ship, the ship\u2019s captain would have been arrested,\u201d a former ship captain told the Daily FT.",
    "Ports State Minister demands action against TUs for spreading false info",
    "Minister slams TUs for sharing footage of event and claims they were obtained illegally",
    "Urges action against those sharing footage and media along with others for spreading false info",
    "Claims event was an observation tour and arranged on request of MPs",
    "Amidst increasing debate over a recent assembly on a Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) vessel involving SLPP MPs, State Minister of Ports and Aviation Premalal Jayasekara yesterday came forward to justify the gathering.\u00a0 Holding a press conference he urged action against trade unions for sharing footage of the event, asserting that the videos were obtained through illegal means.",
    "Jayasekara claimed MPs had requested an observation tour of the port facilities, encompassing the sea sand removal project and the West Container Terminal, as part of a recent Budget debate.",
    "He defended his involvement in arranging the tour, stating that it fell within his responsibilities as the State Minister. Additionally, he decried what he referred to as false allegations and urged for action against certain media and those who make false statements about the event.",
    "The controversy revolves around footage from the event, purportedly featuring former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and approximately 20 other MPs celebrating aboard the SLPA vessel. The incident has led to allegations of insensitivity and extravagance, particularly in the face of a strained healthcare system and economic challenges.",
    "The Sri Lanka Port Trade Union disclosed that the SLPP ship party, held on 9 January was reportedly organised at the invitation of Premalal Jayasekara, the State Minister for Ports and Civil Aviation. The union asserts that about fifty individuals attended the gathering, including SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "The port trade union divulged details of the party and released footage that purportedly captured the event."
