The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on September 26, 2024, after carefully considering the recent and expected macroeconomic developments and possible risks and uncertainties on the domestic and global fronts with a view to ensuring that inflation aligns with the target of 5 per cent over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach its maximum potential, a CBSL statement said.

The Board observed that inflation is likely to remain well below the target of 5 per cent over the next few quarters, potentially recording deflation in the immediate future driven by changes to administratively determined prices and easing of supply conditions, the Central Bank said.

### Role of history and ideology in shaping China’s geopolitical strategies and influence on Sri Lanka

*2024-09-28 00:43:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Role-of-history-and-ideology-in-shaping-China-s-geopolitical-strategies-and-influence-on-Sri-Lanka/14-767268) · `en`

Dr. Patrick Mendis and Dr. Antonina Łuszczykiewicz-Mendis offer an in-depth analysis of China’s ‘Dragon and Phoenix’ strategy, highlighting how Beijing blends assertive geopolitical moves with culturally-driven diplomacy to expand its global influence. They discuss how this dual approach is shaping the ongoing US-China rivalry, particularly in the strategic Indian Ocean region, and its potential implications for Sri Lanka.

Q:  In your article on China’s ‘Dragon and Phoenix’ strategy, you describe the ‘Dragon’ as representing China’s more assertive, forceful actions, while the ‘Phoenix’ symbolises its softer, culturally-focused diplomacy. Could you elaborate on how these two aspects work together to enhance China’s global influence?

Dr. Mendis: In our article, we aimed to capture how China perceives itself and projects its strategy to the world in a very subtle, often secretive manner. To effectively explain this, we chose to use a Chinese metaphor—the Dragon and Phoenix.

### Ratha Gaya: A national burden

*2024-09-28 00:40:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ratha-Gaya-A-national-burden/4-767267) · `en`

Given Sri Lanka’s current economic situation, it is imperative to re-evaluate our approach to vehicle ownership and usage

Ratha Gaya, a term often used to describe the obsession with owning flashy vehicles, has become a pervasive issue in Sri Lanka. This trend, fuelled by the perceived status and the inadequacy of public transportation, has placed an undue burden on the Government and the nation’s economy.

Government officials, often compensated with relatively lower salaries compared to their private sector counterparts, have traditionally been given duty-free vehicle allowances. This has led to a proliferation of vehicles within Government departments, often used more for personal convenience than for official duties. Similarly, the private sector has also succumbed to this trend, viewing vehicles as status symbols rather than mere utilities.

### UNP and its continuing suicidal saga

*2024-09-28 00:39:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/UNP-and-its-continuing-suicidal-saga/14-767266) · `en`

Congratulations on a brilliant editorial on 26 September which used the UNP and its extremely long time leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to highlight the destructive, disastrous and detrimental role he had played individually to the concept of social liberal politics and ideology in Sri Lanka.

You have brilliantly captured in words the reality and practical implications of Wickremesinghe’s role in weakening the pillars of social liberalism, firstly in the UNP and then in Sri Lankan politics.

His nurturing and sustaining the myth that he is eternal and thus creating personality cults within the UNP and every time he governed led to the building up of corruption, cronyism, poor governance, abuse of power, undermining the rule of law and undermining the parliamentary and judicial systems which violate the constitution of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka-Maldives Business Council has extended its congratulations to the newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

"On behalf of the Sri Lanka-Maldives Business Council, I extend our heartfelt congratulations on your appointment as President of Sri Lanka. Your leadership comes at a pivotal time for both Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and we are eager to explore the opportunities that lie ahead. We look forward to collaborating closely with you to strengthen the ties between our countries and promote mutual growth," said Sri Lanka Maldives Business Council President Sudesh Mendis.

While our export revenue has grown to $ 163 million in 2023, it has not kept pace with overall market growth, resulting in a decline in our market share in the Maldives, which now stands at 4.65%, down from approximately 7.02% eight years ago. This decline highlights the need for concerted efforts to enhance our presence in this vital market.

A circular economy seeks to create value of by-products or waste, that otherwise will be discarded and lost

As we celebrate the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, we must understand that this is a global challenge, that affects all of us and we must all contribute to its solution. Whether we are policymakers, consumers, or food producers, the choices we make, can help shape a more sustainable future. Reducing food waste is not just a moral imperative; it is an economic necessity, especially when millions around the world face food insecurity

On 29 September, we celebrate the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, a reminder of the urgent need to transform how we produce, consume, and manage food.

As the Secretary-General has said, “We cannot create a future fit for our grandchildren with a system built by our grandparents.”

### The power of the cross and a crossover in power styles

The power of that cross must slowly but surely transform the nature, principles and practice of power in the land. Else it would be only a transactional double-cross fit for the dustbin of history – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In the run-up to the Presidential election of 2024, the then emerging aspirant for executive office Anura Kumara Dissanayake once waxed eloquent about “the power of the cross” (‘kathiraya’).

He intimated that it was not simply, deceptively, one person’s expressed preference for a particular individual; but rather, a powerful exercise of the franchise which could reap a wide-ranging harvest of repercussions.

Rest assured that those ramifications are being felt in nation, state, country, bureaucracy and beyond today. For better or for worse, only time will tell.
