  "original_body_lines": [
    "South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday proposed impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol for his sudden decision to declare martial law, which he rescinded after a chaotic standoff between parliament and the army that damaged the country\u2019s standing.",
    "Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law late on Tuesday attempted to ban political activity and censor the media in South Korea, which has Asia\u2019s fourth largest economy and is a key U.S. ally.",
    "Washington had no advance notice of the decision, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters, adding that he expected to speak with his South Korean counterpart in the coming days.",
    "Armed troops had forced their way into the National Assembly building in Seoul but stood back when parliamentary aides sprayed them with fire extinguishers. Lawmakers rejected the martial law decision while protesters scuffled with police outside.",
    "On Wednesday evening, civic and labour groups held a candlelight vigil in downtown Seoul calling for Yoon\u2019s resignation - a reminder of the massive candlelight protests that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in 2017. They then marched to the presidential office.",
    "Six South Korean opposition parties submitted a bill in parliament to impeach Yoon, who had already faced accusations of heavy-handed leadership from his opponents and from within his own party, with voting set for Friday or Saturday.",
    "A plenary session to formally introduce the bill was scheduled to begin shortly after midnight (1500 GMT) on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t ignore the illegal martial law,\u201d DP lawmaker Kim Yong-min told reporters. \u201cWe can no longer let democracy collapse.\u201d",
    "The leader of Yoon\u2019s ruling People Power Party called for Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun to be fired and the entire cabinet to resign. Kim has offered to resign, the defence ministry said.",

    "The won was stable but close to a two-year low, with dealers reporting suspected intervention by South Korean authorities after overnight talks between Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong.",
    "Choi sent an emergency note to global financial chiefs and credit rating agencies late on Wednesday which said the market was functioning as usual, and that the finance ministry was working to alleviate any adverse impact from political turmoil, the ministry said in a statement.",
    "Yoon told the nation in a television speech late on Tuesday that martial law was needed to defend the country from pro-North Korean anti-state forces, and protect the free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.",
    "Within hours, South Korea\u2019s parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion for martial law be lifted, with 18 members of Yoon\u2019s party present.",
    "The president then rescinded the declaration of martial law, around six hours after its proclamation.",
    "Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. \u201cWe won!\u201d they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.",
    "\u201cThere are opinions that it was too much to go to emergency martial law, and that we did not follow the procedures for emergency martial law, but it was done strictly within the constitutional framework,\u201d a South Korean presidential official told Reuters by telephone.",
    "There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.",
    "Yoon was embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the U.S.-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.",
    "But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics as \u201ccommunist totalitarian and anti-state forces\u201d as his approval ratings slipped.

    "The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favour. A trial by the constitutional court follows, which can confirm the motion with a vote by six of the nine justices.",
    "If Yoon resigned or was removed from office, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would fill in as leader until a new election was held within 60 days.",
    "\u201cSouth Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot,\u201d Danny Russel, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, said of the first martial law declaration in South Korea since 1980.",
    "Blinken said he welcomed Yoon\u2019s decision to rescind the martial law declaration.",
    "\u201cWe continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,\u201d he said in a statement.",
