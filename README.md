Venice, Italy (CNN) — April 25 has long been a historic day in Venice – the date is not just Italy’s Liberation day, but it’s also the feast day of the city’s patron saint, St. Mark.

But now Venice will notch up another dose of history for April 25 – as the day the city becomes the first in the world to charge day-trippers an entry fee.

There were protests as the day got underway with locals waving banners and holding up their passports in anger at the city being put behind a barrier in the style of a theme park or museum. Photos show police clashing with some protesters.

The long-awaited contributo di accesso (it’s styled as an ‘access contribution’ rather than a ticket) started at 8.a.m. on Thursday. The city council is running a pilot project until mid July to see if it can make the system work.

Anybody visiting Venice as a tourist for the day – except those who live in the local Veneto region – must pay the 5 euro ($5.40) charge if they arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m..

ECONOMYNEXT – Colombo city will be developed further into a tourist destination with the relocation of several features, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

Wickremesinghe outlined plans “for further development beyond Colombo, including relocating the President’s House to the Madiwela area within the next decade.”

There was “potential for transforming sites like Republic Square, Navy Headquarters, Old Jetty, Customs House and the General Post Office into key components of the burgeoning Colombo Tourist City,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media divisions at the opening of the ITC Ratnadipa Hotel.

The luxurious hotel, located near the Galle Face Green, marks the first venture outside India by the ITC Hotel Group, following their establishment of a 10,000-room hotel chain in India.

🟩

The veterinary pedestal at the University of Peradeniya has introduced a new uterine tool to control the breeding of monkeys.

Senior Professor Asoka Thangolla from the University of Peradeniya University said that the radiological examination carried out after the test was noticed that the uterus was successfully operated.

It reached the throat when it used the normal level of tool in the practice of preventing pregnancy for women. So we decided to create a small ring.

He noted that the doctors of the Department of Maternity and Neurology of the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital and the Paradise Faculty of Dental Medicine in Peradeniya have cooperated with the effort.

### Surgeons perform first combined heart pump and pig kidney transplant

*2024-04-26 08:55:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Surgeons-perform-first-combined-heart-pump-and-pig-kidney-transplant/108-281400) · `en`

(CNN) - The first transplant surgery to combine a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney has been completed at NYU Langone Health, the system said Wednesday.

The subject, 54-year-old Lisa Pisano of New Jersey, had heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, NYU Langone said in a news release. But she couldn’t have a standard heart or kidney transplant because of other chronic medical conditions that “significantly reduced the likelihood of a good outcome” and because of an overall lack of donor organs in the US.

“When that opportunity first came to me, I was like, ‘I gotta try it,’ ” Pisano said during a news conference Wednesday from her bed in the intensive care unit.

“I’ve tried everything else, and I’ve exhausted all other resources. So when this opportunity came, I said, ‘I’m gonna take advantage of it,’ ” she said, hoping to “spend time with my grandkids and play with them.”

### Foreign powers intensify surveillance on Presidential elections as strategic interests take centre stage

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Ahead of the presidential election scheduled for October this year, the foreign powers have ramped up their efforts in the assessment of ground political developments as was in the case of vital elections in the past.

The political situation is likely to heat up after May Day events in which the respective parties will try to show their political might as a launching pad for electioneering.

It is natural for foreign countries having bilateral relations with Sri Lanka to be watchful of political developments with key elections pending. However, countries such as the United States, India, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and other Western countries take particular interest in the possible outcome of elections. They have strategic and competing interests in the country.

### Not AirAsia bidding to acquire SriLankan: Capital A CEO clarifies

Capital A CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes clarified that it is AirAsia Consulting Sdn Bhd that is bidding to acquire SriLankan Airlines, and not AirAsia.

If successful, the soon to be re-branded AirAsia Consulting will raise its own capital for the acquisition, Fernandes told reporters in Malaysia this week at a media conference that was held to announce the extension of his tenure as chief for another five years.

“Just to clear that up for everyone, AirAsia is not buying SriLankan Airlines. AirAsia Consulting, which will set up its own fund, is looking at buying SriLankan Airlines. So, it’s not AirAsia,” he said.

“I know it’s confusing, and AirAsia Consulting will be changing (its name) to Capital A Consulting very soon. So, that’s for airlines who want to consult our 23 years of experience, but AirAsia Consulting is also looking for opportunities to invest in airlines outside of ASEAN. AirAsia is fully focused on ASEAN. That’s our goal,”

### A common sense alternative

Sri Lanka must integrate with global production networks that require trade reforms, removal of tariffs and protections across sectors and joining free trade agreements.

I hope to convince the reader that despite some of the commentary, Sri Lanka is not on the road to recovery. Numerous predictably dysfunctional policies with questionable rationalisations were implemented in 2019 and 2020; there was no discernible deliberative process. The underlying fragility of governance that precipitated the collapse is still prevalent. Two years on, the Wickremesinghe Government is exhibiting the same tendencies: a concentration of power in the office of the presidency with the executive holding the critical ministries of finance and defence; this Wickremesinghe Government has not materially altered the conditions that led to our crisis.

What horrible times are we living in? “Never again” was the resolve that led to the formation of a rules-based world order in the aftermath of World War II, in which some 80 million people—3 percent of the then-world population—perished. But events that followed showed humans were incapable of living in peace. People continued to die in wars across the world.

But none of the myriad wars and conflicts could be as brutal as the war Israel’s hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been waging against the hapless people of the Gaza Strip for the past 200-plus days. What is happening in Gaza is not a war; it is genocide, period.
