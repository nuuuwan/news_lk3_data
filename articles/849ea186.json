    "(This article is based on a talk given to the members of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service Association on the 10th of December, 2024. First part of it appeared in The Island of 01 Jan. 2025).",
    "Meantime Trump on Monday, 2 December, 2024, in a post on \u2018Truth Social\u2019 indicated that he seeks an Israel-Hamas ceasefire before he takes office in January. He has promised that \u2018there will be hell to pay\u2019 if captives held in Gaza during Israel\u2019s ongoing war are not released when he becomes President on 20 January, 2025. Whether this is all too familiar Trump bluster or if he is serious in his intent is not yet clear. It also seems contradictory to his \u2018America First\u2019 policy.",
    "What of Trump\u2019s likely China policy? Rick Waters, a former State Department specialist on China, who worked for the first Trump term, in a recent \u2018China Power Podcast\u2019 with Bonn Lynn, the Director of the \u2018China Power Project\u2019 and Senior Advisor at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 (CSIS) in Washington D.C, is of the view that there is likely to be \u2018significant volatility\u2019 in the US-China relationship. Biden, Waters observes, did not re-set the China Policy of Trump when he took over the Presidency in 2020. Waters is of the view that a \u2018leader level channel\u2019 between the US and China is crucial when Trump begins his second term. He foresees the establishment of \u2018Asian NATO\u2019 in the Indo-Pacific to counter China whereby the QUAD and AUKUS will be strengthened, and Washington- Tokyo-Manila and Washington-Tokyo- Seoul trilateral alliances formed.",
    "The entrenched view held in Washington, according to Brian Wong of The Diplomat in his insightful piece titled How will China react to Donald Trump\u2019s Second Term (13 November, 2024) is that the United States is uniquely confronted by a systemic rival in China, and that swift and assertive responses are needed to prevent the displacement of US hegemony by a state beholden to neither the values nor interests of Washington.",
    "Wong\u2019s view is that Trump\u2019s likely approach to China is best likened to \u201cRussian roulette\u201d given Trump\u2019s penchant for risky gambits and transactional diplomacy. Some commentators feel that Trump, as he did in his first term, will broker \u201cdeals\u201d in order to steer the East Asian region away from a hot war \u2013 \u2013 though through what means and with what effects he will do so are not as clear. Trump\u2019s China advisory and foreign policy team seems set to feature a combination of individuals harbouring deeply ideological grievances towards China (Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, and Robert O\u2019Brien); or a tendency to view China through the lens of a great power competition that the United States must win (Ric Grennell, Elbridge Colby, and Bill Hagerty); or the belief that trade globalisation has been anathema to the U.S. interests of the U.S working class and domestic interests in general (Robert Lighthizer, Peter Navarro).",
    "Few amongst these are interested in \u201ccooperating\u201d with China- \u2013 which they construe to be an existential risk to the United States, economically, militarily, and geo-strategically. US engagement with China, they would declare unequivocally, has failed.",
    "Trump will have to moderate some of his extreme and self-undermining protectionist measures so as to deliver for the MAGA crowd that voted him into office- -if he is even remotely committed to bringing down prices, the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Biden administration.",
    "Today\u2019s international, political, and geopolitical scene is dominated primarily by the different worldviews of the United States and China. According to Stephen Roach- -the author of \u2018Unbalanced: The Co-dependency of America and China\u2019 (2014) and \u2018Accidental Conflict: America, China, and the Clash of False Narratives\u2019 (2022)- \u2013 \u2018Sinophobia\u2019, which began in the United States at the beginning of the 21st century, is in full swing today based mostly on their competition in the fields of technology and trade. China has responded with \u2018Ameriphobia\u2019 demonising the United States for its accusations of Chinese economic espionage, unfair trading practices, and human rights violations.",
    "The U.S has long been intolerant of competing ideologies and alternative systems of government. The claim of \u2018American exceptionalism\u2019 seemingly compels the United States to impose American views and values on others. That was true during the Cold War, and it is true again today.",
    "The western bias over \u2018losing China\u2019 after the 1949 Revolution warned us of a \u201cRed Peril\u201d. Today we are being warned of a \u2018Rising China\u2019, modernising its nuclear and defence programmes. This \u2018China bogey\u2019, as the late Jayantha Dhanapala, the former UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs and foremost Sri Lankan diplomat noted a few years ago, will continue to be peddled as part of a larger conspiracy to create a new a Cold War in Asia between a \u2018democratic\u2019 India and an \u2018autocratic\u2019 China.",
    "To put it briefly, if the prevailing Sinophobic tension in the United States-China relations deteriorates further, it will not do any of us any good. The leaders of the U.S \u201cneed to avoid the low road and think more in terms of being the adult in the room.\u201d (Roach:2024). Roach quotes Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s memorable line from his inaugural address in 1933, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d and notes that amidst Sinophobic frenzy, that message is well worth remembering. Amen, I say.",
    "The geopolitical rivalry emanating from the fraught U.S.- China power competition is complicated further, by what appears to be, India\u2019s ambiguous role. True, India is a part of the QUAD and I2U2 (a security partnership among India, Israel, United Arab Republic and the United States), but India also has close relations with Russia and Iran. The recent border agreement between India and China is viewed as a diplomatic breakthrough, given the heightened tensions between the two sides after the Galwan Valley clash in 2020. Some observers suggest that the current breakthrough signals a significant change in India\u2019s threat perceptions of China, with some India- China watchers interpreting it as a desire on India\u2019s part to operate independently of its relationship with the United States. It may also be indicative of India\u2019s interest to bolster its economy while continuing to flaunt, what India refers to as, its multialigned foreign policy.",
    "In the emerging scenario in which complex geopolitical developments are at play in Asia and the Indian Ocean Region, Sri Lanka would do well to steer clear of them and adopt what I would term the \u2018Penelope strategy\u2019 that we encounter in Homer\u2019s epic poem \u2018Odyssey\u2019. This is the non-committal path, that Sri Lanka, given its unalterable geographic location, needs to take if it wishes to avoid harm arising from \u2018big\u2019 power conflict in our region.",
    "In 2002, during a Fulbright Visiting Scholar Enrichment Conference held in Washington D.C, Prof. Benjamin Barber of the University of Maryland gave a memorable keynote speech titled Democracy vs. Jihad vs. McWorld. In this speech he urged the United States, which has lived for almost 226 years with the \u2018Declaration of Independence\u2019, to now issue a \u2018Declaration of Interdependence\u2019. Given, especially the non-traditional security threats all of us face today, such as, resource scarcity, climate change which can lead to environmental degradation, natural disasters, poverty, infectious diseases, drug trafficking and terrorism that affect all of humanity, Prof. Barber\u2019s call is even more urgent today than when he first articulated it. In the 21st century that we live in, \u2018smart weapons\u2019 are much less important than \u2018smart ideas\u2019.",
    "The reality of the world of today is interdependence, as Prof. Barber pointed out almost 25 years ago. I would add one other ingredient and say that today we need both interdependence and multilateralism (however anathematic that may be to Mr. Trump and his colleagues-to-be). As the former Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and one of Sri Lanka\u2019s outstanding diplomats (now retired) said a few months ago when he delivered the inaugural Jayantha Dhanapala Memorial Oration, given that all threats or concerns humanity faces \u2018are borderless in form and content, negotiating solutions and mitigating measures must, of necessity, be multilateral\u2019. In a multipolar world, and in an order that is in flux we need more multilateralism than ever before, opined Palihakkara.",
    "As a lead-up to this conclusion of his, Palihakkara told us the following:",
    "As one of my dialogue partners from across Palk Straits commented in a lighter vein, the multilateral system needs to respond quicker before the AI-equipped cheap drones can become the poor man\u2019s weapon of mass destruction.",
    "Although stated in a lighter vein, one notes a serious underlying point in the above quote which underscores the direction in which we should head if we are to live in a peaceful world. (Concluded)",
