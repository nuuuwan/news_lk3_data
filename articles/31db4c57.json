    "The President of Sri Lanka is elected using a preferential voting system, whereby voters can rank up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the total valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the top two are eliminated, and the candidate with the most overall votes in the second round of counting is then declared the winner.",

    "Then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned following a popular uprising against them leading to incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe getting elected as the president.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s unprecedented crisis manifested in acute shortages of essentials and long lines for fuel and gas. Inflation soared to 70%, the rupee depreciated 45% and the economy shrank by 7.3%, forcing the government to seek a International Monetary Fund bailout.",
    "Aided by a bailout package from the IMF and Indian assistance have brought down the inflation and prices of essential commodities, but economic issues continue to dominate the minds of the voters.",
    "Although inflation cooled to 0.5% last month and GDP is forecast to grow 3% in 2024, for the first time in three years, the change is slow and yet to trickle down.",
    "However, Sri Lanka\u2019s voters will get to opportunity to choose among a record 38 candidates in fray though the contest is likely to narrow down between incumbent President and independent candidate Ranil Wickremasinghe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and National People Power\u2019s (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake.",
    "This three-way contest is unprecedented in Sri Lankan presidential elections, marking a historic moment with all candidates previously experiencing setbacks in the parliamentary polls.",
    "A good voter turnout is expected, in line with Sri Lanka\u2019s record of high voter participation in every national election. The last presidential poll in 2019 saw a voter turnout of 83.72 per cent.",
    "Widely considered a watershed election for the citizens of the island, it will not only elect the ninth Executive President but also a leader who they think will continue to steer the country out of its unprecedented economic crisis."
