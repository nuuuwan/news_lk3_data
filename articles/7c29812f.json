    "\u201cSri Lankans are more likely to think the country is headed in the wrong direction than people in any other country where this is polled. In June\u2013July 2024, a global average of 62% of adults polled by IPSOS in 29 countries thought their country was headed in the wrong direction compared with 93% in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "With only 8% of citizens thinking that the country is going in the right direction and 72% thinking it is \u201con the wrong track\u201d, it would be borderline lunacy to assume that Ranil, ably supported by the most detested parliamentarians since 1970-77, could get into double-digits in September. \u201c\u2026Public views towards the country\u2019s direction have worsened since July 2023, driven by a steady decline in uncommitted respondents.\u201d (Ibid)",
    "The pull-factor that took Apsari Sinhabahu Tillakaratne, \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 behind our nationally inspirational women\u2019s cricket team, and Sudarshini Fernandopulle, highly-respected doctor and politician, to Sajith Premadasa, is symbolic of a strategic reality: he has the \u2018soft power\u2019 to draw outstanding personalities outside his constituency to join or endorse him.",
    "Meanwhile, Sajith\u2019s new Alliance also shows that he has social and political partners, auxiliaries and \u2018reserves\u2019.",
    "\u2018\u2026Dissanayake also revealed that many MPs who recently defected to the SJB had tried to join the NPP but were turned away due to their questionable histories. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this country need politics like that?\u201d he asked\u2019. (https://www.ft.lk/news/AKD-pledges-to-introduce-legislation-to-stop-political-crossovers/56-765355)",
    "Apparently, those MPs were from the Dullas-GL faction(s). Where do their \u2018questionable histories\u2019 or political \u2018pedigree\u2019 (\u201cpatikiriya honda naha\u201d) start and stop? What constitutes a \u2018questionable history\u2019 and what doesn\u2019t? And \u2018questionable\u2019 in relation to whose or what history?",
    "Who decides? A leader who laments the loss of friends and acquaintances to state terrorism in the 1980s as AKD did at a gathering in Thambuttegama where he schooled, but has yet to apologise for the \u2018questionable history and pedigree\u2019 of the party he leads, which includes slaughtering more Sri Lankan leftist leaders and activists than colonialism and the capitalist class ever did, and murdering minor public servants who distributed polling cards for elections?",
    "Sajith\u2019s Samagi Jana Sandaanaya (SJS) was launched at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on August 8th. The NPP and UNP dismissed the Alliance saying its components consisted of those who had been his partners earlier.",
    "\u201cSoon it will be announced that Sajith\u2019s mother Hema also supports Sajith and has joined the Alliance\u201d pronounced the NPP\u2019s Dr Nalinda Jayatissa, acerbically and ungraciously. Chivalry was the personal hallmark from Marx and Engels to Fidel and Che. Lenin wanted Stalin sacked as Bolshevik party General-Secretary (only) because of rude speech. They\u2019d have abhorred gratuitous, ungentlemanly reference to a political adversary\u2019s mother. But then, civilit\u00e9 was never the JVP\u2019s strong suit.",
    "Moreover, the JVP-NPP misses the wood for the trees. On Aug 8th 2024 there were value-additions of qualitative importance: prominent Center-leftists Dullas Alahapperuma, Dayasiri Jayasekara and Prof Charitha Herath. They are reformist-dissidents from the SLPP and SLFP, representing the generic SLFP+Left \u20181956\u2019 tradition.",
    "When SLPP parliamentarians have shifted overwhelmingly to incumbent President Wickremesinghe, it is no small deal for Sajith to retain both his party (minus a few defectors) and his earlier allies. He\u2019s done much better than Mahinda and Basil.",
    "Sajith\u2019s Alliance is, so far, a confluence of four main currents:",
    "The SJB, the main parliamentary Opposition party and a breakaway from the UNP.",
    "Tamil parties representing the hill-country and the Southern towns including Colombo city.",
    "At the signing at the Water\u2019s Edge of an MoU with Dayasiri Jayasekara, SLFP General-Secretary and leader of an SLFP faction, Sajith spotlighted the \u201ctheoretical\u201d (\u201cnyaayika\u201d) compatibility between his own ideas and that of the SLFP, in as much as there is an overlap with the positive, progressive aspect of SWRD Bandaranaike\u2019s ideas. This echoed President Premadasa\u2019s last May Day speech (1992) in which he said he had transformed the UNP so totally that SWRD would never have thought of leaving it, and had the latter been alive he would have been on the UNP stage rather than on any other that year.",
    "Dayasiri was Sajith\u2019s wingman during the initial rebellion to reform and democratise the UNP in 2010-2011; a rebellion during which President Mahinda Rajapaksa saved Ranil, blocking access to the UNP headquarters Sirikotha for incoming party members from all over the island by initiating road construction overnight.",
    "The broadened Alliance at the Sugathadasa Stadium strategically positioned Premadasa as the moderate progressive alternative in the Presidential race, with Ranil and the SLPP renegades occupying the neoliberal Right, and AKD-JVP-NPP, the populist Left.",
    "Sajith occupies the ideological and programmatic centre; a New Middle Path, vital to sustainable reform and more fundamentally, to social, democratic and systemic stability.",
    "SP always leaned towards the progressive centre and social democracy, going back to his November 2019 presidential campaign up to late 2022. There was a muting of social democracy during the Wickremesinghe incumbency and the counter-productive endorsement of his \u201ceconomic doctrine and strategic direction\u201d by the SJB\u2019s Economic Council. That\u2019s what gave AKD-NPP a multiplier, enabling near-exponential growth.",
    "With the simultaneous \u2018Battles of the Brands\u2019 on two fronts, to draw the lines of demarcation between (a) himself and the SJB on the one hand, and Ranil Wickremesinghe on the other, as well as (b) between himself and the SJB on the one hand, and Anura Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP on the other, Sajith instinctively returned to the discursive triangle of progressive centrism, social democracy and (President Premadasa\u2019s) developmental populism. AKD-NPP began dropping since.",
    "The August 8th Alliance has anchored that progressive-centrist, social democratic orientation.",
    "The alienated, fence-sitting Centre-Left vote could prove decisive. There is no basis other than progressive-centrism for an SJB plus dissident SLPP/SLFP bloc which can reach undecided ex-MR votes. Similarly, the combination of populist-reformists from the UNP tradition (Sajith and the SJB) and centre-left reformists from the SLPP-SLFP traditions (Dullas, Dayasiri, GL, Nalaka, Dilan et al.), cannot but amount to-- and produce-- a social democratic orientation.",
    "This enables Sajith and the SJB to carve out a clear Third Space and Middle Path distinguishable from both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Dissanayake.",
    "Ranil stands for complete continuity; proceeding along the same path of growing poverty. That takes social sadism. It is the export-led, high-growth industrialisation model of Bangladesh that Nobel Prize winner Muhammed Yunus critiqued, tried to correct and counter-balance.",
    "Anura Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP do not stand for \u2018extreme socialism/leftism/communism\u2019 as the SJB alleges, but do stand for unclear, untested change; open-ended radical reform; and economic amateurism. 40 days from the election, I still don\u2019t know who the NPP\u2019s chief economist is and what he/she thinks. I also have yet to read a definitive, standalone JVP-NPP economic text which presents its solution to the economic crisis with the debt crisis at its core.",
    "Sajith stands for a combination of change and continuity; change within continuity and continuity within change. This provides the voters with a Third Alternative, that of moderate progressive, reformist change. Globally, it is this option of moderate change and a mixed economy that most people opt for as the intersection of \u2018most desirable\u2019 and \u2018least risky\u2019.",
    "Had the SJB remained solo, clutching its old Blueprint with an economic doctrine indistinguishable from that of incumbent Wickremesinghe, it would have facilitated defections to its old boss. By contrast, what the Aug 8th Alliance and its discourse do is to inoculate it from that temptation by strengthening populist and social democratic \u2018antibodies\u2019.",
    "Sajith Premadasa\u2019s speech at the Sugathadasa Stadium as Presidential candidate and leader of the Alliance was not the razor-edged oratorical masterpiece (\u201ca torch ablaze at both ends\u201d) that his father\u2019s was at the same venue on October 8th 1988 when accepting presidential nomination at the UNP\u2019s Special Session. However, it had echoes of that speech (\u201cvoice of the voiceless millions\u201d), progressive policy content, and cannot be defined as anything but \u2018social democratic centrist\u2019.",
    "In his Aug 8th address, Sajith laid down a marker by praising President Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cnew Social Contract\u201d -- the New Deal-- as a response to the Great Depression. He went on to advocate public-private partnerships (rather than a fire-sale approach) to state enterprise. He committed to an improved, \u201cstrengthened\u201d version of his late father\u2019s Janasaviya anti-poverty program \u201cwhich will be presented to the people very soon\u201d.",
    "Sajith explicitly reiterates his commitment to Social Democracy and goes onto unveil a creative concept: \u2018Social Democratic Market Economy\u2019. This bridges the gap between the global Centre-Left, Social Democratic view deriving from President Ranasinghe Premadasa who called for \u201ceconomic, social and political democracy\u201d and the global Centre-Right view pioneered by Konrad Adenauer\u2019s German Christian Democrats, of a \u2018Social Market Economy\u2019.",
    "Social Democracy is an ideology, a model of society, and an economic doctrine. Sajith positions himself ideologically/doctrinally/philosophically as a Social Democrat (\u201cSamaaja Prajaathanthravaadee darshanaya\u201d), committed to the social democratic goal of \u2018growth with equity\u2019.",
    "He differentiates himself from a classic Social Democratic economy with its top-heavy statism and wall-to-wall welfarism, by accommodating/incorporating the \u2018Social Market Economy\u2019 while modifying it, reinforcing the social and mixed economy/Middle Path character of the model by re-locating it within Social Democratic parameters. Hence, \u2018Social Democratic Market Economy\u2019.",
    "China defines itself and its worldview as \u2018Socialist\u2019, but describes its economic model as a \u2018Socialist Market Economy\u2019 or \u2018market socialism\u2019. Sajith Premadasa\u2019s is a broadly Social Democratic paradigm, with a Social Democratic Market Economy. Those who think it an oxymoron should ponder China\u2019s successful \u2018Socialist Market Economy\u2019.",
    "In their significant speeches at the Sugathadasa Stadium, new Alliance leaders Dullas Alahapperuma and Dayasiri Jayasekara picked up the refrain. Dullas reiterated Sajith\u2019s call for \u2018Social Democracy\u2019 and a \u2018Social Democratic Market Economy\u2019 while Dayasiri Jayasekara said \u201cwe must go beyond, to a Humanistic Social Democracy\u201d.",
    "This makes the August 8th Alliance a \u2018first\u2019. Not since SWRD Bandaranaike\u2019s founding SLFP manifesto of 1951 called for \u2018social democracy\u2019 \u2013 but criminally let it be overlaid by cultural nationalism by 1955-\u201956--has any mainstream party openly endorsed Social Democracy.",
    "Such positioning gives the SJB-led Alliance (SJS) an advantage over the JVP-NPP. Anura and the Maalimaawa haven\u2019t yet officially declared themselves and their project in universally or globally recognisable paradigmatic terms.",
    "It is not the combination of liberal democracy with neoliberal economics, nor liberal democracy with religio-cultural conservatism, that offers the best synthesis for humanity, but rather, liberal democracy with social democratic economics, that constitutes the most balanced, advanced, and humanistic form of modernity.",
    "What is curious is that Anura Dissanayake could have laid to rest many misgivings that arise from the JVP\u2019s past, by adopting Social Democracy before Sajith did. That would have been an obvious homebase for a leftwing party with a Marxist provenance. Yet he chose otherwise.",
    "Given the collapse of the socialist option as alternative universalist vision and system, the crisis of free-market economic liberalism\u2014neoliberalism\u2014resulted in a Far-Right backlash from ultranationalist conservatism or rightwing populism usually with heavy ethnoreligious overtones.",
    "This has brought home the need for a rectified liberal democracy; a strain of liberal democracy immunised against Far-Right populism. Social Democracy is political (liberal) democracy freighted with a different, fairer and more just social and economic content. It was also historically so, when it resisted Communism which it deemed totalitarian.",
    "Social Democracy is the child of liberal democracy. Its great strength is that it is a fusion which combines two streams in history, stemming from two fundamental human \u2013ontological--impulses, individual and collective. It fuses the resistance to and rebellion against absolutism, and for freedom and democracy, with rebellion against social and economic injustice, and for a fairer social order.",
    "It is distinguishable from Communism which neglected/negated the struggle for freedom and democracy\u2014individual and collective. Communism tended to over-emphasise, mono-causally and one-dimensionally, the struggle against economic exploitation and injustice and for socioeconomic justice.",
    "When the liberal democratic Right (Reagan, Thatcher) and Communist Left clashed, what was eliminated was the centre-space, the middle-ground. That is the space of and for Social Democracy.\u00a0 Social Democracy is the political philosophy that best corresponds to the Buddha\u2019s commendation of the Middle Path, the injunction of the Delphic Oracle \u2018Nothing in Excess\u2019, and Aristotle\u2019s urging of the Golden Mean.\u00a0 Social Democracy is more complete and more advanced than its parent, liberal democracy. It stands the best chance of being the last universalist ideology standing.",
    "Social Democracy is the main doctrine overarching and encompassing two moderate, modernist political models, almost archetypes:",
    "Significantly and symptomatically, Anura passed it up, Sajith picked it up.",
    "The embrace of Social Democracy by Premadasa and his partners in the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) representing the most progressive-reformist elements of the main pillars of Sri Lankan democracy, the UNP and the SLFP-SLPP, makes August 8th 2024 a potentially historic date.",
    "In the vortex of the current crisis, Sri Lankan voters must look for the political option that most closely approximates a social democratic ideology and program.",
    "But what if Sajith and the SJB are merely \u2018signaling Left to turn Right\u2019? There will be guardrails. If the SJB\u2019s rightwing pushes Sajith\u2019s SJS administration off social democratic/Ranasinghe Premadasa policy rails, it will face:",
    "(I I I ) The FSP-led Alliance of Aragalaya personalities driving the extra-parliamentary Opposition.",
    "It took guts to do what Namal Rajapaksa did: contest the Presidential election in the worst possible circumstances. By contesting, NR is de-linking himself and the \u2018survivalist\u2019 younger generation of the party from the SLPP \u2018barons\u2019 who defected to Ranil. Thereby he ensures that he has at least a life-raft of a party for the future.",
    "He also preserves for himself unmatched political capital, the value of which is way down now after Gotabaya\u2019s lunatic economics, but will perhaps rise steeply someday: the sociopolitical capital of being the eldest son of the popular, war-winning President MR.",
    "By riding against the wind, Namal is scripting a credible \u2018heroic\u2019 narrative: a young man taking a principled stand, on a lone \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 to fight loyally for the national and economic policies of his famous father Mahinda, instead of surrendering and converting to Ranil\u2019s anti-national neoliberalism at a time when most of the SLPP parliamentary group had betrayed the party\u2019s banner.",
    "\u201c\u2026Issues surfaced. An example is the divestiture of state property. The issue raised concerns with SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa himself.\u201d (https://www.sundaytimes.lk/240811/columns/after-dhammika-pulls-out-slpp-turns-to-namal-for-presidential-race-567347.html)",
    "If Namal clocks 250,000 votes, he decides the winner, as Ossie Abeygoonasekara pretty much did in 1988.",
    "Namal\u2019s run is a rite of passage, which is a return to his roots. He is following in the footsteps of his grandfather DA Rajapaksa, sole parliamentarian to follow SWRD Bandaranaike out of the UNP government of the mighty DS Senanayake in 1951.",
    "At its first election immediately after, in 1952, SWRD\u2019s SLFP came third, behind the rightwing conservative UNP and the Marxist leftist LSSP. But the next election, 1956, was the \u2018Silent Revolution\u2019."
