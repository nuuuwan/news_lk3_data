    "SLT-MOBITEL, the National ICT Solutions Provider, is set to redefine digital home experiences with the introduction of its \u2018Fibre To The Room\u2019 (FTTR) solution, making homes smarter.",
    "FTTR is the premier solution for a full fibre home network. The facility extends fibre connectivity to every room with the latest Wi-Fi 7 coverage, creating a brand-new digital life experience for SLT-MOBITEL\u2019s valued customers.",
    "Home internet consumers who reside in multi-level properties and homes with dividing walls and columns, often experience Wi-Fi dead zones. Similarly, users in specific locations of their home spaces frequently experience disconnections and low speeds.",
    "FTTR fixes these problems and provides superior internet connectivity for every room by eliminating signal interference and degradation.",
    "SLT-MOBITEL uses an innovative, smart roaming technology to implement one network for the entire house. It ensures the roaming handover time is less than 10ms, establishing a seamless exchange anytime, anywhere. This solution supports the smooth and simultaneous efficiency of multiple IoT and other devices, paired with stable connectivity.",
    "Additionally, Wi-Fi 7 technology offers a higher density and capacity for data transmission with optimized network control. It enables improved transmission efficiency and stability when multiple users access the Internet concurrently. Another key advantage of the FTTR solution is its ability to integrate seamlessly into existing home layouts without causing disruptions.",
    "The FTTR for Home solution consists of the main FTTR and sub FTTRs, connected through strong, transparent, invisible self-bound optical fibre cables. These transparent fibres can be rapidly deployed to any room without damaging walls or disturbing preexisting floor plans. A selection of flexible installation options, including desktop, wall-mounted, and panel brackets, are also available to meet a variety of home decors.",
