### Sri Lanka leader hands over India-funded smart classrooms ahead of election

*2024-07-08 11:29:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-leader-hands-over-india-funded-smart-classrooms-ahead-of-election-171211/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, emulating the island nation’s opposition leader, handed over smart classrooms to Southern Provincial state schools as he is eyeing to contest in a grand independent coalition.

Analysts see the move as a strategy to face a rising support for a similar project implemented by main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa who has been distributing smart classes and relevant equipment for schools across the country with funding he has not disclosed.

President Wickremesinghe distributed the digital equipment under an Indian grant project worth 300 million Sri Lanka rupees ($1 million) for establishing 200 smart classrooms with 2200 smart tablets being provided to school students in Southern Province.

The project aims at equipping 200 schools in the Province with necessary digital tools that would enable them to benefit from digital resources and materials across the globe, the Indian High Commission said in a statement.

### Surprise defeat for far-right in France in Macron’s snap election gambit

*2024-07-08 11:25:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/surprise-defeat-for-far-right-in-france-in-macrons-snap-election-gambit-171206/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — President Emanuel Macron’s gamble in calling a snap poll somewhat paid off after a left-wing alliance secured the highest number of seats in the French parliament, effectively defeating an alliance led by the far-right National Rally.

The Economist reported that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN)-led bloc, which was widely anticipated to top the voting, will now end up in third place, securing 134 to 152 seats. However, this is still a major win for the once-fringe party which only held 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, indicating the mainstreaming of its hard-right ideology.

A left-wing alliance led by Jean-Luc Melenchon is projected to have secured 171-187 seats after what CNN has called tactical voting in Sunday’s second round election. CNN noted that France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority.

### Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

*2024-07-08 11:07:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/) · `en`

A pardon is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary ‘as an act of grace’. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an “action of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or conviction”. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons – one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons – one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

Some penal codes contain provisions that discriminate against women and girls, and poor enforcement of laws further contributes to abuses going unpunished.”

China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports.

Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake has said if the Supreme Court issues a restraining order on the petition to prevent the holding of the Presidential election, the announcement of the election date will need to be suspended.

He said that after 17 July the ECSL will be empowered to announce the date for calling nominations for the election. Accordingly thereafter the ECSL will be able to accept nominations 16-21 days following the announcement. He also noted polling will take place within 4-6 weeks from the date of calling for nominations.

“If the Court does not issue an injunction order preventing the holding of elections, the Presidential elections can go ahead unabated,” he said.

The Presidential election is scheduled to take place between 17 September and 16 October. Ratnayake further said that once the Election Commission assumes its authority, it will review the Constitution and determine suitable dates for accepting nominations and conducting the vote.
