  "original_body_lines": [
    "The 1990 Suwasariya Foundation, established in 2016 with 297 ambulances donated by TATA Sons Ltd., under an Indian Government grant, is set to expand its fleet to meet growing demand for emergency and pre-hospital treatment services.",
    "TATA Sons Ltd. has agreed to donate 50 ambulances, while the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide an additional 45 ambulances as a grant.",
    "The move was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday to obtain these ambulances for the 1990 Suwasariya Foundation.",
    "The foundation currently operates 322 ambulances, including 25 provided by the Sri Lankan Government. However, to achieve its target of 450 ambulances and 25 backup units, an additional 150 ambulances were needed.",
    "Thus, addition of these 95 ambulances will significantly enhance the foundation\u2019s ability to provide timely and critical medical assistance across the country, boosting its capacity to save lives and improve health outcomes.",
    "Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena commended the move, particularly given the current restrictions on vehicle imports due to the ongoing foreign exchange crisis.",
    "\u201cThe support from TATA Sons and the ADB is invaluable, especially in these challenging times,\u201d he said.",
    "The proposal to this effect, submitted by Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."
