    "SriLankan Airlines recently celebrated the seventh anniversary of its Melbourne-Colombo route, launched in 2017.",
    "Since then, the airline has successfully connected many Sri Lankan expatriates and students to Melbourne while providing seamless travel options for tourists travelling between Melbourne, Sri Lanka, and beyond, particularly destinations across India.",
    "With steady growth in traffic, including tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka, the Melbourne-Colombo route has become popular among travellers visiting friends and relatives or vacationing between Australia and South Asia, strengthening cultural and economic ties between the two regions. The route is also one of SriLankan Airlines\u2019 top performers, both as a direct flight and a convenient connection, especially for Indian passengers.",
    "Head of Worldwide Sales and Distribution Dimuthu Tennakoon said: \u201cAs we celebrate this milestone, SriLankan Airlines will continue exploring potential expansion opportunities across its network to support the envisioned growth of this important route. With a strong foundation built over the past seven years, the airline is well-positioned to enhance connectivity and promote tourism between Sri Lanka and Australia.\u201d",
    "Regional Manager \u2013 Asia Pacific V. Ravindran said: \u201cWe are excited and overwhelmed by the success of our operations. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire team, and I extend my heartfelt appreciation to each member for their contribution. As we move forward, we look forward to continuing to provide exceptional service and to strengthening our connections between Australia and Sri Lanka. Our commitment to our passengers remains unwavering, and we are eager to explore new opportunities for growth and enhanced travel experiences.\u201d",
    "SriLankan Airlines operates Airbus A330-300 and 200 series aircrafts on the Melbourne route, ensuring modern in-flight comforts for passengers. Flights UL604 and UL605 currently operate a daily service between Colombo and Melbourne. Passengers can expect the award-winning service for which the airline is renowned for when travelling with SriLankan Airlines.",
    "In addition to the robust flight service, SriLankan Airlines has further solidified its presence in Australia by actively engaging with the local community. This includes regular support for events organised by Sri Lankan expatriate organisations, reaching many thousands with the brand\u2019s message as well as sponsorship of major sporting events in Australia, such as the Melbourne Half Marathon and the Great Ocean Road Running Festival, to boost brand visibility. These sponsorships are part of a broader strategy to foster connections within the local community and support events that resonate with both Sri Lankan and Australian cultures.",
    "By collaborating with \u2018Invest Victoria,\u2019 the airline has also strengthened its ties with the State Government, furthering its mission to promote tourism and cultural exchange.",
    "SriLankan said the seventh anniversary of SriLankan Airlines in Melbourne is not just a celebration of successful flights; it symbolises the deepening bond between two vibrant cultures and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead for travellers from both nations."
