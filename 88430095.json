    "The project has yielded numerous benefits for the communities involved, including:",
    "1) Conducting an outreach campaign that reached 10,000 host community members and 1,000 migrant returnees, raising awareness about available support,",
    "2) Providing training to over 550 returnee workers, equipping them with valuable skills to enhance their employability,",
