### What more can Govt. do: Strategies to solidify economic progress post-elections

*2024-10-14 22:51:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-more-can-Govt-do-Strategies-to-solidify-economic-progress-post-elections/4-767955) · `en`

Given Sri Lanka’s strategic location, the Government can actively engage in deepening regional trade ties, particularly with fast-growing economies

While the recent Presidential elections in Sri Lanka have set a positive tone for the country’s economic and political landscape, there is still significant work to be done to build on this momentum. The Government’s initial focus on anti-corruption, transparency, and institutional reforms has already had a strong impact on market confidence and investor sentiment. However, in the current global economic climate, additional measures are necessary to ensure that these early gains translate into long-term prosperity. Here are some key areas the Government could focus on to further strengthen its positive market impact:

### Education for system change: Proposal for critical thinking and civic responsibility curriculum

*2024-10-14 22:45:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Education-for-system-change-Proposal-for-critical-thinking-and-civic-responsibility-curriculum/4-767954) · `en`

Conditioned to internalise information mechanically, students are moulded into conformity and rote memorisation, influenced more by parental expectations and societal pressures than by their talents and aspirations

The entrenched education system excels at producing highly skilled and committed engineers, doctors, mathematicians, and IT professionals, yet it often fails to prepare them to address the oppression and injustices encountered when applying their education in their professions. These professionals may be blind to, or unwilling to acknowledge, these issues. Evidence abounds that educated, talented, and well-travelled individuals—those leading cosmopolitan lives—frequently perpetuate disparities and inequities. They swiftly blame extremists and politicians when things go awry and comfortably evade accountability by positioning themselves as mere producers of ideas, conveniently leaving implementation to others

### Creating a holistic experience for tourists at popular sites: Lessons from Bangkok and Ayutthaya

While the practice of removing shoes when entering places of Buddhist worship is practiced in both countries, Sri Lanka appears to be taking a more extreme stand regarding the distance at which this requirement must be met

Both Thailand and Sri Lanka boast of numerous tourist attractions that are essentially places of religious worship. The challenge faced by administrators of such sites is to strike a balance between the need to maintain dignity and decorum expected in a place of worship with the need to create a pleasant and convenient experience to those who travel from faraway places to catch a glimpse of these renowned sites

The ESG narrative within the new political context could be beneficial for positioning Sri Lankan businesses to attract investment into the country

Sri Lanka’s new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been sworn into office, marking a significant shift in the country’s political and economic trajectory. The new administration is focused on steering the country towards a more sustainable and inclusive economic model, which could significantly impact the business environment and the promotion of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies. Could the potential of more left-leaning policies help to foster a more sustainable business economy by emphasising local industries and sustainable practices?

### India withdraws Canada envoy named in probe, expels diplomats

India ordered the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats on Monday and withdrew its own envoy from Canada, in response to what it said was Ottawa’s decision to name him and others as “persons of interest” in an investigation.

India did not go into detail on the investigation, but relations have been fraught since 2023, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had evidence linking Indian agents to the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader on his territory.

India has long denied Trudeau’s accusation. On Monday it dismissed Canada’s move on the inquiry and accused Trudeau of pursuing a “political agenda”.

“We have no faith in the current Canadian Government’s commitment to ensure their security.

Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

It later said it had asked the six Canadian diplomats to leave by Saturday.
