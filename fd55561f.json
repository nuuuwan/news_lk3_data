    "Birthrates are a critical issue for Japan and other countries with rapidly aging populations. After peaking in 2008, Japan\u2019s population has since shrunk steadily due to a declining birth rate.",
    "An estimated 42% of adult Japanese women may end up never having children, the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing a soon-to-be-published estimate by a government research group.",
    "In a more optimistic scenario, a quarter of women born in 2005 may end up not having offspring. The midpoint estimate by Japan\u2019s National Institute of Population and Social Security Research calls for a third of them having children, the newspaper reported Wednesday.",
    "Birthrates are a critical issue for Japan and other countries with rapidly aging populations. The island nation posted the fewest births in its recorded history last year, continuing a seven-year decline. With a smaller workforce and fewer taxpayers to sustain the world\u2019s third-largest economy, Japan has become one of the world\u2019s most indebted countries.",
    "The percentage of childlessness is even higher for men, with as many as 50% never seen having children, according to the report, the Nikkei said. (Hindustan Times)"
