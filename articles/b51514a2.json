    "British politician John Prescott, a former merchant seaman who rose to the post of deputy prime minister, has died at age 86.",
    "Prescott\u2019s family announced his death on Thursday. They said the politician, who had been suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, died peacefully in a care home on Wednesday with his loved ones around him.",
    "The family said Prescott had \u201cspent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment.\u201d",
    "For a decade, Prescott brought grit, humor and working-class authenticity to the government of the young, polished Tony Blair, who became prime minister in 1997.",
    "\u201cHe was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics, one of the most committed and loyal, and definitely the most unusual,\u201d Blair said.",
    "An amateur boxer in his youth, Prescott was a pugnacious politician who memorably punched a man who threw an egg at him during the 2001 general election.",
    "The uproar briefly looked like it might harm the party, and Prescott\u2019s career. But Blair\u2019s response -\u2013 \u201cJohn is John\u201d -\u2013 cemented his folksy status.",
    "Prescott entered politics through the trade union movement \u2014 a once-common route that became less frequent after Blair rebranded the left-leaning party \u201cNew Labour\u201d and shifted its politics toward the center,",
    "He was a proud working-class figure in a country that still has few from that background at the top of politics. He unapologetically liked the finer things in life and was nicknamed \u201cTwo Jags\u201d by the press because he had two Jaguar luxury cars.",
    "The egg-thrower punching incident earned him another nickname: \u201cTwo Jabs\u201d",
    "Prescott served as Blair\u2019s deputy between 1997 and 2007. One of his proudest achievements was working with then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the landmark Kyoto Protocol climate change agreement in 1997.",
    "Gore said he had \u201cnever worked with anyone in politics \u2014 on my side of the pond or his \u2014 quite like John Prescott.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I\u2019m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend,\u201d Gore said in a statement.",
    "Prescott represented his home city of Hull in northern England for four decades. After Labour lost power in 2010 he was made a member of Parliament\u2019s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.",
    "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Prescott was a true working-class hero.",
    "\u201cHe wanted the good things in life for everyone and not just himself,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he showed that Britain can be a country where if you work hard you can fill your potential.\u201d",
    "He is survived by his wife Pauline and sons Johnathan and David."
