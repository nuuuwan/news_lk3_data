  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Ministry of Defense has been petitioned in the Court of Appeal, seeking to overturn a directive that requires individuals holding firearms for personal protection under licensed permits to return them.",
    "The petition was filed by H.D. Navinthaka de Silva, CEO of Avenra Hotel Group, who argues that the decision poses a significant risk to his safety.",
    "The Secretary of the Ministry of Defense, the Director of the State Intelligence Service, and the Acting Inspector General of Police have been named as respondents in the case.",
    "Filed through lawyer Sanath Wijayawardena, the petition claims that Mr. de Silva obtained licensed firearms from the Ministry of Defense around 2012 or 2013 due to serious personal threats.",
    "He further noted that his business, including his hotels, suffered considerable damage during recent political unrest, compounding his security concerns.",
    "The petition highlights that an announcement from the Secretary of Defense, issued on October 7, calls for the return of firearms licensed for personal protection. Mr. de Silva contends that this directive increases the danger he faces as a businessman, and despite appealing against the decision, he has not received a favorable outcome.",
    "The petitioner is requesting the Court of Appeal to issue a writ order invalidating the Defense Ministry\u2019s order.",
    "Additionally, he seeks an interim injunction be issued suspending the implementation of the directive until a final decision is reached after the hearing of the case."
