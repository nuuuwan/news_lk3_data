    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have scored a diplomatic coup praising President Donald Trump, repeating a claim that the invasion of Ukraine would not have happened during a Trump presidency, reports said.",
    "No mention was made of \u2018secondary sanctions\u2019 after a meeting of the two leaders in Alaska, raising expectations that the US would not impose additional taxes on countries that imported Russian oil including India, after the meeting with Putin which ended without a ceasefire.",
    "\u201cThere were many, many points that we agreed on,\u201d Trump said at a joint press statement event where no questions were entertained unlike the usual style of Western democracies.",
    "\u201cI would say a couple of big ones that we haven\u2019t quite got there, but we\u2019ve made some headway. So there\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal.\u201d",
    "\u201cI will call up NATO in a little while. I\u2019ll call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I\u2019ll, of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today\u2019s meeting.\u201d",
    "Remarkably a post meeting \u2018press conference\u2019 ended without a question period for reporters, which has been interpreted that Trump, supposedly the leader of the \u2018free world\u2019 had been completely controlled by the Russian president into killing the question period.",
    "The Committee to Protect Journalists have said 13 journalists have been killed \u2018contract style\u2019 under the Putin presidency and nobody has been caught. Trump also regularly blasts reporters but no one has died in the US.",
    "\u201cI will call up NATO in a little while. I\u2019ll call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I\u2019ll, of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today\u2019s meeting,\u201d Trump said in his statement.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up to them. They\u2019re going to have to agree with [Secretary of State] Marco [Rubio] and [Special Envoy] Steve [Witkoff] and some of the great people from the Trump administration who\u2019ve come here.\u201d",
    "Putin took a shot at ex-President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s former rival, implying that he was pushed to invade Ukraine by the actions of \u2018my previous US colleague\u2019.",
    "\u201cToday with President Trump saying if he was the President back then, there will be no war and I sure that would be indeed so,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI can confirm that.\u201d",
    "Putin said there was \u2018business like contact\u2019 with Trump and the possibility of arctic co-operation.",
    "Trump said he had always had a \u2018fantastic relationship\u2019 with \u2018Vladimir\u2019.",
    "Putin said there was a shared history with Alaska, which was bought by the United States from Russian Czar Alexander II in 1861.",
    "There was a Russian Orthodox Church and several hundred Russian place names in Alaska, he said.",
    "Putin also praised the US for the military aid (lend lease) given during the Second World War which helped the then Soviet Union defeat Hitler.",
    "\u201cDuring the Second World War this Alaska was the origin of the legendary air bridge for the supply of military aircraft and other equipment under the lend lease program,\u201d Putin said.",
    "\u201cIt was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast expanse of ice. But pilots of both countries gave it their all for a common victory.\u201d",
    "While the US allowed elections in Germany and Japan after their defeat as well as countries liberated by the US and UK, including France, Netherlands and Norway among others, then Soviet Leader Stalin eliminated the democratic opposition in Eastern European nations the Red Army \u2018liberated\u2019, leading to the cold war and the Iron Curtain.",
    "Stalin originally teamed up with Hitler\u2019s plan to build a \u2018Greater Germany\u2019, helped him invade Poland and secretly divided the country between them, leading to the UK, which was Poland\u2019s ally, to declare war on Hitler triggering the Second World War in Europe.",
    "Poland was the first country to give fighter jets to Ukraine to fight off Putin.",
    "Ukraine went to Russia in the so-called Second and Third partitions of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) but has tried to regain independence several times.",
    "Ukraine briefly declared independence in January 1918 (Read More : as the Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic) when Russia fell to the Bolsheviks but the Red Army re-conquered the country.",
    "European leaders fear a repeat of Hitler, with Putin\u2019s idea of a Greater Russia incorporating Ukraine as the first key step to recreate the Soviet Union or Czar\u2019s Russian Empire.",
    "Hitler was trying to build a Third Reich, the first being the Holy Roman Empire, the second the German Empire which ended in the defeat at World War II.",
    "Europe fears Putin\u2019s \u00a0\u201cNovorossiya\u201d (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f) project, with earlier re-incarnations being the Russian Empire of the Czars and the USSR. However Putin traces the history even further back to the Keivan Rus, a sovereignty centred around present-day Ukraine.",
    "\u201cRussians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are all descendants of Ancient Rus, which was the largest state in Europe,\u201d Putin said in a speech in 2021, which repeated some of his earlier ethno-religious nationalist claims in a comprehensive speech.",
    "\u201cSlavic and other tribes across the vast territory \u2013 from Ladoga, Novgorod, and Pskov to Kiev and Chernigov \u2013 were bound together by one language (which we now refer to as Old Russian), economic ties, the rule of the princes of the Rurik dynasty, and \u2013 after the baptism of Rus \u2013 the Orthodox faith.",
    "\u201cThe spiritual choice made by St. Vladimir, who was both Prince of Novgorod and Grand Prince of Kiev, still largely determines our affinity today.\u201d",
    "At the press conference Putin warned Europe not to \u2018torpedo\u2019 his talks with Trump. (Colombo/Aug17/2025)"
