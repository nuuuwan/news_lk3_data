    "Sampath Edirisuriya in his diatribe against our Prime Minister accepting an honorary degree from Delhi University claims that the Indian Government was behind the award and that her acceptance will have a detrimental impact on our policies on our actions on Indian boats fishing in our seas and even our ownership of Kachchativu. I am surprised that he did not include the role of RAW in the process and its bearings on our positions on the proposed road connection with India and our position on Indo-China conflicts in the Indian Ocean.",
    "Honorary Degrees are routinely awarded by University Senates or similar academic bodies to distinguished alumni and those who have contributed to the development of the Universities and has never been \u2018a matter of recognising the knowledge he or she has produced\u2019 which is the basis for awarding earned degrees. The Indian government\u2019s role would have been merely to arrange for the special convocation to fit into the dates and the progamme of her visit to India. There is nothing surprising in this Award as she is a Delhi University alumna who has distinguished herself by being elected Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. If an alumnus of any of our Universities became a President or Prime Minister of another country, I am sure the University will be rushing to felicitate him or her with the award of a honorary degree. We should be congratulating Dr. Amarasuriya for the recognition she has gained rather than carping on over-exaggerated fears.",
    "Sri Lanka can hardly complain about the award of degrees by foreign Universities. I cannot recall Edirisuriya commenting on the University of Colombo\u2019s award of honorary degrees to President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Defence Secretary Gotabaya or the honorary degrees given by dubious Universities like those routinely given to the likes of Mervyn Silva and several other Sri Lankans and foreigners by Dr. Anton Jayasuriya\u2019s \u2018University\u2019 or the doctorate and Professorship awarded by the Irish international University to Dr. Jayalath Jayawardene. Our politicians are also well known for using the title of Professor although they are neither currently attached to Universities nor been awarded Emeritus Professorships, adding bogus doctorates to their names, passing examinations privately held under suspicious circumstances or flaunting their aegrotat degrees.",
    "While Edirisuriya comments on the academic violations of Delhi Universitiy, those of Jawarharlal Nehru University and South Asia University have received far greater publicity. Prof. Apoorvanand (Jha) is a well-known political columnist in the several newspapers and TV and is known for his campaigns for greater democracy, secularism and leftist ideas on governance. I have not heard about the controversy of Apoorvanand\u2019s claim for Headship but Headships, unless decided by seniority, are decided by fellow academics, Deans and Vice Chancellors, and it is they that have to be blamed, not Governments. Headships are routinely doled out to stooges and friends of Deans and Vice Chancellors in Sri Lanka, sometimes even surreptitiously. We have had instances of straw polls being conducted by Vice Chancellors followed by the Headship being awarded to someone with the lowest vote. We even have a case of a lecturer suspended for two years for examination offences with sexual harassment connotations being made Head of a Department soon after returning from suspension.",
    "Similarly, syllabi are decided on by academic bodies. The only way governments can make changes without the support of the majority of academics in a University is by making a law or decision governing all Universities.",
    "Unlike in the West, the one area where governments in many South Asian countries including Sri Lanka are involved has been in the appointment of Vice Chancellors. Ideally a Search Committee should be appointed and a person with vision, strong academic background, good interpersonnel relationships and (in some countries) ability to mobilise funds from donors, should be identified. However, this is not so in our countries. In Bangladesh, the Vice Chancellors of Universities other than the four early Universities which are governed by a different Act are appointed by the President with the consent of the Prime Minister. In India the procedures vary from State to State but political involvement is rife. At present there is a controversy in the Courts regarding two new Universities in Kerala where there is a dispute as to who should have greater influence on the search Committees for Vice Chancellor \u2013 the Governor appointed by the Modi Government or the Communist Chief minister.",
    "We in Sri Lanka have had a history of political interference in Vice Chancellor selection ever since Sir Nicholas Attygalle, a nominee of the ruling party in the Senate was appointed Vice Chancellor after his sixtieth birthday and continued until he was over 73 years although the University of Ceylon Act stated that \u2018no person shall continue to hold the office of Vice-Chancellor after he has completed his sixtieth year,\u2019 the authorities claiming that since Sir Nicholas had already passed his 60th birthday the provision did not apply to him. We also saw two distinguished Vice Chancellors being denied a second term as they avoided signing an advertisement of Vice Chancellors endorsing Mahinda Rajapaks\u2019s candidacy for re-election as President as they felt this would demean the office of Vice Chancellor. Dr. Amarasuriya, as Minister in charge of the Universities has made a statement that appointments of Vice Chancellors under this government will be free of political interference but these are still early days and we can only wait and see.",
