  "original_body_lines": [
    "The HMPV cases are now reportedly rising in Malaysia. In 2024, 327 HMPV cases were reported in the country, a 45% increase compared to 225 cases in 2023. This increase comes amidst reports of rising respiratory illnesses in other countries, including China.",
    "According to the Straits Times, Malaysia\u2019s Health Ministry urged the public to practice preventive measures, including frequent handwashing with soap, wearing face masks, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.",
    "\u201cThe public is advised to proactively take care of their health and prevent infection to others, especially in enclosed and crowded areas,\u201d the ministry stated. \u201cThis includes those planning to travel to countries at risk.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, India has reported two cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Two infants were infected with the virus in Karnataka\u2019s Bengaluru, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday (January 6). One case is also suspected in Gujarat.",
    "The HMPV infection in India was detected in a three-month old girl and an eight-month old boy who were treated at Baptist hospital-Bengaluru. Both the children came in with symptoms of pneumonia, the girl has since been discharged and the boy is recovering, the Indian media reported.",
    "Clarifying the status of the virus, the Indian Health Ministry issued a statement, saying, \u201cHMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries.\u201d",
    "It added that there was no history of international travel in the two cases that were picked up during surveillance, meaning that these infections have no connection to the reported surge in respiratory infections in China.",
    "This comes amid a surge in HMPV cases in China, leading to overcrowded hospitals and fears of a wider outbreak. The respiratory virus, which causes symptoms similar to a cold, was also detected in Malaysia last year.",
    "Five years after the outbreak of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic that claimed over 7 million lives across the global, the HMPV virus in China is being monitored by several countries.",
    "HMPV infections have been documented nationwide in China as the government has ramped up screening, identification and isolation procedures to address unidentified infections. Various videos on social media depicted a scary scene at hospitals, with individuals wearing masks crammed into waiting areas.",
    "Frightening videos show patients coughing at the hospitals amid a spike in respiratory illness. Officials have said that China seen an increase in HMPV cases, particularly among children under the age of 14 in northern areas, reported news agency Reuters.",
    "The spike in cases coincides with colder weather and increased indoor activity, conditions that typically fuel the spread of respiratory viruses. Health officials emphasize that this surge is consistent with seasonal trends.",
    "China\u2019s National Disease Control and Prevention Administration recently reported an increase in respiratory infections, including HMPV, during the winter. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not flagged the situation as a global health emergency, but the rise in cases has prompted authorities to bolster monitoring systems.",
    "A pilot programme has been launched to track pneumonia of unknown origin, ensuring labs and health agencies report and manage cases more effectively, state broadcaster CCTV reported, quoting an administration official at a news conference.",
    "Hong Kong has reported a few cases of HMPV. Neighbouring countries like Cambodia and Taiwan are keeping a close watch on the situation. Cambodia\u2019s Communicable Disease Control Department has issued warnings about HMPV, noting its similarity to Covid-19 and influenza.",
    "Taiwan\u2019s Centers for Disease Control has said the virus\u2019s higher risks for children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals.",
    "In neighbouring India, officials said there is no need for panic as HMPV is \u201clike any other respiratory virus\u201d.",
    "China is currently experiencing a surge in HMPV cases, alongside other respiratory illnesses like influenza A, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and COVID-19. Reports suggest hospitals in some regions are overwhelmed, but Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have not declared a state of emergency.",
    "HMPV can affect people of all ages, but the most vulnerable groups include:",
    "-People with weakened immune systems or chronic respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD.",
    "-Close contact, such as shaking hands or touching someone infected.",
    "-Contact with contaminated surfaces, followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.",
    "-The virus often circulates seasonally, peaking in late winter and spring in temperate regions.",
    "In more serious cases, it can escalate to bronchitis, pneumonia, or asthma exacerbations.",
    "Testing is rare unless symptoms are severe or part of an outbreak. Diagnostic methods include:",
    "-Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT): Detects viral genome in respiratory secretions.",
    "-Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.",
    "There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Symptom management includes:",
    "-Severe cases may require hospitalization for oxygen therapy or intravenous fluids.",
    "-Both HMPV and COVID-19 cause respiratory symptoms such as coughing, fever, congestion, and shortness of breath. They also spread through respiratory droplets.",
    "-Post-COVID-19 lockdowns, surges in HMPV cases have been observed as populations re-expose themselves to respiratory pathogens.",
    "No, HMPV is not a new virus or an imminent pandemic threat. Seasonal surges are common, particularly during the winter months. However, the increase in cases post-COVID-19 restrictions has raised concerns.",
    "The HMPV virus was first identified in children in 2001 in the Netherlands. Infection with HMPV usually occurs by the age of five years with reinfection occurring throughout life as immune protection induced by the virus is too weak to prevent repeated infections.",
    "The virus causes upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, with lower respiratory tract infections being among the most common. While the virus often causes only mild disease, it can lead to severe illness requiring hospitalisation in children, immunocompromised populations and the elderly.",
    "Globally, 3%-10% of hospital admissions and 1% of acute lower respiratory infection-related deaths in children under age five in 2018 are attributed to HMPV, as per a 2021 paper. The study also found that children younger than six months, especially those in low- and lower-middle-income countries, are at greater risk of death caused by the HMPV virus.",
    "Detection of a large number of HMPV cases among children aged less than 14 years in China is a reflection of the heightened surveillance and testing for the virus."
