    "CEAT Kelani Holdings won prestigious double honours at the National Business Excellence Awards 2024 presented by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL), reaffirming the company\u2019s status as one of the country\u2019s foremost manufacturing success stories.",
    "The manufacturer of half of Sri Lanka\u2019s pneumatic tyre requirements, CEAT Kelani won the National Business Excellence Award (NBEA) in the \u2018Manufacturing \u2013 Other\u2019 category and was the winner of the Criteria Award for Excellence in Local Market Reach, in recognition of the company\u2019s success in responding to the challenging conditions that prevailed in the period assessed for these awards.",
    "Notably, this was the fifth occasion that CEAT Kelani Holdings was recognized by the NCCSL for Business Excellence.",
    "The latest awards recognize how, in a period of significant challenge for industry and business, where most companies focused on cutting costs and retaining market shares, CEAT Kelani Holdings took a remarkably different approach \u2013 one of increasing capacity, improving product quality and introducing new products, while investing in sustainability initiatives.",
    "Commenting, on this approach, CEAT Kelani Managing Director Ravi Dadlani elaborated that this was dictated by two factors, the opportunities created by the restrictions in the import of certain categories and sizes of tyres as part of the government\u2019s efforts to conserve foreign exchange, and the company\u2019s belief that it was its duty to step up and cater to the needs of the market, ensuring that economic activity and public transport were not affected by a shortage of tyres.",
