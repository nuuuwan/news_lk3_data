    "The Sahasak Nimavum Project is a prestigious platform that invites students and adults from across the island to showcase their inventive talents. The provincial-level selections, which commenced in July 2024, will continue through August 2024, providing a unique opportunity for budding inventors to gain recognition and support for their groundbreaking ideas.",
    "As a strategic partner, during the provincial programs, NDB will be conducting sessions at each event that aim to advocate for sound financial management by educating participants on how to effectively manage their finances to support their future ventures. Additionally, aligned with the Bank\u2019s commitment to empowering the youth, special focus will be given to NDB\u2019s youth-focused ZEE account, designed to foster financial literacy and savings habits among young individuals, reinforcing the Bank\u2019s dedication to nurturing the next generation of leaders and innovators.",
    "The selected inventors who advance to the national-level final competition will receive invaluable support from SLIC, including facilitation in obtaining patents for their inventions, ensuring that their intellectual property is protected, and positioning them for future success.",
    "SLIC, operating under the Education Ministry, is instrumental in facilitating and promoting local innovation. It plays a vital role in fostering an innovative culture among school students through various programs that offer knowledge sharing, capacity building, guidance from resource persons, and special benefits such as awareness of new technologies and financial, technical, legal, and marketing support for innovation.",
    "NDB\u2019s partnership with SLIC for the Sahasak Nimavum Project is a testament to our ongoing commitment to empowering the youth and supporting innovation in Sri Lanka. We believe that by investing in the creativity and ingenuity of our young inventors, we are helping to build a brighter, more prosperous future for the entire nation."
