  "original_body_lines": [
    "Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp resigned Friday evening, after he failed to secure new sanctions against Israel over the war in Gaza.",
    "Veldkamp had informed the country\u2019s parliament he intended to bring in new measures in response to Israel\u2019s planned offensive in Gaza City and other heavily populated areas but was unable to secure the support of his coalition partners.",
    "The 61-year-old former ambassador to Israel told reporters he felt he was unable \u201cto implement policy myself and chart the course I deem necessary.\u201d",
    "Following Veldkamp\u2019s resignation, the remaining Cabinet members of his center-right New Social Contract party also quit, leaving the Dutch government in disarray.",
    "\u201cIn short we are done with it,\u201d party leader Eddy Van Hijum said, calling the Israeli government\u2019s actions \u201cdiametrically opposed to international treaties.\u201d",
    "The Dutch government already collapsed in June when anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders pulled out of the country\u2019s four-party coalition over a fight about immigration.",
    "The three remaining parties stayed on in a caretaker government until elections could be held in October.",
    "The world\u2019s leading authority on food crises said earlier on Friday the Gaza Strip\u2019s largest city is gripped by famine, and that it\u2019s likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.",
    "The Netherlands\u2019 Parliament had repeatedly delayed a debate on sanctions against Israel, a discussion that was already postponed from Thursday, as the Friday afternoon Cabinet meeting dragged on.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a famine, ethnic cleansing, and genocide going on,\u201d Kati Piri of the merged Green Left/Labor parties told Parliament, \u201cAnd our cabinet has been deliberating for hours about whether to take any action at all. Shameful.\u201d",
    "Veldkamp had proposed a ban on imports from Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in response to the planned military escalation.",
    "Opposition politicians had called for a no-confidence vote for the minister, frustrated at what they saw as a lack of action against Israel."
