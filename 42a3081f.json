    "The company has clearly communicated with the investor community about the exceptional value proposition of this Issue, and has received a very positive response. Therefore, it is anticipated that the Issue will attract broad-based active interest, and result in a successful, oversubscribed issue. In terms of value, the Issue presents a compelling valuation discount based on P/E and EV/Hectare metrics. This combined with the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability and ethical practices will likely enable considerable growth in the coming years.\u201d",
    "Agarapatana Plantations Limited is mainly focused on the growing and production of Ceylon Tea, and maintains well-established Garden Marks at the Colombo Tea Auction, in the coveted Western-High and Uva-High elevation categories. The Company is also able to scale production further through access to green leaf from smallholders in the regions it operates. There is also significant potential for the Company to generate value through tourism, with it already having developed the Historical Site of Lipton\u2019s Seat, which presently accommodates many visitors. With a number of its plantations in close proximity to other tourist attractions and hotspots, including Haputale, the 9-Arches Bridge, Ella, Ravana Ella and Horton Plains, amongst others, the Company is well-positioned to take advantage of the emerging boom in tourism.",
