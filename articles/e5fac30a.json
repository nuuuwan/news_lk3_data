    "Appreciation is a means by which an individual articulates his or her sentiments towards another for a commendable quality inherent in that individual. The act of appreciating another often emerges as a spontaneous response to what one deems worthy of acknowledgment. Moments of appreciation wield a profound influence on the positive aging process. Individuals express their admiration for talents, expertise, achievements, philanthropy, and other virtues through various forms of praise, rewards, and the accommodation of differing perspectives, contingent upon specific circumstances.",
    "Ponder for a moment the myriad reasons for which we ought to express gratitude and appreciation for the intricate ecosystem\u2014the sun, the moon, the air we breathe, the water sources and the diverse flora and fauna that flourish in nature, all of which sustain our very existence. A person with an optimistic outlook on life cultivates qualities that serve as vital sustenance for a fulfilling existence.",
    "Helps one to lift his/her spirit. We are social animals and together live in this life. If we help each other as we age, we can experience joy rather than suffering. This is the power of us. Life can be wonderful in our senior years if we have a support network. Together we can make a difference. Nobody lives in isolation; life is a group outing.",
    "Social neuroscience researcher Matthew Lieberman and psychologist Pamela Rutledge are among those who argue that the heart of our needs is not food, shelter, and warmth, as with Maslow\u2019s model of needs but social bonds, social connections, and collaboration. Imagine Maslow\u2019s pyramid as a wheel instead, with connection at the centre of it stresses the importance of social connections above other needs. It is argued that Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs doesn\u2019t give enough credit to the role of social connection. The author argues that Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs while useful overlooks the importance of social connection.",
    "The most important thing for happiness and contentment of the elderly is for them to be able to feel like they are not alone \u2013 they don\u2019t want to feel like they are just a number \u2013 the need to feel like they belong. You can accomplish this by treating them like they are special and by telling them each time you see them how nice they look. Tell them that they are looking very healthy-sometimes that can make them feel better. Let the elders realize that aging itself is a pride. Changes in appearances such as wrinkles,eye spots, loss of hair etc.are badges of honour and symbolic of wisdom and maturity. Then talk to them about things that THEY want to talk about. NOT the things that I want to talk about. Let them know you care! It doesn\u2019t always matter who gives them caring attention. It\u2019s just important that they are getting the loving care and attention.",
    "David Alan Lereah author of Power of Positive Aging posits that our quality of life will be determined not by our stage of aging or by our physical or mental limitations but by our choice of aging \u201crooms\u201d. viz.",
    "Should be like your living room where life happens. You go to rest, watch TV. Positive aging means the right attitude about growing old. It is about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and staying engaged fully in life even as you experience physical and mental decline, so you don\u2019t lose a sense of control over your own life. People in the positive aging room has the right attitude about growing old. They realize that aging can be a magnificent reality if you appreciate every moment of life. People with a positive mindset become more spiritual.",
    "Very much like your own kitchen. You spend your time there because you need to keep yourself fed, but it\u2019s not where you want to get trapped all day. There will be in your aging journey that require visits to the Positive Ageing Room, but you don\u2019t want to get stuck there and never make to the positive aging room.",
    "Most of us in varying degrees take a practical approach towards aging. We have not fully committed to embracing positivity but are hopeful that we will grow old gracefully.",
    "Those in the God\u2019s waiting room do not embrace the power of positive aging nor do they grow too old gracefully. They simply wait and wait for their name to be called waiting to leave this life. They show little energy or interest in the world around them. Unusually indifferent to about their life.",
    "A 2019 study on positive thinking (a key element of positive aging), states that positive thinking can result in a 11-15% a longer life span and a stronger likelihood of living to age 85 or older. The effect remained after other factors such as age, gender, income, depression, and health status were controlled. Practice of positive aging is destined to enhance quality of life for everyone facing the marks of aging- whether it is a life-threatening disease like cancer or a disease that lowers quality of life like arthritis and diabetes or a mark of mental decline like dementia or a mark of physical decline like morbidity or hearing loss. Notably enhanced physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Senior citizens with positive self-perception of aging lives 7.5 years longer than those with negative self-perception of aging.",
    "Less stressed out and reducing their likelihood of developing chronic disorders",
    "(More important of all, they will experience greater happiness and joy)",
    "Ageing is a lifelong journey characterized by both physical and cognitive decline. The inevitabilities of ailments, discomfort, and anxiety represent some of the formidable challenges encountered during one\u2019s later years. However, with a mindset imbued with resilience and fortitude, individuals can surmount these unforeseen adversities, enabling them to navigate the aging process with grace and success.",
    "Positive aging requires fulfillment of a healthy living- physical, social, and spiritual well-being. Positive aging is also nurtured by acceptance of the inevitability, adapting to both good and bad events, appreciating universal beauty with the right attitude. Power of positive aging is limitless. Positive aging and healthy aging are related but are distinct concepts.",
    "Aging commences not in the twilight years, but rather in one\u2019s twenties. Our faculties reach their zenith around the age of thirty, yet the ramifications of aging on our existence are not fully apprehended until we attain our fifties. It is only as we advance in years that the notions of mortality and finality begin to infiltrate our consciousness. Seven fundamental components are identified as vital underpinnings for successful and affirmative aging. David Alan Lereach posits three critical dimensions of aging that dictate our quality of life, independent of our chronological stage of aging.",
    "Most importantly, a robust social network that connects the elderly with their family and friends should be the focal point that facilitates their engagement in a positive aging process. The social network theory articulated by Pamela B Rutledge aptly underscores the significance of social connections in fostering positive aging.",
    "Older individuals require a sense of relevance, respect, and utility to lead lives imbued with meaning and dignity. Dignity is defined as \u201cacknowledging the intrinsic worth of each person and engaging with one another on a personal level.\u201d Embracing positive aging significantly enhances one\u2019s happiness, allowing for a richer and more fulfilling existence in one\u2019s senior years. From a spiritual standpoint, this phase represents the commencement of a new journey\u2014one that is both invigorating and deeply satisfying.",
