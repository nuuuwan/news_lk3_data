    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organizer Namal Rajapaksa has accused law enforcement authorities of politicizing the investigation into the 2012 murder of national rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, following fresh revelations by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) linking the case to a recent underworld killing.Speaking at a media briefing in Nawala, Rajapaksa alleged that the CID was \u201cfabricating false evidence to please the government\u201d and criticized the decision to disclose sensitive case details to the media rather than the judiciary.\u201cWhen sensitive case details are disclosed at press briefings, it clearly shows a desire to build a political narrative. If someone claims to identify her husband just because of a posture in unclear CCTV footage, is that credible? Where has she been living? Who has she been associating with? These are the questions investigators should ask,\u201d Rajapaksa said, urging an impartial and transparent investigation.New Twist in a 13-Year-Old Mystery:The controversy erupted after Acting Police Spokesperson ASP Minura Senaratne revealed that new evidence had surfaced during the probe into the February 19 murder of Aruna Priyantha Widanagamage, alias Meegasare\u2019 Kajja.\u00a0The prime suspect in that case, Nirmal Prasanga, also known as Backhoe Saman, was arrested in Indonesia along with Kehelbaddara Padme and is currently being interrogated.According to police, Meegasare\u2019 Kajja\u2019s widow recently provided a statement to the CID, regarding the CCTV footage from the night of Thajudeen\u2019s death showing another vehicle following his car.\u00a0At one point, a man is seen entering that vehicle\u2014a detail now considered crucial to the ongoing probe.ASP Senaratne explained that Thajudeen, who was driving a Toyota Vitz, was captured on CCTV parking near a supermarket in Havelock Town to buy water.\u00a0Upon leaving, another vehicle was seen tailing him.\u00a0Investigators released an image of an individual near that second vehicle years ago, but no identification was made at the time.\u00a0Meegasare\u2019 Kajja\u2019s widow has now identified the person as her husband, citing his distinctive habit of placing his hands on his hips due to chronic hip pain.SLPP's Namal Rajapaksa dismissed the credibility of this identification.\u00a0His remarks were echoed by a Facebook post from Meegasare\u2019 Kajja\u2019s son, who questioned why the police had not shown the footage to his father\u2019s siblings for confirmation.\u00a0He also alleged that his mother had left the family for another man and suggested that her testimony might be influenced by personal motives.The post further claimed that Aruna Priyantha was employed along Route 176 in Nugegoda in 2012 and raised suspicions that his murder\u2014and that of his two children\u2014could be linked to his estranged wife and her alleged lover, Sampath Ramanayake, reportedly an associate of Backhoe Saman.Criminal Network Uncovered:Adding to the intrigue, police revealed that Sampath Manampperi, a former SLPP Pradeshiya Sabha candidate currently in custody, has admitted to supplying the firearm used in Meegasare\u2019 Kajja\u2019s murder.Manampperi is being held under a detention order for alleged involvement in a drug trafficking network operated by Backhoe Saman, Panadura Nilanga, and Kehelbaddara Padme.Investigators believe these revelations point to a wider criminal syndicate with deep political and underworld connections.Flashback: The Thajudeen Case TimelineMay 17, 2012 \u2013 Wasim Thajudeen\u2019s burnt body found in a car near Shalika Grounds, Narahenpita.
