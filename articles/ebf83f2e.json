    "Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam has urged the Government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to clarify its position on the future of the Provincial Council system.",
    "Citing recent remarks to the media by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin Silva, who has suggested the system might be abolished, Rasamanickam called for an official response on the matter. The MP raised the question prior to yesterday\u2019s Parliamentary debate on the President\u2019s policy statement, emphasising that the issue is of national significance and has sparked widespread public concern.",
    "Leader of the House Bimal Rathnayake responded by reaffirming the Government\u2019s respect for Rasamanickam but noted that the matter was not directly relevant to the day\u2019s Parliamentary agenda. \u201cDo not be spoiled by those around you,\u201d Rathnayake said.",
    "He assured the ITAK MP that the Government would provide clarity in due course and revealed that ITAK leader Sivagnanam Shritharan had already requested a meeting with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cThis meeting will be arranged within the week, giving MP Rasamanickam an opportunity to directly present his concerns to President Dissanayake,\u201d Rathnayake said."
