Israel said it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and was assessing the damage on Friday after a series of strikes on senior figures in the group that Iran’s Supreme Leader dismissed as counterproductive.

Israel has been weighing options in its response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israel’s military action in Lebanon.

Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an attack on Iran’s oil facilities as Israel pursues its goals of pushing back Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and eliminating their Hamas allies in Gaza.

Hashem Safieddine’s fate was unclear and neither Israel nor Hezbollah have offered any comment.

Instead of dwelling on the past, they should focus on presenting their manifestos for the upcoming election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

I am appalled to see how all the old political parties are scrambling to form alliances against the NPP for the upcoming general election. These are the same corrupt figures who took a different stance during the Presidential election, and now they’re back to their old tricks. Meanwhile, the NPP is showing wisdom by steering clear of these alliances, positioning themselves to secure over 113 seats in Parliament.

It’s time for the other party leaders to walk the talk and stop playing blame games. Instead of dwelling on the past, they should focus on presenting their manifestos for the upcoming election and offer real solutions to the public. It’s clear that the people are well-informed and no longer fooled by these antics.
