  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Under the orthodoxy now promoted by inflationist macro-economists that drive countries wholesale into currency crises through ad hoc exchange rate policy, Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank is an independent holy cow only answerable to the International Monetary Fund.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s presidents, prime ministers and ruling party legislators, who are unceremoniously kicked out by the electorate when the currency depreciates and energy and food prices go up, as rates are suppressed with inflationary open market operations, have no say in the operation of this agency.",
    "Any other SOE, including energy utilities those that suffer due to depreciation caused by flexible policy central banks and run losses are open to criticism by the line minister, but not the central bank which creates five percent inflation and make the country a living hell for the less fortunate and drives millions to seek jobs in currency board style regimes in the Middle East.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has already persuaded the political leadership to allow it to generate 5 to 7 percent inflation through a law promoted by itself to enable it to do so.",
    "The actions of the central bank usually ousts the government in power during the inflation crisis it creates, but also the one that takes corrective measures in what classical economists call a \u2018stabilization crisis\u2019 like Sri Lanka is caught in now.",
    "During this stabilization period the IMF can interfere with the central bank\u2019s monetary policy, even though the Finance Minister cannot ask it not to cut rates and stop the next currency collapse under \u2018central bank independence\u2019.",
    "Make no mistake, the recent advice given by the IMF not to cut rates precipitately is not bad, but it is utterly ridiculous that elected representatives cannot question inflationist bureaucrats of a third or other world central bank due to its \u2018independence\u2019, but the IMF, a supranational agency not only does but is expected to do so.",
    "\u201cGoing forward, the monetary policy stance needs to be carefully calibrated to strike the right balance between maintaining a credible inflation path close to the target and supporting economic stabilization, in line with the MPCC clause and a real policy rate path close to neutral.",
    "\u201cRoom for further loosening in the near-term is limited given potential upside inflationary pressures from (i) second-round effects from new tax measures (\u00b611), (ii) downward pressure on the exchange rate from relaxing import restrictions and banks closing their NOPs arising from the restructuring of CPC-related debts, and (iii) risks of capital outflows from lower interest rates.",
    "\u201cExcessive loosening may make it difficult to control inflation later and even require a policy reversal which would hurt CBSL\u2019s credibility.\u201d",
    "Other than the fact that rate hikes (that track credit demand) hurt the credibility of a central bank, which is absolutely false, the rest of the commentary is correct. The rate corridor which moved was how balance of payments crises were avoided before 1920.",
    "The IMF has also put a domestic asset ceiling on the central bank to limit money printing for the duration of its program. That is also good, even though it limits the agency\u2019s \u2018instrument independence\u2019.",
    "But the country\u2019s parliament should be doing that permanently as classical liberals did in the celebrated case of the Bank of England through the Bank Charter Act (for gold) and stable countries like Singapore does with a 100 percent reserve backing. A foreign assets floor is the inverse of a domestic assets ceiling of essentially zero.",
    "Without a domestic asset ceiling, the central bank had been free to print money leading to currency collapses and lost reserve targets within the IMF programs in 2012 and also 2016 and 2018 under its 5 percent inflation target.",
    "Under the monetary policy consultation clause (MPCC) the central bank macroeconomists are answerable to IMF macroeconomists.",
    "The IMF also has to be consulted ahead of monetary policy meetings.",
    "\u201cA policy consultation will be held with the IMF staff ahead of each Monetary Policy Board meeting,\u201d according to the last report.",
    "Of course, central bankers who are confident of domestic developments may override the IMF recommendation. But there is no transparency. Neither is there transparency in terms of the minutes of monetary policy meetings.",
    "What takes the cake is not that, but that the central bank has to explain itself to the IMF if inflation is lower than the band set in the IMF programs.",
    "\u201cThe authorities discussed with staff the breach of the Monetary Policy Consultation Clause\u2019s (MPCC) inner band,\u201d according to the last report after inflation was below target.",
    "It is laughable that the central bank has to explain itself to the IMF if the inflation is below the target set in the program, and suffering of the people is less, energy and food prices are below target and social unrest is reduced.",
    "There is nothing in the new monetary law to say that the agency has to explain itself to the IMF.",
    "In the original Monetary Law [Sections 68 (c), 72 3(a) and (b) among others], the central bank was answerable to the IMF not to depreciate the currency which was a primary goal (maintaining the external value of the currency) of the Bretton Woods system.",
    "The currency of a country which is a member of the International Monetary Fund shall have",
    "its parity with respect to the rupee established on the basis of its par value as agreed with the Fund in every case where the country is permitting exchange transactions between its currency and the currencies of other members only within the maximum and the minimum rates prescribed in the International Monetary Fund Agreement for such transactions.",
    "There were also other clauses including 110 which made the agency the fiscal agent of the IMF.",
    "But and forex shortages and import controls soon started with the central bank act which allowed liquidity injections and central bank re-finance of private credit.",
    "How did an SOE, which has a money monopoly, has extraordinary powers to control and undermine economic freedoms of the people wholesale through exchange controls and restrictions on banks, promote trade controls, and can destroy money in an instant through depreciation and surrender rules, become answerable only to the IMF?",
    "Especially after the IMF Second Amendment in 1978 central banks have acquired a legal immunity for the consequence of the inflation and depreciation (and the political upheavals and poverty they create) in direct contravention to what the public expects them to, which is extraordinary considering that even Presidents have no immunity.",
    "This impunity has been earned in part by a fiction spread by academics (aided by and abetted by the media) that these depreciating central banks (and others which target employment or growth) are inflation fighting rather than creating inflation.",
    "This stems in part from events in 1931 after the Pound was floated in desperation (by the Deputy Governor as the Governor himself was disembarking in Britain from a trip to the US to borrow more money like Sri Lanka did with India) and inflationists led Keynes himself publicly spoke in favour of the debasement of currency and the promotion of unsound money.",
    "All this worsened after 1971 when the dollar was floated after the 1960s money printing.",
    "Central banks were not independent before the age of inflation which began from around the 1920s and worsened from 1931 with the collapse or float of the Sterling which set off dramatic devaluations and import restrictions in many industrial countries.",
    "The Bretton Woods saw a brief respite but the 1960s post-Keynesian macroeconomic policy led to its collapse triggering the Great Inflation.",
    "Many industrial countries got stability back in the 1980s, but unanchored policy hit Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe and most of Asia (except East Asian credible pegs and Japan) and the Middle East (except GCC) after the IMF\u2019s Second Amendment in 1978 left them without a credible anchor.",
    "Modern central banks are state monopolies with extraordinary powers to rob economic freedoms of the public through exchange controls, trade controls and restrictions on banks.",
    "But in the beginning, they were not unaccountable SOEs, which can depreciate currency with no fear of punishment, but private entities that faced the full wrath of the legislature when convertibility was denied (pegs were broken) or inflation was created.",
    "It is in the age of inflation that they started to escape the law, create monetary instability and create forex shortages and transfer the blame to politicians and the general public who engaged in free trade.",
    "The Bank of England was not independent before it started creating forex shortages, and imposed exchange controls on the people of a country that once stood at the helm of a great Empire.",
    "Before money was mis-used for macroeconomics, politicians limited the powers of central bankers to debase currency",
    "Under the classical specie standard when there was no bureaucratic policy rate, free banks were forced to limit their money printing automatically. Gold standard (or Silver standard to a lesser extent) were automatically forced to keep inflation down as long as the peg was maintained.",
    "In the UK note-issuing banks were expressly prohibited from stimulating the economy and creating collapses like in Sri Lanka or the Housing bubble through devices like the Bank Charter Act.",
    "The Bank of England for example could not break the peg without parliamentary authority (a requirement for Bank Restrictions Act). The laws of all central banks (including in Sri Lanka) had similar provisions, though they were disregarded with no actual legislative change after the IMF\u2019s Second Amendment when depreciation became routine and double-digit inflation and interest rates commonplace.",
    "Unlike now, where the central bank is insulated from criticism, British classical economists got elected to parliament in part to control central bankers.",
    "From 1978, even after the IMF\u2019s second amendment led to chronic double digit inflation and defaults in Latin America Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank dropped the par value but it still retained the responsibility of maintaining a state exchange rate viz \u201cif there has been no determination of the par value of the Sri Lanka rupee, the preservation of the stability of the exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee in relation to foreign currencies.\u201d",
    "However, these primary goals were consistently violated as the latest inflationist teachings from Western universities spread like cancer especially into a set of former colonies which were beginning to be called the \u2018third world\u2019.",
    "It was only after A S Jayewardene became that the requirement to maintain the external value of the rupee was legally dropped as part of efforts to move to inflation targeting.",
    "If anyone goes through the changes made in the Monetary Law Act especially in the 1960s where macro-economists gave themselves powers to give 15 year credits, one can weep for this country.",
    "The present-day obsession with central bank independence dates back to the Fed Treasury Accord of 1951 where then Treasury Secretary John Snyder pressured the Federal Reserve to buy 30 year war bonds to keep its secondary market value up.",
    "It was resisted by Governor Marriner Eccles, a banker who was appointed Fed Chairman by President Franklin Roosevelt during the Depression.",
    "Eccles, who was not macro-economist but a banker, had proposed Keynesian type remedies (independent of Keynes) when credit collapsed under the depression as he had a knowledge of banking.",
    "As private credit recovered after in 1950 and budgets actually turned into surplus as the Korean War petered-off, inflation re-emerged.",
    "Eccles rearguard action backed by the Fed Chair Wade McCade led to the Treasury Fed Accord with Deputy Secretary William McChesney Martin who was also not a macro-economist.",
    "He was soon made the Fed Chair by the then President and kept the US dollar strong \u00a0for about a decade and Bretton Woods escaped a collapse by the skin of its teeth.",
    "One can argue that it may be acceptable to give independence to Eccles and McCade who did not believe that money printing leads to any benefit when credit is positive, but laws should not be made and discretion should not be give for personalities.",
    "Even under Martin himself inflation started to take off in the 1960s as Saltwater macro-economists in particular started to tout the benefits of a so-called trade off between inflation and employment, using statistics and triggering credit cycles.",
    "Central bank swaps were invented, and within a decade the Bretton Woods was in tatters, the world was in Great Inflation, oil shocks and rising food prices. After the IMF Second Amendment, peacetime default started and hyperinflation was also seen.",
    "Countries that stopped short of full hyperinflation also became ungovernable.",
    "A key problem with inflationist macroeconomists is that they are strong in statistics and mathematics and weak in law, both laws of nature and legislated law.",
    "Classical economists, who painstakingly worked out note-issue banking and monetary effects and the balance of payments, knew law and the value of individual freedom. The philosophy that some of them developed led to written law and Constitutions themselves.",
    "Many of them could write law themselves. Classical economists, from Ricardo to Torrens, got themselves elected to parliament to do liberal reforms or to restrain the central bank, were also legislators who passed liberal laws.",
    "Others abolished slavery. Most classicals who talked about free trade, knew money and note-issue banking and its ills.",
    "Some of the constitutional principles of government restraint that are taken for granted now were developed by them.",
    "But modern macroeconomists break the laws or promote laws to give them ultimate discretion not restraint.",
    "They have no compassion for the poor, no understanding of the role that sound money plays in freedom and the liberal democracy. \u00a0That is why countries which are subject to depreciation, become ungovernable.",
    "That is why they create 5 percent inflation without any care for the consequences and depreciates currencies against other currencies and food commodities shockingly heatless to attain the mirage of export growth.",
    "Third world central bankers and proponents of the Washington Consensus also appear to have no knowledge of monetary anchoring and poor grasp of note issue banking.",
    "Williamson himself is the inflationist that is credited with promoting the permanently inflating crawling peg that doomed many countries including Sri Lanka in the 1980s.",
    "They have almost no knowledge of monetary anchoring, which was not the case of classicals. Even the Banking School people knew anchoring it was the anti-bullionists and green backers who did not.",
    "Almost to a man modern macro-economists seem to have little knowledge of banking or the balance of payments. But they have extensive knowledge of statistical modelling.",
    "The high priest of statistical models which promote bureaucratic state interventionism was not just Mussolini\u2019s statistician Corrado Gini but people like Paul Samuelson.",
    "John Exter who built Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank said in a 1991 interview Keynesian was \u201cpumped into me in those early years and actually taught it in the entry level economics course at Harvard. As the years wore on I became more and more sceptical,\u201d he said.",
    "The background notes of the central bank\u2019s monetary law he wrote had many caveats. All of those caveats were ignored especially from the 1960 and Sri Lanka plunged headlong into IMF programs.",
    "Exter said he studied with Samuelson and originally helped him get a job at MIT.",
    "In 1962 after Exter left the Fed and was working at Citibank he had to make a speech in Boston and recalled a conversation with Samuelson.",
    "\u201cWe immediately got into a terrific argument about why the dollar was weak and why we were losing gold. I had worked 10 years with the Federal Reserve system by that time, so I said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple: the Fed is printing too many dollars and they flow out of the country into foreign central banks who demand gold,\u201d Exter recalled.",
    "\u201cWhen Samuelson denied all this I asked him, \u201cPaul, what do you think is the reason the dollar is weak?\u201d He replied that the increase in productivity in Europe and Japan was more rapid than in the US. Luckily Japan was in trouble at that time, so I said, \u201cWhy do you think Japan is worse off than we are?\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s because the Bank of Japan is running its printing presses even faster than the rest of the central banks around the world are running theirs, even our Fed\u2019s.",
    "When he tried to argue against that I said, Paul, I know about this because the Bank of Japan has just been to Citibank for a loan. We sat around the table and talked about the reasons for it and required the Bank of Japan to tighten money. He was non-plussed. \u201cWell, John,\u201d he said, \u201cyou could be right\u2014but you\u2019re lonely.\u201d [laughing]",
    "The problem is people like Samuelson write the textbooks that students study. Like Alvin Hansen this is a recipe for disaster.",
    "The monetary policy consultation clause is a joke. It replaced earlier domestic assets and reserve money target frameworks.",
    "\u201cMany Fund-supported programs assess the monetary policy stance through central bank balance sheet targets (net domestic assets or reserve money). An assessment of programs in developing countries with scope for independent monetary policy shows generally good adherence to net domestic asset ceilings but weak adherence to reserve money targets.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo statistical correlation is observed between reserve money target deviations and inflation deviations in a low inflation context, raising the question of whether reserve money targets are reliable indicators of the monetary policy stance given financial innovation and shocks to money demand.\u201d",
    "\u201cA review-based conditionality to assess monetary policy is proposed as an option to replace a performance criterion on net domestic assets or reserve money, for countries with evolving monetary policy frameworks that have a good track record of monetary policy implementation supported by central bank technical and institutional development, or are committed to a substantial strengthening of the policy framework.\u201d",
    "In the 1980s when floating rates central banks started money supply targeting, countries like Sri Lanka were encouraged to do statistical forecasts of various monetary supply targets, despite collecting reserves.",
    "They fell flat on their face and went to the IMF often seeking bailouts from various facilities with shocking depreciation and social unrest. Up to 1994, Sri Lanka could not go two years without an IMF program.",
    "The same thing happened to countries that tried later tried to target inflation without a clean float when inflation targeting was adopted by clean floating regimes from the 1990s.",
    "With one floating rate fad replaced by the next one, they also became IMF customers.",
    "\u201cSeveral other countries with Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT)- or General Resources Account (GRA)-supported programs have adopted some form of an inflation targeting (IT) regime, where the inflation forecast is the intermediate target and a short term policy interest rate typically serves as the operational target/policy instrument, although some of those countries have not committed to an explicit inflation target.\u201d",
    "\u201cLooking ahead, many other developing countries that seek support under Fund facilities intend to modernize the conduct of monetary policy by using a more flexible framework.",
    "\u201cThe review-based approach to monetary conditionality rests upon enhanced central bank capacity to analyze monetary conditions. The Fund\u2019s training and technical assistance provision in this area is already substantial, reflecting existing efforts to meet a strong demand from members.\u201d",
    "Parliaments have no knowledge as a few inflationist macro-economists and the IMF decide the fate of millions living in a flexible inflation targeting country and the next generation and force them migrate to 2 percent inflation targeting countries or currency board like countries without an obstinate policy rate that import labour due to their stability.",
    "Domestic assets targets definitely work if the currency is not depreciated. That is how East Asia prospered.",
    "In fact most successful East Asian countries and negative domestic assets in central bank balance sheets and excessive foreign reserves.",
    "But the anchor was not domestic assets, but the exchange rate. Negative domestic assets were used to avoid a policy rate and run a tighter regime than the anchor currency. Others ran actual or de facto currency boards.",
    "The East Asian crisis in the 1990s as well as Sri Lanka\u2019s post war crises and default was due to aggressively targeting policy rates and acquiring domestic assets to do so, in complete contrast to what East Asia did in their high growth period up to then.",
    "Neither reserve money nor a 5 percent inflation target that is credible. Both lead to currency crises through the acquisition of domestic assets to target the call money rate and generate inflation.",
    "Classical economists knew this and described these phenomena in detail, managed to prevent the age of inflation starting till 1920.",
    "In fact, Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming have described this in detail (IS-LM-BOP). Mundell went so far as to explain that capital flows were an irrelevant distraction.",
    "That these ideas were considered new in the 1960s is due to a lack of knowledge of monetary history.",
    "Classical economists from Hume, Smith, Ricardo to Thornton, had worked these out in detail (without distraction of exchange controls since at the time the private central banks had no authority to impose exchange controls, only deny convertibility) as a purely intellectual exercise without complicated statistical formulae.",
    "Mundell himself was reportedly amused when The Economist portrayed him as a \u201cgreat eccentric,\u201d and used to insist that his work was based on the work of classicals like Adam Smith downwards and including the IMF backed Bretton Woods.",
    "The Need is a Constitutional Restraint, Not Discretion and Independence",
    "No country needs an \u2018independent\u2019 central bank in the style of one that breaks the Bretton Woods, creates Great Inflation, oil shocks, the Housing bubble and external sovereign defaults.",
    "Sri Lanka does not need a central bank to support government policy with its liquidity tools either.",
    "Sri Lanka or any other country needs a central bank that has a strong stability mandate with a credible anchor that allows people born in this country to live and work and not create 5 percent inflation year after year and drive people to currency board-like countries in the Middle East.",
    "Why independent central banks fail and fire bubbles is because there are more Saltwater \u2013 Cambridge style universities which turf out interventionist inflationists from where staff is hired than a handful of universities that generate graduates with a doctrine of sound money.",
    "Sound money is now taught in very few universities. Even if senior officials learned the hard way through one or two currency crises on the job, how to provide stability, the knowledge disappears in about 10 years as they retire.",
    "This was seen graphically in the Fed which started to create external instability 10 years after the Fed Treasury Accord inventing reciprocal swaps in the process.",
    "If there is a strong constitution of restraint with a credible anchor the statistical operational framework of flexible inflation targeting (real interest rates) and real effective exchange rate cannot trip up countries.",
    "What Sri Lanka needs is a true central bank constitution that will be able to restrain flexible macro-economic policy by a few individuals (whether they in the central bank or are seconded to Treasury or elsewhere in government matters little) and thinking legislators who can push through a piece of legislation.",
    "It is not that difficult. Go to any country that does NOT go to the IMF frequently and has never gone to the IMF and you have the model and the operational framework.",
    "But the tragedy of Sri Lanka and other foreign reserve targeting countries with boat people and outmigration and social unrest is that it is the IMF itself that countries go for monetary advice.",
    "There may be a semblance of stability under a domestic asset ceiling, but the technical assistance and the statistical model peddled by the IMF complete with an \u2018independent\u2019 holy monetary cow with a 5-7 inflation target will ensure the next collapse.",
    "In Germany, nationalists are now making a comeback, just like the Nazis did after the Heinrich Bruning administration\u2019s stabilization after the roaring 20s bubble.",
    "Germany was a victim of both the ECB quantitative easing which drove inflation up, and also green energy and the anti-nuclear policies which has pushed up energy costs for industry.",
    "The Powell bubble has hit the USA and Kamala Harris is proposing price controls.",
    "In Sri Lanka the central bank over the past two years has appreciated the currency, giving tangible benefits to the people and providing credibility to President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s policies.",
    "5 percent inflation target is very much worse than VAT on food",
    "The benefit came from missing the 5 percent inflation target. But the central bank is promising to reach that target in a few months.",
    "A 5 percent annual inflation is like an additional 5 percent value added tax each year on top of the current 18 percent. Over two years it is like a 10.25 percent additional VAT. That is as if VAT was raised to 28.25 percent. Over three years it is like 15.76 percent VAT.",
    "But there is usually no fourth year. Past experience under flexible inflation targeting has shown that balance of payments trouble and forex shortages starts in the first year of credit recovery under a 5 percent inflation target.",
    "Private credit begin to grow 18 to 23 months after the stabilization crisis. Credit recovery after the 2012 float and stabilization crises started in late 2014 and forex shortages came from 2015.",
    "Afte the 2016/17 float and stabilization crisis, credit recovery and currency troubles started in 2018 itself.",
    "After the 2019 stabilization crisis, currency troubles started in late 2019 as private credit recovered fast. In the 2020 first quarter as the flexible exchange rate collapsed, downgrades came through the currency stabilized in May as lockdowns killed credit.",
    "Now private credit is recovering. If rates are cut against credit demand, the next government will see the currency slide as monetary policy errors are compensated by depreciation as has happened since 1978.",
    "Stable money, stable countries, political stability, is not about giving independence to a set of bureaucrats at a state agency. It is about legal restraint and a credible anchor for its operating framework for the agency regardless of whether it is state or private.",
    "That restraint is needed because the parliament itself gave it a money monopoly and denied the citizenry better more stable alternatives through a legal tender law.",
    "The other option is currency competition. Colombo Port City has already done that.",
    "The foregoing is not a reflection of the current central bank Governor\u2019s actions since the ending the use of ACU money. Allowing the rupee to appreciate to 300 from 360 in particular was and keeping it stable was an exceptional pro-stability pro-poor move.",
    "But countries cannot depend on personalities. The US was stable under Volcker and Greenspan. As soon as Bernanke influenced Greenspan to keep rates exceptionally low, the US went into a housing bubble and the Great Moderation ended. (Deflation: Making Sure \u201cIt\u201d Doesn\u2019t Happen Here : Remarks before the National Economists Club, Washington, D.C.)",
    "The industrial revolution was done with fixed exchange rates under self correcting central banks without a policy rate under a single (specie) anchor. The East Asian export boom also came with a single external anchor or with weak domestic anchors which were made subservient that prevented repeated stabilization crises like the one Sri Lanka is again undergoing now.",
    "Vietnam is the latest country to do that, for periods exceeding 15 years, though with less success than some others.",
    "\u201cThe principle of sound money that guided nineteenth-century monetary doctrines and policies was a product of classical political economy,\u201d explains Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises.",
    "\u201cIt was an essential part of the liberal program as developed by eighteenth-century social philosophy and propagated in the following century by the most influential political parties of Europe and America\u2026",
    "\u201cIt is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments.",
    "\u201cIdeologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights.",
    "\u201cThe postulate of sound money was first brought up as a response to the princely practice of debasing the coinage.",
    "\u201cIt was later carefully elaborated and perfected in the age which\u2014through the experience of the American continental currency, the paper money of the French Revolution and the British restriction period\u2014had learned what a government can do to a nation\u2019s currency system\u2026 Thus the sound-money principle has two aspects.",
    "\u201cIt is affirmative in approving the market\u2019s choice of a commonly used medium of exchange. It is negative in obstructing the government\u2019s propensity to meddle with the currency system.\u201d",
    "By destroying currencies after the IMF\u2019s Second Amendment, based on flawed or conflicting anchors it is now a government agency itself that is meddling with the currency systems, using its independence, under \u2018flexible\u2019 or discretionary policies.",
    "Sound money was constitutionally assured in the US after independence. The credible anchor was set by constitution. It was undermined by the Fed in the 1920 and finally broken by a simple majority law (Gold Reserve Act) by Harvard economists in 1934. \u00a0(Colombo/Aug11/2024)"
