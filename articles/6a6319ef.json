    "\u201cAfter Assad: Is Syria the New Libya in the Mediterranean?\u201d is a sharp and unflinching analysis of Syria\u2019s descent into chaos. Journalist Nilantha Ilangamuwa examines the aftermath of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s fall, highlighting the complex web of foreign interventions, regional ambitions, and internal fractures that have ravaged the country.",
    "The author reflects on his personal experiences with Syrian journalists, politicians, and activists, noting the stark contrast between the prosperous cities and the war-torn regions of the Middle East. He writes, \u201cIf you travel at night from Tehran to Doha, one side sparkles with lights, the other is cloaked in darkness, a symbol of neglect and conflict.\u201d",
    "The book draws chilling parallels between post-Assad Syria and Libya after Gaddafi\u2019s collapse, pointing to looting, territorial gains, and military interventions as signs of Syria\u2019s uncertain future. The author critiques foreign powers, including Turkey\u2019s ambitions to undermine Kurdish autonomy and Israel\u2019s actions in the Golan Heights, framing Syria as the epicentre of competing geopolitical interests.",
    "The book also examines internal struggles that exacerbate Syria\u2019s plight. The rise of extremist factions like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the fracturing of opposition forces, and the manipulation of local conflicts by external actors are portrayed as symptoms of a deeper malaise. \u201cWhat began as a cry for dignity and justice has now devolved into a battleground for dominance,\u201d the author observes, driving home the tragic irony of Syria\u2019s uprising. The 114-page book is available on Amazon (https://a.co/d/0CJlhDx). After Assad is an indispensable resource for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of post-Assad Syria. It is a masterfully written, deeply thought-provoking work that demands to be read and reckoned with.",
