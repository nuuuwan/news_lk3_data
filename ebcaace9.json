    "The Minister elaborated during the weekly briefing to announce cabinet decisions on Tuesday (8).",
    "It was reported that a message was circulated by the President's Media Division via WhatsApp on Monday (7) citing that there were attempts to recreate a people's struggle citing the drought and frustrations of the farmers.",
    "Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that the President informed the Cabinet of Ministers that the National Intelligence Service received a report that certain groups involved in the Aragalaya, and opposition were planning to reignite the events that took place on the 9th of May 2022, citing the drought, as well as the electricity and water crisis.",
    "\"There was an attempt to surround the private vehicle of Agricuture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. Special security was provided to the residence of Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, as there was a plan to attack it,\" he said.",
    "According to the Minister, the President also informed the Cabinet of Ministers that two media institutions launched a media campaign to organize all these involved groups, bring them to Colombo to organize another string of protests starting from the farmers protest, and create a situation where shots will be fired, and several deaths will be reported.",
    "\"It was an attempt to destabilize the country,\" Gunawardena told the reporters.",
    "\"If media institutions are attempting to incite the people and force them to the streets by citing natural events like the drought, that are beyond the control of the government, then as the Minister of Media, I am disappointed. I appeal to the media colleagues to look at this logically,\" the Minister said.",

    "\"There is no issue when the media balances this analytically. If issues can be solved by reigniting the May 9th events by spreading violence to set fire to the residences of ministers, then the country should be able to function when all the residences of ministers are set alight, right? That won't happen,\" he said during the \u00a0weekly briefing to announce cabinet decisions on Tuesday (8).",
