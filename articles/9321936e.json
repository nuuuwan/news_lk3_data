    "Defeat Israel and the US remaking the Levant WITHOUT Palestine!",
    "1. After the famous Non-Aligned Movement faded away the rise of the BRICS brought much hope and pride to the people of the South. The fact that many countries want to join it, even some from the western block, reveals to the world the real aspirations of the vast majority in the world.",
    "2. Palestine is a member of the 121 countries that belong to NAM. During the Cold War NAM got organized for the purpose of being independent of the global super powers of that era and to promote South-South cooperation.",
    "3. BRICS or Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa constitute the five biggest and most advanced countries of the south; though Russia is not in the South it can easily be part of it due to many similarities and reasons. Three of these countries have nuclear warheads.",
    "4. We are proud of South Africa for brilliantly prosecuting Israel, at the Hague courts, over the genocide and illegal aggression and occupation of Palestine.",
    "5. We are proud of India for standing up to the simple US president hurling tariffs and sanctions against other countries like a cantankerous brat.",
    "6. We are proud of China for its dramatic advancement and lifting millions out of poverty and its capacity to face any power in the world.",
    "7. We are proud of Brazil not only for an array of superb footballers from Pele to Neymar but mainly for becoming a power to reckon with in the American hemisphere.",
    "8. Finally, we are proud of Russia not only for its immortal contributions to the literature of the world but also for being the elder brother to the BRICS and its associates.",
    "9. United Nations have voted definitively for a two-state solution to the Gaza and Palestine tragedy. Israel and its tail the US with a few small countries have voted against it and Israel the Neanderthals says there is no country called Palestine! I wonder what that land was called before 1948?",
    "10. Internationally the pressure on Israel to stop the genocide and dismantle the illegal occupation and allow Palestine to self-determinate their future is increasing. But still, they are mostly statements and declarations and no action. They do not walk the talk.",
    "11. This is what we are pleading for with you. Show your true solidarity with the oppressed of the world. If we in the South do not stand by them, who will? Let us learn from the small and sovereign nation, Maldives. In 2024, a bill was submitted to the parliament calling for a ban on entry for Israeli passport holders. The ban came into immediate effect after it was approved by parliament on 15 April 2025",
    "12. Cut all ties with Israel. Recall your ambassadors from Tel Aviv. Cancel all commercial agreements and investments. Prohibit them from entering your countries. Expel all Israelis in your countries.",
    "13. Please, Your Excellencies, if you take the lead in this meritorious matter, meritorious because saving the life of just one child from that blood thirsty ogre is meritorious, it will shame the Arab leaders who play footsie with the US into action against the child devouring ogre.",
    "14. It will also be a slap in the face of duplicitous Europeans who are the creators of this tragedy, who committed genocide against the European Jews and most conveniently solved the Jewish problem by expelling the murdering Jewish Neanderthals into Palestine and creating there a rogue nation called Israel. If the modern Jews want vengeance for the Holocaust, they ought to commit genocide in Europe not in Palestine for the innocent Palestinians had absolutely nothing to do with the Holocaust. The main arms suppliers to Israel are US (69%) Germany, Italy, UK, Canada and (OMG!) India. Today the European hypocrites sanctimoniously call for the two-state solution but keep arming and abetting the IDF.",
    "15. Currently there are conflicts and killings happening in many regions but the Palestinian genocide is unique for it is a festering wound on humanity for the last 76 years and it is an acid test whether humanity is advancing to a better state of civilization or rather retreating to the barbarous state of Netanyahu the Neanderthal. And that is what is going to happen if the world will only watch and wail.",
    "16. Your Excellencies, the world went to the UN and to the Hague. We see no action. This is the last place we, the world, can come to. BRICS. Please do not let the Palestinians down, do not let us, the world, down.",
    "17. May our humble and desperate plea not fall on deaf ears and hard hearts."
