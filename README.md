*2025-10-03 13:10:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/215290) · `si`

පිළිකාව යනු මිනිස් ජීවිතයේ පැවැත්මට දැඩි තර්ජනයක් එක්කර තිබෙන රෝගී තත්ත්වයකි.

එම නිසාම ඊට එරෙහිව ප්‍රතිකාර සෙවීමට මේ වනවිට ලෝකයේම අවධානය යොමුවී තිබේ.

එවැනි පසුබිමක පිළිකා සෛල නසන පෝෂක ඖෂධයක් සොයාගැනීමට කොළඹ සරසවියේ ජෛව රසායන, අණුක ජීවවිද්‍යා සහ ජෛව තාක්ෂණ ආයතනය සමත්වී තිබේ.

මිනිස් ශරීරයේ කොටසක අසාමාන්‍ය සෛල පාලනයකින් තොරව වර්ධනයවීම පිළිකාවක් ලෙස හැඳින්වෙන අතර එය මුල් අවස්ථාවේ හඳුනාගෙන ප්‍රතිකාර නොකළහොත් මරණය පවා ගෙනදිය හැකිය.

ගෝලීය වශයෙන් ගත්කළ වසරකට මිලියන 10කට ආසන්න පුද්ගලයින් සංඛ්‍යාවක් පිළිකාව හේතුවෙන් මරණයට පත්වන අතර ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ වසරකට පිළිකාව හේතුවෙන් මියයන පුද්ගලයින් සංඛ්‍යාව 15,000 ත් - 20,000ත් අතර වෙයි.

මෙම තත්ත්වය හමුවේ ගෝලීය වශයෙන් මෙන්ම දේශියවද දිනෙන් දින පිළිකාව පැතිරයාමේ සීඝ්‍ර වර්ධනයක් පෙන්නුම් කර ඇති අතර ඊට සමගාමීව පිළිකාවට එරෙහිව කටයුතු කිරීමේ අවශ්‍යතාවය කෙරෙහිද ලෝකයේම අවධානය යොමුවී තිබේ.

### Sri Lanka slips 15 places in UN gender equality ranking

*2025-10-03 02:01:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Sri-Lanka-slips-15-places-in-UN-gender-equality-ranking/56-782567) · `en`

Sri Lanka has slipped sharply in global gender equality rankings, according to findings presented by UN Women to the Women Parliamentarians’ Caucus recently. The country, which ranked 18th out of 115 nations in 2006, has fallen to 130th among 148 countries in 2025.

The study assessed women’s economic empowerment, participation in governance and decision-making, roles in peace and security, and efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. While acknowledging that some of the region’s most influential figures are women, the research highlighted persistent disparities between men and women across these areas.

Chairing the session, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj called for the final report to be shared with the caucus and proposed that, in addition to allocations for the Women and Child Affairs Ministry, each Ministry should set aside funds in the upcoming Budget to support women’s empowerment.

Police have arrested the owner of a fishing boat in connection with the recent seizure of more than 700 kilograms of heroin and crystal methamphetamine (ICE) in Seenimodara, Tangalle.

The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) said the drugs, discovered in three lorries in the area, had been smuggled into the country by sea. Investigations revealed that the narcotics were brought in aboard a toll boat before being transferred to a smaller fishing vessel for transport.

The arrest was made during a raid linked to the wider probe into the drug trafficking operation.

Authorities confirmed that further investigations are underway into the network responsible for the smuggling.

In celebration of World Children’s Day on 1 October, SriLankan Airlines facilitated the flight experience for a special program for children selected through a creative competition from every province across Sri Lanka.

Through this unique initiative, 250 youngsters aged 12 to 15 were gifted the opportunity to enjoy a nearly two-hour flight aboard a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A330-300, with breath-taking views of Sri Lanka’s stunning landscapes from the sky. For many, it was their first flying experience.

### Beyond degrees: Creating future-ready workforce for Sri Lanka

*2025-10-03 01:38:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Beyond-degrees-Creating-future-ready-workforce-for-Sri-Lanka/4-782547) · `en`

The future of Sri Lanka’s economy depends not only on investment and policy but on how well the country prepares its people for the world of work. The Government is pushing forward with significant reforms to revamp the education system, from modernising curricula to expanding vocational training pathways. These initiatives deserve appreciation. They demonstrate a recognition that the nation cannot build a resilient future with outdated methods of teaching and learning.

In an increasingly competitive world, equipping students and employees with modern skills is crucial for both social progress and economic stability. Yet, despite these promising efforts, fundamental questions remain about whether the country is truly preparing its people to be future-ready and whether the billions spent on free education are delivering an adequate return on investment.

### Growing the pool of billion-dollar companies in Sri Lanka

Today, Sri Lanka has just three listed companies valued at over a billion dollars: John Keells Holdings (JKH), Commercial Bank of Ceylon, and Ceylon Tobacco PLC. This is a sobering statistic for an economy with ambitions of becoming a South Asian hub for trade, services, and investment. A country of 22 million people, strategically positioned astride major maritime routes, and possessing a strong pool of talent in accounting, IT, and law, should be capable of nurturing multiple billion-dollar firms across diverse sectors. The fact that it has not points to deeper structural barriers inhibiting corporate growth.

### Financial institutions at crossroads: Redefining risk management in the age of climate change

In the end, banks become the ultimate receivers of climate shocks, bearing the financial fallout of environmental catastrophes

The recent flash floods in Uttarakhand, India where over 100 people went missing, are just one among thousands of climate-related disasters in recent years. For banks, the impact is direct washed-out assets, loan defaults, and rising credit risk. This is not tomorrow’s threat; climate risk is already reshaping financial stability today. In the end, banks become the ultimate receivers of climate shocks, bearing the financial fallout of environmental catastrophes. Banking risk management is entering a new era. Traditional frameworks built around credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk are no longer sufficient to address the growing complexities of a changing world.

### Energy diplomacy: How Sri Lanka can bridge trade gap with United States

*2025-10-03 01:25:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Energy-diplomacy-How-Sri-Lanka-can-bridge-trade-gap-with-United-States/4-782539) · `en`

For Sri Lanka, the United States is more than just a trading partner. It is the single most important destination for Sri Lankan exports, particularly apparel, and a market that sustains hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributes significantly to national GDP. Yet, beneath this success story lies a structural imbalance. While Sri Lanka exports billions of dollars’ worth of goods to the United States each year, its imports from America remain comparatively small. This asymmetry leaves Sri Lanka exposed to tariff risks, particularly in the post-Trump era where US trade policy has become increasingly transactional.

ශ්‍රී ලංකා පොත් ප්‍රකාශකයන්ගේ සංගමය 26 වැනි වරටත් සංවිධානය කරන කොළඹ ජාත්‍යන්තර පොත් ප්‍රදර්ශනය ඉතාමත් සාර්ථකව පැවැත්වෙන බව පොත් ප්‍රකාශකයන්ගේ සංගමයේ සභාපති දිනේෂ් කුලතුංග මහතා පැවැසීය.

මේ දින කිහිපයේ පමණක් ජනතාව ලක්ෂ එකහමාරකට වැඩි පිරිසක් පොත් ප්‍රදර්ශනය නැරඹීමට හා පොත්පත් මිලදී ගැනීමට පැමිණ ඇති බව ද ඔහු සඳහන් කළේය.

පසුගිය වසර වලට වඩා බොහෝ සාර්ථක ලෙස පොත් ප්‍රදර්ශනය මෙවර පැවැත්වෙන බවත් පොතපත හොඳින් අලෙවි වන බවට කුටි සංවිධායකයන් ප්‍රකාශ කරන බවත් ඔහු කීය.

මෙවර ප්‍රදර්ශනය ආරම්භයේ සිටම සති අන්ත හෝ සතියේ දින යැයි නොසලකා ජනතාව ඇදෙමින් සිටින බව ද වෙන වසරවල එවැනි තත්වයක් නොතිබූ බව ද ඔහු කීය.

මෙවර පොත් ප්‍රදර්ශනයට වැස්සෙන් කිසිම බාධාවක් ඇති නොවූ බව ද සමහර නවකතා ඇතුළු පොත් මිලදී ගැනීම සඳහා පෝලිම් නිර්මාණය වී ඇති බව ද ඔහු සඳහන් කළේය. මෙවර ප්‍රදර්ශනය සදහා පොත් ප්‍රකාශකයන් 450 කගේ කුටි ඇතුළත්ව තිබෙන බව ද ඔහු කීය.
