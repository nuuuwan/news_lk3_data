    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The doubling of the withholding tax from 5 percent to 10 percent adds strain on low and middle-income earners reliant on interest income, Sri Lanka\u2019s former minister of state for finance, Shehan Semasinghe has said.",
    "On Wednesday, President Anura Dissanayake announced that the withholding tax will be increased.",
    "\u201cWhile the tax revision is a positive step, the 100% increase in withholding tax from 5% to 10% reduces disposable income and adds strain on low and middle-income earners reliant on interest income,\u201d Semasinghe said on social media platform X.",
    "Although aimed at offsetting the country\u2019s revenue losses from higher tax-free thresholds, it is unclear if adjusted marginal tax rates are proposed, he said.",
    "\u201cHowever, this increase burdens those already facing financial challenges. I believe the proposed tax revision as of April 2025 by our government, announced prior to elections and aligned with the IMF agreement, would have reduced the PIT tax burden without adding strain through withholding tax.\u201d",
