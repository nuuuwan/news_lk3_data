    "Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - The problems relating to drugs are not the only issue in the health sector, and both the former and incumbent health ministers have been prone to viewing health matters narrowly, focusing primarily on drug-related issues, Deputy Director of the National Hospital Colombo (NHC) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said that when considering health issues, the incumbent and former Health Minister walk on a single track.",
    "\"Drugs are not the sole issue in the country's health sector. The health administration of the hospitals has gone from bad to worse. We cannot treat patients without implementing rules in hospitals. If the Health Ministry cannot understand the issues faced by the patients and cannot understand what they mean, it is better for everyone to go home,\" he said.",
    "\"We should prioritize on a patient-centred hospital management system while shifting away from an employee-centred approach,\" he added.",
    "Meanwhile, Dr. Bellana said he has still not received any notice from the Health Ministry or from the Hospital Director to terminate his services, but it was under the easy administration system.",
    "\"The Health Ministry can remove me at any time, and I'm ready to accept that and the pension,\" he said.",
    "\"But I still have not received such a notice from any of the other parties, and therefore, I'm still engaging in hospital duties,\" Dr. Bellana said.",
    "\"I'm getting between 80 and 90 percent support from the staff of the NHC, and I have the capability of carrying out the administration of the hospital, but I cannot get support from the remaining staff as they engage in drug dealing activities within the hospital premises,\" he said.",
    "Finally, Dr. Bellana expressed his gratitude to the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), and the Public Services United Nurses' Union (PSUNU) for supporting him directly or indirectly in the situation."
