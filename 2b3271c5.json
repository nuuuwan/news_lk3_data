    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka must inform the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that both the government and opposition are against restructuring domestic debt, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said.",
    "All 225 members of parliament must say to the IMF in one voice that the government and opposition are united in their opposition to domestic debt restructuring (DDR), Premadasa said speaking at an executive committee meeting of an opposition collective in parliament on Monday June 19.",
    "\u201cEveryone in parliament must unite and explain the facts to the IMF to win what\u2019s good for the country,\u201d he said, adding that his party, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is ready to support the government in that regard.",
    "Premadasa said the government must at least now reveal its plans regarding DDR to the opposition.",
    "\u201cIf both the government and the opposition can say to the IMF in one voice that we strongly oppose DDR and that that is the voice of all 225 members, we can exert some clear influence and go into a mechanism that will save our EPF, ETF, our pensioners. We\u2019re ready to do that,\u201d he said.",
    "This is not the first time that Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition leader has expressed vehement opposition to DDR. On May 18, he said the SJB will fight to defeat the government\u2019s plans to restructure domestic debt, offering the opposition\u2019s assistance in sending a strong message to the international community.",
    "At a meeting with representatives of the Ceylon Bank Employees\u2019 Union he said the opposition is ready to tell the international community to not touch Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt.",
    "\u201cWe will fight both in and outside parliament and internationally the government\u2019s attempt to restructure domestic debt,\u201d Premadasa was heard saying in news footage of the meeting.",
    "The government, meanwhile, has yet to make its position clear on the matter.",
    "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on Monday that there will be more clarity on Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring efforts, particularly with regard to foreign debt, upon the return of President Ranil Wickremesinghe from France.",
    "Speaking at an event in Colombo Semasinghe said once a final decision has been made on domestic debt optimisation, the government will inform both parliament and the public.",
    "\u201cThis is an extremely sensitive matter that significantly influences the market situation. It is vital that we refrain from making statements that create doubts regarding this optimisation, as it helps maintain stability in our financial market,\u201d the president\u2019s media division quoted him as saying in an official translation of the state minister\u2019s remarks.",
    "A top IMF official told reporters on May 15 that the international lender is in constant dialogue with Sri Lanka over the crisis-hit island nation\u2019s DDR plans.",
    "The IMF defines a macro framework, ceilings on gross financing needs (annual debt volumes that are issued and re-issued), foreign debt service, and debt stocks on a timeline for a defaulted country to make its debt \u201csustainable\u201d.",
    "Sri Lanka also has to restructure its domestic debt to meet gross financing need (annual financing and debt roll-over totals) ceilings from 2027-2032 to make its debt sustainable, according to an IMF debt analysis.",
    "The central bank has said domestic debt restructuring will be voluntary. (Colombo/Jun20/2023)"
