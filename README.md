The life of the sea sand with Akila gave them a new hope.

The severe economic crisis hit them. The fishing industry was affected due to sea oscillations. To compensate for household expenses, Nagendra installed a loan app on his phone. He thought it would be enough for just 2000 rupees.

He turned it back with interest. But, that 2000 rupees destroyed their lives.. Even then, the agents of the credit company followed Nagendra.

They scolded him and insulted him. At the peak, Akila's photos in their hands - it was the personal memories of the couple - they edited pornography. They zoiled the inner parts, created poisonous images and spread it on social networks.

The philosophy of Carl Marx is based on the importance of labor, the fact that history is based on economic inequalities, social change, and communalism. He said that he was transforming nature through man's labor and the exploitation of workers in the bourgeois society, and that workers should create a classless society through revolution.

Adam Smith's economic principles are elaborated in his main book "The Wealth of Nations" (1776). The most important of his theories: "Invisible Hand", which refers to the market forces to regulate the economy; «Working Analysis» (Division of Labor), which increases productivity; And includes the market economy that does not intervene state
