    "The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) established on October 1st 1949 planned their path towards their 1st & 2nd centenary goals in five year steps. The 1st centenary goal was to alleviate poverty in China by 2021 when the Communist Party of China (CPC \u2013 established in July 1921) celebrated its centenary. China reached that goal in 2020 & marked it with the Chinese flag flying on the moon. The 2nd centenary goal was to create a moderately prosperous socialist state (a Xiaokang) by year 2049 when the PRC marks its centenary. Hence, the Five Year Plan (FYP) is an important policy documents for China. The 1st was drawn in 1953 & the FYP continue to set short term goals for China\u2019s socioeconomic development.",
    "Beginning in 1986 (1986 \u2013 1990) with the 7th FYP, China projected an average annual GDP growth & managed to maintain it despite western attempts to stop China especially at a time when the United Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR) was de-established in 1989. Same year Sri Lanka implemented the \u2018Janasaviya\u2019 poverty alleviation programme but a proper analysis can be done to see if Sri Lankans were actually confused between poverty alleviation & poverty sustaining for political benefits.",
    "Fast forward to the 14th FYP, China has matured to maintain a reasonable range & adjust to short term annual conditions aligning with the domestic & global economic landscape. Industrial growth was a downward trend at the start of the 14th FYP but China managed to ensure growth while maintaining stability in the manufacturing sector. Despite being industrially strong, agriculture enjoys a foremost place in China. Its world\u2019s No 1 grain producer (producing 25% of global output) & since 2004 the FYP has focused seriously on agriculture, rural areas & rural people with the medium rage goal to reach the 1st centenary goal to alleviate poverty by 2020.",
    "Chinese indicators backed by data driven statistics gives a clear picture on the focus & control it has on the economy, innovation, people\u2019s livelihoods, ecology & security at the final year of the 14th FYP. China\u2019s urbanization, healthcare, forestry, water quality, food & energy security etc. are key areas Sri Lanka can learn. Green transition progress in China is a good lesson especially to local energy & custom officials who may wish to improve their horizons on renewable energy & electric vehicles etc. (Ref. CPC archives).",
    "Chinese President Xi Jinping at the CPC central committee meeting on July 30th stressed the importance of studying public\u2019s opinions & suggestions to draft the 15th FYP (2026-2030). He encouraged his people to stay committed to high standard opening up & to adapt to changing global landscape while grasping strategic priorities with an assessment of domestic & external risks/ challenges. The 15th FYP is considered crucial as China is using a 3 FYP periods (14th, 15th & 16th FYPs) to realize socialist modernisation by 2035. This indeed is a never before laboratory opportunity for Sri Lankans who started experimenting socialism after observing it since 1935 (founding of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party by late Dr. NM Perera)",
    "President Xi\u2019s advice on; upgrading traditional industries, developing emerging industries, laying the foundation for future industries, improving national innovation system, & zeroing in on global scientific & technological frontiers are applicable to Sri Lanka if it doesn\u2019t expect Boris Yeltsin type Russian industrial development after the collapse of the USSR. Sri Lankans seems to be gradually getting a clearer picture on education reforms & even the value of launching satellites etc. Therefore, Chinese President\u2019s advice to his people should be taken seriously by all those concerned about their own countries (Ref. Media).",
    "Though some in the west criticize China for not practicing democracy, China is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council to practice \u2018One Country Many Systems of Government\u2019. China conducts the highest number of opinion polls internally on a continuous basis. The 15th FYP will also be drafted based on the opinion polls conducted at the grassroots as per the long established tradition of consulting the people. Hence, an online campaign was implemented to seek public\u2019s opinions on the 15th FYP from May 20th to June 20th. It has gathered approx 3.11 million suggestions. During the poll, some have proposed using AI to monitor elders to prevent accidents while another had proposed more community facilities (i.e. gyms, badminton courts & swimming pools etc.). Popularizing science education to cultivate skills for a technologically strong nation was also notable comment (Ref. Chinese media). President Xi has directed officials to study the opinions & integrate them into the 15th FYP. It is a lesson for Sri Lankans who may remember President Mahinda ignoring social media during 2015 Presidential election & President Gotabaya\u2019s experiment on Bio-fertiliser consulting all but the farmers. Such conflicts should be prevented & the lowest levels should be continuously consulted when deciding the course of the nation.",
    "Online public consultation has seen active participation & wide coverage, serving as a vivid example of whole-process people\u2019s democracy. \u2013 Xi Jinping",
