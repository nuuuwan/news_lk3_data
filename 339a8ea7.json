    "The hospital matron glanced up from her desk and for a moment compassion clouded her eyes, as she looked at the small, frail woman standing before her desk, shakily holding out a typed sheet of paper.",
    "\u201cAh\u2026. you got our letter came on the 5.30 bus from Matara this morning. Matron Nona. I \u2026 I\u2026 can\u2019t understand My son \u2014 Ranjit \u2014 has been transferred to the psychiatric ward?\u201d Tears welled in Somawathie\u2019s eyes.",
    "The matron\u2019s sigh was hardly noticeable. There were so many cases. Her training forbade emotional reaction.",
    "She said gently, \u201cHis head wound is healing nicely. But you see, there are other problems.",
    "\u201cHe was so much better the last time I saw him, about two weeks ago! The nurse also said so\u2026 .\u201d Somawathie wiped her eyes with her sari pota and pushed back a strand of grey hair that had loosened itself from the small tight knot at the back of her head.",
    "\u201cDid he speak to you then? Has he said anything to you on any of your visits?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes \u2026 no \u2026 nothing much, because so much pain, no? His head all bandaged.\u201d She blew her nose into a handkerchief which she took out from inside her hatte.",
    "\u201cAmme, I understand, but try and tell us. His bandages were off when you saw him, two weeks ago.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, with the blessings of the gods! He was looking fine then That is why I thought he would be discharged soon.\u201d",
    "The matron sighed. It was always the same. Contradictions muddled thoughts, in times of stress. Gently she said, \u201cThis Amme. can you repeat to us even a word or two he said? You see, he refuses to talk to us.\u201d",
    "The overhead fan creaked, shifting humid air from one side\u2019 of the room to the other. The work-worn hands of the mother twisted together nervously. Her eyebrows knit, deepening the already existing lines on her forehead as she tried to remember.\u2019",
    "\u201cHe \u2013 he was a quiet boy, never much of a talker. Kept to himself. Didn\u2019t even join the village boys. They called him the upasakaya. We just could not believe it, when he said that he had joined the army.\u201d",
    "The matron interrupted. \u201cDid your son say anything to you about how he got his injuries? Or anything at all?\u201d",
    "Somawathie\u2019s bleary eyes took on a distant look as she tried to think back, to recollect. She remembered her fear for her son\u2019s life when she was first told that he had been brought to the army hospital, with injuries to his head. She remembered seeing him lying on his side on the iron bed, with bandaged head and motionless body. She had stroked his arm gently, and bending over, asked him whether he could hear her. But he did not respond. Then a nurse led her away saying, \u201cHe is still in shock, and it\u2019s best to let him rest now.\u201d",
    "The next time she visited him, a week later, he was seated in bed leaning against the bedhead with his eyes closed, his head still firmly bandaged. At first, she had thought he was in deep meditation, but then she saw his lips moving silently and presumed he was praying. She had waited in silence for a long time before she spoke.",
    "\u201cI have come to see you, Putha. Are you feeling better now?\u201d Perhaps he hadn\u2019t finished his prayers because he did not answer. She gave him more time, before she spoke again.",
    "\u201cRanjit, look at me, Putha, I have come all the way from Matara to see you. Please speak to me.\u201d Still silence. Yet she had continued trying to engage him in conversation.",
    "\u201cTell me Putha, what happened to you? I was so relieved when they said that you had no gunshot injuries. How did it happen? Was it a bomb blast? We never get to hear what really happens to our children! Putha, please tell me what happened,\u201d she pleaded.",
    "Then he suddenly spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember,\u201d but remained motionless with his eyes closed.",
    "Somawathie continued talking to him although he had withdrawn once more into his lonely silence. She had told him about the bodhi poojas she was carrying out to bring about his full recovery; how the priest asked after him every time she went to the temple; that pirith was being chanted for him every day.",
    "She touched his hand, but he remained unresponsive. Perhaps he was tired, she\u2019d thought, and needed to rest. As she bent to touch his shoulder and bid him goodbye, she heard him whisper to himself, panati-pata veramanisikka padam samadiyami mouthing the precept to abstain from killing. He is observing his five precepts she had thought, but then, he seemed to be repeating the first precept over and over again, as though he had forgotten the rest.",
    "The next time she saw him he was walking towards his bed returning from the toilet. His head had been shaven. The bandage had been removed and the back of his head was covered with dressing held together with bands of sticking plaster. He looked so different, but better, and she was pleased.",
    "He had walked past her and sat on the bed. Obviously, he had seen her, she\u2019d thought, so she walked up to him and laughing said, \u201cSo, now you only need a yellow robe and you can join the Sangha!\u201d",
    "He had turned his face away from her. Perhaps she had said the wrong thing, even though she had meant it to be light banter. She was happy to see him better, much better, and wanted him to feel good too.",
    "She winced, as her mind raced back to the time when Ranji went missing for several hours after a row with his father. She had eventually found him seated under a coconut tree by the kamatha, his face swollen with crying. Eyes broody, unhappy.",
    "\u201cWhere were you this morning?\u201d his father had demand angrily.",
    "\u201cSo, helping at Sunday School is more important than helping your father in the field? The field that brings you the rice that fills your belly? Do you call yourself a male?\u201d he sneered.",
    "\u201cYou are worse than a woman. Your sisters have more energy in them than you have. They are a credit to this household, unlike you. See how they work. All you can do is to get to a side and read books or creep to the temple! You may as well shave your head and go live in the temple!\u201d",
    "The derision in the father\u2019s voice had hung heavy in the room like dark monsoon clouds. With head hung low, a sinking heart, trying to hold back tears of humiliation that stung his eyes, Ranjit cringed out of the house. His relationship with his father had never been an easy one. He had always known that he failed to measure up to his father\u2019s expectations. Sitting under the tree brooding, he felt as though an old wound he had tried to keep at bay, to ignore, had started bleeding. His sense of inadequacy and alienation ran deep. I\u2019ll show him that I am not the weakling he thinks I am. I will join the army.",
    "\u201cPutha,\u201d said Somawathie, gingerly placing the comb of pIantains she\u2019d brought for him on the bedside table. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to look at the plantains I brought you? They are just how you like them \u2013 not overripe.\u201d He took no notice.",
    "\u201cRanjit, are you angry with me? I was only joking, Putha, about you looking like a Buddhist monk.\u201d But he remained silent, his eyes fixed on the blank wall.",
    "\u201cYour sisters are worried about you. In fact, Prema wanted to come with me today, but I didn\u2019t think she should be travelling such a long distance in her condition. The baby is due end of the month.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to be listening.",
    "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to me, Putha? Have I annoyed you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he snapped, suddenly, harshly.",
    "\u201cThen why don\u2019t you talk to me? I have come all the way from Matara and you won\u2019t even look at me!\u201d",
    "\u201cAmma! I need to think. I need time to remember. I have to sort things out,\u201d he almost shouted at her, not hiding his annoyance. \u201cWhat things  Putha?\u201d",
    "He did not answer; but lay down on the bed and shut his eyes and shut her out.",
    "The Matron\u2019s voice brought her back to the present. \u201cTry to remember his words,\u201d she was saying.",
    "\u201cI think he didn\u2019t like it when I joked with him and said he looked like a monk, with his shaven head.\u201d",
    "The Matron sighed. She had seen too many cases like this where there was no easy answer. But Ranjit had been an exceptionally docile patient, doing what he was told to do, never complaining. But this silence from a man, so young \u2026 something was wrong \u2026 radically wrong. Strange, that the window beside his bed was always kept closed with the curtains drawn. No sooner the nurse opened it, he\u2019d get out of bed and shut it. How could he be helped if he wouldn\u2019t even talk to the doctors?",
    "The mother gingerly touched the Matron\u2019s hand in a gesture of pleading. \u201cWhat happened to my boy, Matron? How did he get hurt? We are never told.\u201d",
    "A division of the Sri Lanka Army, with Ranjit among 40 soldiers led by a Captain, were detailed to search a village in Vavuniya believed to be harbouring Tigers \u2013 cadres of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Shooting had broken out, and hand grenades thrown at the soldiers.",
    "\u201cWe lost 14 soldiers,\u201d the matron said quietly. \u201cSeveral were very badly wounded. Your son was lucky to have escaped with only a head injury. What is so strange is, that he seems to have been hit with a blunt instrument. He won\u2019t tell us what happened.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat is because he does not know. He said he couldn\u2019t member what happened.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d said the mother, \u201cHe said he needed time to think. He said he needed time to remember.\u201d His words rang strong in her mind now.",
    "Ranjit walked slowly to the window. Although he tried not to look as he reached out to shut the window, he couldn\u2019t help but notice from the corner of his eye the bougainvillea he now hated much. The creeper had hooked its treacherous thorns on to the trunk and branches of a mango tree, crept up stealthily and then burst into bloom. It was the colour he couldn\u2019t stand.",
    "It \u2018wasn\u2019t the common purple-red, nor an orange-red, rather, it was a deep, deep, red, the colour of blood. The colour that seeped through his eyes, and into his brain. It flooded inside and created a pressure in his head that was unbearable. It was worse than the pain of his wound. Why did they insist on opening the window!",
    "He gently touched the dressing at the back of his head as he ,tried to remember for the umpteenth time what happened on that fateful day. The more he tried, the more his grip on his memory slipped away, his mind like a shattered mirror, its pieces scattered. As he tried to piece a few together, they disintegrate again into splintered fragments. A kaleidoscope of images\u2019; scenes, noises, smells, feelings, memories \u2013 distant and recent advanced, receded, merged, unceasingly. He desperately strain",
    "recognize a pattern; to insert the pieces of the jigsaw together and make up a picture he could comprehend.",
    "Suddenly his body jerks with the sound of an explosion. A overpowering smell of gunpowder, blood, and singed flesh assail him. He is engulfed in the odour of death.",
    "Then the kaleidoscope shifts and he is walking along a jungle path which, dream-like, turns into a field where the village boys are playing.",
    "\u201cCome and join us \u2013 we are catching grasshoppers,\u201d they shout He shrinks back. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d they taunt. \u201cGrasshoppers don\u2019t bite.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of grasshoppers,\u201d he affirms. Cupping his bands he traps a grasshopper on the ground. He feels its frantic movements against the hollow of his cupped palms.",
    "\u201cCoward! Coward! Coward!\u201d they taunt with evil laughter. The word \u2018coward\u2019 ricochets in his head, as gunshots blast, around him.",
    "\u201cShoot!\u201d a voice booms behind him. \u201cShoot to kill. You blood coward shoot!\u201d",
    "His insides twist in fear as if an invisible band is clenching his guts. He lifts his gun and points at the young woman running towards him.",
    "\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me. Please. Please,\u201d she screams in Tamil as she draws closer with out-stretched arms. The white gemstone on her nostril glints as the sunlight catches it.",
    "Images and sounds recede. Something tugs at him, sucking him down into a dark void of exhaustion; he struggles frantically and drags himself out slowly. The kaleidoscope shifts again.",
    "His mother is seated cross-legged in her room on the cement floor. He is seated in her lap. She takes his little hands and places his palms together. He repeats the Pali stanza after her. Panatipata veramani  sikkbapadam samadiyami . \u2026",
    "That\u2019s the first precept she says. Then she explains what it means. You must never take the life of any living creature. Yes, not even an ant. Killing is a sin.",
    "Suddenly the vision explodes like fireworks against his eyelids. Images pile one on top of another. Bodies thrown up in the air, coming down in pieces; blood and shattered bone; heads with eyeless black sockets. Shrill cries of terror.",
    "The vision comes upon him again. The woman running towards him with outstretched arms. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t kill me\u2026",
    "He feels the coldness of the trigger on his forefinger. He feels the wetness of urine running down his leg.",
    "A gunshot echoes in his head. The woman crumples to the ground. He smells blood as he too collapses and lies on the parched earth. Intense pain stings like live coals at the back of his head.",
    "\u201cRanjit,\u201d the Matron\u2019s voice grated on his raw nerves. \u201cYour mother is here to see you.\u201d",
    "Ranjit\u2019s fists clenched. Why couldn\u2019t he be left alone! He needed to sort things out in his head. He needed to know what happened. He needed time to remember.",
    "\u201cGet out! Get out!\u201d he screamed. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d Somawathie stepped back in shock, unbelieving, desperate.",
    "Captain Welgama\u2019s heavy boots stomped along the grey corridor behind the woman in the blue uniform. Suddenly, she slowed down, then stopped and looked at him.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m telling you once again, Captain, Ranjit will not talk. He does not talk to anyone, and if he does, it will only be to chase you out.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut I need to talk to him Matron. It is important to me and perhaps to him too. I would have come earlier if I was allowed, but I was discharged from hospital only yesterday.\u201d His voice was powerful even though he tried to speak softly. \u201cYou say he can\u2019t remember what happened to him?\u201d",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what he told his mother. He does not speak to us.\u201d They resumed walking.",
    "The Captain frowned. \u201cMaybe I could jog his memory. You see, we were fighting quite close to each other during the attack. saw him collapse, just before I got shot in my leg.\u201d",
    "He took out a handkerchief and wiped his face. \u201cTell me Matron, could Ranjit\u2019s present problems be the result of the blow to his head?\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know Captain, I\u2019m not a doctor. Ranjit did suffer concussion. Sometimes, people can\u2019t remember because they subconsciously block out memories, which are too painful. T here could be other reasons too for his loss of memory.\u201d",
    "The matron stopped at the entrance to Ward 12 and opened he door.",
    "\u201cCaptain, I don\u2019t think you should stay too long,\u201d she murmured, moving towards the far end of the ward. Ranjit was lying on his bed with his eyes closed.",
    "\u201cYou have a visitor, Ranjit,\u201d the matron said with forced cheerfulness.",
    "Ranjit screwed up his eyelids and tensed his body as if in anticipation of an onslaught. He was determined to resist any attempt to divert his attention from the vital task he had: to put together his shattered thoughts and make sense of the images that constantly besieged him.",
    "\u201cHello Ranjit, how are you?\u201d Captain Welgama tried to keep his voice down. \u201cI would have come to see you earlier, but I was in hospital too. I was shot in my leg.\u201d He dragged the chair that was against the wall by the window and sat by Ranjit\u2019s bed.",
    "Ranjit sat up as if galvanized by electricity. The voice boomed in his head echoing, vibrating like the sound of a gong. Shoot!",
    "Shoot! Coward! Idiot! Shoot! His hands crumpled and clenched the bed sheet. His eyes stared at Captain Welgama unseeing. The captain stood up and placed his hands on Ranjit\u2019s shoulders.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man, I\u2019m truly sorry for what I did to you. I just lost control.\u201d",
    "Ranjit looked at Welgama, trying to, but not understanding him.",
    "\u201cI saw the woman running towards you, and you were in a better position to shoot. I couldn\u2019t understand why you were, hesitating",
    "The puzzle was slowly coming together in Ranjit\u2019s head. \u201cBut\u2019 she was asking to be spared, she was innocent, she was coming towards me with outstretched arms\u2026",
    "\u201cYes, but she could have been a suicide bomber. Why was she running towards you, instead of running away? What happened to all those months of training?\u201d",
    "Ranjit\u2019s eyes were fixed on the bare wall, but his mind was seeing the woman, running towards him with her arms stretched out, pleading. He felt his hands lifting the gun as if in slow motion. He felt his finger on the trigger. The voice boomed from somewhere behind him. \u201cShoot! Shoot!\u201d and suddenly his mind went blank.",
    "The captain saw the anguish on the young man\u2019s face and tried to say something to comfort him. But he couldn\u2019t think of what to say. For a few moments they were locked in silence.",
    "\u201cYou see, Ranjit,\u201d Welgama said gently, as if speaking to a child, \u201cby hesitating, you were putting so many lives in jeopardy. That is why I lost my temper. I brought my gun down on your head, with all the energy I could muster. It was such a savage blow; I might have killed you. I am sorry, Son.\u201d",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t remember you hitting me, or even falling down. I saw her falling after I\u2019d shot her, and the next thing I remember is lying on the ground feeling a great pain in my head.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut you didn\u2019t shoot her! That is why I hit you. I was behind you when I shot her. I shot her and then whacked you.\u201d",
    "Ranjit looked at the captain\u2019s face, suddenly noticing his features for the first time. The deep-set eyes beneath his well-defined eyebrows, the slim long nose, the full lips and the slightly protruding teeth, and he felt a surge of gratitude. Gratitude to a man who helped him back to his senses; a man who\u2019d lifted the heavy oppression that had been weighing him down, so long. The man who had used his gun on him with ferocity but now had brought resolution to his paralyzing mental turmoil.",
    "\u201cDid you say I didn\u2019t kill her?\u201d Ranjit wanted to hear it over and over again till every brain cell in his head was imbued with this knowledge. \u201cAre you sure, Sir, are you sure?\u201d Tension from his face and body was visibly easing. He felt a lightness of body and mind he had previously not experienced.",
    "\u201cOf course, you didn\u2019t, man! I wish you had. Then you wouldn\u2019t have suffered that head injury.\u201d He walked to the window, drew the curtains apart and opened it. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot, man, I don\u2019t know how you stay in this room with the window closed!\u201d",
    "The curtains danced as a cool breeze blew in through the window.",
    "\u201cThat is a beautiful bougainvillea,\u201d commented the Captain, looking out. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual colour.\u201d",
    "Ranjit looked at the bougainvillea with new eyes. \u201cYes, Sir,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is a brilliant colour.\u201d",
