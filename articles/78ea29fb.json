  "original_body_lines": [
    "Affirms NPP will only exit power after achieving unified, reformed SL",
    "Calls NPP\u2019s rise response to public demand for change, citing traditional power retention blocks true reform",
    "Sees the 14 Nov. General Election as essential for securing additional reform power",
    "Reveals plan to streamline governance with reduced ministerial privileges, public sector salary increases in the upcoming Budget, including special provisions for estate workers",
    "Says diplomatic posts with political appointees will be reassessed to promote clean governance",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday outlined the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party\u2019s inclusive vision to bring about transformative changes aligned with public demand.",
    "\u201cWe aim to leave power only once we have successfully rebuilt this nation,\u201d Dissanayake pledged, addressing a rally in Nuwara Eliya, reinforcing the NPP\u2019s promise to steer the country towards a more unified and inclusive political landscape.",
    "He underscored the district\u2019s importance in the upcoming General Election, noting the NPP\u2019s vision to unite Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities under one political movement.",
    "\u201cHistorically, our country\u2019s politics have been divided, with Tamil parties representing Tamils and Sinhala parties for the Sinhalese. For the first time, however, a political movement seeks to unite all communities in the Nuwara Eliya district,\u201d he stressed.",
    "Reflecting on his Presidency, Dissanayake highlighted the NPP\u2019s unique path. \u201cIf we were following traditional politics, the Presidency would suffice. But the people\u2019s support for the NPP at the Presidential election was a call for real change. Many old leaders cling to power even after defeat \u2013 this blocks true reform. We need influence beyond just the Presidency to drive meaningful transformation,\u201d he added.",
    "Noting that the NPP wields influence through the President and three Cabinet Ministers, he stated that the 14 November Parliamentary election is critical to securing additional authority for reform, with plans to hold Provincial Council elections next year and local Government elections soon.",
    "He indicated that the NPP\u2019s approach to governance would break from past practices, with streamlined Cabinet roles and reduced privileges for ministers.",
    "\u201cMinisters will no longer have official residences in Colombo or extensive security details,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake also announced plans for public sector salary increases in the upcoming Budget, with special provisions for estate workers.",
    "Additionally, the President confirmed plans to recall diplomats with political appointments from overseas missions as part of a broader commitment to clean governance."
