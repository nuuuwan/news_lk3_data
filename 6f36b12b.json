  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga yesterday took to Twitter to question why no action was ever taken against Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera and others who insulted other religions practised in the country.",
    "Kumaratunga said their words spreading hate against Muslim and Tamil citizens of Sri Lanka were far more vicious than those uttered by Standup Comedian Nathasha Edirisuriya who was arrested recently for making comments deemed insulting to the Lord Buddha.",
    "\u201cWhat about monk Gnanasara and a host of others who insulted Islam, burnt churches and places of Christian worship and mosques? They spread hate speech against Muslim and Tamil citizens more vicious than Nathasha\u2019s words,\u201d she said.",
    "The former leader also questioned why no action was taken against those who accused and slandered Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen going on to ruin his life in the process. \u201cStill not too late for President Wickremesinghe to have the culprits apprehended and punish them. That will be true democratic governance,\u201d she said.",
    "Kumaratunga opined that if Sri Lanka did in fact follow true Buddhist principles it would not be facing the crisis it is in today.",
    "\u201cIndeed Buddhism must receive utmost respect. But also all other religions in equal measure. Every citizen has the sacred right to believe in and follow any religion he wishes to, a truth inherent to the Buddhist philosophy of loving-kindness, and tolerance of others and their beliefs,\u201d she added."
