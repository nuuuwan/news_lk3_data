    "Umariya Singhawansa, the sister of Umara Sinhawansa who made headlines for the distorted singing of the National Anthem at the LPL opening, said today that her sister does not deserve whatever that is happening at the moment as there are much bigger issues underlining this country.",
    "\u201cWhile there are much bigger issues underlining this country, they will always find other irrelevant, trivial things to magnify and blow out of proportion,\" she posted on her facebook.",
    "\u201cBut know this, my sister has too good a heart. And she does not deserve whatever that\u2019s happening at the moment. And I\u2019m ashamed that we still live in a world where ridiculing, bullying and hurting people online and elsewhere is still a \u201cthing\u201d. To those who have stuck by her and have been kind. Thankyou from the bottom of our hearts. We\u2019re grateful,\u201d she said."
