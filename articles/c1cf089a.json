  "original_body_lines": [
    "The world just experienced its hottest January on record, continuing a run of exceptional heat fuelled by climate change, the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Thursday.",
    "Last month surpassed the previous warmest January, which occurred in 2020, in C3S\u2019s records going back to 1950.",
    "The exceptional month came after 2023 ranked as the planet\u2019s hottest year in global records going back to 1850, as human-caused climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, pushed temperatures higher.",
    "Every month since June has been the world\u2019s hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years.",
    "\u201cNot only is it the warmest January on record but we have also just experienced a 12-month period of more than 1.5 C (1.7 F) above the pre-industrial reference period,\u201d C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said.",
    "\u201cRapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing,\u201d she said.",
    "U.S. scientists have said 2024 has a one-in-three chance of being even hotter than last year, and a 99% chance of ranking in the top five warmest years.",
    "The El Nino phenomenon began to weaken last month, and scientists, opens new tab have indicated it could shift to the cooler La Nina counterpart later this year. Still, average global sea surface temperatures last month were the highest for any January on record.",
    "Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent global warming surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid it unleashing more severe and irreversible consequences.",
    "Despite exceeding 1.5 C in a 12-month period, the world has not yet breached the Paris Agreement target, which refers to an average global temperature over decades.",
    "Some scientists have said the goal can no longer realistically be met, but have urged governments to act faster to cut CO2 emissions to limit overshooting the target - and the deadly heat, drought and rising seas that this would inflict on people and ecosystems - as much as possible."
