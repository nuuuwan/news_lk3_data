    "A Magistrate is reported to have told a Buddhist monk, produced before him in a case against the construction of an unauthorised building in a railway reservation in the Gampaha District, a home truth. Ordering that the illegal structure be demolished within one month, the judge stressed that religion and the law must not be confused with one another, according to media reports.",
    "The conflation of religious faith with immunity from legal accountability amounts to a distortion of both religion and governance, and leads to a severe erosion of public faith in the rule of law. Above all, the construction of places of worship and the erection of various religious statues in places such as key traffic nodes, hindering vehicle movement, and preventing road development, is tantamount to a misuse of spiritual authority. Religious leaders ought to lead by example.",
    "Now that the Railway Department has fought a successful legal battle against the aforementioned monk, it ought to ensure that all those who have encroached on railway reservations across the country are similarly dealt with. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of houses and kiosks, located in close proximity to railroads, especially in the suburbs of Colombo. It is no secret that these encroachers leverage their block votes, numbering thousands, to pressure politicians to intervene to prevent the Railway Department from evicting them. The same holds true for illegal settlements on canal banks in Colombo. Vote-bank politics, as it were, takes precedence over the rule of law in this country. So does the immense lobbying power of the financiers of political parties.",
    "The court order under discussion could not have come at a more appropriate time. The government has undertaken to clear the reservations of irrigation tanks of encroachments. No sooner had it launched a programme in Anuradhapura to restore tank reservations in that district to their original state recently than its political rivals challenged it to remove the unauthorised structures, including wealthy rice miller Dudley Sirisena\u2019s hotel allegedly located in the reservation of the Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa. Interestingly, acting suo motu, the government has said Sirisena\u2019s hotel is not in the tank reservation, and only an unauthorised boundary fence will have to be removed! Powerful government ministers who float like butterflies and sting like bees, when they take on their political rivals, float like bees and sting like butterflies, when they have to deal with influential moneybags. The culture of impunity is far from over despite last year\u2019s regime change.",
    "The government is apparently taking great pains to have the public believe that Sirisena\u2019s hotel cannot be an unauthorised structure because it formerly belonged to the state. How can it reconcile this claim with its declaration that several state-owned buildings such as the official residences of the Governor and the Chief Minister of the North Central Province and a number of holiday bungalows belonging to public institutions have been built in the reservation of the Nuwara Wewa in Anuradhapura? The allegation against Sirisena has not been substantiated; it is also not entirely devoid of politics. However, it must be probed thoroughly in a transparent manner. The Opposition\u2019s claim that the Parakrama Samudraya is not filled to its full capacity due to pressure from wealthy encroachers who do not want their properties submerged must also be investigated. It is unbecoming of the incumbent rulers, who have embarked on a campaign to break what they describe as a 76-year curse, to defend the tycoons facing various allegations.",
    "Unless the government fulfils its election pledge to reinforce the rule of law by ensuring that all are equal before the law, efforts being made by upright judges to reinvigorate the judicial and legal processes will not yield the desired results.",
