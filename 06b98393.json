  "original_body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lankan Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa filed a Fundamental Rights petition to the Supreme Court on January 8th, challenging the recent electricity tariff hike and the Ceylon Electricity Board's (CEB) practice of disconnecting power to consumers.",
    "The petition names the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the CEB Head Office, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary, and the Attorney General's Department as respondents.",
    "The Opposition Leader speaking to reporters outside the apex court premises in Colombo \u00a0contends that the CEB generated excess electricity through hydropower, leading to Rs. 52 billion in profits.",
    "He said that a 400 GWh drop in demand resulted in further profits of Rs. 26 billion, and additionally, the CEB imposed an 18% tariff hike, generating another Rs. 26 billion.",
    "Premadasa highlighted the disconnection of electricity for 800,000 consumers despite the Rs. 52 billion profit made by the CEB.",
    "He called for the immediate suspension of this practice and a review of the disconnection policy.",
    "Opposition Leader Premadasa also called for a reduction in electricity tariffs based on the CEB's profits and the introduction of a new pricing formula for low-income consumers struggling with current rates."
