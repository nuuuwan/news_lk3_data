    "First Capital Research, in its\u00a0Pre-Policy Analysis Report \u2013 July 2025, anticipates that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will prioritize economic growth in its upcoming monetary policy meeting, with a potential rate cut on the horizon.",
    "According to the report, there is a\u00a060% probability\u00a0of a rate reduction, with a\u00a050% chance of a 25 basis points (bps) cut\u00a0and a\u00a010% likelihood of a deeper 50 bps reduction, aimed at stimulating economic activity.",
    "However, the analysis also notes a\u00a040% probability\u00a0that CBSL may hold rates steady to assess evolving domestic and global economic conditions.",
    "Additionally, the report suggests an\u00a080% probability\u00a0that the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) will remain unchanged. However, given improved liquidity in the financial system, there is a\u00a020% chance of a 100 bps SRR hike.",
