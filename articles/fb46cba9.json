    "Says his vision for future no longer aligns with SJB\u2019s direction",
    "Expresses belief that his decision is in best interest of both himself and party",
    "Stresses after consecutive election defeats he must now prioritise family and business commitments",
    "Rehan Jayawickreme has officially stepped down from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and relinquished his position as the party\u2019s Weligama Organiser. In a letter addressed to the party\u2019s General Secretary, Ranjith Maddumabandara, dated 1 January 2025, Jayawickreme cited both personal and professional reasons for his decision, marking a significant juncture in his political career.",
    "Detailing his resignation, Jayawickreme explained that his vision for the future no longer aligns with the party\u2019s direction. He emphasised that this fundamental divergence compelled him to step aside, believing the decision to be in the best interest of both himself and the party. \u201cHaving faced consecutive election defeats, I feel it is time to prioritise my family and business commitments,\u201d he said, adding that his choice followed much reflection.",
    "In his letter, Jayawickreme recounted his journey with the SJB and the sacrifices he made to support the party. He recalled being the first local government head to face a disciplinary inquiry from the United National Party (UNP) in 2019 for supporting SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, which ultimately led to his expulsion from the UNP. \u201cI put my reputation, career, and personal stability on the line because I believed in the vision we were working toward,\u201d he wrote.",
    "Beyond his political contributions, Jayawickreme also highlighted his financial support for the party and the Matara district, underscoring his unwavering commitment to the people of Weligama. He expressed pride in the work he accomplished for the community, even as he prepares to step back from active politics.",
    "Jayawickreme was unequivocal in stating that his resignation is final and not open to reconsideration. He extended his gratitude to the party leadership, including leader Sajith Premadasa, Chairperson Imtiaz Bakeer Markar, National Leader Tissa Attanayaka, and Treasurer Harsha De Silva, for their support during his tenure.",
    "While his departure signals a personal shift in priorities, Jayawickreme reaffirmed his adherence to his principles and beliefs, asserting that these remain unchanged.",
    "The SJB has yet to release an official response to Jayawickreme\u2019s resignation, which comes at a pivotal time for the party as it seeks to recalibrate and bolster its standing in Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape."
