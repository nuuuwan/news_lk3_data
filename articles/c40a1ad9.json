    "Premadasa to be SJB\u2019s Prime Ministerial candidate on agreement with all parties in SJS",
    "Says alliance between him and Wickremesinghe could be successful based on \u201carithmetic,\u201d but deeper political analysis would reveal otherwise",
    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa announced his readiness to contest the upcoming General Elections, confirming that he will run as the leader of the Samagi Jana Balavega (SJB) and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS).",
    "Premadasa emphasised his willingness to join forces with progressive groups who align with the party\u2019s principles and are committed to serving the people.",
    "During a meeting held in Colombo with Members of Parliament, district, and constituency organisers of the SJB and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya, the group unanimously agreed to entrust Premadasa with the responsibility of leading the coalition as their Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming elections.",
    "Addressing the media, Premadasa remarked that there had been false rumours circulating in recent days, and he urged the public to critically assess the information disseminated by both traditional and social media.",
    "Premadasa clarified that there had been no discussions with figures such as Ranil Wickremesinghe. While some might speculate that an alliance between him and Wickremesinghe could be successful based on \u201carithmetic,\u201d Premadasa argued that a deeper political analysis would reveal otherwise.",
    "He pledged to humbly accept the will and blessings of the people as reflected in the elections.",

    "The upcoming general election, expected later this year, will be a key test for the SJB and its allies, as they position themselves as a major force in Sri Lankan politics."
