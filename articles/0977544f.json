Peiris and Nalaka Godahewa.",
    "\"You should ask President Wickremesinghe about our being sidelined. We cannot comment on that,\" Dr. De Silva said in response to a question raised by the media as to whether MPs such as him are sidelined by the SJB leadership.",
    "Also he said Sri Lanka should be a stakeholder of fast developing Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala if it is to survive in the future.
