    "Academy of Health Professionals alleges that the administration of Colombo National Hospital has turned away a number of patients due to out-of-order air conditioners at the laboratory on the third floor of the Out-Patient Department (OPD) of the hospital.",
    "When inquired by Ada Derana, Deputy Director of the Colombo National Hospital Dr. Rukshan Bellana stated that this situation arose as a result of a gas leak in the air conditioning system.",
    "The Chinese company which carries out the maintenance activities has informed the doctor that the gas leak remains the same even after recent servicing.",
    "The company has thus requested two more days to restore the malfunctioning air conditioning system, Dr. Bellana added."
