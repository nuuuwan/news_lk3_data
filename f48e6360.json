    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s announced domestic debt restructuring plan has avoided adding to the \u201cfragility\u201d of the banking system, World bank Country Director Faris Hadad-Zervos said.",
    "\u201cThe trick is to do it in a way that does not impact the financial sector and does not cause fragility in the financial sector,\u201d Hadad-Zervos told a forum organized by Sri Lanka\u2019s Press Club.",
    "Sri Lanka kept banks, which have already been hit by bad loans and mark-to-market losses out of re-structuring plan.",
    "Hadad-Zervos said initial analysis seems to indicate that the debt restricting is done in a sustainable way but without further impacting the banking sector.",
    "Maturities of pension funds and central bank holdings are to be extended to meet a so-called Gross Financing Need parameter of the International Monetary Fund, which the agency believes will help make debt \u2018sustainable\u2019 by reducing roll-over volumes in a given year.",
    "The World Bank was supporting a deposit insurance scheme in case banks failed.",
    "There were sign of confidence returning to the financial system as indicated by interest rates, Hadad-Zervos said.",
    "Sri Lanka is expected to get around 150 million US dollars from the World Bank for the deposit insurance scheme.",
    "Each time Sri Lanka\u2019s macro-economists use the central bank\u2019s money printing powers to suppress rates, usually buy purchasing maturing debt from Treasuries auctions to suppress the gilt yield curve forex shortages triggered.",
    "Reserves sales are then offset through open market operations to fix a policy rate (buying back Treasuries from banks buyers through term or outright purchases), resulting in a full-blown balance of payments crises.",
    "Bank loan to deposit ratios weaken as open market operations intensify to maintain the policy rate and sterilize interventions.",
    "In the stabilization or \u2018hangover\u2019 year, when macro-economists stop suppressing rates with more money printing after reserves fall, banks end up with large volumes of bad loans, interest rates soar, economic output falls, triggering wider budget deficits and a spike in debt to GDP ratios.",
    "In the latest BOP crisis, bank bad loans have so far spiked to around 13 percent. In the absence of DDR threat in the past, banks used to buy heavily into government securities, making capital gains to offset some of the bad loans.",
    "In the year rates are suppressed, as reserves are run down, new dollar borrowings from various sources are made as the country loses the ability to settle debt or oil purchases, leading to a spike in net foreign debt, critics have pointed out.",
    "In 2020, macro-economists not only printed money through open market operations and bought maturing debt from past deficits (effectively monetizing the GFN) which is the traditional way BOP crises are created in Sri Lanka, but also cut taxes in additional macro-economic policy (fiscal stimulus) to close an output gap.",
    "\u201cThe switching of resources from unproductive public expenditure to the private firms and individuals will be growth friendly in a context where there has been a persistent output gap,\u201d the Finance Ministry said in December 2022.",
    "\u201cHigher growth will have a positive impact on the overall debt dynamics of the country as well.\u201d",
    "The IMF taught the country to calculate an output gap after the end of a 30-year civil war.  In a new central bank law supported by the International Monetary Fund, targeting an output gap is to be legalized. (Colombo/July19/2023)"
