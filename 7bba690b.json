    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Rescuers from the US and Canadian navies are racing against time to locate a missing submersible named Titan which vanished with five people on board while on a tourist visit to the wreck of the Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday.",
    "Four aircraft from the US and Canada have been deployed in the search for the 22-feet long vessel, operated by commercial tour firm Oceangate, which was carrying enough oxygen for just four days when it began its voyage on Sunday to the wreck which is at 3,800 metres below sea level. Contact with its mother ship on the surface was lost one hour and 45 minutes into the dive. The submersible is carrying a pilot, an expert guide and three tourists.",
