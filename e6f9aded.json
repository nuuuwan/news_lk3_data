    "A special operation by Sri Lanka Navy in the sea area near the Ippanthivu Island, Kalpitiya in the dark hours of 22nd November 2023, resulted in the recovery of about 477 kg (wet weight) of Tendu leaves adrift in the waters.",
    "The Sri Lanka Navy consistently carries out search operations and patrols along the island's coastal areas to deter the smuggling of unauthorized items into the country. As an extension of these efforts, SLNS Vijaya in the Northwestern Naval Command carried out this special operation in the vicinity of Ippanthivu Island on 22nd November. The operation led to the recovery of 14 suspicious sacks floating in the waters. After conducting further examination of the sacks, the Navy seized around 477 kg of Tendu leaves with wet weight.",
    "It is suspected that smugglers might have abandoned the consignment, being unable to fetch them ashore due to the presence of the Navy in the area. The retrieved stock of Tendu leaves has been kept in the custody of the Navy until they are produced for onward legal action.",
