### Japan’s Takaichi set to become country’s first female PM

*2025-10-04 12:50:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113210/japans-takaichi-set-to-become-countrys-first-female-pm) · `en`

Japan’s ruling party picked conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi as its new head on Saturday, putting her on course to become the country’s first female prime minister.

The Liberal Democratic Party elected Takaichi, 64, to regain trust from a public angered by rising prices and drawn to opposition groups promising big stimulus and clampdowns on foreigners.

A vote in parliament to choose a prime minister to replace Shigeru Ishiba is expected to be held on October 15.

The new LDP president is likely to succeed Shigeru Ishiba as leader of the world’s fourth-biggest economy because the party, which has governed Japan for almost all the postwar period, is the biggest in parliament. But this is not assured as the party and its coalition partner lost their majorities in both houses under Ishiba in the past year.

The people of Jaffna were once named for education, discipline, honesty, dignity and labor. But in the past regimes, the use of drugs and telephone use is deteriorating. So we have a responsibility to bring them into a good situation.

He was speaking at the Virtue Day event held on Friday (03) organized by the Jaffna - Sanganai North Pradeshiya Society.. There he further stated,

Everyone knows how social changes are taking place. Lack of morality is the reason for all this. The discipline started in the family and then spread to the village, and it should move towards the country. They are headed by the activities of old governments.

In the past government, politicians have obtained liquor sanctions in Kilinochchi and Jaffna. Brewery are more than dining shops.

The source of a large political party has brought drugs to the south to create a drug factory.

This was overlooked by the last governments.  But our president has taken appropriate action and arrested everyone.
