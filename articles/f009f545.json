    "The summit served as a platform for governments, international organisations, and civil society to share achievements and discuss future strategies for realising lasting peace.",
    "This year\u2019s summit highlighted significant progress in three key areas. In the field of international law, HWPL\u2019s Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW) gained further momentum, with the Latin American and Caribbean Parliament (PARLATINO) and 16 national parliaments and government institutions officially adopting resolutions in support of the declaration.",
    "In peace education, institutionalisation at the national level is underway. The Ministry of Education of Zambia has implemented HWPL\u2019s Peace Education across all public schools in the capital, Lusaka, with plans for nationwide expansion. Mongolia has also formally incorporated the program into its national curriculum.",
    "In interfaith dialogue, the launch of the Solidarity of Religions\u2019 Peace Committee (SRPC) marked a new milestone. Since 2023, the HWPL International Religious Peace Academy (IRPA) has officially been recognised in several countries as a platform enabling both religious leaders and citizens to engage in peace-centred discourse.",
    "In his keynote address, HWPL Chairman Man Hee Lee said: \u201cConflict can never be good. Only the achievement of peace is good. If we fail to establish peace in our time, we will burden future generations with conflict. What we must leave behind is a world of peace, not war.\u201d",
    "Former President of Croatia Ivo Josipovi\u0107, in his congratulatory message said: \u201cOur activity for banning war throughout the world is more important now than ever. This year\u2019s achievements are the guarantee that humankind will one day achieve eternal peace.\u201d",
    "Senior Journalist in Sri Lanka Sukumar Rockwood, who attended the summit, said: \u201cCivic awareness reform is essential to overcome challenges such as environmental issues, drug abuse, and corruption. HWPL\u2019s LP Program can lead to these changes.\u201d He further expressed confidence that cooperation with HWPL will play a crucial role in both peacebuilding and national development in Sri Lanka.",
