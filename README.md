### Rice shortage, price surge fueled by increased beer production?

*2024-11-07 08:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103222/rice-shortage-price-surge-fueled-by-increased-beer-production) · `en`

The Small and Medium Scale Rice Mill Owners’ Association stresses that the growing rice shortage in the market is caused by the increased use of raw rice for beer production.

According to the association, diverting more rice for brewing has impacted the availability of rice for consumers, leading to rising prices.

Chairman of the association U.K. Semasinghe explained that the raw rice used in beer production is sourced from ‘Nadu’ paddy.

“Raw rice is essential for beer production, but it comes from ‘Nadu’ paddy. When a greater portion of this paddy is allocated to the production of beer, the supply of paddy for regular Nadu rice production diminishes,” he noted.

### Ashes Of Despair, Embers Of Hope: Sri Lanka’s Path To Renewal

The story of Sri Lanka’s recent turmoil is both a cautionary tale of authoritarianism gone awry and a narrative of resilience. The Rajapaksa dynasty, spearheaded by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, came to symbolize the very forces that pushed Sri Lanka to the brink—corruption, nepotism, and reckless economic policies. Gotabaya’s tenure left the nation reeling from financial mismanagement, stoked ethnic divisions, and silenced dissent. Yet, from this dark chapter emerged a new leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, whose values and vision offer Sri Lankans a renewed sense of hope. This article traces the disastrous decisions of Gotabaya’s administration and examines how Dissanayake and the National People’s Power (NPP) party are paving a path toward unity, accountability, and economic recovery.
