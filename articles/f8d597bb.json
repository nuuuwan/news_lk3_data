  "original_body_lines": [
    "Russia urged caution on Monday (Aug 4) after US President Donald Trump said he would deploy two nuclear submarines following an online row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.",
    "Trump said he had ordered the deployment in response to what he alleged were highly provocative comments by Medvedev, saying the submarines would be positioned in \u201cappropriate regions\u201d.",
    "Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines.",
    "He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.",
    "\u201cRussia is very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation. And we believe that everyone should be very, very cautious with nuclear rhetoric,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including from AFP, on Monday.",
    "The row between Medvedev and Trump erupted against the backdrop of the US leader\u2019s ultimatum for Russia to end its military offensive in Ukraine or face fresh economic sanctions, including on its remaining trading partners.",
    "Medvedev - one of Russia\u2019s most prominent anti-Western hawks - accused Trump of \u201cplaying the ultimatum game\u201d and said that Trump \u201cshould remember\u201d that Russia was a formidable force.",
    "\u201cEach new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,\u201d he said.",
    "Medvedev, who has not posted on social media since the spat, is currently the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council.",
    "He served one term as president from 2008 to 2012, effectively acting as a placeholder for Putin, who was able to circumvent constitutional term limits and de facto remain in power.",
    "The chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday backed Trump\u2019s actions.",
    "\u201cThe concept of peace through strength works,\u201d Andriy Yermak wrote on social media.",
    "\u201cThe moment American nuclear submarines appeared, one Russian drunk - who had just been threatening nuclear war on X - suddenly went silent.\u201d"
