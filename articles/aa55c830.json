    "The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) in collaboration with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) hosted several impactful teacher training programs for teachers of the established 100 Capital Market Clubs across the country. These teacher training programs were conducted in all three languages from the 13th March to 4th of April at teacher training centers across the nine provinces of country.",
    "The \u2018Capital Market Club\u2019 program is a strategic initiative designed in collaboration with the Presidential Secretariat and the Ministry of Education as well, aimed at fostering financial literacy throughout the education system of Sri Lanka.",
    "The teacher training programs work as the initial step towards equipping the teachers overseeing the hundred capital market clubs with the crucial knowledge necessary to impart on students, so they may emerge as informed investors. The teachers were given a complete workshop, educating them on the regulatory environment, the stock market, the range of available capital market products as well as unit trusts.",
    "By bridging the gap between theoretical instruction and practical experience, this project seeks to empower students with a profound understanding of investment dynamics and the workings of the capital market. For this purpose, the SEC and CSE have created a carefully curated activity plan for the capital market club students, which the teachers were briefed on.",
    "One such activity is an inter-school quiz competition. The event is scheduled to take place in June later this year and expected to attract teams representing each of the capital market clubs across the 100 schools they are established in. Another activity expected to engage the club\u2019s students is a \u2018Virtual Stock Market Game\u2019, where the winners of the activity will receive the opportunity to visit Singapore, as expressed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
