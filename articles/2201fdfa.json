  "original_body_lines": [
    "The highest court in India has strongly criticised the country\u2019s aviation authorities for their handling of the aftermath of the Air India plane crash that killed 261 people in June.",
    "Leaving only one survivor, the flight bound for Gatwick airport from Ahmedabad crashed shortly after taking off, killing 242 passengers on board and 19 others on the ground.",
    "The court said it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d for the aviation authority to suggest, through leaks to the media, that pilot error had caused the disaster.",
    "It called on Indian prime minister Narendra Modi for the government\u2019s response before it rules on a case filed by activists demanding an independent investigation.",
    "The court said the way the aviation body released its preliminary report in to the Boeing Dreamliner\u2019s crash was \u201cselective and piecemeal\u201d.",
    "The preliminary report, published by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off.",
    "The report also said one of the pilots was heard asking the other \u201cwhy did he cut off\u201d in a cockpit voice recording, with another pilot responding that he did not do so.",
    "The recording doesn\u2019t clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.",
    "But the findings of the report have been challenged by aviation safety group Safety Matters Foundation, which is calling for an independent investigation into the crash.",
    "In a court hearing overseeing the aviation safety group\u2019s petition, one of India\u2019s Supreme Court judges said that suggestions that the pilots deliberately shut off fuel supply were \u201cvery unfortunate and irresponsible\u201d.",
    "The crash has left many questioning the safety of India\u2019s airspace.",
    "The chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has defended the safety record of the country, telling the BBC in July that \u201cIndia\u2019s skies have always been safe\u201d.",
    "That same month, the DGCA uncovered 51 safety violations at Air India in the preceding year, as part of its annual audit of the country\u2019s airlines.",
    "The families of four passengers who died on the plane filed a lawsuit in the US against planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing the companies of negligence.",
    "The lawsuit accused the companies of doing \u201cnothing\u201d despite being aware of the risks of the aircraft\u2019s design."
