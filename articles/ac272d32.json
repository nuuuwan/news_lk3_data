    "The STIHL Tea Pruner Machine is designed specifically for tea plantations and is used to trim tea bushes after the harvest, and the STIHL Tiller Machine can be used for several kinds of cultivation, such as vegetable gardens, paddy fields, and row crops. The tiller machine makes even the most challenging and labor-intensive groundwork simple, making it the ideal machine for small to medium-scale farmers and mixed-crop farmers.",
    "There aren\u2019t many vibrations when the worm gear drive is in use and the well-designed curved handlebar can be effortlessly adjusted to the individual body height for easy access to the tiller controls. With the assistance of one reverse gear, two forward gears, and intelligent weight distribution, farmers can operate the strong machine with less effort. Thanks to its operating width of 100 cm the tiller machine can effectively cultivate large areas of fields, plots, and plantations. Both machines have cutting-edge technologies installed to guarantee dependable and effective operation.",
