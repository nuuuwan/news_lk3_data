    "Colombo, June 11 (Daily Mirror) - The Consumer Affairs Authority's (CAA) General Workers\u2019 Association urged the public to exercise caution when purchasing chicken from the market due to the increased risk of contamination caused by recent floods.",
    "Association General Secretary Ajith Jayasundara informed the Daily Mirror that numerous poultry farms have been submerged, resulting in the deaths of many birds.",
    "\"The floodwater may carry various viruses, such as rat fever. These birds could have been infected by these viruses due to the floods. Additionally, a significant number of birds on poultry farms often die due to the spread of bacteria, which may have been carried into the floodwaters,\" he explained.",
    "Jayasundara mentioned that the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) conducted raids on several chicken-selling stalls and discovered chickens that had died due to the floods.",
    "\"In poultry farms, chicken typically displays a white colour in the skin after being prepared, with the heads removed and blood drained. However, chicken with a reddish colour in the skin could indicate that it was purchased after the floods,\" he stated.",
    "Jayasundara noted that their association had observed such red-coloured chicken in certain supermarkets and retail shops located in areas affected by flooding.",
    "Furthermore, he alleged that various animals were being sent for processing into meatballs and sausages. The Association is urging the CAA to promptly conduct raids on meat stalls."
