It is not illegal to serve like that because the fresh medical graduates can earn some money and experience before getting their licences. The medical graduates do not working as independent doctors, but under a registered doctor who is the responsible person," he said.

### Irish voters reject constitutional amendment about women’s role in home

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded defeat Saturday as two constitutional amendments he supported that would have broadened the definition of family and removed language about a woman’s role at home were headed toward rejection in early vote tallies.

Varadkar, who pushed the vote to enshrine gender equality in the constitution by removing “very old-fashioned language” and trying to recognize the realities of modern family life, said it was clear the amendments were “defeated comprehensively on a respectable turnout.”

“It was our responsibility to convince the majority of people to vote ‘yes’ and we clearly failed to do so,” Varadkar said.

Opponents argued that the wording of the changes was poorly thought out — an argument that appeared to have gained traction in the final days of the campaign. Voters said they were confused by the questions and others said they feared changes would lead to unintended consequences.

The Cabinet has rejected the Treasury's decision to cancel the free Lanka bus pass for parliamentary employees, citing economic constraints. Despite the Treasury's decision to cancel the pass due to economic reasons, the Cabinet has decided to continue providing the free bus pass to Parliament employees, deeming it more advantageous than using buses.

🟩

The Cabinet has rejected the Treasury's decision to cancel the free Lanka bus pass issued to parliamentary employees.

Considering the country's economic status, the Treasury decided to cancel the pass from the beginning of this year.

The government provides eight crores annually for the bus permit to the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

Treasury has informed parliament that this year cannot be allocated so much in accordance with the current economic situation in the country.

When we asked a parliamentary officer in this regard, he said that the Cabinet has decided to continue to provide free bus pass to Parliament employees.

He added that it is more advantageous to make such a license than to use buses in Parliament.

### Nuwan Thushara takes hat-trick in third Bangladesh T20I

*2024-03-09 17:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Nuwan-Thushara-takes-hat-trick-in-third-Bangladesh-T20I/108-278548) · `en`

Nuwan Thushara became the fifth Sri Lankan to take a hat-trick in T20I cricket, as he made early breakthroughs to cripple Bangladesh's run chase in the third T20I in Sylhet.

Thushara, bowling his first over in the series, removed Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy and Mahmadullah -- all deceived by his sling arm action -- to reduce the home team to 15 for 4, chasing a target of 175.

Thushara broke through Shanto's defence and castled the stumps with the second ball of the over, before uprooting the off stump to dismiss Hridoy on the next delivery.

He then completed the hat-trick of wickets when he trapped Mahmadullah leg before wicket, the decision being upheld despite the batsmen's review.

Thushara joins Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya and Wanindu Hasaranga as the only Sri Lankans to take a hat-trick in the T20I format.

In a report to the Human Rights Council, Türk said that the establishment and continuing expansion of settlements amount to the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into the territories that it occupies, which amounts to a war crime under international law.

### Australia’s Great Barrier Reef hit by mass coral bleaching

Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by a major coral bleaching event likely caused by heat stress built up over the summer at the biologically diverse site, a government agency has said.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), which monitors the reef’s health, said on Friday that the damage was “widespread” in at least two-thirds of the areas surveyed at the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The reef, a living organism, stretches some 2,300km (1,429 miles) off the northeastern coast of Australia and is considered one of the most species-rich habitats on earth. It is home to hundreds of coral, 1,500 fish species and 4,000 different molluscs.

Coral reefs are an important part of marine life as they house more than a quarter of all sea life on Earth, provide protection for coastal communities, and are natural carbon sinks. Climate change is the biggest threat to their survival because of their sensitivity to heat.
