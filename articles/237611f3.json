    "ECONOMYNEXT\u00a0 \u2014 Newly sworn-in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will be Sri Lanka\u2019s last executive president, a senior member of his party the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) said calling for public support in that regard.",
    "\u201cYou have elected today this country\u2019s last executive president,\u201d former MP and NPP front-liner Sunil Handunneththi said speaking to reporters outside the presidential secretariat in Colombo Monday September 23 morning.",
    "\u201cThere will be no more executive presidents henceforth. The president to abolish the executive president has been elected. We ask the people of the country to support that,\u201d he said.",
    "The parliament will also be dissolved, Handunneththi, after a cabinet of ministers has been appointed. The privately owned Daily Mirror reported Tuesday morning that parliament will be dissolved at midnight. NPP legislator Harini Amarasuriya is also reported to be sworn in as prime minister on Tuesday.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s election manifesto states on page 195: \u201cThe executive presidential system will be abolished, a aarliamentary system of government established, and a president without executive powers be appointed.\u201d",
    "However, this pledge was not a highlight of Dissanayake\u2019s presidential campaign, with other considerations such as fighting corruption taking centre stage. Abolishing the presidency was not a focal point and it is unclear whether his election is a clear endorsement of it. Regardless, abolishing Sri Lanka\u2019s all powerful executive presidential system would require a referendum.",
    "Nearly all presidential candidates going back to the mid 1990s have promised to abolish the presidency, but the pledge was never honoured. The closest Sri Lanka came to fulfilling this promise was during the 2015-2019 Yahapalana government under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that introduced the 19th amendment to the constitution which curtailed some of the more far-reaching powers of the office.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential system has been criticised by various quarters for its concentration of power in the office of a single individual. Its defenders, however, argue that a powerful president is needed for stability. (Colombo/Sep24/2024)"
