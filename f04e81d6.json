    "The Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court on Friday (Jan.12) imposed a travel ban on Mahinda Kodituwakku, the self-proclaimed \u2018Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva\u2019.",
    "Kodituwakku is accused of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings.",
    "He returned to Sri Lanka recently and was welcomed by his supporters at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) upon arrival.",
    "Earlier this week, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) seeking an investigation on the self-styled Bodhisattva.",
    "Alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community, Jinananda Thero claimed that he was directly involved with the recently deceased preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who had promoted \u2018mass suicide\u2019 through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide.",
    "Meanwhile, Ven. Balangoda Kassapa Thero, addressing a media briefing, claimed that this self-proclaimed \u2018Bodhisattva\u2019 had sexually abused his daughter before leaving his house while calling it \u2018Abinishkramanaya\u2019 (Great Departure).",
    "Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings on the path to becoming Buddhas but postpone reaching nirvana to help humanity."
