    "Claiming that those who are engaged in international trade have been severely hit due to the extended three-day bank holiday, former NPP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said today that the government was attempting to bankrupt the banking sector by creating uncertainty and doubt among the people, just like they have bankrupted the economy.",
    "He told a news conference that the government should take complete responsibility for the issues created in the financial sector and that this could create more issues than going for a haircut on domestic debt.",
    "\"The government broke the tradition of bank holidays being not declared for three days by gazetting June 30 as a bank holiday. Even bank heads are unaware why these bank holidays have been given. The matter on domestic debt restructuring has not been discussed with banking heads. It is reported that the President is planning to get the domestic debt restructuring done soon after returning from his French visit,' he said.",
    "Hadunnetti said risking the banking sector and creating financial instability would have more serious consequences in the future than today, adding that the impact on local industrialists and the business community would be severe than the impact it would have on individual account holders.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
