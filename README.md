### Relo condolences to Sampanthan's demise

*2024-07-02 14:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187483) · `ta`

The Tamil Eelam Liberation Movement mourns the loss of Rajavarodhayam Sambandan, a key figure in the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and advocate for Tamil political rights in Sri Lanka. His departure leaves a significant void in efforts towards achieving federal solutions for Tamils. Despite facing criticism and setbacks, including losing his parliamentary seat due to opposition to the 6th Amendment, Sambandan remained committed to Tamil causes, engaging internationally for recognition and rights. His contributions, especially after 2009, were pivotal in highlighting Tamil issues, despite challenges from both state leadership and within the Tamil community itself. Sambandan's legacy of fighting for Tamil political rights through democratic means will be remembered, marking a significant loss in the ongoing struggle for Tamil political autonomy in Sri Lanka.

🟩

The Tamil Eelam Liberation Movement expresses deepest sympathies to the demise of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the leader of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Trincomalee district parliamentarian Rajavarodhayam Sambandan.

The demise of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader and the leader of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Trincomalee parliamentarian Rajavarodayam Sambandan has created a huge gap on the journey of the political rights issue of the Tamil people.

Sampanthan has joined the line of late politicians such as Amirthalingam and Sivasidhambaram.

### Sri Lanka cabinet approves new feed-in tariffs for renewables

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved new feed-in tariffs for renewable power plants below 10 MegaWatts, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Roof top solar below 500 kiloWatts will be paid a flat rate of 27.06 a unit for 20 years.

The plants will get a 20-year flat rate and not a falling Tiered rate.

Sri Lanka’s feed-in tariffs for renewables, other than for bio mass plans which can be operated at any time of the day (dispatched) have been controversial due to administratively devised rates which are far above competitive rates in other jurisdictions.

The tariffs compare with 4.88 cents for a 50MW wind plant in Mannar.

Feed in tariffs were halted in favour of competitive bidding, but were brought back following heavy lobbying.  (Colombo/July02/2024)

### Will Ranil help in the 2024 election?

*2024-07-02 12:38:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187471) · `ta`

Given the detailed context you've provided, it seems you're discussing the political and economic challenges faced by Sri Lanka, particularly focusing on the role of Ranil Wickremesinghe in navigating these issues. Your narrative touches upon significant events such as the signing of loan agreements with Paris and Beijing, the impact of these agreements on Sri Lanka's economic stability, and the upcoming presidential elections where Wickremesinghe is expected to run.



To address the complexities involved in Ranil Wickremesinghe's potential candidacy and the challenges he faces, let's break down the key points:



1. **Economic Recovery and Debt Restructuring**: The agreements with Paris and Beijing mark a crucial step in Sri Lanka's journey towards economic recovery. However, the road ahead is long, requiring careful management and implementation of the agreed terms. Wickremesinghe's experience and leadership during previous economic crises position him uniquely to navigate these challenges.



2. **Presidential Election Dynamics**: The upcoming election is shaping up to be a contest of personalities and policies. Wickremesinghe's track record, especially in handling the current economic crisis, sets him apart from other contenders. His ability to lead during difficult times and his plans for economic revival are likely to be central themes in his campaign.



3. **Public Perception and Support**: Wickremesinghe's success in the election hinges on his ability to connect with the populace, particularly the impoverished majority whose lives have been significantly impacted by the economic crisis. His campaign must focus on tangible improvements in their living conditions and clear communication of his vision for Sri Lanka's economic future.



4. **Challenges and Criticisms**: While Wickremesinghe has demonstrated resilience and leadership, he must also address criticisms and challenges head-on. This includes ensuring that the benefits of the economic recovery plan trickle down to all segments of society, addressing the root causes of poverty, and managing expectations effectively.



5. **Strategic Campaigning**: For Wickremesinghe to secure victory, his campaign must emphasize his experience, leadership qualities, and a clear roadmap for economic recovery. Leveraging his past successes and addressing the current economic challenges directly will be crucial. Additionally, highlighting his commitment to transparency, accountability, and inclusivity can help build trust with voters.



In conclusion, Ranil Wickremesinghe's potential candidacy for the presidency of Sri Lanka is fraught with opportunities and challenges. His ability to steer the country through economic turmoil, coupled with a strategic campaign that addresses the needs and aspirations of the Sri Lankan people, will be pivotal in determining his electoral success.
