    "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is all set to host Afghanistan's one-day bilateral home series against Pakistan here next month, it is learned.",
    "According to well-placed sources in the Kabul-based Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB), SLC has been approached to allow to play three ODIs against Pakistan at one venue and it is also learnt that it has been agreed in principle by SLC to rent out its ground and the stadium.",
    "\"As Afghanistan does not have any stadium, playing in Sri Lanka will be a good preparation for the Asia Cup and the World Cup to follow soon after,\" the source revealed.",
    "\"We were also keen to host these matches in the UAE or Qatar, but it was not feasible considering the extreme heat of the climate there.\"",
    "The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) and the Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) have hosted Afghanistan's matches in the UAE and India in the past but considering the Indian government's possible denial to grant visas to the Pakistan players, India was not considered for this bilateral series, the sources said.",
    "The dates and one venue for the three ODI matches are likely to be finalized soon, and the support staff and the team members are believed to be advised to assemble in Sri Lanka on August 10 or 12.(Bipin Dani)"
