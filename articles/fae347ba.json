    "Colombo, Feb. 28 (Daily Mirror)- National People's Power (NPP) MP Harini Amarasuriya should bring in a private member's motion to repeal the Vagrants Ordinance of 1841 under which prostitution is banned in Sri Lanka, former MP Hirunika Premachandra said today.",
    "\"Amarasuriya did mention that decriminalising prostitution in Sri Lanka is some thing that will be included in her party's manifesto. They don't have to wait till they come to power to do it. This is because she could easily bring in a private member's motion to repeal the Vagrants' Ordinance of 1841 under which prostitution is banned here,\" Premachandra said.",
    "\"You don't have to include such pledges in your party manifesto. However, you can prove your genuineness by briniging in a private member's motion,\" she added.",
    "\"The Vagrant's Ordinance was introduced in Sri Lanka during the British rule. This law was imposed to control the behaviour of the people. However, even women who are not prostitues are dragged by the police today,\" she also said."
