  "original_body_lines": [
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) leader Dullas Alahapperuma said that poverty reduction programms such as Samurdhi Development and Janasaviya Poverty Alleviation Programme were launched for political purposes, therefore their targets could not be reached.",
    "Addressing the media, he said these matters should be corrected.",
    "However, the country is currently talking about a new programme 'Aswesuma' which is to be launched by the government, and strong objections are emerging against the programme, he said.",
    "But it is doubtful whether the 'Aswesuma' Welfare Benefit Programme which the government is hoping to launch, is directly targeting people who are below the poverty line. A discussion in this regard was held recently in Parliament. Ministers from the government side expressed their views.",
    "Currently, the people of the country are suffering from three fears; the fear of hunger has become the most critical for the people in the country. The present government does not have a backspace button, and they believe what they think is correct. This government does not listen to anyone and is not sensitive.",
    "This is a common problem for the whole government, from the president to all those in the government.",
    "Therefore, FPC leader Dullas Alahapperuma requested the government be sensitive because people engage in these protests out of hunger. They cannot bear it. Therefore, the fear of hunger covers the whole country.",
    "With the poverty of the people, this Aswesuma programme will definitely fail, and this Aswesuma programm will be a 'Pas Vesuma Programme' (covering with earth). (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
