    "A new partnership between Spa Ceylon, \u2018All About That Reef\u2019 and Scope Cinemas has set a precedent for how Sri Lanka\u2019s private sector can leverage collaboration, brand influence and cultural platforms to drive environmental action. The initiative brought the globally acclaimed \u2018OCEAN with David Attenborough\u2019 documentary to Sri Lankan audiences this week through a series of free public screenings at Scope Cinema Multiplex, Havelock City Mall.",
    "The screenings, held on September 30, were more than just a cinematic showcase. They symbolized how corporate responsibility, conservation advocacy and entertainment can converge to build awareness of ocean conservation while strengthening brand equity in a market where consumers are increasingly demanding sustainable practices.",
    "Spa Ceylon, the world\u2019s largest Luxury Ayurveda chain, with over 140 stores across 33 countries, has long embedded sustainability into its brand ethos. Its products are ethically sourced and cruelty-free, and the company has built a global reputation by linking luxury wellness to responsible consumption.",
    "\u201cOceans sustain over three billion people globally, yet face unprecedented threats from climate change, pollution, and human activity, said Shalin Balasuriya, Co-Founder and Group Director of Spa Ceylon. \u201cAs a responsible global brand, we believe marine conservation is a shared responsibility that transcends borders. This initiative is a small but meaningful step towards safeguarding our oceans.\u201d",
    "For Spa Ceylon, aligning with a conservation-themed film narrated by David Attenborough is a strategic reinforcement of its image as a socially conscious luxury brand. By investing in the screenings, the company effectively positioned itself as a leader in linking consumer wellness to planetary well-being.",
    "Marine conservation initiative, \u2018All About That Reef\u2019 brought its outreach expertise to the project, underscoring how narrative-driven engagement can inspire public responsibility.",
    "Founder Aindri Morahela emphasized that Sri Lanka\u2019s recent move to establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in international waters highlights what can be achieved through collective action. \u201cScreenings like this remind us that every effort\u2014whether protecting, educating or simply sharing knowledge\u2014contributes to something far greater, she said.",
    "The collaboration demonstrates how conservation groups can expand their reach by forming alliances with consumer-facing companies and entertainment providers.",
    "For Scope Cinemas, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading cinema chain, the screenings showcased the business potential of expanding beyond entertainment into social impact.",
    "Executive Chairman Naveen Cader explained, \u201cCollaboration is the key to creating lasting impact. By working with Spa Ceylon and \u2018All About That Reef\u2019, we\u2019ve shown that cinema can unite communities, spark important conversations and drive positive change.\u201d",
    "The initiative strengthens Scope Cinemas\u2019 reputation as a cultural influencer while tapping into a growing audience base that values sustainability-driven content. For the entertainment sector, such partnerships demonstrate how film can become a tool for both education and brand differentiation.",
    "From a business lens, the collaboration illustrates how the triple bottom line\u2014people, planet and profit\u2014can be operationalized. Spa Ceylon gains brand visibility while reinforcing its environmental commitments. Scope Cinemas broadens its influence beyond entertainment. \u2018All About That Reef\u2019 amplifies conservation advocacy with the reach of private sector partners.",
