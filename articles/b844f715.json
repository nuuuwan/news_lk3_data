  "original_body_lines": [
    "Emphasises historical loyalty of Muslims in Sri Lanka to country\u2019s rulers",
    "Warns that Gota\u2019s claims could distort historical facts and create false impressions for future generations",
    "Asserts that Gota\u2019s claim of minority groups including Muslims of conspiring against him are baseless",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Kabir Hashim in Parliament last week called on former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to withdraw the allegation made in his book \u201cThe Conspiracy\u201d, where he accused minority groups in the country, including Muslims, Tamils, and Catholics, of plotting to force him out of office.",
    "Hashim said Rajapaksa must foremostly study history. He said Muslims in Sri Lanka have never betrayed Sinhala Buddhist Kings or rulers of the past and have always worked to protect them.",
    "Hashim cited historical instances, recounting the story of a woman named Fathima from a village in Mahiyanganaya. He recounted how she sheltered Sri Vikrama Rajasinha when the British were searching for him, hiding him inside the hollow of a tree. He said despite the threat of execution by the British, she remained steadfast and did not betray him which eventually led to her death.",
    "The MP noted that in recent times, Muslim Moulavis have travelled to Geneva to address the UNHRC against the war crimes allegations against Sri Lanka. He highlighted that Muslim nations voted in support of Sri Lanka at the UNHRC without imposing any conditions.",
    "Hashim emphasised that Rajapaksa\u2019s claim could potentially mislead and create a false impression if left uncorrected, affecting perceptions in the future. He stressed the importance of rectifying such statements.",
    "Hashim said Rapaksa is putting on an act to cover up the wrongs he committed against the country. \u201cThis is a lie, a myth. How can minorities oust him?\u201d Hashim asked.",
    "The MP accused Rajapaksa of attempting to gain power in 2019 through both legitimate and illegitimate means. He highlighted that this suspicion persists due to the Government\u2019s failure to hold those responsible accountable. Instead, Rajapaksa is now accused of scapegoating minorities, the MP noted.",
    "The MP recalled Rajapaksa\u2019s engagement in divisive politics leading up to the polls in 2019, which fostered a belief among the majority that the minorities were to blame for the country\u2019s woes. Hashim noted that however, Rajapaksa\u2019s policy decisions led to the downfall of Sinhalese businessmen, farmers and others who then commenced the people\u2019s struggle against his rule who were later joined by the minorities.",
    "He noted that Rajapaksa was provided safety by The Maldives, a Muslim country when he was ousted.",
    "\u201cMuslims as a community did not work to oust Rajapaksa,\u201d he said. The MP said Rajapaksa was ousted due to karma for the actions carried out by him, such as forced cremations of Muslims.",
    "\u201cIt cannot be accepted that anyone conspired to oust him. If any mistake was made in the book it must be corrected or it will go down in history incorrectly,\u201d the MP urged."
