    "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya told Parliament last week that the Government remains committed to upholding human rights and deliberately avoids narratives that foster division, hatred, or violence.",
    "\u201cAs the new Government in Sri Lanka, we are committed to ensuring the protection of all people,\u201d the Prime Minister said on Friday, responding to a question raised by MP S. Shritharan. \u201cWe are always willing to listen, correct ourselves, and be responsive for public sentiment.\u201d",
    "Dr. Amarasuriya underscored that all citizens were entitled to equal dignity and respect, without exception. She said the Government aimed to promote unity, empathy, and accountability as part of its broader commitment to human rights.",
    "\u201cWe can see how easily institutions can be dismantled or weakened if that culture of respect for human rights is not something that is normalised or accepted within a society. We have consciously tried to avoid narratives that sow the seeds of division, hatred, or violence,\u201d she said.",
    "The Prime Minister added that the administration, from the President downwards, had maintained this position consistently. \u201cWe have stood by our pledge not to resort to racism or to provoke violence and hatred as a means of survival or maintaining power. This is an important shift that we need to acknowledge,\u201d she said.",
    "Dr. Amarasuriya also stressed the importance of public engagement in governance, noting that the Government was prepared to provide space for consultation and to respond to public concerns."
