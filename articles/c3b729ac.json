    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday sent a reminder to the Speaker of Parliament, who also serves as the Chairman of the Constitutional Council, regarding the long-pending appointment of the Chairman of the Right to Information (RTI) Commission.",
    "The BASL highlighted that the position has remained vacant for a considerable period and urged the Speaker to take serious cognisance of the matter and nominate the remaining member needed to fully constitute the RTI Commission.",
    "The BASL expressed confidence that the Constitutional Council would be mindful of the public trust reposed in it, and that it would make an appropriate and widely acceptable recommendation to fill the remaining vacancy. On 28 May 2025, the BASL highlighted that since the resignation of Retired Supreme Court Judge Upali Abeyratne on 9 March 2025, no appointment has been made to fill the post. The Chairperson\u2019s role, as outlined in the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016, is pivotal to the Commission\u2019s effective operation and its mandate to safeguard the public\u2019s right to access information.",
    "\u201cThe absence of a chairperson hampers the Commission\u2019s ability to operate efficiently and discharge its duties,\u201d the BASL letter stated, highlighting the national significance of ensuring a fully functioning RTI Commission.",
    "The BASL\u2019s letter was signed by its President Rajeev Amarasuriya and Secretary Chathura Galhena."
