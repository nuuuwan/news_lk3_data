    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka legislators have raised questions about the net present value hit on the Employment Provident Fund from a domestic debt re-structure given the lack of disclosure on its investments by its management, in a parliamentary debate.",
    "Opposition legislator M A Sumanthiran said in parliament that the EPF did not disclose the purchase price, face value and market price of each investment, which was required under its law.",
    "Related  Sri Lanka central bank, EPF slammed over governance, mis-disclosure amid DDR",
    "However, details on Sri Lanka\u2019s government\u2019s outstanding securities and other debt have been published for the benefit of foreign creditors, he said.",
    "\u201cThanks to that publication, we can tell you that we are able to tell you the return on the entire Treasury bond holdings of the government today is 13.52 percent,\u201d opposition legislator M A Sumanthiran told parliament in a debate over the debt restructure plan.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s our calculation. What are you assuring the EPF? 9.1 percent.\u201d",
    "According to a debt restructure plan unveiled last week, the maturity of EPF\u2019s existing debt will be extended till 2038 with maturities beginning from 2027.",
    "Central bank and Treasury officials as well as politicians are walking a tight rope trying to protect the banking sector and also meet IMF targets to get out sovereign default.",
    "The maturity extension of bonds is required to meet deficit financing and roll-over ceiling set by the International Monetary Fund (Gross Financing Need) which is said to make the country\u2019s debt \u2018sustainable.\u2019",
    "When the maturity, and as a result coupon is changed, there can be a change to the net present value of the portfolio, depending on the discount rate applied. A low market interest rate or discount rate will reduce losses or create profits, while a high rate will show a loss.",
    "\u201cWe have repeatedly asked the central bank to share with us the net present value loss to the EPF, but they have not given to us, but it is easily calculable,\u201d Sumanthiran, who has commented on the Committee on Public Finance said.",
    "\u201cI am saying with responsibility that the net present value as at today, if you take the net present value today, the loss to EPF holders will be 47 percent,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSince the EPF is the single largest holder of government bonds, over 40 percent, we can expect the EPF to have the same overall yield as the stock of government bonds which will has a yield of 13.52 percent.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn this debt re-structure the government is proposing to limit the yield to 9.1 percent for 16 years.\u201d",
    "Based on the assumption of the average yield, the EPF would grow from 3 trillion today to 27 trillion by 2038, even if no new funds were contributed by members, he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s interest rate fluctuates wildly due to rate cuts of the central bank which are enforced by liquidity injections when the economy and private credit recovers from previous currency crises, analysts have said.",
    "Such rate cuts, usually enforced by purchasing bills and bonds outright or term from the market or at auctions or through reverse repo operations, trigger forex shortages, depreciation, flight of rupee bond holders, which require very high rates to correct and restore confidence in the currency.",
    "Money has been printed through multiple tools in recent years, to close a perceived \u2018potential output\u2019 gap under so-called flexible inflation targeting/flexible exchange rate.",
    "In the decades past money has been printed by economists or economic bureaucrats in the central bank and Treasury to keep down Treasury bill yields or to re-finance rural credit or both, analysts say.",
    "Immediately after a currency crisis however, rates fall naturally as private credit contracts, and fuel is market priced even if deficits go up in the stabilization year due to a hit on consumption and knee jerk import restrictions which follow the initial rate cuts and slow tax collections.",
    "Re-investment investments yields however are based on assumptions which may, or may not be the actual.",
    "Opposition legislator Harsha de Silva commented on the Sumanthiran\u2019s projection explaining that it implied a 470,000 rupee loss for every million rupees.",
    "\u201cWe asked the EPF to please give us the calculation,\u201d de Silva who heads the parliament\u2019s Committee on Public Finance said.",
    "\u201cThe head of the EPF said he saw this (DDR plan) on facebook. When we questioned the Monetary Board (the governing body of the central bank and EPF), they said they did not give any special advance notice to the EPF because all creditors were treated equally.",
    "\u201cThis potential loss to the EPF, which is shown by various calculations should be made known to the parliament.\u201d",
    "Following the approval of the DDR by the parliament, the proposal would be made known to the EPF and the ETF on July 04, he said.",
    "\u201cThey have 21 days to respond. It is only on July 25 that they will say whether or not they agree to the plan. Within that period, the parliament should discuss it.\u201d",
    "In most countries central banks have become the SOE with unusual powers, by-passing parliament, especially after the Bank of England was nationalized in 1946.",
    "The private Bank of England die not dare to impose exchange controls on the people after printing money, though it suspended convertibility several times after triggering external trouble (effectively gold shortages).",
    "In countries where the central bank is blocked form denying monetary stability by the parliament or they are run by officials including finance ministers, who do not believe in stimulus (macro-economic policy), long-term rates inflation tends to be low and the countries grow steadily.",
    "In Sri Lanka, bond yields tend to fall after a float succeeds and the rupee is re-pegged after a currency crisis originally triggered by rate cuts, as banks and other buy into them.",
    "But due to a flaw in the IMF\u2019s default workout framework where a cut-off date for DDR is not declared early many investors stayed away from bonds in 2022 sending yields to historic heights.",
    "Sri Lanka recently overcame the flaw \u2013 in a tactic that the IMF can perhaps adopt in other countries with reserve collecting central banks with flexible inflation targeting that default \u2013 by excluding bills from restructure and halting bond auctions.",
    "Whether or not the EPF will actually make a nominal or real loss depends on future inflation which will come from how much of monetary stability is denied by the central bank, analysts say.",
    "If monetary stability is not denied the manipulation of interest rates with liquidity injections, the exchange rate will be stable and inflation will be low, analysts say.",
    "De Silva said when the EPF was set up originally (during the gold standard), inflation was low/",
    "\u201cWe questioned in the CoPF whether the 9.1 percent return can be legislated. That is not an unfair request.\u201d",
    "When the EPF was set up in 1958, its law specified a 2.5 percent return, de Silva said.",
    "\u201cIn the five years before, interest rates were around 1 percent,\u201d de Silva said. \u2018Inflation varied between plus or minus half a percent. So that was not unfair.",
    "At the time Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank was constrained by two complementary anchors; an exchange rate target, and a gold target independently though it was starting to create forex shortages. The Fed was also constrained by a gold target.",
    "Under the tighter monetary standard and more or less fixed exchange rates, sovereign defaults were rare and debt to GDP ratio was lower. Under the currency board Sri Lanka\u2019s debt to GDP ratio was below 20 percent.",
    "After exceptional monetary instability under flexible dual anchor policies and depreciating of the currency, interest is the biggest component of state spending after salaries.",
    "Western central banks started to operate aggressive \u2018macro-economic policies\u2019 denying monetary stability especially during the 1960s. Anglophone nacro-economists claimed that there was a trade off between growth and inflation, among other econometric formulae, legitimizing instability.",
    "In 1971, the Bretton Woods collapsed and Sri Lanka closed the economy, in part using exchange controls and a 1969 law on import controls.",
    "An epidemic of sovereign defaults started in the 1980s, about 10 years after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, among countries with reserve-collecting central banks that used aggressive open market operations (anchor conflicts).",
    "The current default wave is also coming in the wake of bad money from Fed\u2019s ultra low rates in the run up to and after the \u2018housing bubble\u2019 which ended in extended quantity easing.",
    "RELATED Sri Lanka\u2019s collapse in new sovereign default wave is not really China\u2019s fault: Bellwether",
    "Germany, Japan and France (after 1960) rejected the ideology. Fast growing exchange rate targeting East Asian nations also rejected macro-economic policies even after the collapse of Bretton Woods setting the stage for fast growth in the 1980 and 1990s in the Great Moderation period.",
    "Legislators themselves have the power to block any central bank from denying monetary stability either by legally barring the agency from running an operational framework involving dual anchor conflicts, including by not rubber stamping a 4-6 percent inflation target, critics say. \u00a0(Colombo/July02/2023)"
