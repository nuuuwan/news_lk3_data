    "Sri Lanka has achieved much in the solar energy industry sphere. However, the challenges lie ahead, said Prof. Asanka Rodrigo, electrical engineering expert from the University of Moratuwa. \u2018As the country moves towards a future powered by renewable energy, smart technologies and innovative solutions will be key to ensuring that solar power plays a central role in its energy transition, he explained.",
    "\u2018With a commitment to sustainability and collaboration between academia, industry, and government, Sri Lanka is well on its way to a brighter, greener future, Rodrigo said.",
    "Speaking at the merger which took place at the Hilton Residences in Colombo, last week, between EPPC and SunGro, two leading brands in the solar industry, Rodrigo, a long-time academic and industry expert, stressed Sri Lanka\u2019s growing commitment to renewable energy, particularly solar power and outlined the country\u2019s ambitious targets for the future.",
    "Rodrigo added: \u2018Sri Lanka has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with a firm goal of sourcing 70% of its energy from renewable resources by 2030. Solar energy is a central part of this transition. There has been significant growth in solar power generation over the past decade.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial solar power generation began modestly with off-grid systems in the 1980s. The introduction of the \u201cmid-metering\u201d scheme in 2009 marked the beginning of a rapid expansion in the industry. By 2016, Sri Lanka had only achieved 30 MW of solar capacity, but government initiatives, such as the \u201cSurya Bala Sangramaya,\u201d accelerated this growth. Targets of 200 MW by 2020 and 1,000 MW by 2025 were set and Sri Lanka has already surpassed these milestones, achieving 1 GW of solar capacity by July 2024.",
    "\u2018The next phase of growth would be far more ambitious. By 2030, Sri Lanka aims to have 4,700 MW of solar power, more than four times its current capacity. This would require an annual increase of 500\u2013600 MW, which, while challenging, is achievable if the industry continues to grow at its current pace.",
    "\u2018To meet this target, the solar sector will need to diversify and expand in three main areas:",
    "\u2018Solar rooftops: A growing segment in the residential and commercial sectors.",
    "\u2018Ground-mounted projects: Large-scale installations producing 50 MW, 100 MW, or more, with some projects even aiming for 700 MW.",
    "\u2018Floating solar projects: An emerging field, with pilot projects already underway in Hambantota, utilizing underused lakes and reservoirs.",
    "\u2018Standards such as BS 7671 and IEC have adapted to these changes. The new generation of solar installations must consider complexities like multidirectional power flow, battery storage, electric vehicle (EV) chargers and advanced communication systems. Additionally, hybrid systems combining solar power with battery banks and grid connectivity are becoming more common and inverters are being classified as grid-forming or grid-following, reflecting their increasing complexity.",
    "\u2018As solar energy systems become more integrated with the grid, new protection mechanisms are required to ensure safety and efficiency. For instance, anti-islanding protections, low voltage ride-through (LVRT) and other fault response technologies are essential to maintain grid stability.",
    "\u2018Proper planning and technical expertise is essential in meeting Sri Lanka\u2019s ambitious solar targets. While the challenges are significant, advancements in technology, coupled with government support and industry collaboration, can help the country achieve its renewable energy goals and create a more sustainable future.\u2019",
    "From E.B. Creasy Solar were S.D.R Arudpragasam, chairman, Sanjeev Rajaratnam, Managing Director, Isuru Lekamge, Chief Operating Officer, Eksath de Alwis, Sales Manager and Howard Fu, Director of SUNGROW Power Supply Co., Ltd was also in attendance with the SUNGROW team.",
    "The event also saw the participation of key figures from Sri Lanka\u2019s energy industry, including, Ranjith Sepala, chairman, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Nalinda Ilangakoon, chairman, Ceylon Electricity Board. Additionally, SLSEA-registered solar PV service providers were present, to mark this significant milestone for the industry.",
