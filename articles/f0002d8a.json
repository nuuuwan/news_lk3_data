    "Colombo, March 21 (Daily Mirror) - Running counter to the statement by the Health Ministry regarding the return of migrated doctors to Sri Lanka, recent statistics paint a different picture, revealing only a meagre five specialists have returned to the country this year.",
    "The assertion initially made by Deputy Director General (Medical Services) Dr. G. Wijesuriya failed to produce the statistics and thus met with skepticism, especially considering the stark reality depicted by the data.",
    "Dr. Wijesuriya, who found himself in hot water over the statement, claimed a reversal in the trend of doctors, particularly those pursuing postgraduate training abroad, choosing not to return to Sri Lanka. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not in alarming numbers, the migrated doctors have started to return to the country,\u201d",
    "However, the actual figures present a stark contrast. Among the handful of specialists who have returned include a Gynaecologist (VOG), Surgeon, Anaesthetist, Pediatrician, and Ophthalmologist, indicating a minor shift rather than a substantial return.",
    "Commenting on the situation, President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA). Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama opined that returning five specialists cannot be considered as a positive improvement given the staggering number of doctors who migrated last year.",
    "As per the statistics, a total of close to 450 specialists have migrated since the latter part of 2022 with another 785 specialists set to go overseas for training.",
    "Meanwhile, Dr. Ashoka Gunaratne, the media spokesman for the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), raised concerns over the escalating migration of medical professionals, asserting that they had not noticed such a trend of specialists returning to the country.",
    "He also charged that the health Ministry cannot make such blank statements over such a critical matter without producing clear-cut figures."
