    "In a letter addressed to the President, the HRCSL recognized the well-established human right to truth under international law, emphasizing its crucial role in transitional justice.",

    "1) Without delay, a high-level committee should be set up under the Presidential Secretariat, comprising pertinent experts and representatives from victim groups and civil society. The primary responsibility of this committee is to oversee the implementation of all positive recommendations from prior truth-seeking mechanisms, including the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).",
    "2) Programmes that inform the country as a whole about the findings of previous truth-seeking mechanisms should be carried out.",
