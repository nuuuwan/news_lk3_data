    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) lawyer Harshana Nanayakkara yesterday filed a petition before the Supreme Court, requesting the apex court to issue an order preventing the Constitutional Council from approving Deshabandu Tennekoon\u2019s name as the Inspector General of Police (IGP).",
    "The petitioner in his application noted that the Presidential Commission tasked with investigating the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings has uncovered substantial negligence or omissions on the part of Government officials and police officers, including Deshbandu Tennakoon and recommended disciplinary action against them.",
    "Additionally, the petitioner contends that Deshbandu Tennakoon, despite having considerable police authority and access to emergency regulations, neglected to utilise his powers to thwart the group\u2019s assault on unarmed citizens at Galle Face Green, facing the Presidential Secretariat.",
    "He also maintained that as of 16 May 2022, the Attorney General\u2019s Department has identified senior Deputy Inspector General of Police Tennakoon as a person involved in the incidents that transpired on 9 May 2022 and put forth recommendations for a thorough investigation into his role in the matter.",
    "Furthermore, the petitioner highlighted that by 30 May 2022, the Attorney General\u2019s Department had suggested an accelerated criminal investigation into Tennakoon\u2019s behaviour. The petitioner emphasised that the Supreme Court recently ruled that the respondents, including the current Acting Inspector General of Police Deshbandu Tennakoon, had violated the fundamental rights of an ex-serviceman. The violations included freedom from torture, illegal arrests, and arbitrary administrative actions that deprived the victim of equal protection under the law, the petitioner noted.",
    "Considering the aforementioned circumstances, the petitioner underscores that bestowing additional responsibilities and powers upon Deshbandu Tennakoon while he continues to hold the position of Inspector General of Police is deemed arbitrary and irrational. He said such actions are asserted to be detrimental to the right to security of the citizens of Sri Lanka."
