When an easy path is available and when the Indians and Sri Lankans both are linked to a common goal, why move on complicated routes?

The recent statements by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar (37 minutes long) on Kachchatheevu created a sensation in India and Sri Lanka, especially regarding what would be their short- and long-term repercussions. Quotes such as “every Indian” is angered as PM Modi said, and India needing to sit down and work out a solution, declared by Minister Dr. Subramaniam Jashankar, insinuated the heartburn and the potential for follow-up action in Indian power-houses.

### Decline: Why Ranil and Sajith ain’t no JR and Premadasa

*2024-04-11 05:35:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Decline-Why-Ranil-and-Sajith-ain-t-no-JR-and-Premadasa/4-760584) · `en`

Having watched recent TV performances by JVP leaders and NPP’s Dr. Harini Amarasuriya’s charming admission that though she reads Marx she is not a Marxist-Leninist nor is the leftist NPP, the SJB’s shadow finance minister Dr. Harsha de Silva experienced a “gotcha moment”. He exclaimed that this revealed a hugely problematic gap, and referring to the JVP’s admissions, challenged: “who can say they ‘love Marx’ and go to the IMF? No one does that! Tell me one country that does?” harsha de silva vcut (youtube.com)

The obvious answer is Ceylon/Sri Lanka and Dr. N.M. Perera, Minister of Finance, whose first visit to the IMF was in 1970. He was the Marxist leader of the country’s oldest and largest Marxist party. The IMF and World Bank engagement under his stewardship was critiqued by two widely-read books of the day, Cheryl Payer’s The Debt Trap and Teresa Hayter’s Aid as Imperialism.

### The Falcon and Falconer

*2024-04-11 05:24:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-Falcon-and-Falconer/4-760583) · `en`

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.

“The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.”

It is showdown time. I borrowed the caption from the ‘The Second Coming’ by W.B. Yeats. Things fall apart and the centre cannot hold. Passionate intensity dictates debate.

The next election, Presidential or Parliamentary will be a ‘head-to-head’ encounter between the ‘dominant’ and the ‘dominated.’

Despite polls and engineered parades, the dismantling of the hegemony of the dominant class is not a certainty. Since hope is not optimism, I would say that it is a near certainty.

The Bastille will be breached. If not totally, substantially. 2024 is the year when people of Sri Lanka will prove Heraclitus right. “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.”

### Fitch affirms Construction Guarantee Fund’s ‘BB’ National IFS Rating; Outlook Stable

Fitch Ratings said it has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Construction Guarantee Fund’s (CGF) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating of ‘BB(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable.

Weak Operating Conditions: CGF’s performance exhibits a strong correlation with Government construction activity, as the company offers guarantees and related services to small- and medium-sized contractors involved in Government projects. The Government’s weak fiscal position has resulted in fewer new construction contracts, the suspension of existing projects and payment delays to contractors. This has affected CGF through a drop in premium income and a higher risk of claims by employers.

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror) - As temperatures soar in parts of Sri Lanka, authorities warn of an impending rise in the heat index, particularly in regions spanning the Northern, Western, Sabaragamuwa and North-Western provinces and the Anuradhapura, Galle and Matara districts.

The heat index, a measure of how hot it feels to the human body when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature, is anticipated to escalate to levels classified as 'Caution' levels.

According to the heat advisory issued, the 'Caution Level' was expected only in 15 districts, which included the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavunia, Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Kegalle, Colombo, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Galle and Matara districts.

This poses potential health risks, especially to vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

### World Athletics introduces $50,000 prize money for Olympic gold medallists

*2024-04-10 20:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/World-Athletics-introduces-50-000-prize-money-for-Olympic-gold-medallists/107-280573) · `en`

Paris, April 10 (The Guardian) - Sebastian Coe has defended World Athletics’ decision to break with 128 years of Olympic tradition by becoming the first sport to give athletes prize money if they are victorious in Paris this summer.

Coe said the surprise move, under which gold medal-winning athletes in each of the sport’s 48 events will walk away with $50,000 (£39,360), was merely a reflection that the world has changed and said it was time his sport gave more to its stars.

However the decision clearly blindsided the International Olympic Committee, which has never awarded money for participating or winning a medal, as it believes that to compete at a Games is reward enough.

Asked whether the announcement would violate the Olympic spirit, Coe was clear. “I don’t think it does,” he replied.

Currently cargo ships arriving in Sri Lanka must declare the cargo upon their arrival in territorial waters.

“We plan on getting cargo information 48 hours before the departure of the ship from the foreign port,” Silva said. “That way it is faster for us to do our homework.”

“This way we can do the risk assessment and see if it’s low risk, medium risk or high risk.”

Sri Lanka Customs can then start the process of authorization and documentation before the ship arrives in Sri Lankan territorial waters.

Prior cargo declaration begins from April, and piloting of pre-arrival processing is set to start on May 1.

### Tamils in the presidential election must prove democratic strength - Sabah Kukadas

*2024-04-10 15:50:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180868) · `ta`

Sabah Kukadas emphasizes the need for Tamils to demonstrate democratic strength in the presidential election, highlighting the importance of unity and strategic decision-making to avoid chauvinism leading to racism.

🟩

Relo's leadership committee member Saba Kukadas said that after the war silence, the people's basic aspirations were not revealed for 15 years after the war.

It is not easy to make a conclusion in other elections.

In the past, the presidential elections have not been racially advantageous but they must unite in the aftermath of the war, but it is imperative that all political parties and civil organizations in the Tamil homeland must unite in the same site to implement this.

The decisions of Tamils must be tactically beyond criticism that chauvinism can turn communalism into racism.

Whatever the decisions of the Tamils in the past, the South has turned it into communalism, for example, the separatism is the reality of separatism.

It is therefore stated that the aspirations of the ethnicity will be made in the international arena and the political liberation of the Tamil people in the international arena and the global regional conversation of the global regional countries.

### Nobel-winning ‘God particle’ physicist Peter Higgs dies aged 94

British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle – the so-called Higgs boson – jointly earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday.

“He passed away peacefully at home on Monday 8 April following a short illness,” the Scottish university, where he had been a professor for nearly five decades, said in a statement.

It called him “a great teacher and mentor, inspiring generations of young scientists”.

“His family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time,” the university added.

Higgs used ground-breaking theoretical work to help explain how the Universe has mass, thus resolving one of the greatest puzzles in physics and earning him a place alongside Albert Einstein and Max Planck in textbooks.

His 1964 theory of a mass-giving particle, which became known as the Higgs boson or the “God particle”, won him and Belgian physicist Francois Englert the 2013 physics Nobel Prize.
