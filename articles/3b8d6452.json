We have entered an era of renaissance, where the aspirations of the people, which were suppressed by past rulers, are finally coming to the forefront.",

Another story is the defeat of the Asura Narakasura by Lord Vishnu. These significant events are remembered and honoured by Hindu devotees during this vibrant festival.",

The time has come for the Sri Lankan nation, which has faced attempts at division and weakening, to stand undivided and strong.
