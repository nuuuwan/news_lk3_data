    "A dramatic and unprecedented surge in hoax bomb threats targeting Indian airlines is wreaking havoc on flight schedules, diverting planes and causing widespread disruptions.",
    "A video posted on social media last week showed passengers draped in woollens, walking down the icy ladder of an Air India plane into the frigid air of Iqaluit, a remote city in Canada.",
    "The 211 passengers on the Boeing 777, originally en route from Mumbai to Chicago, had been diverted early on 15 October due to a bomb threat.",
    "\u201cWe have been stuck at the airport since 5am with 200 passengers\u2026 We have no idea what\u2019s happening or what we are supposed to do next\u2026 We are completely stranded,\u201d Harit Sachdeva, a passenger, posted on social media. He praised the \u201ckind airport staff\u201d and alleged Air India was not doing enough to inform the passengers.",
    "Mr Sachdeva\u2019s post captured the frustration and anxiety of passengers diverted to an unknown, remote destination. Hours later, a Canadian Air Force plane ended their ordeal by ferrying the stranded passengers to Chicago. Air India confirmed that the flight had been diverted to Iqaluit due to a \u201csecurity threat posted online\u201d.",
    "The threat was false, mirroring scores of similar hoaxes targeting India\u2019s airlines so far this year. Last week alone\u00a0 there were at least 30 threats, resulting in diversions, cancellations and delays. In June, 41 airports received hoax bomb threats \u00a0via email in a single day, prompting heightened security.",
    "A Frankfurt-bound Vistara plane was diverted to Turkey after a bomb threat in September (BBC)",
    "For context, between 2014 and 2017, authorities recorded 120 bomb hoax alerts \u00a0at airports, with nearly half directed at Delhi and Mumbai, the country\u2019s largest airports. This underscores the recurring nature of such threats in recent years, but this year\u2019s surge has been sensational.",
    "\u201cI am deeply concerned over the recent disruptive acts targeting Indian airlines, affecting domestic and international operations. Such mischievous and unlawful actions are a matter of grave concern. I condemn attempts to compromise safety, security and operational integrity of our aviation sector,\u201d federal aviation minister, Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu, said.",
    "Hoax bomb threats targeting airlines are often linked to malicious intent, attention-seeking, mental health issues, disruption of business operations or a prank, experts say. In 2018, a rash of jokes about bombs \u00a0by airplane passengers in Indonesia led to flight disruptions. Even fliers have proved to be culprits: last year, a frustrated passenger tried to delay a Spicejet flight \u00a0by calling in a bomb hoax alert after missing his check-in at an airport in India\u2019s Bihar.",
    "These hoaxes end up wreaking havoc in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing aviation markets. More than 150 million passengers flew domestically in India last year, according to the civil aviation ministry. More than 3,000 flights arrive and depart every day in the country from more than 150 operational airports, including 33 international airports.",
    "Last week\u2019s hoaxes peaked even as India\u2019s airlines carried a record 484,263 passengers \u00a0on a single day, 14 October. India has just under 700 commercial passenger planes in service, and an order backlog of more than 1,700 planes, according to Rob Morris of Cirium, a consultancy. \u201cAll this would certainly render India the fastest growing commercial aircraft market today,\u201d says Mr Morris.",
    "Bomb threats to airlines inconvenience passengers, as seen with these travellers boarding another Vistara flight from Turkey (BBC)",
    "Consider the consequences of a bomb threat alert on an airline.",
    "If the plane is in the air, it must divert to the nearest airport \u2013 like the Air India flight that diverted last week to Canada or a Frankfurt-bound Vistara flight from Mumbai that diverted to Turkey,\u00a0 in September. Some involve fighter jets to be scrambled to escort planes reporting threats like it happened with a\u00a0 Heathrow bound Air India flight over Norfolk \u00a0and a Singapore bound Air India Express last week.",
    "Once on the ground, passengers disembark, and all baggage and cargo and catering undergo thorough searches. This process can take several hours, and often the same crew cannot continue flying due to duty hour limitations. As a result, a replacement crew must be arranged, further prolonging the delay.",
    "\u201cAll of this has significant cost and network implications. Every diverted or delayed flight incurs substantial expenses, as grounded aircraft become money-losing assets. Delays lead to cancellations, and schedules are thrown off balance.\u201d says Sidharath Kapur, an independent aviation expert.",
    "The dramatic rise in bomb threats on social media from anonymous accounts has complicated efforts to identify perpetrators, especially when emails are sent directly to airlines. The motives remain unclear, as does whether the threats come from a single individual, a group, or are simply copycat acts.",
    "More than 150 million passengers flew domestically in India last year (BBC)",
    "Last week, Indian authorities arrested a 17-year-old school dropout for creating a social media account to issue such threats. His motivations remain unclear, but he is believed to have targeted four flights \u2013 three international \u2013 resulting in two delays, one diversion and one cancellation. Investigators suspect that some posts may have originated from London and Germany after tracing IP addresses.",
    "Clearly, tracking down hoaxers presents a significant challenge. While Indian law mandates life imprisonment for threats to airport safety or service disruption, this punishment is too severe for hoax calls and would likely not withstand legal scrutiny. Reports \u00a0suggest the government is considering placing offenders on a no-fly list and introducing new laws that could impose a five-year prison term.",
    "Ultimately, such hoax threats can cause serious anxiety for passengers. \u201cMy aunt called to ask if she should take her booked flight given these threats. \u2018Should I take a train?\u2019 she asked. I told her, \u2018Please continue to fly\u2019,\u201d says an aviation consultant, who preferred to remain unnamed. The threats continue to disrupt lives and sow fear.",
