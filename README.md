### AKD slams speaker for stuffing his staff with relatives

*2024-03-25 13:13:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/akd-slams-speaker-for-stuffing-his-staff-with-relatives/) · `en`

The three-day debate on the No-confidence Motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena offers an insight into the prevailing ‘dump the lot’ public opinion on the incumbent legislature. Listening to what some MPs said (sometimes yelled) during the debate helps understand the present mood in the country that the incumbent legislature has long lost its mandate which must be urgently restored through a general election.

Only a few members presented coherent arguments during the debate. The government relied on its roster of provocative speakers who bellowed the usual rhetoric. Those who spoke sensibly rightly predicted that the government’s numerical advantage would secure the motion’s defeat. However, they cautioned that any victory would be fleeting as they believed the government’s downfall was inevitable.

### Sri Lanka should not give standing facilities as lender of first resort

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s recent removal of counterparty limits for access to central banks’ printed money as a standing facility is a mistake which will make banks overtrade and contribute to monetary and financial instability in the future.

Standing facilities should be the last among lender of last resort facilities.

The more liberal the LOLR facilities are, the more unchanging the rate, the more external instability there will be in the future, and more bank bad loans will pile up as stabilization policies are applied.

Essentially, standing facilities, term or permanent injections allow banks to lend without deposits, and trigger forex shortages in a soft-peg or flexible exchange rate.

The UK has a standing facility that prints money at 0.25 percent above the policy rate.

### Human rights in Lanka and oil deposits in Palestine - EDITORIAL

On September 6, 2023, the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights castigated Sri Lanka saying that the country suffers from a continuing accountability deficit- be it for war crime atrocities, more recent human rights violations, corruption, or abuse of power- which must be addressed for the country to move forward.

In Sri Lanka’s near three decade-long civil war, around 40,000 Tamil civilians reportedly died of military attacks. Thousands of others were wounded, while some were critical. Women suffered the most, and it is alleged that rape was used as a weapon of war.

Hundreds of Sinhalese civilians too were killed by armed Tamil militant groups -mainly the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)- during the course of the three decade-long war.

Since the civil war ended, there has been no credible government mechanism set up to apprehend these different merchants of death.

In a recent column, I discussed the worsening American economy and dire forecasts of a looming recession. I said too, that there is more to the health of a country than money and economics. In fact, when the going is good and the sun is shining, countries and people get carried away and start making mistakes that lead to their downfall and hard times.

Beaten, broken and bruised: but carrying on with courage and compassion ‘beyond checkpoints’

In a nation notorious for not remembering many matters of importance beyond the news cycle, remembering right becomes a sacred trust and duty. Sri Lanka has faced many challenges as a country and a people in its chequered history since independence, and forgetfulness must not be added to its woes.

Thus a poignant memoir of episodes still not out of mind comes as a welcome reminder that once upon a time in our erstwhile island paradise, there was ‘something rotten in the state’. It was not a people, political party or government, or even a separatist movement that escalated into terrorism, which were solely to blame for the phenomenon we ironically recall as a ‘civil war’.

Higher the Government expenditure, greater the burden being borne by people

It is the total Government expenditure that should worry citizens instead of the mere tax payments. The total expenditure of the Government, known as gross government expenditure, is made up of the recurrent or consumption expenditure, expenditure incurred for building the country’s capital stock, and money used for repaying the maturing Government debt. Financing that expenditure, whether it is done through taxes, borrowings, or money printing, or a combination of all the three, is a burden to the people. Taxes force them to bear the burden today, borrowings tomorrow, and inflation today as well as the future
