    "The strongest man is never strong enough to be always master, unless lie transforms his power into right, and obedience to duty.",
    "At the time my story begins, a routine civil service transfer had me moved as Assistant Secretary in the prime minister\u2019s office which was without doubt the most exalted and powerful institution in Sri Lanka. For the first 30 years of the new state\u2019s existence, its place in the political structure remained unchallenged and unchanged. The role of the prime minister as the keystone of the arch in a Westminster-style government was paramount. It was only much later, after the second Republican Constitution in 1978 and the creation of the Executive Presidency with its enormous concentration of power, that the position of the prime minister became as it now is, devoid of constitutional authority, largely decorative\u2019 and what its holder is able to make of it.",
    "I was still on my period of \u2018cadetship\u2019 after two stints of apprenticeship under the tutelage of two senior government agents, doing field inspections and observing how the provincial administration worked in Anuradhapura and Jaffna. This was the time-honoured route in the civil service. Both stations, Jaffna particularly, where the young Leonard Woolf, one of the early stars of the Ceylon Civil Service had begun his career at the turn of the century, kindled fanciful thoughts of emulation. Could one dare to aspire to walk in the footsteps of the great?",
    "My transfer to the prime minister\u2019s office was sudden and unexpected. On my return to Colombo after 10 months in Jaffna, I had a telegram from M Rajendra, then secretary to the treasury, posting me to the Badulla Kachcheri as an Assistant Government Agent. This at first sight seemed unfair since my first two Assignments had been to two of the more distant outposts. But one of the early pieces of advice the four of us \u2018cadets\u2019, Shanti Kumar Phillips, myself, Chandi Chanmugam and Lester Pereira \u2013 in the order of our entry to the Civil Service \u2013 had received at our orientation by Shirley Amerasinghe, who was then Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) and literally our shepherd, was that \u2018civil servants\u2019 never questioned a transfer order.",
    "Looking haughtily down his aquiline nose one day, he had informed us in an unusually severe tone that we served at the pleasure of the Crown. It was, as he seemed to imply, noblesse oblige for those of the Ceylon Civil Service\u2019 \u2013 the CCS \u2013 and one was not to question why. The code for the chosen ones was apparently different from that for mere normal public service mortals. I took him at his word. Much later on a similar note, the late Pieter Keuneman, a respected leader of the Ceylon Communist Party, slightly parodied the predicament I was in \u2013 complain but comply was his diktat.",
    "I had booked a railway wagon for the transport from Maradana to Badulla of my second-hand Morris Minor car, which I had bought on my first government transport loan for six thousand rupees, when the news of the change of transfer to the prime minister\u2019s office reached me. It transpired that the need of Nadesan, then secretary to the prime minister, for someone \u2018good in English who could do the \u2018messages and things\u2019, had priority. That is how I found myself, in the middle of 1955, quite routinely brought into the \u2018exalted office\u2019 and into an intimate association with a long line of Sri Lanka\u2019s political leaders.",
    "Sir John n Kotelawala, the first of my prime minister\u2019s, but third in Sri Lanka\u2019s history, was a colourful personality who was certainly not given to calling a spade an agricultural instrument. In 1954 some months before I came to his office, he had gained some notoriety by a characteristically direct remark at an international conference. It was the non-aligned summit in Bandung and Chou En-lai the urbane leader of the Peoples Republic of China was making a strong bid for China to be recognized as a leader of the non-aligned nations.",
    "Sir John in his speech had implied that China with its close links to one of the power blocs \u2013 the Soviet Union \u2013 could hardly be regarded as non-aligned. Even more and quite deliberately, in view of his known antipathy to communism, he had referred with -ironic sarcasm to the Soviet Union\u2019s own colonial record and China\u2019s recent \u2018annexation\u2019 of Tibet.",
    "Nehru, one of the architects of non-alignment and in his panchaseela mode, was anxious to mollify the rattled Chou En-lai. He had turned sharply to Sir John and inquired querulously, \u201cSir John, why didn\u2019t you show me your speech before you said that.\u201d Sir John\u2019s celebrated riposte which warmed the hearts of even many of his local critics \u2013 most knowledgeable Sri Lankans being congenital Indophobes \u2013 was short and to the point. \u201cWhy should I, Nehru,\u2019 he had countered, \u201cdo you show me yours before you speak?\u201d",
    "So I knew as I began work with him that he had a direct turn of phrase and plenty of courage. Certainly not a man to trifle with. I also learnt in those early days that Sir John was not quite the playboy and tough guy that the Press had made him out to be. Of course he enjoyed the company of pretty women and there were enough around him on most evenings at his Kandawala home for the Press to call them his \u2018Purple Brigade\u2019. But I have seen him order everyone out, including the pretty women, when the \u2018party\u2019 was over and it was time to get back to work.",
    "He had a quick and inquiring mind and a strong sense of discipline engendered no doubt by his volunteer service in the Army. Before he became prime minister and when he was the minister of the state council in 1936 he was invariably referred to by his military rank, Major and later Colonel, and as Lionel \u2013 the L in J L \u2013 rather than John. The \u2018Sir John\u2019 came with his knighthood, a traditional parting gift after the Queen\u2019s visit to Ceylon which he had organized with great assurance and success in 1953.",
    "The prime minister\u2019s father too had been named John Kotelawela and there was always a whiff of mystery surrounding `John Sr\u2019. There had then been rumours of high intrigue, of family feuds, contract killings and near unassailable alibis. The kavi kola karayas \u2013 the wandering minstrels who preceded the radio as purveyors of news in my childhood had sung the story in racy jingles, doubtless embellishing it as time went on. But what was spoken about in whispers was that John Sr had died in prison while awaiting trial after arrest in a foreign land for killing a brother-in-law.",
    "But this could well be the embellishment of an overladen imagination. I would not personally subscribe to its veracity and mention it only to show how the whisper mills grind away in this country. So the son, John Lionel Kotelawela had grown up very much in the care of his dynamic mother Alice. She continued to be a strong influence throughout his life and frequently intervened to help him out of the many sticky situations his reckless tongue got him into.",
    "Alice Kotelawela was one of the three Attygalle sisters of Madapatha who made an important impact on the political history of colonial Ceylon through their dynastic marriages. The eldest, Alice, as we have noted, married John Kotelawela Senior. Leena, the second sister married T F Jayewardene, an uncle of J R Jayewardene, the future president. The youngest, Ellen, married F R Senanayake, the elder brother of D S Senanayake, the first prime minister of independent Ceylon. The Attygalle sisters have been likened to the three Soong sisters of pre-revolutionary China who achieved fame through their marriages to leading political figures.",
    "The Attygalle family network was indeed an impressive one. F R Senanayake\u2019s younger brother D S and D S Senanayake\u2019s son Dudley, were the first and second prime ministers of the country while John Kotelawala\u2019s son Lionel (our Sir John) became the third. These family networks and the way the highest posts rotated among kinsmen led to the UNP being referred to as the \u2018Uncle Nephew Party\u2019, a sobriquet not unwarranted by the facts. Political analysts observing this trend being repeated later on in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and by contagion in the neighbouring countries as well, were to refer to the phenomenon rather grandly, I think, as dynastic democracy, a typically South Asian variant.",
    "Sir John\u2019s entrance to the office of prime minister on October 12, 1953 was according to him delayed and long over-due. As he perceived it, he should by right and by seniority in the Party, have been appointed by the Governor -General Lord Soulbury to fill the vacancy caused by the death of D S on March 22, 1952. t was a climactic moment in the life of the new nation as D S, like other new leaders who had managed the transition from colony to free state, had been like a father figure.",
    "The question before the leading politicians of the government as D S lay dying \u2013 and also the choice being theirs, was, \u201cWho will now be prime minister?\u201d S W R D Bandaranaike, a likely successor, had put himself outside contention by his resignation from the government and the UNP on July 12. 1951, a full eight months before D S\u2019 death. What would have been the country\u2019s future had he continued in the UNP of which he had been a founding member in 1946, and been chosen to succeed? This was to become an often-asked question but I always thought it was irrelevant considering the profound differences in policy and direction between himself and D S.",
    "On crossing the floor\u2019 in a memorable speech he had expressed his frustration at not being able to make the regime implement the progressive reform agenda he had submitted. There was no doubt that after much reflection he had left the government to form his own Party since he was convinced that forces within the UNP would never allow him to succeed D S. With S W R D Bandaranaike out of the way the leading contender was Sir John. He had held ministerial rank since 1936, was now deputy leader, held the portfolio of minister of transport and works and was leader of the house. The other possible candidates were Dudley, D S\u2019s son, and J R Jayewardene who was also a distant relative of the Senanayake\u2019s.",
    "Dudley had been in the Cabinet for less than five years and held the important portfolio of Agriculture and Lands. But he was much younger, relatively inexperienced and had shown no great enthusiasm for the rough and tumble of politics. J R Jayewardene was minister of finance and had earned a reputation as a political strategist but his stand on the language issue \u2013 official status for Sinhala \u2013 and his penchant for the national dress did not commend him to the old guard of the UNP for the leadership position.",
    "It looked obvious to Sir John and his followers that he would be next in line. But it was not to be. Apparently the late prime minister, since he was in poor health, had advised Lord Soulbury that if anything untoward happened to him he should ask Dudley to form a government. Soulbury was out of the country at the time but had flown back on March 26 and with the minimum of consultation invited Dudley to do so. Dudley was then 41 years old and thus became the youngest prime minister in the Commonwealth.",
    "Lord Soulbury whose appointment to office had been recommended by D S had paid off his debt, but as far as Sir John was concerned he had gained a mortal foe. Indeed Sir John had written a curt letter6 to Soulbury about the breach of British parliamentary convention to which the governor-general had not deigned to respond. It was soon also apparent that a majority of members of the parliamentary group had favoured Dudley over Sir John, who with his characteristic impulsiveness was more than likely to get them all into trouble.",
    "After some days of sulking and denunciation of all the \u2018plotters\u2019 from his home at Kandawala Sir John had been persuaded to serve in Dudley\u2019s cabinet, taking up his old portfolio which had been kept vacant. S W R D Bandaranaike watching these goings on from the sidelines was to describe this in his usual pithy terminology as \u201cthe culmination of a long, shabby and discreditable intrigue\u201d.\u2019",
    "However, Sir John\u2019s fury at being, as he perceived it, \u2018double crossed\u2019 was not to be pacified by ministerial office alone. He had to get it off his chest and he did so in his usual scathing style in a document widely circulated without any authorship, which gave a blow by blow account of how the deed was done. This was the famous The Premier Stakes . As usual his wayward tongue landed him in a heap of trouble. He was in the US on his way to Canada on an official visit when the story broke. Let me record the sequence of the events in his own words. The extract is from his An Asian Prime  Minister\u2019s Story.",
    "\u2018Premier Dudley was prevailed upon to send me this message by cable: \u201cThe publication of the The Premier Stakes in 1952 has created a situation which makes it impossible for me to retain you as a member of my Cabinet. I shall, therefore, be glad if you will hand in your resignation by top secret telegram through our Embassy in Washington.\u201d",
    "\u2018The message was delivered to me with the utmost formality by an official of the Embassy who was very correctly dressed for the occasion, in tails and black tie. His instructions were that I should read it myself. When I had digested the contents of the cabled message which had been sent in code I asked him whether he would send a reply in plain English signed Kotelawala. He said that he certainly would. The reply I dictated made our uneasy diplomat shrink from its emphatic and rudely specific terms. The prime minister was to be asked to thrust the message he sent me into the place where I thought it belonged. Needless to say no reply was sent to Ceylon in these terms through the prescribed channels.\u2019",
    "However, Sir John was advised by many friends to go back to Ceylon and make up with Dudley. Then followed one of those diplomatic denials sometimes euphemistically described as being \u2018economical with the truth\u2019 which I was to encounter again and again in my career with top people. It was agreed, as Sir John later wrote, that everything should be forgiven and forgotten. In writing he solemnly asserted that he had nothing to do with the publication of the The Premier Stakes and denied the truth of the statements attributed to him in the document. Dudley accepted the explanation and all was well that ended well.",
    "Blood in the country\u2019s politics has always been thicker than water. Sir John\u2019s mother Alice and Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, who was also an expert at patching up other peoples\u2019 quarrels, then a cabinet minister and later the next governor-general recommended by Sir John, were said to be the prime actors in this charade.",
    "Overlooked in 1952 for the premiership and now more than ever before the heir-apparent, Sir John did not have to wait too long for the prize he was seeking. Dudley as everyone expected called for an early election influenced by two main considerations. One obviously was to take advantage of the considerable sympathy vote following the death of his father. The other was to pre-empt the rising influence of S W R D Bandaranaike, who after the inauguration of the SLFP in September 1951 was seen to be making strong inroads into the traditional rural vote base of the UNP with a highly populist agenda.",
    "But Dudley\u2019s spell of office, after comfortably winning the elections of 1952, was short. Plagued by ill-health and indecisiveness, Dudley resigned on the October 12, 1953, following the widespread hartal (general strike) in August brought about by the government\u2019s abrupt reduction of the subsidized rice ration. Finally Sir John\u2019s perseverance and tenacity had paid off His reputation for being strong-minded and resolute made him the man of the hour within the Party and there was virtually no opposition to his taking over as prime minister.",
    "There were many urgent things to be done; the pre-eminent need being that of getting the strikers off the streets and back to work. There was also the official visit of the Queen which was pending and which Sir John was determined would be an unqualified success.",
