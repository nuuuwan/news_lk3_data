    "SriLankan Airlines is positioning itself as a leading regional air cargo hub with bold expansion plans, enhanced capacity and a renewed emphasis on safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Senior officials of the airline shared their vision during a familiarisation visit organised for journalists at the Bandaranaike International Airport\u2019s (BIA) cargo facilities this week.",
    "Explaining the airline\u2019s strategy, Chaminda Perera, Head of Cargo at SriLankan Airlines, said that Colombo is uniquely placed to become the \u201clogical gateway to Asia,\u201d connecting air and sea trade routes while leveraging Sri Lanka\u2019s location within global supply chains.",
    "\u201cWhat does it mean to be the logical gateway to Asia, he asked. \u201cIt means that we are on the same route as the Belt and Road, not only in terms of air freight, but connecting the dots of all modes of transport. Being an island nation, we are at the heart of East\u2013West connectivity, both by sea and air. This provides tremendous growth potential.\u201d",
    "Highlighting India\u2019s economic boom, Perera said: \u201cIndia is very big around us, with GDP growth of 8%. For us, even the crumbs falling out of India are enough to build a strong trading hub. Like Singapore or Dubai, we too can aspire to be a global hub.\u201d",
    "He added that SriLankan Cargo already operates from two terminals spanning 60,500 square metres, with another 10,000 square metres in the pipeline. Once complete, the airline will be capable of handling nearly 400,000 metric tons of cargo annually.",
    "Thushara Wijesuriya, Senior Manager of Worldwide Cargo Operations, explained that SriLankan Airlines remains the sole cargo handling agent in Colombo, managing operations for 32 international airlines.",
    "\u201cOur two facilities \u2013 Terminal 5 with 9,000 square metres and Terminal 4 with 7,500 square metres \u2013 cover exports, imports, transshipment and postal mail operations, Wijesuriya said. \u201cWe handle all types of cargo: general, dangerous goods, perishables, pharmaceuticals, live animals, valuables, courier, human remains and even live human organs.\u201d",
    "He recalled how SriLankan Cargo was the only department operating round the clock during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the timely delivery of vaccines and medicines.",
    "Earlier this week, his team delivered radioactive medical supplies from Mumbai to the Maharagama Cancer Hospital in just nine minutes after the flight landed. \u201cI don\u2019t think any cargo terminal in the world does this kind of timeline, Wijesuriya said. \u201cBecause of our efficiency, over 20 patients were able to receive treatment that very day.\u201d",
    "Cargo Manager \u2013 Standards and Procedures, Ubhaya Arewatte, highlighted that SriLankan Airlines Cargo upholds the highest international benchmarks.",
    "\u201cWe comply with IOSA and ISAGO safety audits, handle 24 airlines with ACC3 and RA3 security certifications, and recently secured CEIV certification for lithium battery transport, he said. \u201cIn April, we also achieved ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System certification.\u201d",
    "He noted with pride that the airline recently completed an ISAGO audit \u201cwith a clean sheet \u2013 without a single observation \u2013 something very rare in the industry.\u201d",
    "SriLankan Cargo is now working towards IATA\u2019s Live Animals Certification and CEIV Fresh for perishables.",
    "Shehan Fernando, Manager Cargo Operations with more than three decades of experience, stressed the importance of skilled manpower.",
    "He told The Island Financial Review: \u201cOne of the biggest stumbling blocks we face is finding the right candidates, he said. \u201cDespite high demand for jobs worldwide, the specialised skills needed for cargo operations are lacking. Students should seriously consider cargo operations, as this field has immense potential.\u201d",
    "Corporate Communications Manager Deepal Perera summed it up: \u201cEverything we do is done on a timeline and with great sensitivity. Despite challenges, our dedicated staff continue to deliver world-class service. Our commitment is not only to the airline but also to the economy of the country.\u201d",
