    "Affirms proposed reforms to Sri Lanka Electricity Bill will be presented for Parliament approval",
    "Says CEB will submit electricity tariff reduction proposal to PUCSL next week",
    "CEB issues a circular cancelling all leave for workers indefinitely",
    "President Wickremesinghe re-issues gazette declaring power supply as an essential service",
    "As state power sector workers took to the streets yesterday, defying the circular that cancelled all leave, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera ordered a rigorous crackdown on employee misconduct within the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).",
    "\u201cInstructions have been given to the CEB management to suspend and take appropriate disciplinary action against any employee that disrupts the services or acts in violation of the guidelines issued by the CEB management,\u201d he said via \u2018X\u2019 yesterday.",
    "The Minister also confirmed that the proposed reforms to the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill would soon be presented to the Parliament, with amendments designed to restructure the State-run CEB to boost efficiency and address challenges faced by the national power utility.",
    "\u201cThe CEB will also submit the electricity tariff reduction proposal to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) next week,\u201d Wijesekera added.",
    "The move follows the announcement of a planned protest by the Ceylon Electricity Boards Joint Trade Union Alliance, starting yesterday outside the CEB headquarters.",
    "The union, led by Ranjan Jayalal vehemently opposes the proposed bill to restructure the CEB, noting it will break the organisation into 12 parts and sell them jeopardising the future of the sector and national security.",
    "The Government, however, maintains the bill aims to improve the efficiency of the debt-ridden CEB and attract foreign investment to the industry.",
    "On 1 January, the CEB Acting General Manager Dr. Narendra de Silva issued a circular cancelling all leave for CEB workers until further notice.",
    "The notice comes as electricity workers across the country prepared to launch a three-day (3-5 January) protest campaign against the proposed Sri Lanka Electricity Bill.",
    "The circular noted an extraordinary gazette notification that designates the supply of electricity as an essential service.",
    "\u201cTo ensure uninterrupted service all leave for CEB workers is cancelled, effective 2 January 2024,\u201d it noted.",
    "However, the circular allows for exceptions in cases of emergency, as approved by the relevant Executive Officer.",
    "In addition to the warnings issued by the Minister, President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday once again issued a gazette notification declaring several services as essential.",
    "Accordingly through the gazette dated 3 January all services connected to the supply of electricity, the supply or distribution of petroleum products and fuel, the discharge, carriage, landing, storage, delivery and removal of articles of food or drink, or coal, oil or fuel from vessels within any port as defined for the purposes of the Customs Ordinance and the provision and maintenance of facilities for transport services by air, including airports and ports have now been declared as essential services.",
