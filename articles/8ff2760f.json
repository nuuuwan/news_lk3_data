    "The June 2024 regulations were also less tighter than the earlier ones.",
    "Sri Lanka and other central banks which go to the International Monetary Fund regularly impose exchange control on the people due to deep flaws in their operating framework where monetary policy is in fundamental conflict with exchange rate policy.",
    "When the policy conflicts intensify due to open market operations to narrowly target a policy rate, exchange controls are intensified instead of correcting monetary policy.",
    "Trade controls may also follow. Sri Lanka is to open vehicle imports which were blocked for almost four years due to central bank policy in February 2024.",

    "A soft-pegged (a managed exchange rate central bank that collects reserves) can also destabilize the currency by engaging in swaps with domestic market participants.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s external instability and social unrest worsened after adopting flexible inflation targeting (operating an inflation targeting framework without clean floating regime) where large volumes of money was printed to target mid-corridor rates.",
    "Errors in targeting a policy rate with inflationary open market operations were then compensated with currency depreciation (exchange rate as the first line of defence), instead of abandoning the mid-corridor targeting (now called single policy rate) promptly.",
    "Modern-style exchange controls were devised by the Bank of Russia in 1906 limiting outflows to 50,000 German units. The country ended up in high inflation and revolution a decade later. (Colombo/Dec19/2024)"
