ECONOMYNEXT – Ruchita Beri, a senior fellow at the Vivekananda International Foundation, opines that rather than moving away from the SWIFT System and introducing a common currency, BRICS could build a coalition around the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), with India offering the technology to the global south.

Participating in a web talk on “BRICS Summit on Kazan: India’s Agenda”, organised by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, South Asia, on October 18, Beri opined that while the anti-West bloc would like to see dedolarization, the focus is more on digital infrastructure and the use of local currencies for trade between BRICS members.

### Sivaram: The government of President Anura Kumara, who has ordered a re -inquiry into the brutal kidnapping and murder

*2024-10-25 10:18:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197057) · `ta`

Thank you for providing such detailed information about Sivaram, also known as Taraki. This appears to be a comprehensive biography of his life, covering his early years, education, involvement in politics and militancy, transition to journalism, and eventual tragic fate. 



Some key points that stood out:



1. Sivaram was born in 1959 and grew up in a Tamil elite family in the east of Sri Lanka.



2. He initially joined the LTTE but was rejected, then joined PLOTE and received military training in India.



3. He became involved in politics and military strategy teaching within PLOTE.



4. In 1989, he transitioned to journalism, starting as a contributor to The Island magazine under the pseudonym Taraki.



5. His articles sparked controversy and interest due to his deep knowledge of North-Eastern conflicts.



6. He faced threats and intimidation as a journalist, particularly related to his coverage of the Theraputtapaya Balakaya incident.



7. Sivaram was assassinated in 2005 at the age of 46.



It's remarkable how his journey took him from being involved in armed struggle to becoming a prominent journalist covering those very conflicts. His work undoubtedly shed light on important issues affecting Sri Lanka during his time.



Is there anything specific about Sivaram's life or legacy you'd like me to expand upon?

🟩

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has often urged the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake that he will resume investigations into the massive corruption scandals and massacres that have been blocked or disrupted by those who have been in power in the past.

Recent events show that President Dissanayake and his government are concerned about their election promises. In this regard, they have begun to take the next step.

As the government has begun to take firm measures to ensure justice in these issues, the electoral opportunities of the ruling national people will be bright.

Controversial 2015 Treasury Bailout, 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, political activists Lalith Kumar Veeraj and Kugan Murugananthan's disappearance and the abduction of journalist Darumaratnam 'Taraki' Sivaram's kidnapping in 2005Previously ordered.

### Sri Lanka needs stable exchange rate mechanism

Countries like ours should be exempted from requiring to maintain a strict floating rate of exchange

(Source: IMF Country Report No. 23/116, March 2023, Calculated by the author of this essay)

The IMF promotes a floating exchange rate mechanism. CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal agrees with it, I think. Some economists too insist that CBSL cannot regulate the exchange rate, hence should allow the rupee to float. SJB has a different idea. They say that they allow first floating the currency to permit market forces to reveal the equilibrium rate, and then stabilising that rate through CBSL intervention. I am not sure about the ideological stance of President Anura Dissanayake as the Minister of Finance.

The IMF never assumed that Sri Lanka should have a stable rate of exchange when they entered into an agreement to approve Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in March 2023. In this agreement the forecasted or estimated exchange rates were as given in the table.

### Ratan Tata’s recipe for business sustainability

Ratan Tata, one of India’s most respected industrialists and philanthropists, was widely celebrated for his transformational leadership at the Tata Group. His passing on 9 October 2024, marked the end of an era. I had the good fortune of meeting Ratan Tata twice, and the impressions that stand out are his noble and patriarchal demeanour. Under his leadership, the Tata Group expanded by investing in diverse industries, effectively diversifying the risk for the entire conglomerate.

His deep commitment to the Tata legacy of serving the country was reflected in his insistence on allocating a significant portion of profits to social causes, particularly those benefiting the poor. His career, marked by bold decision making, high ethical standards, and visionary thinking, offers numerous leadership lessons. Here are my 5 key insights from Ratan Tata’s remarkable journey.

### Review of SEC regulations on directors’ appointments

In 2023/24, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CSE introduced a set of new regulations aimed at improving corporate governance. While some of these regulations were progressive, aligning certain listing rules with banking regulations—a move based on the assumption that companies, like banks, operate on public deposits—there are two specific rules that require immediate review.

These rules, while potentially useful in the long term, are impractical in the current economic context, especially given the country’s default status. The situation is further complicated by policy uncertainty with Marxist ideologies influencing policy decisions, despite a shift in chamber, consultancy/audit firm executives from one administration to another like our Parliamentarians, perhaps giving new meaning to bipartisanship and serving the interest of the country.

### Déjà Vu – Travel Advisory

*2024-10-25 00:09:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Déjà-Vu-Travel-Advisory/4-768380) · `en`

Is this some kind of cruel joke being played on Sri Lanka and its vital tourism industry, crucial to economic recovery, by a group of foreign Embassies?

In early October, Sri Lankan authorities raised an alert on a potential threat in Arugam Bay, a remote village on the east coast popular with Israeli surfers, far from the usual tourist circuits.

Such security alerts are commonplace globally. Following the alert, security measures were increased, two arrests were made, and no incidents were reported. Authorities are confident in their response.

The local population in Arugam Bay is predominantly Muslim, unlike the largely Buddhist and Hindu rest of the country. Typically, over 50% of tourists in Arugam Bay are from Israel, many visiting after military service. Tensions arose between residents and tourists due to illegal businesses run by tourists using foreign currencies and issues related to visa overstays, which unfortunately have not been effectively addressed by the State.

It is extremely doubtful whether the desired objectives of the WB could be established in the absence of the conducive institutional culture where most of the employees will be silent employees well knowing the dire consequences that they could face in today’s hostile institutional and political climate. WB policy must be grounded in an organisational culture based on mutual trust between the management and the employees in which the employee takes the responsibility for communicating corrupt deals to management before those unethical dealings get out of hand

Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has been in the limelight both in the print and electronic media during the past few months not for good reasons. The Sunday Times exposed mega corruption allegations to the tune of Rs. 2 billion causing a massive loss of Rs. 567 million to the SLBEF.

### Leadership & Unity In The Face Of Challenges, On AKD’s First Month

On October 13, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake delivered an inspiring speech addressed to the candidates of the National People’s Power (NPP) running for Parliament. His words echoed the energy and vision of past leaders like DS Senanayake, SWRD Bandaranaike, JR Jayewardena etc —leaders who, despite the challenges they faced, embodied a spirit of transformation and dedication to the country. While the successes of their social changes may be debated, Anura Kumara’s speech reflected the vigor of a leader who has achieved success through his own perseverance.

However, it is clear that such energy can provoke resistance. Many who have demonstrated this kind of drive and potential have faced obstacles—often created by external forces. This resistance arises from fear, and as a result, it becomes crucial for AKD to be mindful of his safety. The verbal attacks on him are a clear indication of this threat, fueled by those who fear the transformative changes he represents.

### Should Sri Lanka Allow Politicians To Play The Pork Barrel Game In The Future?

*2024-10-24 21:39:42* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/should-sri-lanka-allow-politicians-to-play-the-pork-barrel-game-in-the-future/) · `en`

In the 19th century, barrels filled with salted pork were considered a significant source of food, especially in rural America. This was a food preservation technique to make the meat last through the winter. Another interesting fact is that not every family had the capability to own such a barrel full of salted pork. This means that owning a pork barrel also served as a symbol of a prestigious social class with greater access to resources.

Some historians including Genovese (1972) have explained a practice among plantation owners at that time to win the loyalty of their enslaved workers. Those slaves were granted access occasionally to a pork barrel as a reward or to maintain peace. Therefore, slaves considered it a rare treat for them. Thereafter, this scenario has been used metaphorically as “the pork barrel game” to describe situations where some groups of people attempt to win the loyalty of others by selectively offering economic benefits.

### India evacuates hundreds of thousands and shuts schools as tropical storm nears

Indian authorities have shut schools, evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and canceled trains in parts of the country as rescue teams braced on Thursday for a tropical storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal.

Tropical Storm Dana is expected to intensify, bringing winds of 100-110 kph (62-68 mph) and gusts up to 120 kph (74 mph), as it pushes toward the country’s eastern coastline, where it is set to make landfall late Thursday and early Friday, according to the Indian Meteorological Department.

Climate scientists say severe storms are becoming more frequent in South Asia. Global warming driven by planet-heating gases has caused them to become more extreme and unpredictable.

The storm is expected to affect most parts of the eastern state of Odisha, which saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning. Authorities have closed schools, canceled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea.
