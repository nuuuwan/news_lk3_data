    "The moment I stepped into Gatz at the City of Dreams, Cinnamon Life, on Saturday, 20th September, I was immediately reminded of the hit song \u2018Starry, Starry Night\u2019 by Don McLean.",
    "The venue was packed with some of the big names in the local scene, both past and present, and they were all there to take in singer Noeline Honter\u2019s final night at Gatz, and she was, as usual, awesome on stage, ably backed by Mirage.",
    "The stars present included Damian Wikkramatillake, Rukshan Perera, Piyal (Gypsies), Chrys Wikramanayake, Judy de Silva, Geoffrey and Russel Fernando, Mignonne, Suraj, Hussain Jayah, Alston Koch and, of course, Sohan who has made Gatz the heartbeat of the city.",
    "It was, indeed, Noeline\u2019s night and she is seen here with a guest who also happens to be a big fan of Sohan",
    "They did their thing, on stage, with Mirage doing the needful, and, believe me, the audience didn\u2019t expect to experience such an awesome happening. It was, indeed, a starry, starry night!",
    "One can\u2019t forget the band Mirage, backing all the top artistes and providing some awesome music, as well.",
    "They were fabulous \u2013 real professionals on stage \u2013 and their female vocalist, Danu, was very impressive with her vocals.",
    "And, as Hussain Jayah quite rightly said, all this was possible due to the country\u2019s famous entertainer Sohan Weerasinghe \u2013 Brand Ambassador-cum-Entertainment Consultant at Cinnamon Life \u2013 who has made Gatz the happening place in Colombo!",
    "What\u2019s more, entrance to Gatz is free, so go check it out yourself.",
    "Better the known devil? Some thoughts on the politicisation of education",
