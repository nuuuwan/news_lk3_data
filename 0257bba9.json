    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Aviation Ministry permitted Uber and PickMe to operate at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for a fee after passengers complained of harassment and overcharging by other taxi drivers, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.",
    "Responding to a statement by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, de Silva told parliament on Thursday June 22 that a conventional \u2018airport taxi\u2019 charges 6,750 rupees for a trip to Colombo from the airport whereas an Uber or PickMe cab would charge only around 3,500.",
    "The government has so far earned revenue in excess of five million rupees by allowing Uber and PickMe drivers to park at the BIA, he said.",
    "\u201cThis was not given to them free of charge,\u201d said de Silva, responding to Premadasa\u2019s claim in parliament the previous day that the livelihood of over 2,000 taxi drivers were threatened by \u201cprioritising\u201d Uber and PickMe, two smartphone app-based ride hailing services.",
    "Premadasa told parliament on Wednesday that, as far as he was aware, no proper procurement process had been followed in selecting the two companies who he claimed were allowed to advertise at the BIA premises while the small-time taxi operators were not.",
    "In his statement on Wednesday, the opposition leader said the government must prioritise the livelihoods of 1,057 taxi drivers represented by six associations and a further 1,000 taxi drivers whose income had taken a hit from the pandemic and other factors. While he acknowledged the need for modern solutions, Permadasa said modernisation should not be at the expense of the existing small-scale operators.",
    "\u201cWhy deprive the livelihood of 2,200 families to make way for two large scale corporations? That is wrong,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "Minister de Silva said in his response the next day that he was disappointed that \u201cso many people\u201d were taking Premadasa for a ride.",
    "\u201cNone of these vehicles are foreign-owned. Uber and [PickMe] drivers are all Sri Lankans,\u201d he said, adding that much of the fare goes back to the individual drivers even as the two companies earn a commission.",
    "Most tourists already have Uber installed on their phone, said de Silva. He also argued that it was only fair to facilitate an affordable cab ride home to domestic workers and other Sri Lankans returning to the island.",
    "\u201cEveryone has the right to use either Uber or [PickMe] when they land to go home,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe received many complaints from passengers that they\u2019re harassed by people asking them if they need a taxi. This is really ugly,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "Taxi services that run on apps also keep a record of their journeys, which would make it easier to locate a driver or a vehicle in the event of an incident, he said, adding that the ministry\u2019s reasoning was to employ new technology to provide some relief to passengers.",
    "In March 2023, a BIA official said it was considering giving designated parking slots for PickMe after other three wheeler drivers were seen harassing tourists using the system.",
    "Sri Lanka airport may give parking slots for Pick MeSee more",
    "Premadasa in his statement on Wednesday did not say that Uber or PickMe should be left out. He said he was simply making a case for protecting the livelihoods of the 2,200 taxi drivers. Critics of his statement, however, argued that not fostering competition between the different players would only serve to benefit a politically-connected cartel rather than the consumer.",
    "Chief government whip Prasanna Ranatunga responding to Premadasa on Wednesday said that, when the former was aviation minister, there was demand from tourists to make ride-hailing services available at the airport.",
    "\u201cTourists have gotten used to ordering a taxi from an app. This happens at any international airport the world over. This was a demand for a long time,\u201d he said, adding that a mechanism for including these services were discussed for some time.",
    "Ranatunga suggested that the \u2018airport taxi\u2019 drivers register for Uber or PickMe to supplement their income while continuing to offer their own service.",
    "\u201cThe vehicles you speak of only get a trip maybe once every two days. So they can use it the other days,\u201d he said.",
    "Premadasa urged Ranatunga to consider the plight of the traditional taxi operators, most of whom are constituents of the former aviation minister.",
    "\u201cThere are over 2,000 families. We can\u2019t force people to join Uber or PickMe. There is freedom and human rights in this country. They have a right to decide their livelihood,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, why not make these changes while protecting their livelihoods? What is the procurement process?\u201d he asked.",
    "Premadasa also claimed that taxis registered with the airport are generally prioritised at international airports in \u201cmany countries\u201d, a claim contested by Minister de Silva who claimed on Thursday that some 800 airports globally allow arrivals to call an Uber.",
    "\u201cProtect their livelihoods, and manage this without destroying their lives,\u201d said Premadasa, who also reiterated that Uber and PickMe have been allowed to advertise at the BIA while the six taxi driver associations have not.",
    "Ranatunga responded that the associations have each been allowed a counter at the airport.",
    "\u201cTourists can come to their counters. Uber and PickMe have not been given counters. They can only advertise at their parking spot,\u201d he said.",
    "Ranatunga also alluded to an alleged politicisation of the matter. He said that various associations were formed under successive governments resulting in an \u201cunnecessary\u201d issue.",
    "Premadasa insisted, however, that he raised the matter in good faith with the income of 2,200 families in mind and not on behalf of some alleged mafia.",
    "He once again urged the government to prioritise the taxi drivers while also letting Uber and PickMe participate.",
    "\u201cFrom a tourism perspective, tourists generate dollar income so they must be allowed that privilege. We\u2019re not forcing people to sign up for Uber or PickMe. While running their own taxi, they can earn some additional income through them by signing up for those services. This will protect their job too. This was our proposal,\u201d he said.
