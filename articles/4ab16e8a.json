    "Political propaganda is a double-edged sword. It is something to be handled very carefully. But successive governments and their propagandists have used propaganda to demonise their political opponents\u2014in some cases with the help of the police as well. There have been numerous instances where leading Opposition figures were framed and made to languish in remand prisons for months on end under previous governments. The arrest and detention of Vijaya Kumaratunga on trumped up Naxalite charges is a case in point. The J. R. Jayewardene government also falsely accused the JVP of having a hand in the 1983 anti-Tamil violence, and proscribed it. The tradition continues.",
    "The incumbent NPP administration stands accused of misusing its war on drugs to discredit Opposition politicians by making unsubstantiated allegations against them. Its strategy has apparently backfired. The Opposition insists that a wealthy drug dealer recently arrested for smuggling narcotics in trawlers in the Tangalle area is an active member of the JVP! It says some JVP leaders have even enjoyed the drug smuggler\u2019s hospitality during their visits to the southern parts of the country. The boot is now on the other foot. The Opposition has got hold of something to beat the government with.",
    "There is a nexus between politicians and narco barons, as is public knowledge. But many drug dealers are known to operate behind various fa\u00e7ades, duping even the police. They pose as business leaders and use legitimate fronts to conceal their illegal activities. In 2002, an unsuspecting Police Chief attended a birthday party thrown by a drug dealer who had acquired social respectability as a businessman. IGP T. E. Anandaraja was denied a service extension when his host was found to be a drug dealer. It is believed that several political leaders used to visit the house of another drug dealer who pretended to be a rich garment factory owner, in Colombo 07. A huge haul of heroin was detected in that house in 2003. The drug baron, known as Ward Place Siyam and his wife were sentenced to death in 2007.",
    "A defining feature of propaganda onslaughts in this country is making very serious allegations against someone and challenging him or her to disprove them! Social media even holds trials and suggests punishment. The police and the national anti-graft commission also resort to hasty arrests and prosecutions, which receive wide media coverage. This may be one of the reasons for Sri Lanka\u2019s disturbingly low conviction rate\u2013\u2013a dismal 4-6%.",
    "A large number of politicians, their family members and friends were arrested, remanded and prosecuted during the Yahapalana government (2015-19), and almost all of them were acquitted subsequently, and worse those who were considered corrupt, returned to power after a few years. Most of them cannot be considered honest by any stretch of the imagination, but the police and their political bosses botched up investigations in such a way that the suspects were able to win back public sympathy. Hence the need to ensure that police investigations are devoid of politics, and politicians and the police refrain from turning high-profile criminal investigations into political circuses and causing a severe erosion of public faith in the legal and judicial processes.",
    "The Opposition is likely to make the most of the latest drug bust in Tangalle to exact revenge on the NPP, which has been on the offensive, hurling wild allegations against its political rivals. It is time both sides stopped playing politics with drug busts, criminal investigations, etc., lest the public faith therein should erode further.",
