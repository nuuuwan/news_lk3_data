    "Police have arrested the suspected shooter in the killing of a 55-year-old businessman who was shot dead in the Neluwattuduwa area of Hanwella on September 30, allegedly due to a dispute over failure to pay ransom.",
    "The incident occurred at around 8.15 p.m. on September 30, and the victim, identified as Vajira Nishantha, succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to Avissawella Hospital in critical condition, according to Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa.",
    "The shooter, who carried out the attack inside the victim\u2019s home, has been arrested, police confirmed. Authorities suspect the gunman used a T56 assault rifle to commit the murder.",
    "CCTV cameras had captured the moment the suspect jumped over the house\u2019s wall, fired the fatal shots, and fled the scene.",
    "Police believe that the killing was orchestrated by underworld figure Lalith Kannangara, who is currently in hiding in Dubai.",
    "Kannangara had reportedly demanded ransom from several businessmen in the area, including the deceased. Fearing for their safety, many of these businessmen have since fled their homes and refused to speak to the media due to threats issued by Kannangara, police said.",
    "The victim\u2019s home had been targeted before, with a shooting incident in 2021 and his business premises were set on fire. Despite receiving multiple death threats from Kannangara due to non-payment of the ransom, the businessman had not complied with the demands. Police revealed that Kannangara became enraged after the victim failed to respond to his phone calls.",
    "The Colombo-South Crimes Division is conducting further investigations regarding the incident. Police have further disclosed that the victim had previously helped Kannangara when he first arrived in Colombo to work as a bus conductor, even assisting him in obtaining a driver\u2019s license."
