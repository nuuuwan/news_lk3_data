### Relieving Tired Eyes

*2024-11-13 23:37:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/relieving-tired-eyes/) ┬╖ `en`

Steep two tea bags (black or green tea) in a mug of boiled water for 02 to 04 minutes and then remove the tea bags, and press out the excess water from the bags.

Let the tea bags cool slowly at room temperature or chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

Your cold brew might give you a refreshing jolt, but a caffeine fix for the skin can also help calm blotchiness or swelling.

Start by freezing some brewed coffee in an ice cube tray. Once the coffee ice is ready, spend a few minutes gently rubbing an ice cube: under your eyes, along your brows, across the bridge of your nose, and from the outer corners of your eyes to your temples

Place the slices over your closed eyes for about 15 minutes.

As an alternative, try cold spoons. They can help constrict blood vessels and reduce areas of under-eye darkness.

This election is expected to be a defining moment for Sri Lanka, with outcomes that could significantly impact its political and economic trajectory in the coming years тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The upcoming General elections in Sri Lanka are pivotal, given the countryтАЩs complex political and economic landscape. Several key factors are shaping expectations for the outcome.

First, economic challenges remain a critical concern. Sri LankaтАЩs economic recovery from a severe debt crisis and inflation surge has been slow, with many citizens still experiencing financial hardship. This context has led to frustration with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as many view its policies as ineffective in alleviating economic pressures. This dissatisfaction may boost Opposition parties like the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP), who have gained traction with promises of economic reforms and anti-corruption measures.

President Trump actually thought that Kamala Harris, a feminist progressive-liberal, was a тАЬradical-leftist, Marxist, Socialist, CommunistтАЭ.

The Trump administration and a Republican Senate are going to regard a JVP-NPP regime in the Indian Ocean headed by JVP leader Anura Dissanayake, pale-pink NPP frill, crony corporate d├йcor and all, differently from the way a Democrat White House and Senate did.

The multidimensional triumph of Donald Trump is an outcome I hardly applaud, but as a political scientist and former diplomat, I cannot fail to note its magnitude, even epic character, and respect the political achievement.

Was it a counter-revolution or a revolution? Critics would argue the former; fans, the latter. It is like those two-dimensional pictures we had as postcards or key-tags when we were schoolkids. It all depends on which side you tilt it; which angle you view it from.

### What we should learn from Nehru

Now after so many years we have to shamefully admit that in this age of religious ostentation, hypocrisy, superstition and orthodox thinking where priests of all faiths are gaining influence and getting political patronage for opinions, there is now a deep gap between the Nehruvian understanding of scientific approach and its practical application and implementation in the Indian context. It has come a long way. But Nehru is as relevant today as he was then.

While today there is a deluge of superstitious clerics and leaders everywhere in the country, about seventy years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had foresightly emphasised that, тАШPolitics led me to economics and it was from that that I was inspired by science and knowledge to adopt a scientific approach to problems and life. Only science can solve the problem of hunger and poverty. Science is the only medium that can eradicate hunger and poverty.тАЩ

A system change will be meaningless unless governance participation is taken to the people in an effective, practical way not just during elections but in between them as well тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In a society that has inequality and inequity, with many having no recourse to hold politicians responsible for the promises made, except believing promises by another set of politicians at the next election and believing them, and many ending up without opportunities for their advancement due to the failings of politicians, life does not change for them except going further downhill

Government has no wealth, and when a politician promises to give you something for nothing, he must first confiscate that wealth from you -- either by direct taxes, or by the cruelly indirect tax of inflation

Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers

The problem with this expansion is not the MovementтАЩs religion, but its politics.

Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The NPPтАЩs policy platform strongly emphasizes environmental sustainability and energy independence. The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPPтАЩs policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. тАЛ

The Sri Lanka Customs Trade Union Alliance says that the decision taken by the customs officers to only carry out the activities related to their respective duties has been temporarily suspended.

The customs officers had resorted to a union action of carrying out only the work related to their official duties, in protest against the alleged false accusations levelled against them by container truck owners and drivers during an observation visit by Minister Vijitha Herath to the Colombo Port on November 07.

This had resulted in a serious delay in the clearing of the containers at the port.

However, the President of the Customs Trade Union Alliance stated that the decision to carry out only duty-related activities was temporarily suspended considering that the container truck drivers and assistants would not be able to vote due to having to park their container trucks.

Here are five likely key impacts on investments:

The NPP is expected to introduce stricter regulations for sectors deemed strategic or essential, which could increase the complexity of doing business for both local and foreign investors, analysts say. Such moves are likely to help in curbing deep rooted corruption at the expense of some delays, they say. This could affect investment in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and utilities, where state influence may increase to ensure alignment with public needs and national prioritiesтАЛ.
