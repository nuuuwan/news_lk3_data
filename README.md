The book was merely a banal repetition of a conspiracy theory without substantive proof to bolster it

The mountains have laboured and brought forth a mouse! Former Sri Lankan President Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa has after many poya days reportedly authored a book. The political grapevine had been buzzing for several months that a book by the ex-president known popularly as Gota and Gotabaya was in progress. It was supposedly a bombshell book with explosive revelations. The book belied such expectations. It was a

Gotabaya Rajapaksa released a statement on 6 March that his book will be launched on 7 March 2024. He also posted on X as follows – “My book ‘The Conspiracy to oust me from the Presidency’ will be available in English and Sinhala at leading bookstores from tomorrow, Thursday, March 7th, 2024.

### APAC economies and commodity exporters most exposed to China stress scenario: Fitch

*2024-03-13 03:57:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/APAC-economies-and-commodity-exporters-most-exposed-to-China-stress-scenario-Fitch/14-759429) · `en`

Fitch Ratings believes that economies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and commodity exporters would be particularly affected under a severe downside stress scenario in China. There would also be a dampening effect on international price pressures.

Fitch’s analysis released last week, based on internal modelling using the Oxford Economics Global Economic Model, sees vulnerabilities in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, through their strong economic linkages with China.

It also suggests Middle Eastern energy exporters, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and Oman, would see slower real GDP growth. However, this does not capture factors such as Qatar’s long-term LNG supply contracts, which we think should make its exports less sensitive to short-term shifts in Chinese demand, limiting the hit to its GDP.

*2024-03-13 01:08:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178568) · `ta`

Douglas Devananda proposes a "Marine Scout Brigade" to monitor and protect Indian fisheries in the North, addressing illegal fishing activities by Indian fishermen.

🟩

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda has said that a Cabinet paper has been submitted to create a volunteer organization "Marine Scouts:" to monitor the safety of the North.

The Marines are carrying out their duties as much as possible in the northern seas to control the violation of Indian fishermen.

However, our marine resources and our fishermen's fisheries equipment are being illegally destroyed by Indian fishermen entering our waters.

In this case, I have submitted the idea of another attempt to carry out the maritime surveillance.

It is worth noting that I think I can create a voluntary organization called the Marine Scout Organization to monitor the activities of the Indian fishermen and control the activities of the Indian fishermen.

*2024-03-13 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Malnutrition-among-young-girls-and-the-Hippocratic-Oath-EDITORIAL/172-278721) · `en`

Our Health Ministry, according to a recent report in the ‘Daily Mirror’ has rejected out-of-hand a report published in the prestigious British ‘Lancet’ magazine concerning child malnutrition and underweight young girls in our country.

If the matter was not so sad and serious, the denial of the Ministry Secretary would be funny.

A UNICEF report posted on January 4 this year showed that 3.9 million people were moderately food insecure with over 10,000 households facing severe food insecurity.

Over 2.9 million children need humanitarian assistance to access lifesaving nutrition, health, education, water and sanitation, protection, and social protection services.

The reports of our very own Central Bank state “...The latest official assessment of the Family Health Bureau of Ministry of Health that was conducted under the concept of Nutrition Month in October 2022 on nutritional status of children under five years, reveals the nutritional status of children deteriorated in 2022.

### Russian economy grows despite sanctions- study

*2024-03-13 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Russian-economy-grows-despite-sanctions-study/172-278720) · `en`

Of the two countries that at each other’s throats now - Russia and Ukraine - it is Ukraine which appears to be the underdog despite massive American and Western arms aid.

While the Russian economy is growing despite severe US and European sanctions, Ukraine is facing a major arms and manpower shortage with dim chances of being rectified.

Given the possibility of Donald Trump returning to power in the US, even the current level of Western support to Ukraine may not be forthcoming. And unlike Russia, Ukraine has no indigenous capability to sustain itself, whether economically or militarily.

On the other contrary, Russia, has been able to circumvent the sanctions and keep its economy humming, according the Vienna Institute of International Economic Studies (VIIEC). And there has also been no let-up in its military efforts.

### NPP support surge linked to opposition weakness

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The surge in the support for the National People's Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka can be attributed to the weakness of the Opposition, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.

The primary opposition should be prepared to assume governance. However, this opposition prepared prematurely.

Therefore, the emergence of a third party became prominent as uncertainty loomed over the effectiveness of the opposition.

As a result, the main opposition's only course of action may be to collaborate with the ruling party. If they choose not to unite without careful consideration, several key leaders from the main opposition may opt to join the government.

However, the selection of the common opposition or the President will be made by the Members of Parliament based on their personal opinions, but there is no relevance to being in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or any other political party.

Increased malnutrition of baby and mothers in this country. According to a survey conducted in 2022, 25% of children aged 5-18 are lessweight children. Many such statistics show that nutritional deficiency is increasing and that mothers and children become a group of nutritional deficiency.

The Opposition Leader said that the United People's Power will meet representatives of the International Monetary Fund in the next few days and the International Monetary Fund's Special Cooperation Program is needed to address the malnutrition of mothers, infants, children and school children in the country.

The International Monetary Fund is the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the establishment of a special fund and the need for a special national program to get out of this nonsense.. The development of nutritional deficiency is equivalent to forming an evil cycle. The opposition leader added that this has a negative impact on the country's productivity.

It comes as a price war intensifies between firms like BYD and Tesla in China, the world's biggest car market.

At the unveiling of the Speed Ultra 7 (SU7) last year, Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said the company aims to become one of the top five car makers in the world.

The smartphone giant has said it will invest $10bn (£7.8bn) in its vehicles business over the next 10 years.

Mr Lei said the SU7 was "super electric motor" technology which is capable of accelerating faster than some Tesla and Porsche EVs.

Xiaomi is also hoping that the car's shared operating system with its phones and other devices will appeal to existing customers.

### When I Become The President

*2024-03-12 20:34:02* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/when-i-become-the-president/) · `en`

Long ago, about 65 or more years ago, when I was a school boy, I remember writing an essay on the above subject. Don’t ask me what I wrote in that essay I remember nothing. I never thought I will have to write another essay on the same subject after almost a lifetime. This time it is serious as it is about the life and death of a nation.

The thought of becoming the president of this country is pure nonsense and useless wishful thinking. But it gives me a free hand to indulge in creative writing or day dreaming. It certainly is not going to be fiction or an irresponsible bed time story. It will be very serious and I am going to put to work all the gray matter, what little still left of it in my brain and all the warmth and hope, not much really, still left in my old, betrayed, dried up and broken heart.
