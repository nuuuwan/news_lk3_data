    "The NPP government has made the arrest and extradition of notorious underworld figure, Manudinu Padmasiri Perera alias Kehelbaddara Padme, and four other criminals a bigger spectacle than the defeat of the LTTE. Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala and IGP Priyantha Weerasuriya, accompanied by a host of senior police officers, rushed to the BIA on Saturday to oversee the arrival of Kehelbaddara Padme and others. (Wijepala and Weerasuriya are seen moving in tandem, much like the sea anemone and the hermit crab.) They made some boastful claims while jointly addressing the media, which also went overboard, even mentioning the exact locations where the extradited criminals were to be detained.",
    "The police, especially the CID, have received praise for a very successful operation. They richly deserve praise and much more. All police personnel who track down criminals and facilitate their extradition should be rewarded. Unfortunately, the CID lacked such high-Octane performance in early 2019, when it investigated some incidents in the run-up to the Easter Sunday terror attacks. Otherwise, it would have been able to prevent the terrorist bombings that claimed more than 275 lives.",
    "The extradition of criminals must not be turned into a political circus. Such missions are dangerous and best kept under wraps for the safety of the officers involved in them as well as the suspects. The capabilities of the underworld must not be underestimated. It may be recalled that in 2023 a criminal gang planned an attack on the CID headquarters to rescue two drug dealers, Nadun Chinthaka Wickramaratune alias Harak Kata and Salindu Malsitha Gunaratna also known as Kudu Salindu. We reported in November 2023 that a crack strike team made up of former and serving army commandos had been hired by the underworld for the rescue operation and they were to be paid as much as one billion rupees. Thankfully, their plan went awry. Circuses like the one we witnessed on Saturday can endanger the lives of not only the extradited criminals but also the police and security forces personnel escorting them.",
    "Pity the land whose leaders seek political mileage out of the extradition of criminals, one may say with apologies to Brecht. The Opposition including the JVP condemned the previous government\u2019s Operation Yukthiya against the netherworld of crime and narcotics as a political circus aimed at appeasing and distracting the irate public. That operation did not yield the intended results. The SLPP-UNP administration could not shore up its approval rating and collapsed, and the then IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon lost his job. But circuses continue under the incumbent government, and underworld activities have taken a turn for the worse. More than 50 lives have been lost in about 80 underworld shootings so far this year, according to media reports.",
    "One may recall that there was no political circus when Kumaran Pathmanathan (KP), the LTTE\u2019s main arms procurer and self-proclaimed successor of Prabhakaran\u2019s, was arrested in Malaysia and brought to Sri Lanka in 2009. By the time his arrest became known, he had already been brought to Colombo! IGP Weerasuriya, who never misses an opportunity to praise the current administration, has said operations like the one that led to the arrest and extradition of Kehelbaddara Padme and others are possible because the police are now free from political interference under the incumbent government. One is intrigued. Samarasinghe Arachchilage Makandure Madush Lakshitha aka Makandure Madush, known as Sri Lanka\u2019s Napoleon of Crime, was arrested in Dubai and brought back to Sri Lanka in April 2019, when Maithripala Sirisena was the President and Ranil Wickremesinghe the Prime Minister. Is it that the police were free from political interference at that as well?",
    "Referring to the extradition of Kehelbaddera Padme and others, IGP Weerasuriya, on Saturday, urged the media not to help lionise criminals, whom he called social dregs. One cannot but agree with the Police Chief on this score. Negative publicity may hurt the ordinary people but it paradoxically helps underworld figures by amplifying their notoriety, making them household names and instilling fear in communities. Publicity serves as a badge of power for criminals even if it is bad. Hence the need for the media to be cautious. However, the question is why IGP Weerasuriya and Minister Wijepala rushed to the BIA when some dregs, namely Kehelbaddara Padme and his associates were brought back. In doing so, they gave undue importance to those criminals, didn\u2019t they?",
