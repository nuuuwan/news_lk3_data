    "Sri Lanka\u2019s new government has responded to allegations over the lack of Muslim representation in its Cabinet of Ministers.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t form the Cabinet according to the race, religion or the cast. We have selected the persons who are very much capable to hold those ministerial portfolios,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.",
    "Responding to a question during today\u2019s Cabinet press briefing, he noted that the NPP government has in fact appointed a Muslim businessman as the Governor of the Western Province, and that the Deputy Speaker, one of the Deputy Ministers and that one of the National List MPs appointed from the Gampaha District are from the Muslim community.",
    "\u201cWe are serving the Sri Lankan nation. Not for the races, the religions and the cast,\u201d the minister stressed.",
    "\u201cWe appeal to the Muslim community don\u2019t consider these matters according to the race. Please see our new government and the Cabinet from the angle of the Sri Lankan nation. Then we can solve that problem,\u201d he added."
