    "Russia has launched the biggest air attack on Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian military told CNN, with an unprecedented number of drones and missiles fired at targets across the country, killing at least 26 people and injuring more than 120 others.",
    "The wave of attacks began overnight into Friday and struck nationwide, with blasts reported in the capital Kyiv, as well as at a maternity hospital in the central city of Dnipro, the eastern city of Kharkiv, the southeastern port of Odesa, and the western city of Lviv, far from the frontlines.",
    "The strikes continued Friday afternoon, Ukraine\u2019s air force said, as a barrage of missiles targeted the northern Cherkasy region, with one hitting the city of Smilla. Other missiles were detected from Russia\u2019s Kursk region heading towards the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we have seen so many enemy targets on our monitors in all regions and all directions,\u201d Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s air force, told national television. \u201cEverything was being fired.\u201d",
    "Russia used 158 drones and missiles, including hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, cruise missiles and Shahed drones, to strike targets in Kyiv, the east, south and west of the country, Ukraine\u2019s air force said.",
    "\u201cToday the enemy has struck a powerful blow. There are downed targets, however unfortunately there are also casualties,\u201d Ihnat added.",
    "The Polish military reported an \u201cunidentified airborne object\u201d entered Polish airspace from Ukrainian territory early Friday morning.

    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia used \u201cnearly every type of weapon in its arsenal\u201d in the \u201cterrorist strikes,\u201d to which he pledged Ukraine\u2019s military would respond.",
    "The massive overnight assault comes just days after Ukraine struck a Russian Navy landing ship in Crimea on Tuesday, causing severe damage to the vessel in another major blow to Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet.",
    "But the onslaught also came shortly after Ukraine received the last package of military aid from the United States until Congress approves the Biden administration\u2019s funding request.",
    "Nearly two years since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Zelensky is facing a largely-stalled counteroffensive while Western aid has begun to dry up.",
    "In Kyiv at least three people were killed and 28 injured, including 25 hospitalized, after Russia targeted a metro station and residential buildings. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been pulled from the rubble of a damaged warehouse in Shevchenkivskyi district, adding that rescue operations were ongoing.",

    "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Russia had targeted \u201cUkrainian women, children, the elderly, and civilians.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe crimes that Russia has committed in Ukraine today are its revenge for its inability to turn the tide of the battle in the fight against the Ukrainian defense forces,\u201d it said in a statement.",
    "Without referring directly to Friday\u2019s attacks, the Russian Defense Ministry said its army had \u201ccarried out 50 group strikes and one mass strike with high-precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles\u201d in the period from December 23 to 29, claiming it had only struck military targets.",

    "The Ukrainian Air Force said it recorded \u201cthe departure of 9 Tu-95MS strategic bombers from the \u2018Olenya\u2019 airfield in the Murmansk region of Russia.\u201d The Tu-95 bomber is a mainstay of Russia\u2019s aerial attacks on Ukraine, able to launch cruise missiles against its neighbor out of the range of most air-defense systems.",
    "In Kyiv, air raid sirens sounded for several hours overnight. Residents told CNN later Friday how they were woken by the attacks.",
    "\u201cIt was very loud, the house was shaking, it was very scary,\u201d said Viktoria Krasyuk. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve been living in this for many months, but it still causes emotions, it\u2019s still very difficult, it\u2019s very hard to decide whether to stay or go somewhere, or even leave (the country).\u201d",
    "A man named Sehiy told CNN the attack was a reminder that Russia\u2019s \u201cgoal is the same \u2013 to destroy Ukraine as a state.\u201d",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, Russia is learning to fight. It is learning to fight, including from us Ukrainians. They are accumulating ammunition, everything else they need,\u201d he said.",

    "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen missiles flying into Romania, as well as attack UAVs and debris. The same thing happened in Poland,\u201d he told Ukrainian television. \u201cThese things can happen under such massive attacks. The enemy is attacking the border areas in the west [of Ukraine] as well.\u201d",
    "In November 2022, a missile struck near the Polish village Przewodow, close to the border with Ukraine, killing two people. US officials later determined it was a Ukrainian S-300 air defense missile.",

    "\u201cThese sounds are what Russia really has to say. Our only collective response can and must be continued, robust, and long-term military and financial assistance to Ukraine. Only greater firepower can silence Russian terror.\u201d"
