    "The commotion agitated from various sects in Sri Lankan society targeted those who visited the State of Israel, including myself, labelling the delegation as those who are on the Mossad payroll, and it further questioned the moral reasoning of the Sri Lankan delegation, pushing them to the darkest corners of hell. While the critics\u2019 right to condemn Israel or anything related to Israel as scum bug is respected, the attendees to the Israel tour should have their own stances, reasoning what impetus drove them to join the delegation, and their side should be heard , at least to emulate the principle of natural justice.",
    "Several critics who wrote for Colombo Telegraph mocked those who joined the delegation, calling them vultures legitimizing Israel\u2019s state-sponsored terrorism in Gaza. They did so without knowing that the Sri Lankan delegates met the most vehement opponents of Netanyahu\u2019s government in Israel. Many activists we encountered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv strongly advocated for peace. If the tour was meant as a brainwashing campaign funded by the Israeli government, it would not have included critics who openly question Netanyahu\u2019s military actions in Gaza. This inclusion demonstrates a healthy aspect of Israeli democracy, the only functioning democracy in the Middle East.",
    "A larger proportion of allegations aimed at the Sri Lankan delegation to Israel refer to so-called Israeli activities in Sri Lanka that pave the way to create a Jewish paranoia, as it existed in the 1930s when Sinhalese nationalist journalist Hemapala Munidasa propagated the myth of forming Jewish Settlements in Sri Lanka. The current concerns of the critics resemble the same roots, mainly targeting the Israeli tourists visiting Sri Lanka and Chabad Houses and Kosher food outlets, in which the critics attempt to construct a villainous depiction of Israelis as invaders. To dispel the ignorance prevalent in the public, one needs to review those popular allegations one by one.",
    "Starting from Israeli tourists visiting Sri Lanka, especially those who served in the IDF, the vocal opponents tend to describe them as baby killers or assassins without knowing every Israeli is obliged to serve in the army as conscription is compulsory under the basic law. Depicting every Israeli as a mass killer is an imbecile act filled with vendetta towards Israelis. Furthermore, when Russian soldiers, who are engaged in a war in Ukraine, are not being questioned when they visit Sri Lanka, it exposes the hypocrisy of their argument.",
    "The second question critics raise is about the behavior of Israelis in tourist areas. They point to Israelis conducting prayers in Chabad houses and seeking kosher food as evidence of an expansionist attitude. This criticism is ironic and stems from a deep ignorance of Jewish culture in Sri Lanka. Just as Muslims seek halal food, Jews seek kosher food to follow the Torah and the laws of kashrut. Kosher food is part of Jewish religio-cultural identity, just as halal food is for Muslims. It is preposterous that some Muslims in Sri Lanka are suspicious of kosher food while they themselves adhere to halal food culture.",
    "Those who bemoan the nature of Chabad houses in Sri Lanka as an existential threat are still not aware of the purpose that lies behind the Chabad movement since its inception. Chabad house does not stand as a platform for conversion or missionary activities. On the contrary, it is akin to a community centre standing as a safe haven for Jewish visitors when they need spiritual guidance, which does not involve the local community. To put it bluntly, Chabad House is a fraternity limited to the Jews, devoid of ulterior motives. The clamor on Chabad Houses in Sri Lanka essentially stems from Muslim politicians who try to fabricate an alleged sinister motive or Zionist plan behind it, displaying their staunch opposition to the State of Israel. The question that comes to the fore is why aren\u2019t they raising the same concern about the influence of Gulf states in Sri Lanka to curb Wahabism, which has been the chief factor undermining the rich cultural tapestry of the Muslim community in Sri Lanka by polarising them within the society.",
    "Accusations against journalists visiting Israel\u2014labeling them as Mossad agents or Zionist sympathizers\u2014are tactics to suppress alternative perspectives that deserve consideration. The violent attacks by Hamas on October 7 at multiple sites, including Kirbutz and the Nova music festival, catalyzed the current Middle Eastern conflict. During their visit, Sri Lankan delegation members observed food distribution at Kerem Shalom and found it more organized than mainstream media reports about famine suggest. Food supplies within Gaza are reportedly controlled by Hamas, with its cadres allegedly appropriating much of the aid.",
    "On the face of it, the misplaced hysteria surrounding the visit made by Sri Lankan journalists to Israel is fuelled by shadowy factors intending to promote a sided narrative, in which the State of Israel stands as the perennial villain. The reaction received by Sri Lankan journalists for visiting Israel reveals how vulnerable Sri Lanka is before manufacturing consent, which systematically marginalizes dissent. The beguiling picture planted in Sri Lankan society is portrayed through the moral binaries: good vs evil, victim vs oppressor, and Palestine Vs Israel. When those who have planted them realize that these trajectories are at stake, they begin to question them on moral grounds. Denying the Israeli perspective shuns people\u2019s right to know the fullest story.",
