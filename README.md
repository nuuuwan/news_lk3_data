These include the exposure of former presidential advisors and their vehicles, the investigation ordered into the visa and passport controversies not to mention the peaceful conduct of the post-election celebrations which did not include any taking of revenge against those who had been in power. This is indeed a break with the past when the victors went on the rampage against their political opponents and included innocent ethnic and religious minorities in their frenzy.

*2024-09-30 23:49:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/more-excitement-for-sri-lankans-in-melbourne/) · `en`

Sri Lankans, Down Under, especially in Melbourne, are never short of entertainment. They have something exciting to look forward to, on a regular basis, and, invariably, it comes from Sri Lankan artistes…not domiciled in Australia.

Just recently we had the Gypsies who were involved in three ‘sold out’ concerts, in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide.

On Friday, 20th September, it was the turn of another popular Sri Lankan artiste to do the needful, in Australia – Melantha Perera.

He was featured at ‘Moratuwa Night’ held in Sydney, along with the band Redemption.

On 11th October, Melantha will be seen in action again, and this time in Melbourne, with the band Ebony, at the Walawwa (Sandown Regency).

Having built up a huge fan base, in Melbourne, Suzi Flückiger (better known as Suzi Croner in the local scene), is ready to give her fans another memorable happening.

Suzi is billed to appear at ‘Country Night’, scheduled for Saturday, 26th October, at The Grand On Princess.

### A political and policy tightrope awaits Sri Lanka’s new president

*2024-09-30 23:41:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/A-political-and-policy-tightrope-awaits-Sri-Lanka-s-new-president/14-767366) · `en`

Anura Kumara Dissanayake has emerged victorious in Sri Lanka’s Presidential election, held on 21 September 2024. Dissanayake, who obtained 42.3% of the votes, managed to secure victory over his closest competitor Sajith Premadasa, who gained 32.8% of votes.

This represents a historic change in the country. For the first time in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history, a candidate belonging to neither of the two main elite parties or their offshoots has come to power. Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe came in a distant third, with 17.3% of the votes. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, came fourth with a mere 2.6% of the votes.

### Triumph of an independent commission – a role model

A peaceful, fair, and corruption-free national election is a rare achievement for a developing, financially struggling country. However, we should take pride in our Election Commission, which excelled in planning, executing, counting, and releasing the results of a significant and complex election in a remarkably short time. Additionally, the Commission effectively mitigated post-election celebrations, preventing the violence and intimidation that often follow.

First, we must congratulate the Chairperson, R.M.A.L. Rathnayake, the Election Commission board members, and all staff for their outstanding work. Such recognition is seldom seen, even in the media, which tends to focus more on inflammatory stories that threaten peace.

### Old Wines in New Democracies:Education in the making

These are new times indeed. The country is in a celebratory mood. We have a brand new President, and a brand new Prime Minister, who would both enjoy an anticipated majority in Parliament – a government that has infused the people with much hope. Though we have not seen a decisive victory for the new President, the country has woken up to the remarkable change the Presidential election has ushered. The times are also critical. This is the first election after the protests of 2022 – the Aragalaya-Porattam-Struggle movement. Since independence we have seen a see-sawing between two traditional parties, the UNP and the SLFP and their offshoots, coalitions, etc. In Dissanayake, we have a completely new face, a new class of face, a new ethos of politics in the promise that corruption will be eliminated from the practice of governance.

What has to be understood is the fact that over the years, what has happened is that Governments have only ‘managed’ the economy, and that too not very well, and not developed the economy. This indicates that a fundamental change in thinking is required. To do so, a great change in thinking is urgently required. Though the political will to do so has been expressed, I am not too certain, that the process to achieve has been understood

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s United National Party (UNP) is open to naming Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa the prime minister pick for a common opposition alliance that will contest under a common symbol, a UNP spokesman said.

Following a meeting of parties supporting ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe held on Flower Road, Colombo, on Monday September 30, UNP member Saman Ratnapriya told reporters that discussions were held between the UNP and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) whose majority he said supports Wickremesinghe.

“There were discussions as UNP and as the majority group of the SLPP, and then the group led by former prime minister Dinesh Gunawardena had a discussion outside. The consensus among all of them is that there should be a common alliance under a common symbol.

“There is still room for the SJB to enter talks. But there is a question about whether the talks are going forward to the extent we had anticipated,” said Ratnapriya.

Is it reasonable for the Government to take on more debt to build tracks and commit taxpayer funds to a service that is incapable of even covering operational costs?

An outspoken activist justified his support for Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) because of the superiority of the manifesto proposals on public transport, especially railways. It’s possible that the actual decision was taken on some other basis, but the railway proposals shed light on a larger problem. I had studied the manifestos in detail but paid little attention to sector proposals, considering them irrelevant in the context of the financial constraints any successful candidate would have to work within in 2024-29.

In plain language, IMF is only about getting back to the rotten and festering past. The “change” that AKD and NPP promised should be a better socio-economic life with peace and decency around and the security forces back in barracks. Perhaps, AKD needs a new open discourse outside the NPP before formulating his 2025 annual budget

“Many steps have to be taken during a considerably long period, to achieve the ‘change’ we aspire. They nevertheless need ensuring stability and trust in this present economy. We have therefore decided to begin discussions with the IMF as soon as possible to move ahead with the Extended Fund Facility” – President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his first address to the nation on 25 September 2024 (translated from Sinhala script).

Generally, changes are fundamental, dynamic, and demanding, so they are not time-bound. Some changes can be quick, others take time, and some are long-term. AKD/NPP will make changes on priority and step by step, along with what he promised. However, the impact of any change on the masses and the country must be positive; people must be able to feel, understand, and be convinced. Only then could the welfare and well-being of the masses be enhanced, step by step, in the right direction

Since March 2024, I have written 24 articles about the change Sri Lanka and its people have wanted since 1948, and the AKD/NPP has committed accordingly. The change that the people and the country want to witness is massive in terms of economic, social, political, cultural, and many more. A peaceful or nonviolent Presidential election marked the beginning of the realisation of change, while the opposition advocated violent polls because of their bankruptcy in many ways.

However, this change somewhat in 2024, voters are making decisions based on policies than just for a party. This sentiment is reflected in the over 4.7 million voters (out of 6.9 million) who previously voted for the former President but have now supported the current President, Anura Kumara Dissanayake. This is a clear objection and a mandate to keep them out and initiate a complete system change. Additionally, those who voted for the current President on September 21st, along with a growing number of others, are advocating for legislation that would permanently disqualify corrupt politicians from holding any elected or appointed positions in the future.

### Israel said to inform US of plans for imminent limited ground op in Lebanon

Israel is planning a limited ground operation in Lebanon that may start imminently, Israel has told the United States, the Washington Post reports citing an unidentified US official.

The operation will be smaller than Israel’s 2006 war against Hezbollah and will focus on security for border communities, the official says.

*2024-09-30 22:01:00* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/corruption-in-sri-lanka-a-historical-overview-of-political-mismanagement/) · `en`

For the past 76 years, Sri Lanka has grappled with pervasive corruption that has deeply entrenched itself within the political fabric of the nation. Successive regimes, particularly the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the Rajapaksa family, have been accused of mismanagement and theft, leading to the deterioration of the country’s assets and the suffering of its citizens.

The political landscape of Sri Lanka has largely been dominated by a few powerful families whose governance has often prioritized personal gain over national welfare. These regimes have systematically depleted the country’s resources, leaving Sri Lanka in a precarious economic position. Many citizens believe that the wealth generated by the country’s natural resources and public enterprises has been siphoned off, with assets being transferred to foreign lands.

The strongest man is never strong enough to be always master, unless lie transforms his power into right, and obedience to duty.

At the time my story begins, a routine civil service transfer had me moved as Assistant Secretary in the prime minister’s office which was without doubt the most exalted and powerful institution in Sri Lanka. For the first 30 years of the new state’s existence, its place in the political structure remained unchallenged and unchanged. The role of the prime minister as the keystone of the arch in a Westminster-style government was paramount. It was only much later, after the second Republican Constitution in 1978 and the creation of the Executive Presidency with its enormous concentration of power, that the position of the prime minister became as it now is, devoid of constitutional authority, largely decorative’ and what its holder is able to make of it.
