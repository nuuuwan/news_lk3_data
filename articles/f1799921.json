    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s leftist opposition party National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has shot back at main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) asking the party to suggest alternative dates for the proposed debate between the two parties\u2019 leaders.",
    "The NPP\u2019s Nalinda Jayatissa, who has been tasked with overseeing the organisation of the debate from the NPP\u2019s end, told reporters on Thursday April 25 that, since all political parties are going to be busy in the run up to Labour Day on May 01, the SJB can propose three or four dates before May 20.",
    "\u201cLetters have been exchanged on this debate between the presidential candidates of the NPP and the SJB, but there is still no consensus the date of the debate,\u201d said Jayatissa.",
    "\u201cFrom our end, we have proposed four dates: May 7, 9, 13 and 14. But the SJB has responded that it was a unilateral declaration of dates and the opposition leader can\u2019t make it on those dates as he is very busy. Okay. In that case, we ask the SJB to [propose alternative dates],\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s not do this till May 01 since everyone is going to be busy till then. So propose to us three or four dates before May 20. On one of those dates, our leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake will definitely attend,\u201d added Jayatissa.",
    "The SJB said on Tuesday that it will formally write to the NPP this week inviting a representative for a discussion on a mutually agreeable date for an election debate.",
    "SJB legislator Nalin Bandara said the party will write to Jayatissa for a discussion on either Thursday April or Friday 26 on a time, date and venue for the proposed debate.",
    "This is despite the NPP having already written to the SJB inviting the latter\u2019s leader Sajith Premadasa for a debate with NPP leader Dissanayake on May 7, 9, 13 or 14.",
    "Both parties have been accusing the other of trying to avoid the calls for a debate in the run-up to the presidential election.",
    "The leftist NPP, controlled by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), currently lead at least one opinion poll, significantly ahead of the SJB. (Colombo/Apr25/2024)"
