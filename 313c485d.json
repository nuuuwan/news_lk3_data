    "While acknowledging the ongoing efforts to replace the PTA, the Core Group urged the Sri Lankan government to ensure that terrorism legislation is consistent with the country\u2019s international obligations.",
    "The Core Group\u2019s statement also stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, inclusivity and of building meaningfully on past work and recommendations that address the root causes of conflict and impunity.",
