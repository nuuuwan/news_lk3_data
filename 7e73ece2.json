    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Sri Lanka is looking to qualify for the Cricket World Cup in India in October, if it can defeat hosts Zimbabwe in an ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier Super Sixes match at Bulawayo today.",
    "Sri Lanka is leading the points table with six points and a high net run rate of +1.832, and will qualify if they beat Zimbabwe. The Lankans have one more game to play versus the West Indies, but this would become a dead rubber if they win today. A loss today to Zimbabwe would make the West Indies match a must-win game.",
    "Zimbabwe, which is also on 6 points but has a lower net run rate of just +0.752, is also hoping for a win. But a win today would not automatically qualify it for the Word Cup, as they face third-placed Scotland in a must-win game on Tuesday. Scotland currently has just four points and a net run rate of +0.188, but can qualify if it wins against Zimbabwe and fourth-placed Netherlands, or with one more win if Zimbabwe lose both of its matches.",
    "The Dutch only have a very slim chance of qualifying with just 2 points and a net run rate of -0.560, but it has the easiest remaining matches, versus Scotland and Oman.",
    "The West Indies and Oman have already crashed out of contention as both have zero points, although both have two matches to play.",
