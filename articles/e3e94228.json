    "Sri Lanka\u2019s leading business figures made a strong call for biodiversity-driven economic revival at the launch of the landmark book, \u2018Discovery: Additions to the Flora of Ceylon\u2019 authored by Dr. Himesh Dilruwan Jayasinghe, under the guidance of biodiversity scientist Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda. The launch brought to the fore the inextricable link between nature and national prosperity\u2014particularly tourism, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and green growth.",
    "Speaking at the event, at the \u2018Genesis by Dilmah in Colombo\u2019 recently, Malik Fernando, chair of MJF Leisure and co-chair of MJF Holdings, made a striking admission: \u201cDespite Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda calling me a naysayer, I\u2019m actually a huge fan of nature, he said with a smile, adding that he had just booked out an entire hotel, some 2,500 copies of Himesh\u2019s book, in anticipation of increased eco-tourism interest. \u201cWhat Himesh has done is nothing short of remarkable. As the government rightly identifies tourism as the engine of economic growth, it is vital to remember that nature\u2014our forests, wetlands, our 50 shades of green\u2014is the core of that engine.\u201d",
    "Fernando stressed the pressing risks posed by environmental degradation, warning that biodiversity loss could cripple tourism\u2014an industry that accounts for 15% of Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP. \u201cOur very economy is threatened by the vanishing of our biodiversity. Forests are drying out. Wetlands are shrinking. The unique experience Sri Lanka offers to travelers is under existential threat.\u201d",
    "He also called for sustainable tourism policies and emphasized the direct economic value of preserving biodiversity. \u201cIn a small island like ours, where you can travel from rainforests to dry zones within hours, our ecological wealth is our competitive advantage.\u201d",
    "Adding gravitas to the business case for conservation, Dilhan C. Fernando, chairman of Dilmah Tea, reminded the audience of the foundational role nature plays in crafting Ceylon tea\u2014the country\u2019s most iconic export. \u201cSunshine, wind, rainfall and soil\u2014these aren\u2019t just poetic elements, they are the architects of our tea, he said.",
    "He shared a deeply personal narrative about his father, Merrill J. Fernando, the legendary founder of Dilmah, who built the business on a philosophy of kindness\u2014towards people and the planet. \u201cMy father didn\u2019t go to business school. He followed my grandmother\u2019s principle of kindness. And that kindness extended to nature, because no business can flourish without it.\u201d",
    "The tea magnate stressed that biodiversity is not just a moral or ecological imperative, but a business necessity. \u201cOver 50% of global GDP depends on nature. Forty-four trillion dollars. Just think about that. Whether it\u2019s medicine, water, air or even advertising\u2014there\u2019s nothing more innovative or creatively complex than what nature produces.\u201d",
    "Fernando also cited the butterfly garden recently launched by Dilmah Conservation as more than just a conservation initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s a design lab. A place where we study ecosystem services and food security. Butterflies aren\u2019t just pretty\u2014they\u2019re indicators of ecosystem health, which is crucial for everything from agriculture to medicine.\u201d",
