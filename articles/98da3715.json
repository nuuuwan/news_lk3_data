  "original_body_lines": [
    "The UK and 27 other countries have called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, where they say the suffering of civilians has \u201creached new depths\u201d.",
    "A joint statement says Israel\u2019s aid delivery model is dangerous and condemns what it calls the \u201cdrip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians\u201d seeking food and water.",
    "Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said more than 100 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while waiting for food over the weekend and that 19 others died as a result of malnutrition.",
    "Israel\u2019s foreign ministry rejected the countries\u2019 statement, saying it was \u201cdisconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas\u201d.",
    "The ministry accused the armed group of spreading lies and undermining aid distribution, rather than agreeing to a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
    "There have been many international statements condemning Israel\u2019s tactics in Gaza during the past 21 months of its war with Hamas. But this declaration is notable for its candour.",
    "The signatories are the foreign ministers of the UK and 27 other nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland.",
    "The statement begins by declaring that \u201cthe war in Gaza must end now\u201d.",
    "It then warns: \u201cThe suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government\u2019s aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity.",
    "\u201cWe condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food. It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid.",
    "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy later told the House of Commons a \u201clitany of horrors\u201d was taking place in Gaza, including strikes that have killed \u201cdesperate, starving children\u201d.",
    "Announcing an extra \u00a340m of humanitarian assistance for Gaza this year, Lammy said he was \u201ca steadfast supporter of Israel\u2019s security and its right to exist\u201d but the government\u2019s actions were \u201cdoing untold damage to Israel\u2019s standing in the world and undermining Israel\u2019s long-term security\u201d.",
    "There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while waiting for food since May, when Israel partially eased an 11-week total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza and, along with the US, helped to establish a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to bypass the existing one overseen by the UN.",
    "Israel has said the GHF\u2019s system, which uses US private security contractors to hand out food parcels from sites inside Israeli military zones, prevents supplies being stolen by Hamas.",
    "But the UN and its partners have refused to co-operate with the system, saying it is unsafe and violates the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence.",
    "Last Tuesday, the UN human rights office said it had recorded 674 killings in the vicinity of the GHF\u2019s aid sites since they began operating eight weeks ago. Another 201 killings had been recorded along routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added.",
    "On Saturday, another 39 people were killed near two GHF sites in Khan Younis and nearby Rafah, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots to prevent \u201csuspects\u201d approaching them before the sites opened.",
    "And on Sunday, the ministry said 67 people were killed as they surged toward a convoy of UN aid lorries near a crossing point in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a crowd \u201cto remove an immediate threat\u201d but disputed the numbers killed.",
    "Following the incident, the World Food Programme warned that Gaza\u2019s hunger crisis had \u201creached new levels of desperation\u201d.",
    "\u201cPeople are dying from lack of humanitarian assistance. Malnutrition is surging with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment,\u201d the UN agency said.",
    "Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday that 19 people had died as a result of malnutrition since Saturday and warned of potential \u201cmass deaths\u201d in the coming days.",
    "\u201cHospitals can no longer provide food for patients or staff, many of whom are physically unable to continue working due to extreme hunger,\u201d Dr Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, told the BBC.",
    "\u201cHospitals cannot provide a single bottle of milk to children suffering from hunger, because all baby formula has run out from the market,\u201d he added.",
    "Residents also reported that markets were closed due to food shortages.",
    "\u201cMy children cry from hunger all night. They\u2019ve had only a small plate of lentils over the past three days. There\u2019s no bread. A kilogramme of flour was $80 (\u00a359) a week ago,\u201d Mohammad Emad al-Din, a barber and father of two, told the BBC.",
    "The statement by the 27 countries also says Israeli proposals to move Gaza\u2019s entire 2.1 million into a so-called \u201chumanitarian city\u201d in the southern Rafah area are unacceptable, noting that \u201cpermanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law\u201d.",
    "They urge Israel, Hamas and the international community to \u201cbring this terrible conflict to an end, through an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire\u201d.",
    "And they warn that they are \u201cprepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire and a political pathway to security and peace\u201d.",
    "That is seen by many as code for recognising a state of Palestine, something many countries have done but not all, including the UK and France.",
    "\u201cAll statements and all claims should be directed at the only party responsible for the lack of a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire: Hamas, which started this war and is prolonging it,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cInstead of agreeing to a ceasefire, Hamas is busy running a campaign to spread lies about Israel. At the same time, Hamas is deliberately acting to increase friction and harm to civilians who come to receive humanitarian aid,\u201d he added.",
    "The Israeli military said earlier this month that it recognised there had been incidents in which civilians had been harmed while seeking aid and that it was working to minimise \u201cpossible friction between the population and the [Israeli] forces as much as possible\u201d.",
    "The Israeli military body responsible for co-ordinating aid, Cogat, also said on Monday that Israel \u201cacts in accordance with international law and is leading efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in co-ordination with the international organisations\u201d.",
    "A spokesperson for the GHF meanwhile appealed to UN agencies to join its operation while also blaming them for \u201cstopping\u201d work and for failing to deliver supplies across the territory.",
    "Chapin Fay told journalists that he had been to border crossings where he saw aid supplies \u201crotting\u201d because UN agencies would not deliver them.",
    "The Israeli foreign ministry said on Sunday that 700 lorry loads of aid were waiting to be picked up by the UN from crossings.",
    "The UN has said it struggles to pick up and distribute supplies because of the ongoing hostilities, Israeli restrictions on humanitarian movements, and fuel shortages.",
    "The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
    "At least 59,029 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry."
