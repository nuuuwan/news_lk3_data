    "Steps will be taken to replace the fuel price formula with a maximum retail price, thereby creating a fuel competitiveness that benefits the country, State Minister of Power and Energy D.V. Chanaka said.",
    "Meanwhile, he assured that a Maximum Retail Price (MRP) will be stipulated by the Government to all fuel companies under the price formula from August.",
    "The State Minister also said that a decision is expected to be taken regarding the QR code after discussions with all the parties in the future.",
    "He expressed these views today (23) during a media conference themed \u2018Collective Path to a Stable Country\u2019 held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC).",
    "The Minister said the first fuel shipment of China\u2019s Sinopec, which signed a contract to enter the Sri Lankan fuel market, will arrive in the country early next month.",
    "He said the fuel price formula existed only for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation until now and that steps will be taken to set a maximum retail price using the price formula to affect all companies through this new system.",
    "\"The Ministry will decide only the maximum retail price in the future. The companies will then be able to provide fuel at a price of their choice subject to the maximum price. This will create competition among fuel companies resulting in reduced fuel prices,\" he said.",

    "\"By the first week of next month, a ship with a cargo of fuel from Sinopec is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka signed a contract agreement with Sinopec in May this year, in response to the ongoing foreign exchange crisis,\" he said."
