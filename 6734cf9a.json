    "Former MP Hirunika Premachandra who expressed frustration on the current situation of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), slammed the party leadership saying the SJB top brass trusts only two-faced crooks.",
    "\u201cThere are two-faced crooks in the SJB who stay with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa during day time but wine and dine with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the night. These SJBers are snakes. However, the party leader trusts only them instead of us who are committed to the party,\u201d Ms. Premachandra told a party meeting.",
    "\u201cPlease talk to Mr. Premadasa and try to put him on the right track,\u201d she told party National Organizer Tissa Attanayake who was at the meeting.",
    "\u201cThose who meet Wickremesinghe tell us that they have been offered ministries. These people will join the President even if they are re-elected to Parliament from the SJB ticket. Mr. Wickremeisnghe never talks to me as he is fully aware that I will tell him a thing or two if he calls me,\u201d she added.",
    "\u201cNo one would have dared to associate with the President if the SJB leader had taken disciplinary action against MPs such as Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakakra who initially crossed over to the government,\u201d she added. (Yohan Perera)"
