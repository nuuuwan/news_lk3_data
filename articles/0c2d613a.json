  "original_body_lines": [
    "Hezbollah left the door open to a negotiated ceasefire on Tuesday after Israeli forces made new incursions in Lebanon, and Israel\u2019s defence minister said another senior official from the Iran-backed group appeared to have been killed.",
    "In what could be the latest in a series of major blows to Hezbollah, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it appeared the replacement for slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had been \u201celiminated\u201d.",
    "Hashem Safieddine, a top Hezbollah official, was widely expected to succeed Nasrallah. Safieddine has not been heard from publicly since an Israeli airstrike late last week.",
    "\u201cHezbollah is an organization without a head. Nasrallah was eliminated, his replacement was probably also eliminated,\u201d Gallant told officers at the Israeli military\u2019s northern command centre, in a brief video segment distributed by the military.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no one to make decisions, no one to act,\u201d he said, without providing further details.",
    "In a televised speech, Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem, said he supported attempts to secure a truce, and for the first time did not mention the end of war in Gaza as a pre-condition to halting combat on the Lebanon-Israel border.",
    "Qassem said Hezbollah supported attempts by Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, to secure a halt to fighting, which has escalated in recent weeks with the Israeli ground incursions and the killing of top Hezbollah leaders.",
    "\u201cWe support the political activity being led by Berri under the title of a ceasefire,\u201d Qassem said in his 30-minute televised address.",
    "It was not clear whether this signalled any change in stance, after a year in which the group has said it is fighting in support of the Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, and would not stop without a ceasefire there.",
    "Speaking in front of curtains from an undisclosed location, Qassem said the conflict with Israel was a war about who cries first, and Hezbollah would not cry first. The group\u2019s capabilities were intact despite \u201cpainful blows\u201d from Israel.",
    "\u201cWe are striking them. We are hurting them and we will prolong the time. Dozens of cities are within range of the resistance\u2019s missiles. We assure you that our capabilities are fine,\u201d said Qassem.",
    "His televised address comes 11 days after the killing of Nasrallah, the most devastating setback Israel has dealt its foe in decades. Qassem said the group would elect a new secretary general and announce it once it has been done.",
    "Israel kept up the pressure on Hezbollah on Tuesday by killing another one of its senior figures and launching new operations in southern Lebanon.",
    "Qassem said Israel had yet to advance after ground clashes that broke out in south Lebanon a week ago.",
    "\u201cIn any case, after the issue of a ceasefire takes shape, and once diplomacy can achieve it, all of the other details can be discussed and decisions can be taken,\u201d Qassem said.",
    "\u201cIf the enemy (Israel) continues its war, then the battlefield will decide.\u201d",
    "The regional tensions triggered a year ago by Palestinian armed group Hamas\u2019 attack on southern Israel have spiralled in recent weeks into a series of Israeli operations by land and air against Lebanon. On Oct. 1, Iran, sponsor of both Hezbollah and Hamas, fired missiles at Israel.",
    "Iran warned Israel on Tuesday against any retliatory attacks. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said any attack on Iran\u2019s infrastructure will be met with retaliation.",
    "Araqchi will visit Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East starting on Tuesday. In a video on state media he said the aim of his trip was discuss ways \u201cto prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon in continuation of the crimes in Gaza\u201d.",
    "Sources have told Reuters that Gulf Arab states have sought to reassure Tehran of their neutrality in the conflict.",
    "On the ground, the area of Israeli operations in Lebanon has been expanding. The Israeli military said it was conducting \u201climited, localised, targeted operations\u201d in Lebanon\u2019s southwest, having previously announced such operations in the southeast.",
    "A World Food Programme official voiced concern about Lebanon\u2019s food supply, saying thousands of hectares of farmland across the country\u2019s south has burned or been abandoned.",
    "\u201cAgriculture-wise, food production-wise, (there is) extraordinary concern for Lebanon\u2019s ability to continue to feed itself,\u201d Matthew Hollingworth, WFP country director in Lebanon, told a Geneva press briefing, adding that harvests will not occur and produce is rotting in fields.",
    "World Health Organization official Ian Clarke in Beirut told the same briefing that there was a much higher risk of disease outbreaks among Lebanon\u2019s displaced population.",
    "Israel\u2019s military struck Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs overnight again and said it had killed a figure responsible for Hezbollah\u2019s budgeting and logistics, Suhail Hussein Husseini, in what would be the latest in a string of Israeli assassinations of leaders and commanders of Hezbollah and Hamas.",
    "Many Israelis have regained confidence in their long-vaunted military and intelligence after deadly blows in recent weeks to the command structure of Hezbollah.",
    "The situation in Lebanon is getting worse by the day, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told the European Parliament, calling for a ceasefire. Some 20% of the Lebanese population had been forced to move, he said."
