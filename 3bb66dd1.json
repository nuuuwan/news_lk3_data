    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Tourism Promotion Bureau is in the process of clearing barriers to marine tourism, including leisure activities on yatchs, Managing Director Nalin Perera said.",
    "Yatch cruise operators have earlier complained that a specified International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) requirement by Sri Lanka\u2019s Directorate of Merchant Shipping which was not demanded by countries like Thailand or Red Sea nations was blocking \u2018live aboard\u2019 cruises.",
    "One reason was that Sri Lanka did not have a proper classification criteria for marine tourism, Perera said.",
    "\u201cThe classification has been finalized, but there are few areas we are getting the ADB assistance to clear that one up,\u201d Perera said.",
    "Sri Lanka has dozes of sunken wrecks which can be used to promote diving, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.",
    "Sri Lanka is surrounded by the sea, but the island neither has a domestic yatch culture, nor yatch based tourism activities like liveaboard diving cruises.",
    "Sri Lanka wants to promote a range of marine linked tourism activities as well wider use of yatchs including attracting owners to park their luxury yaths in Sri Lanka, Tourims Minister Fernando said.  (Colombo/Jan14/2024)"
