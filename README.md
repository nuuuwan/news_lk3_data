### Sri Lankans must improve to render system change successful

*2024-12-01 01:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lankans-must-improve-to-render-system-change-successful/) · `en`

“It is not possible to develop a country without the moral development of man. Let us develop the country along with moral development (of man)” So pronounced Most Ven Madihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Thero. This translation from Sinhala is by Ven Vajiraramaya Nanaseeha Thera – previously Deshabandhu Olcott Gunasekera – who was one who assisted the venerable bhikkhu to establish the Dharmavijaya Foundation in 1977. The Foundation later adopted this truth as its mission statement. Moral development connotes character building.

The thought about the quirks and misdemeanours of most Sri Lankans which ultimately tarnish the wellbeing and image of the country has long been in mind and discussed frequently when we older generations meet and grow nostalgic of how things were back then. We most definitely had a much better life, though sans TV and all these advances, since peace and general goodness prevailed.

(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: Maverick with the Midas touch, biography of Nahil Wijesuriya)

It was on July 29, 2002. Nahil received a call from Mahen Thambiah at around 9:30 p.m. informing him that Roshanne had met with an accident while crossing the main road at Wattala after leaving a party celebrating the home coming of Mohan Lanerolle Jr and his new bride.

It was around 9.00 p.m when Roshanne left the party with Ryan Raymond, who was to give her a ride back to Colombo. Rayan had parked his vehicle on the opposite side of the Colombo/Negombo road and since the road was busy while crossing they got to the centre until the traffic eased when a van driven by a person under the influence, drove close past Ryan and Roshanne accidently knocking them with the side view mirror of the vehicle.

“The Prime Minister felt betrayed. She was embarrassed, bitter and angry. She was sensitive to Mrs. Gandhi’s feelings”

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.

### The Elusive Rs. 1,700

It is now six months since Ranil Wickramasinghe announced at the Kotagala May Day Rally of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress that the daily wages of estate workers would be increased to Rs. 1,700 and that they would be paid Rs 80 for every kilogram of green leaf plucked above the norm. The government gazetted the decision as an order from the Commissioner of Labour, the daily wage being made up to Rs. 1,700 by adding a Rs. 350 special allowance not liable to statutory payments of EPF and ETF to the basic wage of Rs 1,350. However, the Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) obtained an interim injunction against implementing the gazette as they were legally challenging the decision as being unilateral and arbitrary.

### Fine sportsman, great debater, big appetite but weak stomach

Dudley Senanayake in the short Parliament of March to July 1960

Family and background had been central in Dudley Senanayake’s case too. Greatness had literally been thrust on him when he had been appointed prime minister on the death of his father D S, in 1952. That had been a time of intrigue and maneuvering which had soured the relations between Sir John, his close relative and him.

Sir John had struck back with the Premier Stakes which he later denied having any connection with. So Dudley had been anxious to win his spurs for himself through the hustings as early as possible. And he had proved his legitimacy by winning the 1952 elections handsomely, helped by the sympathy vote created by the death of his father. But his first stint as prime minister did not last long. Plagued by illness, chronic gastritis and the hartal of August 1953 which resulted in police firing and some civilian deaths, Dudley resigned.

### SHALL WE SHOP TODAY?

The one phrase calculated to galvanize any young person into flying out of bed is that magic question, “Shall we shop today?”

“Where, where?” To KitKat, my granddaughter, the word ‘shopping’ has a sort of intonation that no other sound can equal. It is an incantation of magic.

Really, I am so crafty I surprise myself. I need KitKat to help me carry a few new books from Vijitha Yapa Bookshop to my car plus a few household necessities.

She bounds out of bed and is ready so fast I have barely time to turn round and catch my breath before casually mentioning that I do need to have a short stop at the Crescat Supermarket before treating ourselves to those Palaces of Delight — namely the new clothes shops opening up all over the city these days. She resigns herself to my perfidy.

“I knew you’d make me pay for this,” says she. “I trust you will make it worth my while,” she adds sternly.

“How much will it take?” I am cautious. KitKat’s ideas of economy do not exactly dovetail with mine.
