(Excerpted from Render unto Caesar – Memoirs of Bradman Weerakoon)

Two highly personal life-defining events occurred in 1956. One was my marriage in August to Damayanthi and the other the death of my father in late September.

Damayanthi Gunasekera was the third daughter of a friend of my father’s who joined the colonial police at about the same time as Station House Officers. They both served for 35 years before retiring as superintendent in charge of districts. But more than that, Damayanthi’s mother was a Weerakoon from the same village as my father – Payagala in the Kalutara district – and a second or third cousin as well.

Damayanthi’s mother who wed at the age of 14 was said to be a beauty and it was rumoured in family circles that my father. as a young police officer, was seriously interested in her. Be that as it may my parents were really pleased when the proposal from the Gunasekera side came along.

### Trump creates an even bigger threat than “immigrant vermin” – The Enemy Within

The American economy is the envy of the world – The Economist, Oct. 19, 2024

The November presidential election, a mere two weeks away, still remains deadlocked.

The Trump campaign keeps gloating that Trump has the confidence of the American electorate on two key issues – management of the economy and immigration.

This week’s Economist follows its headline as shown above with the sub-head that the American economy has left the economies of other rich countries in the dust.

Economists agree that during the last four years, the economy has performed remarkably well. The Biden/Harris economy has achieved a record job growth of 15.7 million new jobs within four years, the highest new job growth for a presidential term in history. Wages are increasing faster than prices – the annual inflation rate is now at 2.2%. The Federal Reserve Board reduced interest rates by half a point in September, and is expected to reduce rates another half point in November.

### The possible future of foreign policy in Sri Lanka

*2024-10-21 15:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-possible-future-of-foreign-policy-in-sri-lanka/) · `en`

The last two weeks suggest that the NPP is moving to the centre, most probably in a bid to grapple with the challenges of a slim majority. The new government has announced that it will oppose the upcoming UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka. This indicates that it is moving to embrace the nationalist space that was previously held by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family, but has since bifurcated, if not trifurcated. As Harendra Dassanayake and Rajni Gamage recently observed, the Sinhala Buddhist space in Sri Lanka currently lacks a leader. The NPP appears to have caught the most vocally articulate sections of this milieu.

One by one the lights go out. In a span of seven months, Sri Lanka’s Engineering fraternity and the country’s progressive political fraternity have lost three of their kind, one after another. Chris Rodrigo was the first to go in March, then it was Bahu in July, and now it is Kumar David, the oldest of the three. Professor Kumar David passed away in Los Angeles, on Monday, October 14. He was 83 years old.

He had been in declining health for some time after a cataract surgery that did not go as smoothly as such surgeries do. But on his annual visit to Sri Lanka earlier in May, he seemed to be in good spirits, and he was closely following from LA the results of the September presidential election in Sri Lanka. He was obviously pleased with the results and would have been hoping to see their consolidation in November. That was not to be. His was a long life, well lived, yet the end came too suddenly and too painfully for many of us.
