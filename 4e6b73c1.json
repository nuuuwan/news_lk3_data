  "original_title": "The Abduction and Killing of  Human Rights Activist and  Lawyer K.Kanthasamy by the EROS 35 Years ago.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Political struggle of the Sri Lankan Tamils to have their grievances redressed and lost rights restored has brought forth many \u201cquiet\u201d heroes. I say quiet because these persons never sought publicity or praise. They gave up their comfortable existence and  served  their community in many ways. Many of them refused to kowtow before  authoritative Governments as well as autocratic armed groups. Some of them paid the supreme price for their courageous defiance. Sadly the sacrificial contributions made by such people is unacknowledged and even forgotten.This week\u2019s column focuses on such a person. A man who accomplished much for his people but was cruelly abducted and killed 35 years ago  by the armed Tamil group EROS (Eelam Revolutionary Organization )",
    "Kandiah Kanthasamy was a Jaffna-born  lawyer who  enjoyed a lucrative practice in Colombo. Yet he  turned his life around by transforming himself into a human rights lawyer and human rights activist. He also dedicated himself to a life of service that attempted in many ways to alleviate the suffering of thousands of Tamils displaced by the anti-Tamil violence of 1977,1981 and 1983 and  also during the military conflict in the North and East of Sri Lanka. Kandasamy also strove in multiple ways to highlight the racist discrimination and human rights violations targeting Tamils and draw international attention.",
    "Among the many organizations and institutions he set up or played a key role in setting up were the Tamil Refugees Rehabilitation Organisation (Colombo, later Jaffna), Central British Fund For Tamil Refugees  (UK); Theepan  Research Institute (Jaffna); New Era Publication Ltd, publishers of  Saturday Review of (Jaffna), Home For Human  Rights (Jaffna) , Tamil Information Centre (UK) Tamil Information Centre, later Tamil Information and Research Unit (Madras), Tamil Information Centre (Madurai); Movement For Integration Of Refugees and Repatriates (Madurai). He was also engaged in the process of establishing in Jaffna  an  institute for Communication Research and  another Institute for  Development Research when he was abducted and killed  by the Tamil militant group Eelam Revolutionary Organization (EROS). The 35th anniversary of his demise was observed last June.",
    "Why then did the EROS  abduct and kill Kanthsamy a man who did so much for the Tamil people?Likewise why did Tamil militant groups at different times kill so many Tamils who served the Tamil people to the best of their ability? The standard answer to these questions is \u2013  the wrong course adopted by those involved in the Tamil armed struggle!",
    "Before writing in detail about the life of Kanthsamy and his positive, constructive contribution to the welfare and betterment of the Tamil people, I wish to place on record my personal relationship with Kantha as he was generally known. However I used to call him Kantha Annan (elder brother)",
    "In those days the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF)  Colombo branch  used to hold a weekly meeting every Wednesday that was open to the public. It was at these meetings  that I first met Kanthsamy and became acquainted with him. I was not a journalist then.",
    "I  became a journalist in 1977 by joining the \u201cVirakesari\u201d as a Staff Reporter. Thereafter Kanthasamy interacted with me more frequently discussing politics and current affairs.  The first lead story written by me for the \u201dVirakesari\u201d was due to a tip- off given by Kantha.",
    "The August 1977 anti-Tamil violence brought us closer as I did some volunteer work for the Tamil Refugee Rehabilitation Organization(TRRO) that he was instrumental in setting up. I worked closely with  TRRO secretary Kanthasamy and President KC Nythiananda in the TRRO\u201ds initial stages until a formal structure was established for the organization. We used to meet daily at KC\u2019s residence at  17, Frances road, Wellawatte. Incidentally  EPDP leader and cabinet minister Douglas Devananda also used to stay there then. Deva was Nythananda\u2019s nephew and a student at Colombo Hindu College.",
    "President JR Jayewardene appointed a one man commission to probe the 1977 anti-Tamil violence. Former Chief Justice MC Sansoni held sittings in places like Jaffna,Colombo, Kandy and Anuradhapura in this regard. When the Sansoni commission sat in Anuradhapura in 1978 I was assigned by the \u201cVirakesari\u201d to cover proceedings in A\u2019pura.  The  team of lawyers representing the TRRO  comprised K.Kanthasamy, Leslie Bartlett, AP Niles and K. Sittampalam.",
    "Even as Sansoni Commission proceedings were on, several  hand written posters were plastered on Anuradhapura city walls threatening Tamils. I told Kantha about it and he promptly informed  Justice Sansoni who instructed the Police to investigate. A police inspector  informed Mr. Sansoni after a while that there were no such posters and that it was a canard. This placed Kanthasamy in an awkward position vis a vis Sansoni.likewise I was placed in such a position with Kanthasamy.",
    "I then went out  and walked on the streets and saw the posters on the walls. They were very visible.Obviously the Police had lied. I noted down the exact positions of where the posters were. I also took the bold step of tearing down an anti-Tamil poster off  the wall  in broad daylight and took it to the commission. Many people saw me doing this but none interfered.",
    "I gave Kanthasamy the poster and my notes about some of the spots where the posters were. He took me to Justice Sansoni\u2019s chambers. When I told Sansoni what had happened  and showed him the poster, the retired chief justice called in the Police officer and chided him. The Police were instructed to ensure that all posters were removed. Justice Sansoni told me \u201cGood work young man but don\u2019t take such risks in the future\u201d. Kantha was happy that he had been vindicated in Sansoni\u2019s eyes. I was happy that I had been vindicated in Kantha\u2019s eyes.",
    "During our stay in Anuradhapura we got a  day off on a Sunday when the commission did not sit. Kanthasamy and I went to many of the historic places in Anuradhapura. The Maha Bodhi, Tissa Wewa, Ruwanweli Mahaseya, Jethawanaramaya, Isurumuniya, Lovamahapaya stone pillars etc. I can still recall  being pleasantly surprised by Kanthsamy  remarking what a  marvellous  civilisation we had in this country and  then nodding approvingly when I quoted   Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s lines  \u201cThe Glory that was Greece and the Grandeur that was Rome \u201c.",
    "Our friendship or rather a fraternal type of association grew  over the years until he went off to London in order to avoid possible arrest.  He had reliable information that he was about to me arrested under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism act (PTA). This was shortly before Black July. However we  continued to  remain  in  contact. He would often call me to get some accurate information about a particular incident in Sri Lanka. In 1988 he returned to Sri Lanka and we used to meet  frequently when he was in Colombo. In June 1988, Kantha was abducted  in Jaffna by the EROS and made to \u201cdisappear\u201d",
    ".A few months later I left Sri Lanka for the USA and then moved to Canada in 1989. I got married in 1992 to Kanthasamy\u2019s niece in Toronto- his sister\u2019s daughter. But Kanthsamy was not alive to see his \u201cThamby\u201dlike friend become a  member of his extended family. Kantha\u2019s numerous nephews and nieces refer to him as \u201cKannaadi  Maamaa\u201d(Spectacled uncle)",
    "Kandiah Kanthasamy was born on April 6, 1930, the son of a school teacher. Hailing from Maaviddapuram in  Valikamam north, he had his education at Jaffna  Hindu College and St John\u2019s college. He entered university and  obtained a degree specializing  in mathematics. After a brief spell of teaching, Kantha  went on to do law.  as a lawyer he excelled in commercial and company law and built up a lucrative practice on those lines.  Although keeping a low profile among legal luminaries, Kanthasamy commanded a very high income  at that time.",
    "The 1977 August anti-Tamil violence was in a sense the watershed  that changed life for Kanthasanny. As he himself stated later. \u201cTo be a Tamil was one of the greatest misfortunes in August September 1977,\u201d Kantha  was one of the founding fathers of the Tamil Refugees Rehabilitation Organisation (TRRO).This organisation did yeoman service in providing refuge, relief, rehabilitation and resettlement to the thousands displaced by violence. JR. Jayewardene insisted that the organisation remove the word Tamil if approved charity status was to be bestowed.",
    "Kanthasamy and President, TRRO, KC Nithyananda, quite rightly refused. Yet the social fabric of the Tamils along with international non-governmental assistance was enough to launch very worthwhile projects. So successful was the TRRO then that a campaign of covert and overt repression with the unofficial sanction of the state was unleashed against it.",
    "When the Govt appointed  former Chief Justice MEC Sansoni to probe the 1977 violence, Kanthasamy plunged with full zeal into the proceedings of the Sansoni Commission. Once again his role was not that of the stridently articulate courtroom advocate but more of the silently instructive proctor of old. He was the livewire behind the elaborate legal preparations undertaken on behalf of victimised Tamils.",
    "Kanthasamy was also  instrumental in publishing the newspaper  \u201cSansoni  Commission Evidence\u201d in English that helped spotlight the atrocities of 1977. When the commission began sitting in Jaffna in 1978, a galaxy of 24 Tamil lawyers were present, one of whom was  Kanthasamy.   He was the only Tamil lawyer to see the Sansoni commission right through to the end. This  severely damaged  his legal   practice.",
    "Realising that an alternative  English journal was necessary, Kanthasamy and three of his friends formulated plans for the publication of Saturday Review with the primary objective of disseminating correct information on events and developments in Sri Lanka and outside. The weekly paper was meant to analyse events and trends and interpret them against the background in which they occurred.",
    "Above all it was aimed to meet the challenge of establishing two-way communication between all peoples and nationalities in the country, and in the process to serve as a vehicle for building healthy and civilised interaction, and as a useful link between Sri Lanka and its people abroad. In particular it would reflect the ethos and life around the area from which it was to be published (ie. Jaffna) with authenticity. Finally Saturday Review was to be an independent non-partisan journal offering its columns for free comment and the expression of views within the limits of law and reason.",
    "Though Kanthasamy arranged for the finances and set up the organisational structure of the Saturday Review, he never interfered in editorial and management functions. Those entrusted with these responsibilities however did not adhere faithfully to the original objectives behind the launching of the review. As a result the paper adopted an abrasive style that created needless controversy particularly within the Tamil community. At the same time the efficiency of managerial persons too was very much wanting.",
    "As a result the paper  never realised its full potential but produced many enemies for Kanthasamy. As he himself observed:\u201d Dale Carnegie wrote a lot about how to win friends and influence people. I know the secret to lose friends and make enemies and that is to publish an independent paper\u201d.",
    "In 1983 prior to \u201cBlack July\u201d  the political grapevine began buzzing that  Kanthasamy was going to be arrested under the PTA by the Jayewardene regime.  Kanthasamy\u2019s coronary  condition  too was not very healthy. So he left the country for Britain. Then came the July \u201883 holocaust.",
    "A shocked Kanthasamy\u2019s condition  deteriorated and he was soon hospitalised in London. Upon recovery, the man seemed to get his second wind. He immersed himself with indefatigable energy and total dedication into  service for humanity again. Using his personal charm to collective advantage, Kanthasamy cultivated various aid-giving agencies to garner a large amount of funds. This was channelled into numerous projects.",
    "Apart from continuous assistance to the TRRO and Saturday Review, there was the Central British Fund for Tamil Refugee Rehabilitation, the Theepam Research institute, the Home For Human Rights Centre in Jaffna.  The Tamil information centres of London, Madras and Madurai, the Tamil Information And Research Unit of Madras and the Movement For Integration Of Refugees And Repatriates Of India.",
    "An English social activist once told me about how Kanthasamy worked and why the donors trusted and admired him.  According to this lady who was associated with Kantha in London,   Kanthasamy would present his case precisely in a straight forward simple manner without flourishes. He would furnish details and follow up with appropriate budget estimates. He defrayed his personal expenses by staying in his sister\u2019s home .He avoided restaurants and ate  home cooked food. He travelled around by bus and tube as far as possible. Kantha was always clad in white and white.",
    "After the 1987 Indo-Lanka accord, Kanthasamy wound up all  his overseas activity and returned to Sri Lanka in January 1988. He naively assumed that real peace had set in. He also wanted to return to  Jaffna and base himself there.  When I  cautioned him in  Colombo  about  working in Jaffna with the militant groups.  Kanthsamy replied that he had communicated with their  representatives in London and they had welcomed it. He then observed  with a smile \u201cAlready I\u2019m after by pass surgery. I have only a few more years to live. Let me die in Jaffna.\u201d How woefully prophetic those words were!",
    "Upon returning to  Jaffna Kanthasamy found that the internal affairs of some institutions he had founded, fostered, nurtured and nourished were not very satisfactory. An existential reality of Jaffna life in the post \u201883 period was that of the dominance of so-called Tamil militants in every sphere of life.  The gun culture was the ruling ideology, Kantha living in London for five years had not fully realised the  state of transformation of society in Jaffna.",
    "One of the things he could not stomach was the compromising of independence by the TRRO.  It was apparently taking instructions from the Tamil armed groups.  Another irritant was the allegedly improper handling of finances involving certain projects.",
    "Kantha\u2019s honest and principled approach to public affairs necessitated his adopting a firm stance against these practices.  This in turn incurred the wrath of the Tamil armed groups and also provoked some of those within  the TRRO itself.  The Eelam Revolutionary Organisation known as EROS too had its refugee organisation called the Eelam Refugee Organisation.  EROS had always been interested in controlling all aspects of refugee rehabilitation in the Tamil regions. Earlier it had killed Kathiramalai, a refugee rehabilitation official of the Sarvodaya movement, heaping wild charges against him.",
    "Soon the EROS began getting irritated by Kanthasamy.  EROS may also have been encouraged by corrupt employees of the TRRO who were troubled by Kantha\u2019s strict adherence to financial discipline and accountability. Balakumar, the joint leader of the EROS  met Kanthasamy and discussed matters amicably at the beginning. The EROS in Trincomalee had set up a front organisation \u2013 Trincomalee District Development Foundation. It was also contemplated to set up one on similar lines in Jaffna.  The idea was to encompass all refugee organisations under one umbrella controlled by the EROS. Kanthasamy refused  to go along with this idea.  The ulterior motive of the EROS was to misappropriate large portions of refugee funds for their outfit.",
    "With frank forthrightness Kantha  made it known that he would not dance to the EROS tune.  He would also inform  all donor agencies of the reality of the situation.  Kantha believed that details of every major problem should be conveyed to the donors.  It was this honesty and transparency that endeared Kanthasamy to the donors who trusted his impeccable integrity and bestowed funds lavishly on his projects. Kantha considered himself morally and legally accountable for the finances he  had been instrumental in procuring while those who were siphoning off these funds  regarded Kantha as an obstacle to their greed.",
    "Kanthasamy also had a fierce sense of independence. He was of the view that the TRRO should not tolerate political interference by the EROS and said publicly, \u201cIf we cannot carry on as a free organisation we should close it (TRRO) down.\u201d.  These sentiments too were rapidly conveyed to the EROS by the moles within the TRRO.",
    "The EROS directly confronted Kanthasamy.  An excerpt from a note prepared by Kanthasamy and sent to trusted friends described what happened then.  \u201cThree  people came and said that they were from EROS and wanted to meet me. They said that I could not trifle with an organisation like EROS and that they would send me a van the following morning at 11 am and that I should come to their office.\u201d",
    "\u201c However, the following morning the three of them (Ravi, Vasanthan and AndrewJoseph) came at 11.30 am and there was no suggestion that I should go to their office.  The discussion was centered on the memorandum circulated by TRRO under my signature. They  said they would disrupt  any rehabilitation work not in conformity with their policy, and no work would be tolerated except with their permission ( as an afterthought they added \u201c and  with the permission of LTTE\u201d). When I asked them what their policy was, they said they could not announce it, but permission should be obtained case by case.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey also reminded me that Kathiramalai was killed because he acted against the policy of EROS, and that could be the fate of others as well.  The meeting was not as tough as it was the previous day, but was possibly intended to be intimidatory.  I later learned in Trincomalee that it was a \u201cwarning.\u201d",
    "Matters came to a head when the EROS summoned then Chairman, TRRO, Prof K Sivathamby and ordered him to issue a statement publicly stating that Kanthasamy had nothing to do with the TRRO. Balakumar of the EROS was in a foul mood and refused to even discuss the issue. Later  Secretary, TRRO, Aravinthan too was called by Balakumar and informed that Kanthasamy should go.  Some TRRO personnel warned  Kanthasamy that his life may be in danger. Well-wishers of Kanthasamy within the community urged him to escape to Colombo and lie low for a while.  Kanthasamy refused, saying he would not run away.",
    "On 19  June 1988, a white van of EROS came to Kanthasamy\u2019s temporary residence in Jaffna in the morning.  He was seen being bundled in by three men.  That was the last anyone saw of him.  A huge outcry was raised by concerned individuals and groups both nationally and internationally.  The EROS was under great pressure.",
    "The international outcry that ensued was mainly a result of the various donor institutions and human rights organisations evincing interest in Kanthasamy  \u2013 a man with whom they had interacted a great deal. Likewise a group of Sinhala intellectuals and human rights activists too were extremely concerned as they too knew the calibre of the man called Kanthasamy. Those who knew him well were fully aware of his integrity, dependability and selfless service to humanity. Alas, his own people, the Tamils to whom he devoted the greater part of his life in the post-1977 period, little realised the greatness of the man.",
    "One  reason for  many Tamils  not being too concerned about  Kanthasamy\u2019s  disappearance was  due to the fact that the masses at large knew very little about him. He was a man who shunned publicity and believed in tangible achievements through action rather than seeking the limelight through empty verbosity.  Also  the on going conflict had seen many disappearances perpetrated by the security forces as well as the armed Tamil groups. To many Kantha was just another victim.",
    "When Kantha was reported  missing and there was an  international outcry, an EROS cadre asked  me  in bewildered tones, \u201cWe and other movements have  detained and killed off so many Tamils. Then there was no concern. Why is everyone so bothered about this individual? Who is this man Kanthasarmy?\u201d",
    "The experience of Dr. Brian Seneviratne from Australia is significant.  In his own words, \u201cI was abroad when Kanthasamy was abducted and did not hear of it for some time.  As soon as I heard about it, I telephoned a senior member of EROS in London and asked him about the abduction.  He launched into a tirade against Kanthasamy.  The basic problem, he said, was that \u201cWe are Marxists and he is not.\u201cWhen asked whether that was sufficient reason for abduction, he replied that their group did not abduct Kanthasamy but told me that I should not expect to see him alive.\u201d",
    "With mounting international condemnation of  the abduction, the EROS did a complete somersault and issued a statement praising Kanthasamy and all the work he had done.The EROS after issuing a statement denying involvement and praising Kanthasamy did something else. They got the \u201cMurasoli \u201d newspaper in Jaffna, to publish a statement purportedly issued by a hitherto unheard-of group, the \u201cPasarai Iyakkam.\u201d",
    "The  Tamil statement said, \u201cThe disappearance of Kanthasamy of the TRRO is only a starting point in our action to eliminate the destructive elements which have penetrated into all spheres of the society.  We would like to inform those who are looking for Kanthasamy that he cannot be found at any time in this birth.\u201d",
    "Kanthasamy was abducted on June 19th 1988. I left Sri Lanka on 14th September 1988. During the time I was in Sri Lanka ,  I kept on  sending messages to EROS leaders Balakumar and Para asking about Kanthasamy. Finally an EROS Cadre who was a friend of mine prior to his joining the movement after July 1983 came to see me in Colombo. He conveyed a confidential message from  Balakumar to me  that the EROS  had not killed Kantha but he had suffered a heart attack when they were questioning him harshly on the night of June 19 itself,  They did not know how to react and had clandestinely cremated Kantha,   Balakumar\u2019s message was told to me in September a few days before I left the Island. I conveyed this message to Dr. Neelan and Sithie Tiruchelvam and to Kanthasamy\u2019s close friend and associate I.F. Xavier  the Human rights lawyer.",
    "But the tale told by an Indian army officer to a close associate of Kantha was different to what Balakumar said. According to this official, the Indian Intelligence had monitored a call between  EROS Co-leader Shankar Rajee in India and Balakumar in Jaffna in which  Rajee had concurred with Balakumar that Kantha should be killed.  The IPKF then launched a search of EROS camps and safehouses but could not trace Kantha.",
    "Subsequently  a high profile  EROS member revealed to Indian authorities  that Kantha had been killed, chopped into pieces and dumped  in a latrine  sewer.  What a gruesome end of a  truly noble soul!",
    "A fitting epitaph to Kantha and a prophetic indictment of the  Tamil political struggle is available in an excerpt from a letter written by British writer  David Selbourne  to a dear friend of Kantha and a human rights  activist colleague after Kantha\u2019s abduction.",
    "\u201cThe disappearance and probable death of poor Kanthasamy has afflicted me like no other horror of the Lankan Disaster. He was one of the very best and most honest of men, equal to twenty of your Prabhakarans and other such tinpot heroes, who are leading the Tamils towards a long term  political and moral disaster, which the present savagery of the conflict, and the resolutions of support from this or that useless conference, prevent them from seeing.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat EROS could do this, and  get away with it with such little genuine Tamil condemnation, condemns the Tamil cause itself to perdition. But there is no need for me to condemn it. It is self -condemning, and after all, who am 1? In any case, the Tamil cause itself, as a moral struggle for justice, had begun to be lost once the killing  of innocent Sinhalese citizens, at hands of Tamil \u201cfreedom fighters\u201c, had begun a few years ago.\u201d",
    "\u201c Moreover  despite the struggle, I now think that there will neither be Eelam, \u2018true\u2019 federalism, nor genuine devolution, nor anything else which is just and fair to the Tamils this century,  if ever. I had not wanted to say  this out in the open earlier, because it would have lent some legitimacy to the wickedness of Colombo, which is  incorrigible also. But since the presumed death of Kanthasamy  I think that such silence is pure cowardice. \u201c",
    "\u201cBut abducting and killing Kanthasamy! What low brutishness was that? What does it say of the men who did it? Answer: they are no better than the drunken gangsters who killed Rajasunderam in Welikade Prison\u2026\u201d",
    "Kanthasamy was of the stuff of which quiet heroes are made. Rather than compromise on principle or run away from injustice, he chose to confront it in his own way and pay the supreme price.  He accomplished in constructive terms more for the Tamils than the gun-toting groups. He is a greater role model for the younger generation to emulate than the   merchants of death who bore AK-47 guns and the vocal warriors posing as political leaders.",
