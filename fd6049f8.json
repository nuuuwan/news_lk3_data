    "(WION) India is hoping to strengthen trilateral cooperation with Japan and Sri Lanka, focusing on new avenues of collaboration while jointly working on debt restructuring for Colombo.",
    "Speaking at the India-Sri Lanka-Japan Trilateral Cooperation Event, co-hosted by NatStrat, VIF, Pathfinder, and CII, Puneet Agrawal, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ocean Region in the Ministry of External Affairs, highlighted the shared interests and potential for synergistic partnerships among the three nations.",

    "\"Some projects in Sri Lanka which were to be executed jointly by India and Japan did not progress due to several reasons, but that should not deter us in exploring new cooperation,\" he affirmed. \u00a0In the past, both Delhi and Tokyo burnt fingers after a tripartite deal with Colombo was scrapped for the development of Colombo Port\u2019s eastern container terminal in 2021.",

    "He underscored the importance of connectivity in this process, encompassing maritime connectivity, energy and power trade, financial and digital connectivity, and people engagement.",
    "Regarding digital connectivity, India's advanced IT sector is set to foster economic growth in Sri Lanka, he said.",
    "\"This will not only boost e-commerce and financial inclusion but also empower Sri Lanka's youth with skills for the Digital Age,\" Agrawal added.",
    "An agreement between NPCI International and Lanka Pay on UPI-based digital payments is poised to revolutionise the financial landscape, enhancing tourism and public infrastructure.",
    "In addition to economic collaboration, cultural ties between India and Sri Lanka were highlighted as pivotal in fostering regional solidarity.",
    "\"Promotion of the Buddhist circuit and the Ramayana trail, exchange programs between educational institutions, scholarships, and cultural events have not only strengthened the bonds between our nations but also promoted a sense of regional solidarity,\" the Indian diplomat noted."
