    "The accelerating pace of digital transformation has brought the financial services industry to a defining juncture, where the growing threat of cyber risk increasingly shadows the opportunities of technological advancement. This pressing reality was at the forefront of a high-level panel discussion held recently, organised under the Continuing Professional Development Committee (CPDC) of the Association of Professional Bankers (APB), at the Bank of Ceylon Head Office Auditorium.",
    "A packed audience comprising professionals from the banking and finance industry, as well as representatives from technology firms, insurance providers, consulting agencies, academia and regulatory institutions, signalled the widespread recognition of cybersecurity and technology risk as issues that extend well beyond the boundaries of finance.",
    "Central Bank of Sri Lanka Senior Assistant Director \u2013 Bank Supervision Department R.M.J. Patabendige delivered the keynote address. Her remarks emphasised the evolving nature of cyber risk and the crucial role regulators play in strengthening the banking sector\u2019s resilience. She offered valuable insights into how digital innovation must be matched by equally strong risk management frameworks, a balance that is increasingly critical for the long-term sustainability of financial institutions.",
    "The panel brought together a group of distinguished thought leaders, each contributing distinct perspectives shaped by experience across both local and global contexts. ISACA Vice President Indika Rajakaruna and an established authority in data governance and cybersecurity, shared lessons from his tenure as a CISO and academic mentor. Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Chief Information Security Officer Sunari Dandeniya discussed practical approaches to embedding cybersecurity at the core of banking operations. As Sri Lanka\u2019s first and only female CISO in the sector, her insights were particularly impactful. Adding a global dimension to the dialogue, international cybersecurity firm, Scybers President Madu Rathnayake emphasised the importance of cross-industry collaboration in tackling the increasingly complex nature of cyber threats.",
    "Moderating the discussion was Hatton National Bank Chief Information Security Officer and Senior Vice President Suresh Emmanuel, who ensured a dynamic and engaging conversation, encouraging thoughtful exchanges between panellists and participants. The event served as a timely reminder of the interconnected responsibilities shared across sectors in securing a resilient digital future for Sri Lanka, reinforcing the importance of sustained dialogue and collective effort in addressing emerging technology risks."
