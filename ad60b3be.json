    "As a result of successful completion of multiple sustainable initiatives, complying with ISO 14064:1 2018 standards and projects rolled out over this period, the company was able to accomplish carbon footprint verification in October 2023 and conferred with carbon footprint verified manufacturing organisation certification by Sri Lanka Climate Fund Ltd. together with the Ministry of Environment in Sri Lanka.",
    "As one of the South Asian country\u2019s, Sri Lankan Government too declared a Carbon Net Zero 2050 Road Map & Strategic Plan. Hence, as a responsible corporate establishment in the Island, overcoming these sustainability challenges, Unidil has also taken all possible efforts to be a proactive contributor to the nation. Unidil Roof Top Solar project was one of the initiatives which was rolled out in 2021 with a capacity of 860 kwh energy, to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. Further, the company has also installed VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) for all machineries to optimise the power utilisation. Achieving the set goals with minimum impacts on environment is one of the core principles of Unidil. To drive this, at present the company is functioning the operation through bio mass boiler as a substitute for furnace oil boiler to reduce the carbon emission by 26%. In achieving two key values of the company; the best service to the customer and minimise the cost and waste through efficiency, Unidil has introduced a Shuttle App to eliminate unnecessary fuel usage while optimising the delivery efficiency to cater the best service to the customers. The company is striving further measures and will invest time and expertise into its sustainability efforts in the future, to make their strategic goal which is to be affirmed as a \u2018Carbon Neutral Entity\u2019."
