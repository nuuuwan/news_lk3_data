    "An all-party conference led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is set to take place at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday (July 26) to inform party leaders representing Parliament about the National Reconciliation Program, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "Invitations have been extended to leaders of all political parties and independent groups with representation in Parliament, according to the PMD.",
    "The development closely follows the President\u2019s two-day official visit to India last week, where he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Tamils issue figured prominently in the wide-ranging talks between the two leaders.",
    "The Indian prime minister highlighted the need for the implementation of the 13th Amendment (13A) to the Sri Lankan Constitution.",
    "India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13A, brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community. It created nine provinces as devolved units with a temporary merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces.",
    "Prior to his India visit, at a meeting with the Tamil parties, Wickremesinghe assured that the 13th Amendment would be fully implemented, without police powers, in the provincial councils.",
    "Prime Minister Modi, during his talks with Wickremesinghe, expressed hope that the Sri Lankan leader would be committed to implementing the 13A and holding the provincial council elections. He urged Wickremesinghe to ensure a life of respect and dignity for the Tamils."
