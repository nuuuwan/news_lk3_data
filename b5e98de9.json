    "Highlighting the significance of establishing a Truth-Seeking Commission to address the ethnic problem\u2019s impact on affected communities, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has stressed that the commission should operate independently, with the government\u2019s role limited to providing necessary support and facilities.",

    "He further pledged to take all essential steps to instill confidence in the truth-seeking commission.",
    "Director General of Trade Unions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe Saman Ratnapriya, who also expressed his views at the event, pointed out that the three-decade-long war had caused extensive damage throughout the country as a whole, and there is a pressing need for a thorough investigation.",
    "He noted that previous commissions\u2019 proposals on this matter were not adequately implemented, leading to the consideration of models from countries like South Africa to devise a suitable mechanism for Sri Lanka.",
    "Ratnapriya further emphasised that informing society about the commission and garnering support for its implementation is vital to prevent the country from facing further difficulties.",
    "Also addressing the event, Director General of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Asanga Gunawansa drew attention to Singapore\u2019s remarkable transformation into a developed country through reconciliation, two decades after gaining independence.",
