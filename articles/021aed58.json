    "Two fine half centuries from Rahamat Shah and Azmatullah Omarzai spearheaded Afghanistan to 266 in the third and final One Day International (ODI) against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy.",
    "Rahamat hammered 65 from 77 deliveries with the help of one six and seven boundaries and also added 57 runs for the second wicket along with opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz.",
    "Gurbaz provided Afghanistan a flying start as he smashed four successive boundaries in the first over off Dilshan Madushanka after the visitors had won the toss and elected to bat first.",
    "Gurbaz fell just three runs short of his half century while Skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi fell cheaply as Afghanistan suffered a mini collapse losing two wickets in successive overs.",
    "However, Omarzai regained the momentum for Afghanistan with a 53-ball half century that included four boundaries and was sixth out with five overs left in the innings.",
    "Seamer Pramod Madushanka picked up three late wickets after the two spinners Dunith Wellalage and Akila Dananjaya had caused the early damage.",
    "Earlier, both sides made two changes apiece. For Afghanistan, seamer Fareed Ahmad and left-arm spinner Sharafuddin Ashraf came in for Noor Ahmad and Gulbadin Naib.",
    "Sri Lanka's spin pairing of Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana were rested, with spin-bowling all-rounder Dunith Wellalage and off-spinner Akila Dananjaya coming in to replace them.",
    "Fall: 1-39, 2-96, 3-108, 4-166, 5-223, 6-237, 7-250, 8-255, 9-260",
    "Bowling: D. Madushanka 6-0-52-0, P. Madushan 8.2-0-45-3, A. Fernando 9-0-44-2, D. Wellalage 10-0-38-2, J. Liyanage 2-0-11-0, A. Dananjaya 10-0-54-2, C. Asalanka 3-0-17-0"
