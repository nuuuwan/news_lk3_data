    "He made this statement during a media briefing held today (24), emphasizing the government\u2019s commitment to easing the economic hardships faced by the public.",
    "\u201cIf we wanted to, we could have said that the economy has collapsed now... wait a little longer... tighten our belts. We can also argue that we will do it in 2026. But we will not do that. We know the hardships people are living in. We can definitely expect a salary increase. I will present those details in the budget\u201d, he added."
