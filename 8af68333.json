    "The new flour was unveiled at an event held at the Araliya Green City Hotel, Nuwara Eliya recently with distinguished guests in attendance including, Chairman Barath Arulsamy, Director General L.R. Perera, and Director Health Dr. R.M.S.K. Amunugama from the PHDT.

    "Adhi Shakthi wheat flour contains essential nutrients such as Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12. The product has been developed in response to widespread micronutrient deficiencies and the increasing incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) within Sri Lanka\u2019s estate community. Especially the prevalence of anaemia and folate deficiencies among the plantation communities is a well-known fact due to the lack of a balanced diet among these communities. Thus, Adhi Shakthi is poised to significantly improve the nutritional well-being of the estate community, contributing to the overall health and vitality of the area.",
