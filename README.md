ECONOMYNEXT – A pediatric specialist at the Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital in Colombo has warned that influenza types A and B and an upper respiratory viral fever are spreading among children in Sri Lanka.

Pediatrician Dr Deepal Perera has urged parents to be aware of flu like symptoms, including fever with headache, cough, cold, sneezing, body aches, difficulty in breathing and vomiting.

“If such symptoms spread quickly in classes and day care centers and homes, this could be a viral disease of the upper respiratory tract or influenza,” Dr Perera said.

A sputum test can check for influenza and if so anti-virals will be administered, he was quoted as saying in a government statement.

“Antibiotics are not necessary as this is a viral infection and if the cough persists, it may lead to childhood asthma, so proper treatment should be given.”

The pediatrician said those with symptoms should wear face masks and that children with symptoms should be kept at home.

### Sri Lanka cabinet clears more egg imports by state agency

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet has approved the import of eggs by State Trading (General) Corporation to stop spikes in egg prices, Spokesman Bandula Gunawardana said.

The import of eggs will prevent price spikes during the upcoming Ramazan and Christmas seasons, he said.

Sri Lanka has imported 224 million eggs after a cabinet decision allowed imports in March and 95 percent was sold through state-run Sathosa at 37 rupees an egg. The permission had run out in April 30.

Sri Lanka has slapped import licensing taxes on maize, pushing up feed costs, and making poultry more expensive, farmers have complained. The dairy sector also faces similar constraints.

Sri Lanka started importing eggs after the Consumer Affairs Authority imposed price controls on eggs and forced farmers to kill off flocks for meat, when feed prices went up during an economic crisis.

Nobody has been held accountable for the damage done to the poultry industry. (Colombo/July30/2024)
