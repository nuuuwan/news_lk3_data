üü©

The Israeli military has been searching for Yahya Sinwar, the hidden Sinwar after the October seven attack.

Sinwar, 61, is thought to have lived within the tunnels of the Gaza Valley for the past one year.

However, in the south side of Gaza, he faced an Israeli patrol sect.

Israel reported that the 828th Bislama brigade was on patrol in Raba's Dul al -Sultan on Wednesday.

The Israeli soldiers who identified three militants have attacked and killed them.

When the body of a killed person then searched, it was seen as the body of Yahya Sinwar.

However, the Israeli soldiers who did not completely remove it, fearing that explosives could be found around the body, have only cut off its finger and sent it to Israel.

His body was taken to Israel after the area was found to be safe.

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hakari said that our soldiers were involved in the operation without knowing that Sinwar was there.

Before the Presidential election, there were ramifications, speculations and cautions expressed by several learned people who were not ready to adjust their mindset for a change. They casted doubts as to what a future AKD-led Government would do, if elected. The most repeated question was how would the Government find money to keep the pledges. The second question was how would the Government deal with the IMF. The third cynical question was how Thambuttegama Ranbanda‚Äôs Kolla would manage international affairs without competency in English.

As financial services become increasingly digital, so do the methods employed by cyber criminals and fraudsters. In both global and Sri Lankan context, social media platforms and online channels have become breeding grounds for financial scams. These schemes exploit the public‚Äôs lack of awareness and in some cases, desperation during economic hardships. While the exact scale is difficult to gauge, the prevalence of such incidents in media paints a concerning picture. This has raised the need for financial institutions to step up their security measures and educate the public.

This article explores recent fraud incidents, the importance of user education, and how financial organisations can protect their customers while ensuring convenience and minimising service disruption.

Globally, cybercriminals are exploiting the popularity of social media to launch sophisticated scams.

First action he is to take, is to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections. During this period from dissolution to summoning new parliament, country would be ruled by an interim government, which will be constituted by members of the existing parliament.

There will not be much problem as there are number of Muslim MPs who are ready to somersault, and opportunistic MPs like Sumanthiran, Devananda and some Sinhala MPs will give them support. Another problem to be faced is to get many NPP members elected at the next hustings. After proportional representation was introduced, no faction was able to secure two-thirds majority, and NPP cannot expect any better result than that. Once settled, let us analyse how they would perform in meeting their promises to the people.

### Eliminating Ethnic-Based Politics In Sri Lanka: A Path Toward National Unity

*2024-10-17 22:28:01* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/eliminating-ethnic-based-politics-in-sri-lanka-a-path-toward-national-unity/) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lanka, with its rich diversity of ethnicities, religions, and cultures, has long faced the challenge of balancing these identities in its political landscape. Ethnic-based politics, which has shaped much of the country‚Äôs history, continues to be a divisive force that hinders national unity, sustainable development, and long-term peace. Eliminating ethnic-based politics is essential for Sri Lanka‚Äôs progress toward a truly united, prosperous, and peaceful society.

Ethnic politics in Sri Lanka can be traced back to the colonial period, when the British promoted communal identities for administrative convenience. After independence in 1948, political parties began to align themselves along ethnic lines, leading to an entrenched system of division. The Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities were often pitted against one another as political elites manipulated ethnic tensions for electoral gains.

### Sajith Premadasa has made opposition politics unwinnable. He had the choice of making an alliance with the UNP but he was so insecure that Ranil Wickremesinghe would somehow wrest control of the Party that he turned  it down.

Even those who did not vote for Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the presidential race would find it refreshing to see that the old rot that had infested Sri Lankan politics is being cleared out.

But, look closer;  while some of the old guard may have left politics for good, a good number of others have their names on the national list, which gives, at least the folks in the top quarter of the list, a sure shot at getting into Parliament, without the travails of going before the voters.

Also, a cursory look at the troubles brewing in the SJB would reveal that it is not just the old guard collapsing. It is, in fact, the entire machinery of the political opposition that is actually collapsing.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for voters to send experienced members back to parliament in the upcoming general election, saying those who worked with him have the necessary expertise.

‚ÄúWithout experience, you cannot run the Parliament, you cannot achieve the goals we have been set. Those who worked with me have the expertise to solve the economic challenges,‚Äù Wickremesinghe said making a statement on Thursday.

‚ÄúSo they should be in Parliament whether in the government or opposition.‚Äù

Wickremesinghe said it was important to have experience in running the Parliament and reaching economic goals, and urged Sri Lankans to vote for people who worked with him as president to address the economic crisis.

He undertook the presidency when the country had defaulted, he said, and his goal was to reach debt sustainability and overcome bankruptcy.

‚ÄúWe were able to reach agreement with the IMF, 18 countries that lent to us and private bondholders.‚Äù

### Dr. Harsha De Silva, with his expertise in economics, experience in governance, and reputation for pragmatism, could emerge as a more favourable candidate to lead the Samagi Jana Balavegaya(SJB)

*2024-10-17 18:00:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84917) ¬∑ `en`

Targeting Dr. Harsha de Silva by senior SJB members began a couple of years ago when he started gaining recognition as a potential future leader. The brilliant economist faced criticism a few months ago after securing state funding for development work in Kotte.

During a TV chat show explaining the process, Harsha made the remark, ‚ÄúMama Ambalangoda kollekk‚Äù (I am a man from Ambalangoda), which some within the party used to undermine him. Party members close to the leadership reportedly conspired to push him out of the Colombo district, seeking to move him to Galle‚Äôs nomination list, his hometown. This would free up a prime slot in Colombo for a former Hela Urumaya member, and an apparent attempt to sideline Harsha and diminish his influence within the party.

Bangladesh‚Äôs International Crimes Tribunal on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, citing her alleged involvement in mass killings during violent protests that erupted earlier this year.

The protests, which began as a student-led movement against public sector job quotas, escalated into some of the deadliest unrest since the country‚Äôs independence in 1971, resulting in over 700 deaths and numerous injuries.

The violence ultimately forced Hasina to flee to India on Aug. 5 and an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge.

The tribunal‚Äôs proceedings, presided over by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar, saw prosecutors request arrest warrants for 50 individuals, including Hasina.

‚ÄúI appealed to the court that if the accused, who are extremely influential, are not arrested, it will be impossible to conduct the investigation,‚Äù chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said.

Meanwhile, if a voter‚Äôs left thumb is unavailable, the mark will be applied to the thumb of the right hand, or if necessary, another finger, as suitable, according to the Election Commission.
