Moldovans were voting on Sunday in a presidential election that has been overshadowed by meddling allegations and could see Moscow claw back influence in the country at a time when it is trying to draw closer to the European Union.

Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu, who has accelerated the nation’s push to leave Moscow’s orbit and join the EU, faces Alexandr Stoianoglo, an ex-prosecutor general backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party.

The fortunes of Sandu, who set Moldova on the long path of EU accession talks in June, will be closely followed in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state hoping to join, re-elected a ruling party seen as increasingly pro-Russian.

Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).

Moldova’s future has been thrown into the political and diplomatic spotlight as the war in neighbouring Ukraine rages to the east.

The death penalty came into effect in Nigeria in 1976, but no one has been convicted since 1996.

Therefore, it is wrong to bring the boys to the court.
