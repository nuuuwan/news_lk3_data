    "The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) has marked a proud and historic moment by being ranked among the Top 20 Architecture Schools in the world and securing the No. 1 position in Sri Lanka in the latest INSPIRELI World Architecture University Ranking. This global recognition is based on student performance in the INSPIRELI Awards, the world\u2019s largest architecture and design competition for students and young architects. In the 2023\u20132024 cycle, SLIIT climbed to the 17th position globally out of more than 1,360 participating universities, demonstrating a significant leap from its 22nd position the previous year. It also proudly ranks among the Top 2 Architecture Schools in Asia, reinforcing its status as a regional leader in architectural education.",
    "The INSPIRELI Awards, established in 2015, have grown into a globally respected platform that highlights the creativity, talent, and vision of student architects from over 150 countries. Unlike many other competitions, INSPIRELI charges no entry fees, ensuring open access to students regardless of financial background. The competition is not merely a celebration of design, it is deeply rooted in educational values and humanitarian purpose, with past challenges including real-world projects such as the Port of Beirut renewal and the Czech Embassy in Ethiopia. As a result, rankings derived from student performance in this competition are considered a genuine reflection of academic and creative excellence.",
    "SLIIT\u2019s continued rise in this global landscape is a testament to the strength of its architectural programs, the commitment of its academic faculty, and the creative ambition of its students. The recognition also highlights the university\u2019s dedication to producing innovative, industry-ready graduates who are equipped not only with technical skills but also with a broader understanding of design as a force for societal good. The school\u2019s nurturing and dynamic studio culture fosters individual expression while maintaining rigorous academic standards, creating an ideal environment for students to thrive and gain international exposure.",
    "This achievement is more than a numerical ranking. It signifies a growing reputation for SLIIT as a hub of architectural innovation in South Asia, offering globally aligned education within Sri Lanka. For prospective students, it presents a compelling reason to choose SLIIT\u2019s School of Architecture as the foundation for a world-class design career. For the broader design community, it reaffirms that Sri Lankan institutions can compete and lead on the global stage. The university continues to offer internationally recognized degree programs in partnership with Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, ensuring that students benefit from both local insight and global academic standards.",
    "The Head of the Department of Architecture, Prof. Lalith De Silva shared a few thoughts, \u201cThis is such a proud moment for all of us at SLIIT. It reflects the strength of our quality education structure and the world-class facilities we offer at the School of Architecture. We are fully capable of providing the right environment for our students to grow, explore, and express themselves. It inspires prospective students to see the possibilities of beginning their architectural journey at SLIIT University and reassures our current students that their creativity is being recognized on the \u201d world of work\u201d showcasing their Design Excellence. For Sri Lanka, it\u2019s a reminder that our universities can lead with vision and excellence.\u201d",
    "With this milestone, SLIIT continues to shape a future where design is not only about buildings but about impact, relevance, and global contribution. Its students are not merely participating in global discourse they are helping define it. The university remains committed to supporting young architects in their pursuit of excellence and will continue to build on this success in the years ahead.",
