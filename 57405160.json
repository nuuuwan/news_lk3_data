  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s president has pointed out the need to develop regional tourism markets and create a unified regional tourism bloc, using selective integration to forego country-specific geopolitical fissures.",
    "\u201cWe can create our own economic hub, a regional economy. We may not have one big South Asian economic bloc, and the geopolitics are such that I don\u2019t think we are all going to work together. But we can make it happen,\u201d Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the \u2018YPO Colombo Experience: Rediscover the Pearl\u2019 held last weekend.",
    "He said that the economic shift towards Asia calls for South Asian nations to work together to harness the growing economic power in the region, through an integrated ecosystem that could be beneficial for industrialization and tourism.",
    "He urged Sri Lankan entrepreneurs who have in the past invested in operations in Bangladesh and Maldives to invest in other countries within the region, including India.",
    "\u201cWe are already one of the largest investors in Bangladesh. Go into Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, East Africa, West Africa,\u201d he invited entrepreneurs and investors.",
    "The president pointed out potential tourism hotspots accessible from Sri Lanka\u2019s east coast.",
    "\u201cBay of Bengal has a cruise area that is larger than the Caribbean. Sri Lanka\u2019s east coast, which is not opened up yet, can benefit from this. India has some very good spots along the east coast\u201d.",
    "\u201cBangladesh\u2019s Cox\u2019s Bazar hasn\u2019t been opened up, the whole of Andaman Islands. The beaches in Myanmar are beautiful.",
    "\u201cIf most of the Indians and Chinese decide to take a cruise then we don\u2019t need to bring down Europeans.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka signed a free trade agreement with Singapore, and is looking to sign one with Thailand.",
    "\u201cWe will negotiate with Malaysia and Indonesia, and then we\u2019ll go into Vietnam. We\u2019ll also have a similar arrangement with Bangladesh so it covers the whole area and then Pakistan. We can create this regional economy,\u201d he said.",
    "He said that Sri Lanka and other South Asian nations should venture into Pakistan and Iran, the maritime corridor into Central Asia.",
    "\u201cIran is important. Both Pakistan and Iran which preside over the Makran coast, are the route that can lead into Central Asia.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has also applied to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the pursuit of comprehensive economic partnerships with India and Bangladesh. (Colombo/Nov21/2023)"
