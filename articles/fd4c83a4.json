    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is yet to ascertain if the attack plan at its Eastern coastal tourism hotspot of Arugam Bay is a false alarm, but it does not consider the incident as a pressure tactic, Cabinet spokesman Vijitha Herath said.",
    "The intelligence information of a possible attack against Jews in an Arugam Bay area was first shared by foreign intelligence agency with the local counterpart and the government swiftly tightened the security to ensure the safety of both locals and foreign tourists, he said.",
    "\u201cIt is yet to ascertain if this is a a false alarm because only after the investigation we will be able to find whether the information is true or false,\u201d Herath told the weekly post-Cabinet news briefing in Colombo on Tuesday (29) while responding to a question if the government thinks it was a false alarm or a pressure tactic by an external group.",
    "The U.S. Embassy in Colombo issued a travel advisory first asking its citizens to avoid Arugam Bay.",
    "That travel advisory was followed by Israel, Russia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.",
    "The travel advisories come ahead of the peak tourism season starting next month. They also come one month after Anura Kumara Dissanayake was elected as the President and formed a new interim government. The parliamentary polls are scheduled for November 14.",
    "Sri Lanka largely relies on tourism for its economic recovery after declaring sovereign debt default in April 2022.",
    "The seven countries that have issued travel advisories have accounted for 29 percent of the total tourism arrivals in the first nine months of this year, the official government data show.",
    "\u201cIndividuals can come to different conclusions because there was no such incident.\u00a0But as a government we had to act with full responsibility,\u201d Herath said.",
    "\u201cWe do not consider this as a pressure tactic because the U.S. Embassy clearly advised to avoid traveling to Arugam Bay. It was not a travel ban. It is something they have to ensure the safety of their citizens.\u201d (Colombo/October 29/2024)"
