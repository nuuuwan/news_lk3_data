    "Colombo, Jan 24 (Daily Mirror) -\u00a0 Notwithstanding official reports indicating that Onco Surgeon Dr. Crysantha Perera, accused of allegedly assaulting a female hospital staffer, has sought early retirement, the Health Ministry is reported to have rejected his request, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "The surgeon, in accordance with the recently issued circular, is eligible to continue serving until the age of 63. However, the 61-year-old surgeon had formally submitted his retirement request two years prior to reaching the retirement age.",
    "Against this backdrop, informed sources suggest that the Health Ministry's refusal is based on the pressing service requirements at the Karapitiya Hospital, where Dr. Crysantha plays a pivotal role as the chief Onco surgeon.",
    "Highlighting Dr. Crysantha's significant contributions to the hospital, sources emphasise that his departure would create a void that cannot be easily filled at this juncture due to the absence of any immediate replacements.",
    "Furthermore, the Health Ministry is expected to communicate its decision on the matter following Dr. Crysantha's return from prison.",
    "The surgeon's assault allegations have added a layer of complexity to the situation, impacting his professional standing and retirement plans.",
    "However, the medical fraternity has urged authorities to mete out justice to the specialist in question, given his irreplaceable service at the Karapitiya Hospital. Subsequently, three minor hospital staff members including a female were arrested over the alleged assault on Dr Crysantha Perera."
