வாசிம் தாஜுதீன் கொலை போன்ற குற்றங்களை கிராமத்தில் இருக்கும் சிறிபால அல்லது ஞானரத்னம் செய்யவில்லை, மாறாக நாட்டை ஆண்ட ஆட்சியாளர்களே செய்ததாக அமைச்சர் பிமல் ரத்நாயக்க இன்று தெரிவித்தார்.

விசாரணைகளின்படி குற்றங்களில் ஈடுபட்டவர்கள் அரசியல் ஆர்வலர்களாக இருந்தாலும் இல்லாவிட்டாலும் அவர்களுக்கு எதிராக சட்டம் அமல்படுத்தப்படும் என்று அவர் அனுராதபுரத்தில் ஊடகவியலாளர்களிடம் தெரிவித்தார்.

தாஜுதீன் கொலையில் தொடர்புடையதாகக் கூறப்படும் அரசியல்வாதிகள் மீது நடவடிக்கை எடுக்கப்படுமா என்ற கேள்விக்கு பதிலளித்த அவர், அவர்கள் அரசியல் ஆர்வலர்களாக இருந்தாலும் இல்லாவிட்டாலும் அவர்கள் மீது நடவடிக்கை எடுக்கப்படும் என்றார்.

### ”தாஜுதீனின் ஆன்மாவை அவமதிக்க வேண்டாம்”

*2025-10-01 18:19:14* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/தாஜுதீனின்-ஆன்மாவை-அவமதிக்க-வேண்டாம்/175-365597) · `ta`

முன்னாள் ரக்பி வீரர் வாசிம் தாஜுதீனின் மரணம் குறித்து அரசாங்கம் பாரபட்சமற்ற மற்றும் விரிவான விசாரணையை நடத்த வேண்டும் என்றும், அதை அரசியல் மயப்படுத்த முயற்சிக்கக்கூடாது என்றும், இல்லையெனில் அது அவரது மறைந்த ஆன்மாவை அவமதிப்பதாக இருக்கும் என்றும் ஸ்ரீலங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் நாமல் ராஜபக்ஷ கூறினார்.

இந்த ஆண்டின் தொடக்கத்தில் மித்தெனியவில் கொலை செய்யப்பட்ட 'கஜ்ஜா' என்ற ஒழுங்கமைக்கப்பட்ட குற்றப் பிரமுகர், 2012 இல் தாஜுதீன் இறப்பதற்கு முன்பு அவரைப் பின்தொடர்ந்த வாகனத்தில் இருந்ததாக பொலிஸார் சமீபத்தில் வெளிப்படுத்தியதைத் தொடர்ந்து அவரது கருத்துக்கள் வெளியாகியுள்ளன.

ஊடகங்களுக்குப் பேட்டியளித்த பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் நாமல், தாஜுதீனின் மரணம் குறித்த தற்போதைய கவனத்தை 'ICE வாரம்' மற்றும் 'ரணில் வாரம்' போன்ற அரசியல் ரீதியாக முக்கியத்துவம் வாய்ந்த கடந்த கால நிகழ்வுகளுடன் ஒப்பிட்டுப் பார்த்து, சிலர் அதை தனிப்பட்ட அரசியல் ஆதாயத்திற்காகப் பயன்படுத்துகிறார்கள் என்பதைக் குறிக்கிறது.

இருப்பினும், வழக்கின் அனைத்து தொடர்புடைய விவரங்களும் முழுமையாக ஆராயப்பட வேண்டும் என்று அவர் கூறினார்.

*2025-10-01 17:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226616) · `ta`

The father of an 8 -year -old schoolgirl has lodged a complaint at a school in Colombo against the Colombo Swimming Club.

My son was attending a birthday party at the Colombo Swimming Association.

We did not answer the questions asked by the doctors as to how much time the son was given and when the ambulance came.

This is because the authorities of the Colombo Swimming Corporation did not provide us with the right information regarding the incident. They have no CCTV cameras.

The negligence of the Colombo Swimming Association is responsible for the brain damage to my son.

Therefore, the father said in the complaint that I would like to ask the police to conduct a proper investigation into the matter.

### US government faces brain drain as 154,000 federal workers exit this week

*2025-10-01 15:50:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113111/us-government-faces-brain-drain-as-154000-federal-workers-exit-this-week) · `en`

More than 150,000 federal employees will leave the U.S. government payroll this week after accepting buyouts - the largest single-year exodus of civil servants in nearly 80 years, triggering what unions and governance experts warn is a damaging loss of institutional expertise.

The official resignations begin on Tuesday for workers who opted into a deferred exit program that kept them on the payroll through September. The buyouts are a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s push to shrink the federal workforce, combining financial incentives with threats of dismissal for those who declined the offer.

Many left their agencies months ago, according to the federal government’s HR office, and have effectively been on paid leave.

Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said the biggest impact of this week’s exodus will be the brain drain of so many experienced civil servants, a loss of talent he says will be hard to reverse.
