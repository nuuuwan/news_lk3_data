    "The Court of Appeal has ordered that the retirement age of specialist doctors in public service be extended to 63 years.",
    "This decision was delivered this morning (Dec.15), when a writ application filed by 176 specialist doctors challenging the Cabinet decision to lower their age of retirement to 60 years.",
    "Appeals Court President, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice A. Marikkar sat for the petition hearing today.",
    "On October 17, 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers gave its approval to revise the retirement age of specialist doctors from 63 to 60, however, the move was widely criticized by the medical officers. As per the Cabinet decision, doctors aged 60, 61 and 62 by the end of 2022 were allowed to serve until 61, 62 and 63 respectively, however, those aged 59 were required to retire by the age of 60.",
    "Later, 176 specialist doctors filed a writ application challenging the Cabinet decision to revise the retirement age of specialist doctors.",
    "On June 28, the Ministry of Health informed the Appeals Court of its decision to extend the compulsory retirement age of specialist doctors in the public service to 63 years. The Health Secretary had told the court that the service period of specialist doctors would thus be extended to 63 years by revising the current compulsory retirement age, pending the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers."
