Supreme Court rejects YouTuber Ashan Senaratne's appeal against National Election Commission's rejection of nomination. Commission claims unauthorized submission. Senaratne expresses frustration, submits documents outside. Election Commission states nominations must be submitted by specific individuals.

üü©

The Supreme Court today rejected a petition filed by YouTubeyuber Ashan Senaratne against the decision of the National Election Commission, which rejected its nomination for the upcoming general election.

The National Election Commission had earlier rejected the list of nominations of the Independent Committee of the famous Yudubar Ashan Senaratne in Colombo district.

The Commission disqualified the Independent Committee, claiming that the nominations were submitted by an unauthorized person.

In a video posted on social media at the time, Senaratne expressed his frustration over the incident and said that he was asked to wait outside, which led to submitting documents.

Commenting on the issue, the Election Commission stated that nominations should be submitted by certain persons and that the failure to follow this rule would be disqualified.

Following this, Ashan Senaratna filed a case in the High Court last week against the decision of the Election Commission.

Current government maintains IMF program structure. Corruption remains a significant issue, hindering foreign investment. Delays in customs processes affect business operations. Political figures like former Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva have been accused of demanding bribes.

Question - We are currently in the midst of the IMF plan. How far you are confident that the current government will continue to carry out this?

They have re -appointed the Secretary of the Treasury, who was negotiating with the International Monetary Fund.

This is the best signal that the new government respects the agreement with the International Monetary Fund.

She further stressed that while Sri Lanka‚Äôs economic recovery is underway, addressing its substantial debt burden remains a priority.
