  "original_body_lines": [
    "Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, was stabbed by another inmate and seriously injured Friday at a federal prison in Arizona, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.",
    "The attack happened at the Federal Correctional Institution, Tucson, a medium-security prison that has been plagued by security lapses and staffing shortages. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the attack and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that an incarcerated person was assaulted at FCI Tucson at around 12:30 p.m. local time Friday. In a statement, the agency said responding employees contained the incident and performed \u201clife-saving measures\u201d before the inmate, who it did not name, was taken to a hospital for further treatment and evaluation.",
    "No employees were injured and the FBI was notified, the Bureau of Prisons said. Visiting at the facility, which has about 380 inmates, has been suspended.",
    "Messages seeking comment were left with Chauvin\u2019s lawyers and the FBI.",
    "Chauvin\u2019s stabbing is the second high-profile attack on a federal prisoner in the last five months. In July, disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar was stabbed by a fellow inmate at a federal penitentiary in Florida.",
    "It is also the second major incident at the Tucson federal prison in a little over a year. In November 2022, an inmate at the facility\u2019s low-security prison camp pulled out a gun and attempted to shoot a visitor in the head. The weapon, which the inmate shouldn\u2019t have had, misfired and no one was hurt.",
    "Chauvin, 47, was sent to FCI Tucson from a maximum-security Minnesota state prison in August 2022 to simultaneously serve a 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights and a 22\u00bd-year state sentence for second-degree murder.",
    "Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, had advocated for keeping him out of general population and away from other inmates, anticipating he\u2019d be a target. In Minnesota, Chauvin was mainly kept in solitary confinement \u201dlargely for his own protection,\u201d Nelson wrote in court papers last year.",
    "Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Chauvin\u2019s appeal of his murder conviction. Separately, Chauvin is making a longshot bid to overturn his federal guilty plea, claiming new evidence shows he didn\u2019t cause Floyd\u2019s death.",
    "Floyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9\u00bd minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.",
    "Bystander video captured Floyd\u2019s fading cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d His death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.",
    "Three other former officers who were at the scene received lesser state and federal sentences for their roles in Floyd\u2019s death.",
    "Chauvin\u2019s stabbing comes as the federal Bureau of Prisons has faced increased scrutiny in recent years following wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s jail suicide in 2019. It\u2019s another example of the agency\u2019s inability to keep even its highest profile prisoners safe after Nassar\u2019s stabbing and \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski\u2019s suicide at a federal medical center in June.",
    "An ongoing AP investigation has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department\u2019s largest law enforcement agency with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an annual budget of about $8 billion.",
    "AP reporting has revealed rampant sexual abuse and other criminal conduct by staff, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides.",
    "Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters was brought in last year to reform the crisis-plagued agency. She vowed to change archaic hiring practices and bring new transparency, while emphasizing that the agency\u2019s mission is \u201cto make good neighbors, not good inmates.\u201d",
    "Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, Peters touted steps she\u2019d taken to overhaul problematic prisons and beef up internal affairs investigations. This month, she told a House Judiciary subcommittee that hiring had improved and that new hires were outpacing retirements and other departures.",
    "But Peters has also irritated lawmakers who said she reneged on her promise to be candid and open with them. In September, senators scolded her for forcing them to wait more than a year for answers to written questions and for claiming that she couldn\u2019t answer basic questions about agency operations, like how many correctional officers are on staff."
