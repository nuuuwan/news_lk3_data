  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a recent statement, Sri Lanka\u2019s Export Development Board\u00a0 (EDB) announced plans to secure USD 31.3 billion revenue from total\u00a0 exports (both goods and services) by 2027. The EDB expects to double\u00a0 goods export revenue from 2022\u2019s USD 13.1 billion to USD 26 billion in five\u00a0 years \u2013 a yearly growth rate of 15%.",
    "Sri Lanka has a history of seemingly ambitious export\u00a0 targets being missed and subsequently downgraded, and these fresh export\u00a0 aspirations face potential scepticism. For instance, the government\u00a0 expected to double goods exports from USD 10.6 billion in 2011 to USD 20\u00a0 billion by 2020. However, as of 2022, goods exports of Sri Lanka earned\u00a0 only USD 13.1 billion, and the country has failed miserably to reach\u00a0 its target. Given that Sri Lanka only managed a modest increase of less\u00a0 than USD 3 billion in its goods exports over a decade (2011-2022), the\u00a0 aspiration to double exports in just five years, amid a global economic\u00a0 downturn and the uncertainty created by the rivalry between major\u00a0 economies, appears overly ambitious.",
    "In fact, the EDB is already facing a setback, in only the\u00a0 first year of its 5-year plan. Contrary to its expectations, the goods\u00a0 exports in the first five months of 2023 fell by 8% compared to the same\u00a0 period in 2022. The goods export target set for 2023 is USD 15.9\u00a0 billion. The slowing down of exports, combined with the gloomy forecasts\u00a0 made by the apparel industry that accounts for over 40% of the\u00a0 country\u2019s exports, will make it challenging for the EDB to meet its 2023\u00a0 target.",
    "According to World Bank trade data, Vietnam, a peer economy\u00a0 in the region, increased its goods exports by almost three times between\u00a0 2011 and 2020 \u2013 despite Sri Lanka failing to even double its exports.\u00a0 The same source of data also shows that Sri Lanka\u2019s ambition to double\u00a0 its exports in the next five years, while seemingly a formidable challenge,\u00a0 is modest in comparison to the past export track records of many others\u00a0 in the region. For instance, from 2001 onwards, Vietnam managed to\u00a0 double its goods exports consistently over periods of five years or less.\u00a0 It has gone from USD 15 billion goods exports in 2001 to an export\u00a0 value of USD 200 billion in 2017. It almost doubled its exports over\u00a0 the past five years to USD 370 billion in 2022, even amid the pandemic.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Malaysia also scaled up its exports from USD 100 billion to\u00a0 USD 200 billion within five years. Thailand did the same in six years. India\u00a0 expanded its exports from USD 75 billion to USD 150 billion in just three\u00a0 years, and from USD 150 billion to USD 300 billion in four years.",
    "There are several key differences that stand out when\u00a0 comparing Sri Lanka with other countries in the region that experienced\u00a0 rapid growth in their exports within a short period \u2013 such as Thailand,\u00a0 Malaysia, and more recently, Vietnam. These differences shed light on\u00a0 important factors Sri Lanka appears to have neglected in its efforts to\u00a0 increase exports.",
    "The first difference is that Sri Lanka strived to grow its\u00a0 exports by squeezing more out of existing industries and existing\u00a0 markets. In contrast, the other countries that saw their exports jump\u00a0 several-fold achieved that by expanding to new products and new markets.\u00a0 The second difference is that Sri Lanka heavily depended on existing\u00a0 investors to contribute more to exports. However, countries like\u00a0 Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam generated more exports by bringing in new\u00a0 investors.",
    "Mobile phone exports from Vietnam grew from USD 2 billion in 2010\u00a0 to USD 58 billion by 2021. An article published by The Economist\u00a0 magazine in May this year points out that Thailand\u2019s early presence in\u00a0 automotive supply chains enabled it to emerge as the tenth-largest\u00a0 producer of cars in the world, surpassing countries like France and\u00a0 Britain. Thailand almost doubled the value of automobile exports within a\u00a0 decade (2008-2018), from USD 18 billion to USD 32 billion. According to\u00a0 Reuters, Malaysia accounts for 13% of global chip assembly, testing and\u00a0 packaging, and 7% of the world\u2019s semiconductor trade. Connecting to\u00a0 GVCs enabled Malaysia to double its electronics exports from USD 49\u00a0 billion in 2008 to USD 105 billion in 2018.",
    "Overall, GVC-led exports (electrical goods, machinery, and\u00a0 automobiles) account for over 40% of the total exports of Thailand,\u00a0 Malaysia, and Vietnam. In contrast, exports of these products account\u00a0 for a mere 5% of Sri Lanka\u2019s total exports.",
    "The next major shift that happened in the world market in\u00a0 the recent past is the pivot of world trade to the East. In the 21st\u00a0 century, with this shift, China emerged as the world\u2019s second-largest\u00a0 importer. Its imports increased nine-fold in the last two decades, from\u00a0 USD 295 billion in 2002 to USD 2,716 billion in 2022. Countries like\u00a0 Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam were quick to expand their exports to\u00a0 this new and rapidly growing market in the region. Exports to China in\u00a0 2021 accounted for 14%, 15% and 17% of the total exports of these\u00a0 countries, respectively. In contrast, Sri Lanka went on a borrowing\u00a0 spree with China but failed to benefit from the massive and rapidly\u00a0 growing Chinese market. As of 2021, exports to China accounted for only\u00a0 2% of the total exports of Sri Lanka.",
    "The experience of countries in the region has valuable\u00a0 lessons for Sri Lanka. First, the importance of identifying and\u00a0 utilising emerging opportunities in the global market. Second, the\u00a0 importance of venturing into new products and new markets \u2013 which is\u00a0 only possible by bringing in new investments, both local and foreign.",
    "If Sri Lanka is to accelerate its exports, it is critical\u00a0 for the country to be able to respond to major shifts taking place in\u00a0 the global market at present. For example, in response to growing\u00a0 geopolitical tensions between the USA and China, many companies are\u00a0 seeking new investment locations to make their supply chains resilient\u00a0 to emerging geopolitical shocks. The Economist has coined the term\u00a0 \u201cAltAsia\u201d for a collection of 14 countries in the region which has the\u00a0 highest potential to become investment destinations for companies\u00a0 seeking to reduce the over-reliance on China and diversify their supply\u00a0 chains. It includes most of the ASEAN countries, as well as our South\u00a0 Asian neighbours India and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is absent from this map\u00a0 of \u2018AltAsia\u2019. While these countries are already attracting investments\u00a0 from major MNCs like Apple, Google, Samsung, and Intel, Sri Lanka\u00a0 appears to be missing this opportunity again.",
    "The EDB is yet to publish a detailed official version of\u00a0 the country\u2019s national export strategy for the next five years.\u00a0 However, unless Sri Lanka takes note of the current shifts in the global\u00a0 market and devises strategies to capitalise on emerging opportunities,\u00a0 it will miss the latest target of doubling exports in five years too."
