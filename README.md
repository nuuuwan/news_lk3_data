What we have witnessed in Sri Lanka is a massive concentration of power and often politicians have resorted to serving themselves or their cronies because concentration of power in one person is a dangerous weapon

The judiciary holds its scales of justice evenly despite various attempts at stripping its powers. The legislature had made veiled threats aimed at the distinguished members of the Judiciary several times. Some learned Justices have been unceremoniously booted out from the office. The Standing Orders have not been properly adopted in compliance with the fundamental rights of the Constitution. A Constituent Assembly could look into all aspects of the Constitution and bring forth a new Constitution which will have the backing from the people of Sri Lanka. That can restore dignity to the people of Sri Lanka
