    "Accuses NPP Govt. of mishandling governance and focusing on trivial, self-created issues",
    "Criticises Govt. for transforming minor matters into major political points",
    "Warns NPP\u2019s current approach risks becoming a political joke in long term",
    "Former MP Charitha Herath delivered a sharp critique of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government during a media briefing held at the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) head office in Pita Kotte yesterday.",
    "Addressing the gathering, Herath accused the NPP Government of mishandling governance and prioritising trivial issues. \u201cThe Government is currently in a quagmire of its own making,\u201d he remarked, asserting that the challenges faced by the NPP stem from self-created \u201ctrivial issues\u201d rather than those inherited from previous administrations.",
    "Herath criticised the NPP for transforming minor matters, such as the refusal to dine in Parliament\u2019s cafeteria or attend cultural performances, into major political talking points. \u201cThese actions demonstrate the Government\u2019s struggle to maintain the \u2018paper palace\u2019 it created to win elections,\u201d he added.",
    "The former MP also alleged that the NPP Government had built a narrative to delegitimise past Governments and politicians. \u201cThey constructed a story that for 76 years, all politicians and political ideologies in the country were wrong, and only the NPP was right,\u201d he said. He claimed the party\u2019s reliance on this narrative has forced them to exert immense effort to retain public support, describing their strategy as one built on \u201clies\u201d.",
    "Prof. Herath warned that the Government\u2019s efforts to preserve its credibility may soon backfire. \u201cThe NPP will now have to work hard for five years to protect the fabricated stories that won them political power. These actions risk turning into a political joke,\u201d he said, pointing to growing internal crises and allegations of criminality and fraud within the ruling party\u2019s ranks."
