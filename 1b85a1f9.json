    "The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has informed the public to use pipe water sparingly due to the prevailing dry weather conditions.",
    "Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the NWSDB said the average water consumption of people had increased drastically due to the dry weather.",
    "They said there has been a drastic decrease in the water levels of the catchment areas due to not receiving sufficient rain.",
    "They said due to insufficient water levels at the intake, the water purification and supply could become low.",
    "The Water Board requests the public to limit the use of purified tap water for activities like washing cars, gardening, swimming pool maintenance etc. Due to the low pressure the water supply to higher-lying areas may be disrupted. Therefore, people are requested to collect water and use it sparingly.",
    "The NWSDB said the situation may improve if the catchment areas receive rain.",
    "They also said certain areas may receive water at low pressure. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
