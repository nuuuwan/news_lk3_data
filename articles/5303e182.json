    "SLGJA President Akram Cassim said: \u201cThe Sapphire Sponsorship Circle reflects the unity and strength of our industry, with some of Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost gem exporters and jewellers coming together to elevate FACETS 2026. Their support is a powerful endorsement of our shared vision to showcase the brilliance of Sri Lankan gemstones and craftsmanship on a global stage. FACETS has always been more than just an exhibition; it is a celebration of our heritage, a driver of innovation, and a platform to connect Sri Lanka with the world.\u201d",
    "FACETS 2026 Chairman Armil Sammoon said: \u201cFACETS has proudly carried the story of Sri Lanka\u2019s gems to the world for over three decades. Since its inception in 1991, the exhibition has grown into an internationally respected platform that highlights the richness of our sapphire legacy and the incredible variety of over 50 gemstones found in our island. Each edition has not only promoted our exports but also strengthened Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation as the true \u2018Island of Gems.\u2019 FACETS 2026 will build on this history with a bold, futuristic vision that connects our past to the opportunities of tomorrow.\u201d",
    "FACETS 2026 also announced that Universal Travel Bureau (UTB) has signed up as its Official Travel Partner. As part of this, UTB will curate customised pre-show and post-show experiences for delegates, which will allow to experience and connect with Sri Lanka at a deeper level. These offerings will include exclusive gem mine tours, which will provide visitors with a rare insight into mining traditions that have spanned centuries, and the sustainable practices that continue to define the gem industry. Through this collaboration, FACETS 2026 goes beyond being just a trade show, transforming into a cultural gateway that blends heritage, hospitality, and discovery.",
    "The SLGJA said the relocation of FACETS to Cinnamon Life City of Dreams also marks a bold new chapter for the exhibition. This will be the first time that the exhibition will span two dedicated floors, with an immersive layout that combines tradition and innovation. Visitors will have the opportunity to explore a plethora of interactive displays that detail the gem journey from mine to market. Story Corners, where exhibitors share their brand stories, and VR showcases, offering insights into Sri Lanka\u2019s gemstone origins, will also be featured.",
    "FACET Sri Lanka 2026 will also spotlight sustainability, ethical sourcing, and cutting-edge design to ensure that the exhibition not only celebrates Sri Lanka\u2019s 2,500-year gem heritage, but also aligns with future global trade and consumer expectations. Over its 30-year history, FACETS has evolved into one of the most anticipated and respected exhibitions in the international gem and jewellery calendar. The country itself is synonymous with sapphires ranging from the celebrated cornflower blue to the rare padparadscha and modern teal. Sri Lanka\u2019s gems have long adorned the world\u2019s most prestigious collections.",
    "This edition of FACETS seeks to honour and celebrate this legacy, while also reimagining the future, drawing global buyers, traders, and enthusiasts to Colombo for a truly memorable showcase. Backed by the Sapphire Sponsorship Circle and further strengthened by its partnership with UTC, FACETS Sri Lanka 2026 is set to be its most dynamic edition to date, the SLGJA added."
