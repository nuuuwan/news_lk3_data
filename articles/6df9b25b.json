    "The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Chairman and former Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya in a statement has called for responsible leadership in respecting the choice of the people from all candidates competing at the Presidential election on 21 September as well as party leaders.",
    "\u201cAs we approach a crucial Presidential election, the people of Sri Lanka have the opportunity to choose their Head of State for the next five years. Every citizen is entitled to exercise this right freely, without any interference.",
    "In this context, party leaders bear an even greater responsibility than the Presidential candidates themselves. Their foremost duty is to respect the people\u2019s choice. Upholding this decision is not only a matter of adhering to the country\u2019s laws and principles of social justice but also respecting basic moral and civilised standards.",
    "We highlight this due to the commitment demonstrated by Sri Lankan society in recent years to establish an election culture that is peaceful and free from violence. This effort must continue. Failing to do so risks placing Sri Lanka in a situation similar to that of Bangladesh. It is essential to recognise the tragic consequences seen in certain African nations where post-election violence has devastated communities, and we must take steps to prevent such situations.",
    "Additionally, we wish to remind everyone that the President elected on 21 September will carry significant responsibilities for the nation. One of the key duties will be to ensure that Parliamentary, Provincial Council (PC), and Local Government (LG) elections are conducted properly, allowing the public to fully engage in the democratic process. Moreover, it is critical to reform the current electoral system by abolishing the Executive Presidency, which concentrates excessive power in one individual. A special Presidential Commission, chaired by former Chief Justice (CJ), and President\u2019s Counsel Priyasath Dep, has already made several important recommendations for electoral reform.",
    "These proposals should be made available to the public as soon as possible. We believe that presenting them as a white paper, based on contributions from civil society organisations, academic forums, and others, will spark valuable public debate.",
    "It is also important to recognise the efforts of the Election Commission (EC), the security forces, and other Government officials, who have worked tirelessly to ensure a free and fair election.",
    "Thanks to the EC\u2019s oversight, all election-related activities have been conducted in a peaceful and lawful manner. We extend our thanks to them and other institutions for their hard work. After 22 September, the future of Sri Lanka will rest on the continued good actions of authorities and the law-abiding nature of the citizens. We expect all parties in the country to fulfil their national responsibilities with integrity.\u201d"
