    "The truck test ensuring the Blade Battery can withstand upto 50 tons of pressure",
    "For years, worries about electric vehicles (EV) have remained, much like the persistent presence of vehicle exhaust fumes. Concerns about fiery meltdowns and roadside range woes cast a shadow on the electric revolution. But nestled in the heart of innovation, global giant BYD has forged a technological masterpiece to rewrite the rules of EV safety, range, and charging: the Blade Battery. While this game-changer has disrupted the global automobile landscape, its impact is particularly exciting for Sri Lanka, thanks to the crucial partnership between BYD and JKH.",
    "BYD\u2019s story is intricately woven with the evolution of batteries. From humble beginnings as a manufacturer, they\u2019ve relentlessly championed safer, more efficient technologies. This deep understanding of power flows through everything BYD does. Their EV journey began not with flashy debuts, but with tireless research and development, building a foundation of expertise in battery technology. They rose from a manufacturer to a powerhouse, pioneering safer and more efficient batteries, a choice that set them apart from the crowd. This dedication propelled them onto the global stage, where their EVs, powered by their own innovations, now cruise along bustling city streets and wind along scenic highways across the world. From their home turf in China to the expanding markets of Europe, Americas and Asia Pacific and other regions, BYD\u2019s commitment to clean mobility is leaving its mark, one powerful, efficient battery at a time.",
    "This deep understanding of power flows through the Blade Battery, a masterpiece redefining everything we thought we knew about EV limitations. Forget bulky modules \u2013 the Blade Battery integrates individual cells directly into the vehicle\u2019s core. This revolutionary design throttles the Achilles\u2019 heel of lithium-ion batteries \u2013 heat runaway \u2013 preventing the domino effect of fiery failures. Picture your sleek BYD SEAL gliding through the streets of Colombo, its Blade Battery impervious to punctures and heat, having passed the Mount Everest nail penetration test- the most extreme test for battery safety.",
    "The Blade Battery\u2019s ultra-high strength and cellular aluminum-like structure ensure that it is less likely to suffer catastrophic damage. It has been rigorously tested to withstand up to 50 tons of pressure without significant deformation, ensuring no fires and normal vehicle operation post-accident, a far cry from the anxieties plaguing traditional competitors.",
    "But safety is just the first act in the Blade Battery\u2019s drama. Imagine conquering range anxiety, the stage fright of EV drivers. The BYD\u2019s luxury sports sedan BYD SEAL powered with the Blade Battery is said to have a driving range up to 650 km (NEDC), while the relatively smaller BYD DOLPHIN has a range of 410 km as per the NEDC standard. Furthermore, it is rumoured that the Blade Battery will support a drive range of over 1,000 km in newer models in the near future.",
    "In addition to the long range offered by the battery, the Blade gulps down power like a parched traveller finding an oasis, reaching 80% capacity from 30% SOC (State of Charge) in a lightning-fast 15 minutes for the BYD SEAL. Picture zipping through Colombo\u2019s gridlock in the BYD ATTO 3 or cruising along the breathtaking Galle Highway in the BYD DOLPHIN, knowing you can quickly refuel your electric adventures. With the active expansion of charging infrastructure across Sri Lanka, finding your next power source is simply a scene change, paving the way for worry-free commutes and weekend getaways across the island.",
    "But the Blade Battery\u2019s strength goes beyond bulletproofing and swift refuelling. Its compact design maximises space, allowing for king-sized batteries without sacrificing size. Imagine exploring the emerald hills from Kandy to Kataragama in the BYD SEAL, a sedan capable of conquering 500 kilometres on a single charge \u2013 no more range anxiety interrupting your Sri Lankan odyssey! And the battery life? It leaves traditional batteries in the dust, lasting over 4,500 charging cycles with minimal degradation \u2013 over a million worry-free kilometres in the BYD SEAL, BYD ATTO 3, or BYD DOLPHIN, twice the life expectancy of even high-end models of other players.",
    "The Blade Battery\u2019s impact transcends individual journeys. Its efficient design boosts range and longevity and minimises resource consumption. The compact structure requires less material, reducing the extraction and refining of environmentally sensitive metals like cobalt and nickel. Additionally, the extended lifespan translates to fewer batteries produced and discarded over time, minimising waste generation and resource depletion. This translates to a lower carbon footprint throughout the battery\u2019s lifecycle, paving the way for a cleaner future for both Sri Lanka and the world.",
    "BYD\u2019s Blade Battery isn\u2019t just a technological marvel; it\u2019s a catalyst for change. It shatters the myths of unsafe, short-lived batteries, replacing them with fortresses of power and endurance. It proves that EVs aren\u2019t just eco-friendly alternatives; they can be exhilarating machines, redefining how we experience the open road."
