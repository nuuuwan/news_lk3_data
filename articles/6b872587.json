Many of these patients seek medical attention only once they reach the third stage.

    "The Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists (SLCP), dedicated to the field of pulmonology, will hold the 15th Annual Academic Session \u2018Respire 2025\u2019 at the Sri Lanka Medical Association from 9 to 11 February at the Cinnamon Grand.",
    "The flagship event will serve as a platform to empower healthcare professionals and the public to enhance respiratory health outcomes through innovation, collaboration, and knowledge dissemination. Themed \u2018Equity in Respiratory Health: For the Right to Breathe Free,\u2019 the SLCP underscored its vision of delivering state-of-the-art respiratory care across the country without discrimination.",
    "SLCP President and Consultant Respiratory Physician Dr. Neranjan Dissanayake remarked that the flagship event will be a transformative gathering for professionals in respiratory medicine, not only in Sri Lanka but across the region. \u201c\u2018Respire 2025\u2019 is not solely another knowledge sharing conference \u2013 it is also a celebration of 15 years of unwavering commitment to advancing pulmonology, improving patient care, and fostering a dynamic community of respiratory specialists,\u201d he told a media briefing.",
    "Highlighting critical respiratory health challenges facing Sri Lanka, Dr. Dissanayake described the high burden posed by asthma, on people of all ages. \u201cSri Lanka has one of the highest prevalence rates globally and is one of the top 10 countries with deaths due to asthma. Studies indicate that approximately 23.9% of adults in Sri Lanka experience asthma symptoms, such as current wheezing, which is notably higher than the global average of 4.5%. Despite these high prevalence rates, many individuals, including pregnant women and children, lack effective management of asthma, even when the condition is properly diagnosed.\u201d",
    "He also spoke of the surge in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD), a common lung disease restricting airflow, affecting around 10-15% of the population. While COPD is primarily attributed to cigarette smoking in Sri Lanka, recent studies have identified other contributing factors, such as indoor air pollution. Although COPD is globally prevalent amongst men due to smoking, in Sri Lanka, biomass fuel exposure as a result of wood burning and cooking means females are especially affected.",
    "Another respiratory crisis in the country was tuberculosis, responsible for around 700-750 deaths, with two deaths occurring on a daily basis. Although it is easily remedied abroad, Sri Lanka\u2019s mortality rate due to this disease calls for urgent assistance, with enhanced preventative measures.",
    "Other viral infections include influenza and lung cancer that resulted in disability and death, particularly among the elderly, expectant mothers, and toddlers, underscoring the need for greater specialist care, such as enhanced paediatric treatment for children.",

    "We aim to update professionals with the latest advancements in respiratory health, promoting enhanced professional development and evidence-based practice.

    "He also stressed the importance of leveraging social media to engage diverse audiences as a means of raising public awareness about symptoms, prevention, and treatment options. Key highlights of the program to achieve these objectives include pre-congress workshops, hands-on training, and post-congress initiatives. International experts, including research authors and specialist doctors ranging from countries such as, Canada, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh are expected to deliver cutting-edge insights, while the presence of Government health officials and medical colleges can guarantee improved access to quality healthcare services to all in the long-run.",
    "The SLCP has consistently championed initiatives to expand access to quality respiratory care. From conducting postgraduate training programs to organising workshops in underserved regions like Ampara, Vavuniya, and Puttalam, they remain committed to uplifting healthcare standards nationwide.",
    "This year\u2019s conference epitomises their dedication to ensuring fair access to respiratory care, as reflected in the theme. By bringing international expertise to Colombo, \u2018Respire 2025\u2019 aims to inspire innovation and excellence in"
