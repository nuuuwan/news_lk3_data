  "original_body_lines": [
    "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has revealed that permission for the import of vehicles will be granted in the month of August.",
    "Accordingly, the state minister said that permission will be given for the import of vehicles required for business and transportation at the initial stage.",
    "\u201cA government cannot lead the country back to the point of imposing import restrictions by asking for this election. At that time, all other restrictions were eased except for vehicles. Regarding the easing of vehicle restrictions, the government\u2019s position as of August is how the import restrictions on vehicles will be removed in stages. We hope to give permission to those vehicles required for business activities and transportation in the first round. But we expect to import vehicles for private consumption in the first quarter of 2025,\u201d said Semasinghe."
