    "Exterminators PLC, in technical collaboration with Pest Scan BV, Netherlands, and Sentario UK Ltd., has launched IoT in pest management in South Asia. Through constant innovation, creative strategic disruption, and in-depth research, Exterminators PLC has developed a system to transform the industry by designing, developing, crafting, articulating, and amalgamating the world\u2019s best preventive pest tech tools, devices, components, and technologies, powered by IoT, AI, and machine learning, while balancing trade-offs between people, profit, and the planet.",
    "This unique approach combines a diverse range of tools, devices, components, and technologies to proactively prevent and manage pest risks while simultaneously minimising the environmental impact.",
    "With IoT devices and sensors, Exterminators PLC enables real-time monitoring of pest activity and environmental conditions. This allows early detection of pest infestations, facilitating prompt action to prevent further spread and damage. With a strong commitment to excellence, sustainability, and innovation, the company is leading the way in shaping the future of the pest tech industry in South Asia and emerging and developing markets.",
    "A key component of Exterminators PLC\u2019s strategic approach to pest management is the utilisation of IoT technology. By incorporating sensors, cameras, and other IoT devices, the company can monitor pests in real-time, track their movements, and analyse data to identify trends and patterns. This proactive approach to pest control helps to mitigate infestations before they occur, rather than reacting after the fact.",
    "In addition, Exterminators PLC uses AI and machine learning to predict and prevent pest outbreaks. By analysing historical data and applying algorithms to identify potential risk factors, the company tailors its pest management strategies to specific environments and conditions. This not only improves the precision of its treatments but also reduces the reliance on harmful chemicals and pesticides.",
    "The company emphasises precision pest control, using IoT-enabled devices to provide targeted pest control measures that reduce the need for broad, indiscriminate pesticide applications. This approach saves time and resources while minimising the impact on non-target species and the environment.",
    "Exterminators PLC remains committed to finding sustainable solutions to pest management that prioritise the health and safety of its customers and the environment. By leveraging the latest technologies and continuously innovating its approach, the company offers comprehensive and effective pest control services that address the needs of today\u2019s ever-changing world.",
    "The use of IoT (Internet of Things) and DigiTech (Digital Technology) in pest management offers numerous benefits that improve efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. Some of these advantages include automation and remote control, which allow DigiTech tools to automate processes like deploying traps or spraying pesticides at optimal times. Remote control capabilities further enable pest management professionals to monitor and adjust control measures from anywhere, enhancing efficiency and response times.",
    "Additionally, IoT devices allow Exterminators PLC to collect and analyse vast amounts of data on pest behaviour, population dynamics, and treatment efficacy. This data-driven decision-making helps the company develop more effective pest control strategies, leading to better outcomes.",
    "IoT and DigiTech solutions are also seamlessly integrated with existing pest management systems, streamlining operations and improving communication between stakeholders. This integration simplifies data management and allows for more coordinated and efficient pest control efforts.",
    "Exterminators PLC Founder and Managing Director Marlon Ferreira, underscores the transformative potential of incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) and Digi-Pest-Tech in pest control practices. Ferreira advocates that these technological advancements offer a cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional pest management methods. By utilising cutting-edge technology, pest management professionals can enhance operational efficiency and efficacy in mitigating pest infestations.",
    "While the application of drones has garnered attention for addressing targeted mosquito infestations, Ferreira cautions against their use in broader agricultural contexts, particularly in tropical small countries. He highlights the detrimental impact of drones on local ecosystems, including the pollution of air and unintended harm to beneficial pollinators such as bees, butterflies, wasps, and moths, as well as other non-target insect species. Such collateral damage poses significant risks to biodiversity and agricultural productivity.",
    "Ferreira\u2019s insights emphasise the need for a judicious application of technology in pest management. By balancing innovation and ecological responsibility, the industry can harness the full potential of IoT and Digi-Pest-Tech while safeguarding the delicate ecosystems that many communities rely upon. Responsible technology use is crucial for sustainable pest control practices in modern agriculture."
