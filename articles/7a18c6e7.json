    "The media is awash with stories about official ceremonies in Sri Lanka, which is perhaps the only country where no project is commenced or opened, without the presence of politicians. Even the opening of a public convenience is not considered complete without a politician cutting the so-called ceremonial ribbon. A member of the current administration has come under a social media piranha attack for ceremonially opening a public tap. During the last several decades, Presidents, Prime Ministers and ministers of all political hues have spent a lot of time, energy and state funds, attending ceremonies related to development projects, etc., countrywide.",
    "Last year, former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena came under fire for their excessive travel in the Sri Lanka Air Force helicopters, while in office. The distance they, their predecessors and successors each travelled overland may be several times the circumference of the globe. It is doubtful whether any benefits have accrued to the country from their extensive travel. Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe is now facing legal action over alleged misuse of state funds during a foreign visit while in office.",
    "The travel bug has not spared the members of the incumbent administration either despite their much-avowed commitment to austerity measures. They travel long distances to attend various ceremonies. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was in the North yesterday to commence some development projects there. Northern development, no doubt, must figure high on the government\u2019s agenda, but should the President, ministers and state officials go all the way from Colombo to attend such events, for the public has to bear the cost of their travel, etc. Security arrangements alone cost the public an arm and a leg.",
    "There is absolutely no need for ceremonies to mark the commencement or the opening of development projects, especially those carried out with state funds. Such events only help boost politicians\u2019 egos. Political leaders and officials ought to take a leaf out of the Sri Lanka Navy\u2019s book. The Navy has been quenching the thirst of millions of people and helping prevent renal diseases by building Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in areas facing chronic shortages of potable water. It has so far constructed and handed over about 1,000 RO plants, with the assistance of philanthropists\u2013\u2013without fanfare. This example is worthy of emulation.",
    "One may recall that President Dissanayake and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Sampur solar energy project via a virtual platform in April. This is the best way for the government leaders and state officials to attend ceremonies. They should remain mindful of the country\u2019s economic problems and do everything possible to save state funds. Having obtained a popular mandate to bring about a major system overhaul, the NPP politicians are duty-bound to set examples and precedents, aren\u2019t they?",
    "Sri Lankan Presidents usually embark on their re-election campaigns on the pretext of launching and opening development projects and attending various ceremonies. They craftily use state funds for this purpose, and that may explain why Rajapaksa and Sirisena had so many SLAF chopper rides. President Wickremesinghe drew heavy flak for travelling all over the country, handing over freehold deeds to people living on state-owned land, and launching numerous projects, as part of his presidential election campaign. His strategy did not work; he came a poor third in last year\u2019s presidential race. Rajapaksa\u2019s efforts to secure a third term came a copper in 2015. Sirisena had to opt out of the 2019 presidential election. It is not possible that President Dissanayake is emulating his predecessors as the NPP has made a solemn pledge to abolish the executive presidency. The JVP has ostentatiously displayed its antipathy towards that institution since 1978.",
    "Wanderlust seems to be a shared characteristic of all Sri Lankan political leaders. We once said in an editorial comment that President Sirisena was travelling overseas at such a rate that while going out, he might meet himself coming in, at the BIA. A wag asks whether President Dissanayake is determined to break that record.",
    "It is hoped that politicians and officials will rest their legs and tongues and set their minds to what needs to be done to revitalise the economy and improve the people\u2019s lot.",
