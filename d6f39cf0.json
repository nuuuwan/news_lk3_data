    "The water levels in the 73 reservoirs controlled by the Irrigation Department have decreased drastically and only 900,000 acre-inch of water capacity is available for use, the Department said.",
    "A Department spokesperson said only 30.3 percent of the water capacity is available and can be used.",
    "\"Among the 73 reservoirs controlled by the Irrigation Department, there are nine reservoirs that have a water capacity of less than 10 percent and 32 reservoirs with a water capacity of less than 30 percent. The overall water capacity of the reservoirs is less than 50 percent,\" she said.",
    "Considering the long-term studies by following the water levels of the reservoirs, the current water level shows a two or three-percent reduction in water.",
    "\"The hot weather conditions prevailing in the areas are very high, and due to that, the evaporation of water in reservoirs is very high, which we cannot control at all,\" she added.",
    "According to the forecast by the Meteorology Department, the reservoirs are expected to be filled with rain by October. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrame)"
