    "\u201cOn numerous occasions, Opposition members, including myself, have put forward proposals to rectify this injustice both inside and outside the chamber. However, these proposals have been intentionally dismissed by the Speaker,\u201d stated the Opposition Leader. He announced the initiation of a no-confidence motion, which will be discussed in the upcoming party leaders\u2019 meeting. The Opposition Leader expressed their intent to bring the motion to parliament promptly and ensure the removal of the Speaker from his post."
