    "Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala told a news conference that Basil Rajapaksa wanted to reinstate expired LG Bodies as he thinks SLPP\u2019s power is in Local Bodies.",
    "\u201cIt is true that SLPP held power in the majority of LG Bodies. The situation has changed now. They have lost people\u2019s mandate now,\u201d he said.",
