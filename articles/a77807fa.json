    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has untapped potential in marine linked activities, with 1,340 kilometres of coastline and two seasons that allow year-round action, and can be expanded into a billion US dollar industry quickly, an industry official said.",
    "\u201cThe geographical location offers yacht chartering, boating, whale watching, whatever you call, all the sea-based activities,\u201d Kaushal Rajapaksa, Chairman, Chamber of Marine Industries of Sri Lanka told participants of Voyage Sri Lanka 2024, a forum organized by the island\u2019s Export Development Board.",
    "\u201cYou can enjoy the sea year-round as well as sea-based activities. Expanding technological capacity and maritime services, we have advanced capabilities in boat building and whatever the activity is related to maritime.\u201d",
    "Despite the long coastline, and domestic manufacturers of leisure boats, there was a dearth of yacht marinas to get the sector moving.",
    "Colombo Port City is expected to have a \u2018mega marina\u2019 by 2027. There were 21 fishery harbours around the country.",
    "The chamber has been in discussions with authorities to set up mini marinas within the fishery harbours.",
    "\u201cWe will be renewing the discussions with the present government to convert these 21 fisheries harbours partly for mini marinas,\u201d Rajapaksa said.",
    "\u201cWe have a success story, Honorable Minister, in the south, that is the Mirissa Harbor,\u201d he said in an aside to Trade and Commerce Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe who was at the forum.",
    "His own company Sea Leisure Yachting Group and 60 others were in Mirissa and working with fishermen and their families.",
    "\u201cWe give them semi-skilled, multi-skilled training and get them back if they wish to join the 10 jobs we have in water in Sri Lanka,\u201d Rajapaksha said. \u201cAnd this is not only our company, but this is followed by other boat manufacturers.\u201d",
    "The chamber has also presented a development proposal to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to set up a mini marina in Galle Port until a mega marina is built under a public private partnership over the longer term.",
    "Under the National Export Strategy Kapparathota in Weligama is to be developed to support local boat builders.",
    "The Environmental Impact Assessment has been done and the report is awaited. The cabinet has approved a public private partnership.",
    "\u201cSo it\u2019s an opportunity, gentlemen, for the investors. I would say it\u2019s a very quick one, low-hanging fruit, that you can invest in,\u201d Rajapaksa said. \u201d Again, it will be a marina, plus on the other side, fisheries harbor.\u201d",
    "Chamber of Marine Industries of Sri Lanka has become a member of the International Conference of Marine Industry Associations.",
    "\u201cAnd we are getting the best of support and advice from the major players in the marine industry,\u201d he said.",
    "Over the past three years, memoranda of understanding were signed with the Maldives Boat Association, who attended the conference in Colombo. Singapore Boat Association, Indo-Sri Lanka Chambers and the Republic of Tatarstan.",
    "\u201cThe reason for signing all these MOUs for the last three years is to open up for our industry as well as those countries to interact with our industry members and create opportunities for our industry to visit them and for them to come and visit us,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka has several boat manufacturers including Neil Marine, Dhanusha Marine, Chalana Boat Yard and Sail Lanka.",
    "Colombo Dockyard was also building larger ships and specialist vessels. (Colombo/Dec02/2024)"
