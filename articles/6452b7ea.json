    "(Second part of the interview with Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne, lead author and lead photographer of \u2018A Photographic Guide to the Wildlife of Sri Lanka\u2019 published by John Beaufoy Publishing.)",
    "Q: Wildlife photography can be demanding. Could you share some memorable experiences or challenges you\u2019ve encountered while capturing wildlife?",
    "A: I remember once I saw a bull elephant standing still by a waterhole in Yala. My safari vehicle driver wanted to move on. There was nothing to see, he said. I thought there was something going on. The elephant was strangely still. Perhaps it was communicating with a herd using infrasound? Other vehicles drove up. \u2018There is nothing to see\u2019 I heard them say and they drove on hoping for a leopard or sloth bear or some elephants that were doing something. We waited, watched, waited and watched. Another bull elephant emerged and the two had clearly been in conversation. But not amicably. A brief fight ensued. I did not get any amazing pictures on that occasion but it was deeply satisfying to know my instinct had been correct.",
    "On another occasion I did get some good images by positioning my vehicle unobtrusively behind some low scrub overlooking a grassy glade. A bull elephant was grazing peacefully and another arrived and a fight ensued, yards away from my vehicle. I was nervous. In Tsavo East National Park I was on a game drive and came to a waterhole with two hippos. The driver wanted to move on. I suggested we just stay and enjoy the bird life and watch the animals coming in procession to drink water. The driver reluctantly agreed and dozed off. A bull elephant arrived and there was this amazing display of aggression between one of the hippos and the elephant. But it does not have to be large animals.",
    "I am just as thrilled if I am in Diyasaru Wetland Park and a huge Water Monitor walks past me. In the Gambia I was on foot photographing Baboons when I was hit by a branch that had snapped back as a large alpha male pushed past it. I froze as this fearsome male unexpectedly walked past within inches of me. As a rule, I am very careful to keep a safe distance and I think safety is very important. No photograph is worth a photographer risking injury or death or triggering an angry reaction from an animal. But when you are on foot and you are absorbed with watching wildlife and taking images, it is easy for animals to sneak up on you. So always be careful, especially if you are in an area where there are animals that could kill you or kill you and eat you.",
    "Q: How do you approach ethical considerations in wildlife photography, especially when photographing rare or endangered species?",
    "A:My general rule with all wildlife photography is that the welfare of the subject comes first. No photograph is worth disturbing an animal from its feeding or resting. My approach is to let an animal come to me or to approach it very carefully and let it get used to my presence. I will keep my distance and avoid forcing it to flee. Quite often by waiting at a distance an animal gets used to me and approaches me closely. This then makes it possible to observe and photograph natural behaviour.",
    "Q: Do you have any upcoming projects or books on the horizon that you\u2019re excited about?",
    "A. Well, I seem to be going back full circle. My recent book \u2018A Photographic Guide to the Wildlife of Sri Lanka\u2019 was meant to be the one book a wildlife enthusiast or a professional naturalist would take if they only had the space and weight in their field bag for one book. Thanks to contributions from thirteen section contributors it goes some way to being that useful one book. Although having said that, we all know Sri Lanka is so biodiverse that there can never be one field guide.",
    "The present book is a good compromise in size, approaching the upper limit of weight people will carry as a field guide. But following Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis and the devaluation of the currency, the book is too expensive for many people who work in tourism and wildlife. The foundation for this book was laid in a series of simple photographic leaflets and booklets I did many years ago for people to have affordable field guide literature. These simple pictorial booklets had a huge impact. In the early days for a hundred rupees, you could buy one of these simple guides that helped you to put a name to a butterfly or dragonfly. I have been having discussions with my publisher to work with the tourism sector to going back to developing a series of such affordable mini guides for people who can\u2019t afford the more expensive books.",
    "Q: What advice would you give to budding naturalists and photographers who is keen to follow in your footsteps?",
    "A: A good wildlife photographer is also a good naturalist. Try to learn as much as you can about the plants and animals around you. That will open up new worlds for photography which you had not imagined. Being a wildlife photographer requires two skills, as a photographer and as a naturalist. As a photographer you need to understand elements such as lighting, exposure, composition, how to frame a subject and so on. The skills that go into taking a portrait of a person are the same skills that are needed to take a gook wildlife image. Of course, with wildlife, you have no control over wild subjects. So sometimes you have to either position yourself or wait for the subject to move into the right position where lighting, background, composition all come together. Sometimes it never works out and you have to settle for record shots.",
    "Also give some thought to what you are taking the images for. For many people wildlife photography is a creative pursuit to take stunning images to celebrate the natural world. If you are using it to illustrate an article, then you need a range of images to tell the story. If it is for a field guide to plants for example, then it can become quite technical as you first need to understand subtle features that distinguish one species from another. Fortunately, there is now a lot of knowledge available for free on the internet. You can also study the imagery of top photographers to understand how they approach composition.",
    "In my own case, education and creating a livelihood for people out of wildlife tourism has become the main plank of my activities. As a result, even when I am in Yala, without driving around in pursuit of the perfect leopard photograph, I often stop to take pictures of plants which other people might think is quite boring or even a waste of precious time on a game drive.",
    "Q: You\u2019ve done a great deal to promote Eco-Tourism in the country. What more can be done to make it a sustainable industry?",
    "At the macro level, we need the private sector and government agencies to collaborate to make the experience good for both the wildlife and people. In the open sea, if whale watching boats crowd around a whale that is stressful for a feeding whale. Many visitors also do not enjoy the experience. To improve whale watching it needs a combination of training the boat crews as well as enforcement. I was whale watching in Vancouver recently and I noticed how a patrol boat kept an eye on the whale watching boats to ensure they observed the guidelines on distance.",
    "In places like Yala, the experience for visitors can be improved by having different routes with different numbers of vehicles allowed on the routes. People should also be able buy tickets in advance for different timed entry slots. This is not to create a situation where only people with money will be able to see leopards. Each route can be chosen so that on any of the routes there is a near equal likelihood of seeing a leopard. But it can be priced differently so that people who want routes with fewer vehicles allowed can buy tickets for more expensive routes. This will suit people who want a leopard encounter without being disturbed by too many other vehicles. People who just want to see what the park is like or are happy to see birds and plants can buy tickets for a cheaper route which allows a larger number of vehicles.",
    "Then beyond the immediate visitor experience, there are a number of other things we should look at. Tourism, as with everything else, should adopt sustainability practices. The three Rs, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle come into mind. We should adopt this in our personal lives. For example, can we reduce the clothes we buy and wear them for longer. When a shirt is too frayed on the sleeves to be worn when going out, can we re-purpose it as a night shirt?",
    "The providers of tourist accommodation can play a bigger role by adopting sustainable practices. But they can also play a major part in education and habitat creation. The educational aspect is easier if you have a resident naturalist or a member of staff who is willing to take guests on a guided nature walk. My recent book, \u2018A Photographic Guide to the Wildlife of Sri Lanka\u2019 which covers 1,180 species with section contributions from 13 others aims to be something that local naturalists can use as a learning tool.",
    "Tourist hotels can also play a big part in habitat creation. At the larger end this can be the creation of man-made wetlands such as at Jetwing Vil Uyana. But it could be something as simple as planting a few wildlife friendly fruit trees. Or, leaving aside a small patch to grow wild. Nectar plants can be planted for pollinators. But remember, with all species you need to think about not just of their food source, but what physical conditions they require for their lifecycle. This included places to rest and places to reproduce.",
    "Q: How do you balance the dual goals of attracting tourists and protecting natural habitats?",
    "In a developing country like Sri Lanka there is a strong linkage. Yes, we can make commitments to sustainable goals such as the amount of forest cover we want to have. These make a lot of sense in terms of the ecosystem services provided by nature. However, what most people want is to be able to provide for their families. If you are poor and living next to a forest you want to be able to feed your family and afford simple things like buying school books for your children. A forest which is simply declared inviolate is no good. But if you can earn a good living as a wildlife tourism service provider, then you will be happy to conserve the forest. But for this to work, there has to be very good infrastructure for visitors to be able to visit it, and stay and have access to visitor amenities. It needs thinking.",
    "But if it is too successful, does it become a victim of its own success? If it reaches that point, other visitor management measures can be applied including requiring the advance purchase of limited ticket numbers and also developing the infrastructure in a way that different visitors are kept entertained in different ways. At sites where visitors can go about by foot, many casual visitors will be very happy to stay within a radius of a kilometre from the visitor centre. If you think about it, a shopping mall with a very small footprint can still manage to handle tens of thousands of visitors in a day. Well managed nature reserves have also learnt to keep many visitors confined to a small area, leaving those who are more serious to explore further afield.",
