### Canada to cut immigration numbers, government source says

Canada will sharply lower the number of immigrants it allows into the country for the first time in years, marking a notable shift in policy for the government as it tries to remain in power.

Canada will bring in 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027, down from 485,000 in 2024, according to a government source.

The number of temporary residents, meanwhile, will decrease by about 30,000 to around 300,000 in 2025, the source said.

Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers, but in recent years, the national debate around immigrants has shifted in part due to rising housing prices.

Many Canadians have been priced out of the housing market since interest rates started rising two years ago. At the same time, a huge influx of immigrants has pushed Canada’s population to record levels, further boosting housing demand and prices.

The United States said for the first time on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that could mark a significant escalation in Russia’s war against its neighbor.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in Rome, said it would be “very, very serious” if the North Koreans were preparing to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, as Kyiv has alleged. But he said it remained to be seen what they would be doing there.

“There is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,” Austin told reporters, using North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Speaking to reporters later on Wednesday White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States believes at least 3,000 North Korean troops are undergoing training at three military bases in eastern Russia.

### Sri Lanka SOE container terminal to get tax exemptions as ‘special project’

*2024-10-24 09:13:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-soe-container-terminal-to-get-tax-exemptions-as-special-project-184708/) · `en`

ECONOMNYNEXT – A container terminal built by Sri Lanka Ports Authority has been named a ‘special project’ by the cabinet to give tax benefits Minister Vijitha Herath said.

Private terminals in the port are given tax benefits under a Strategic Development Project law.

The excessive length of tax breaks as well as exempting senior official’s companies from personal income tax under the SDP when people earning above 100,000 rupees are taxed has become a contentious issue.

“The International Monetary Fund has objected to benefits under the Strategic Development Act law,” Minister Herath said.

“This is not going under that process. It is going as a special project.”

The SDP had come under fire also for negotiated tax breaks, which allegedly leads to corruption as there are no fixed rules.

The East Terminal is now partially built and contracts for cranes have been awarded, a post-cabinet statement said.

“The other two jetties have been given some tax exemptions,” Minister Herath explained.

### AKD’s call for a ‘powerful’ government: Implications for political system

*2024-10-24 05:44:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-s-call-for-a-powerful-government-Implications-for-political-system/4-768355) · `en`

In his stump speech on the General Election campaign trail, President AKD has called for the voters to produce a “powerful” (“balavath”, “prabala”) government.

Interestingly, he did not call for a “strong” (shakthimath”) government which is conventionally the opposite of a “weak” one. Given where he’s coming from, that distinction and his choice of words should give us pause.

Sri Lanka, Ceylon at the time, was not only the first in Afro-Asia to have universal franchise but it was also the first in South Asia to evolve a two-party system. India which was independent a year before Ceylon, maintained what was defined in the political science literature as a ‘one-party dominant’ system until 1977. That was the party of Independence, the Congress party. The term ‘one-party dominant’ was minted to differentiate such countries from those which had a ‘one-party system’ be it Fascist (e.g., Spain’s Falange) or Communist.

The 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka Anura Kumara Dissanayake

One could not ask for a better market place than the recently staged Presidential election – 17.4 million consumers (voters), targeted essentially by four brands (though there were 38 Presidential candidates registered). Each brand had the stipulation of Rs. 1.8 billion within a two-month period. Given that Sri Lanka is an island nation, it was a ‘perfect market place’. All candidates had the freedom to travel, freedom to use any medium of communication. The candidate that secured the highest share was declared the winner. Let me pick up the key lessons for businesses.
