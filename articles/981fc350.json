    "Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror)- Former President Chandrika Kumaratunge today refuted claims by Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walaha Hengunawewe Dhammarathana Thera that she was getting two pensions.",
    "A statement issued by her office said the allegations by the Thera are false and baseless.",
    "The statement said she was getting only the pension entitled to her as the former President.",
    "It also said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his tenure, increased the pension of the President upto Rs. 97,000 and that the pension of Ms. Kumaratunge and former president D.B. Wijetunge were not increased even though the retired Presidents should also have enjoyed an increase in line with the salary hike of the President.",
    "However, the statement added that the situation was rectified after Maithripala Sirisena was elected President in 2015 and the pension of Ms. Kumaratunge which is credited to her bank account is used only for social services."
