  "original_body_lines": [
    "Dr. Dinara Gunasekera (DG), (The Island of 28,2024) has criticised the NPP (National People\u2019s Power) policy document on Research and Development (R & D) as \u201clacking in substance, originality and clarity\u201d. I wish to emphasise that there have been several R & D policies in the past by the NSF and the NASTEC. Although several conferences have been organised by NASTEC and policies have been formulated none of the recommendations have been implemented. However, these are merely documents collecting dust at these offices and no previous government has taken these policies seriously. Dr. Gunasekera has wrongfully implicated the committee which drafted the NPP policy as \u201cwandering in the dark\u201d about the work of Sri Lanka\u2019s scientists.",
    "This committee consisted of high calibre expatriate scientists and also local scientists. I have nearly four decades of experience in research and as a member of this committee fully aware of the local research and the problems faced by our scientists. This writer claims that many of the problems have been identified and those backing the NPP R & D policy \u201clack understanding of the ground level Science and Technology situation\u201d in Sri Lanka. This is far from the truth and we spend a dismal 0.12% of our GDP on R & D and out of 119 countries we are ranked 110 with respect to such spending. Our policy addresses these shortcomings and make proposals for increasing this GDP percentage. The main problem at present is that although original research has been done, there have been only a few instances where these research results have been used for economic development. Apart from publications in reputed journals, commercialisation of results has been poor. In most developed countries, governments identify research priorities and fund them on competitive proposals. If we take South Korea as an example, major companies such as Samsung and Hyundai spend millions of dollars in research to improve their products and remain globally competitive.",
    "DG criticises that this model is based on the American model and hence a capitalist model in spite of the socialist agenda of the earlier JVP. He should understand the difference between the NPP and JVP, and the NPP leader has publicly stated that the private sector should play the pivotal role in industrial development and the government will only act as a facilitator and will not start doing business. DG should further realise that the current NPP is now a party keen on a systematic change with the support of professionals from all sectors since they are fed up with the rampant corruption of the two major political parties which governed our country since independence.",
    "It is obviously wrong to find fault with expatriate scientists who according to DG \u201chave not worked in Sri Lanka in either official or voluntary capacity\u201d. This is incorrect as some of them have been helping local researchers by providing much needed resources, helping to apply for foreign grants and find places for our graduates to carry out postgraduate research. They are in a better position to help local researchers owing to their well-equipped laboratories in the west. The NPP policy was drafted not only by expatriate scientists but also local scientists like me who are well aware of the ground situation in Sri Lanka. It is unfair to criticise expatriate scientists and one should realise that the Institute of Fundamental Studies in Kandy was established by an expatriate scientist, Prof. Cyril Ponnamperuma and a large number of scientists benefitted from this institute. India and China have developed tremendously because these Governments have attracted expatriate scientists to work in their home countries.",
    "DG has criticized the concept of \u201cvalue added products\u201d and the efforts of Institutes like SLINTEC and ITI having done extensive research. I am not sure as to how many of these research results have led to commercialiation or has export potential. On the other hand, carrying out advanced research is one thing, but commercialisation is an entirely different game. This is one aspect specifically mentioned in the NPP policy document.",
    "The efforts of Sri Lankan scientists should be appreciated and what the NPP policy attempts is to strengthen such activities. We need not go that far into nanoproducts, we still import phosphate fertilisers which can be easily made here using Eppawela apatite nor produced titanium dioxide from mineral sands. No government has taken these projects seriously obviously because of corruption and indifference. Similarly, there is limited university-industry collaborations which needs more emphasis and support from the political system and this too has been explicitly stated in NPP R & D policy.",
    "Dr. Gunasekera has criticised the use of fancy terms like AI, LLM, Nanotechnology and genomics. These are widely used terms in developed countries and our dream is to attempt to reach a higher level at least on par with at least developing countries such as Thailand and Malaysia.",
    "Our agricultural scientists have achieved tremendous success by developing high yielding varieties and newer varieties of other food crops. All what we are saying is that these efforts should be further strengthened by introducing more agriculture-based finished products suitable for export.",
    "Some of what DG says is true such as the problems faced by Sri Lankan scientists in procuring items from abroad and maintaining expensive equipment. The proposal to establish a central body to monitor and provide remedial measures is an NPP step in the right direction to overcome such problems.",
    "DG\u2019s tirade against the NPP is more political and based on unsubstantiated interpretations of the NPP R & D policy. Those who drafted this document believed in the NPP, which has the best chance of implementing the proposed plan of action. Has any other political leader ever talked about research and development as a tool to achieve economic prosperity? There is not even a cabinet minister in charge of Science and Technology. NPP leaders have publicly acknowledged R & D as a means of achieving economic prosperity and to increase the percentage of GDP on research.",
    "Our document has been opened for public consultation. Any professional genuinely interested towards the country\u2019s R&D progress has the opportunity here to make their suggestions.",
    "Why must Sri Lanka take reconciliation seriously? Role of universities in creating a harmonious society",
