    "A new report on the global crocodilian trade reveals shifting patterns in the world\u2019s most lucrative reptile industry \u2014 one that spans high-end fashion, exotic meat markets, and the live animal trade. While much of this trade remains legal and regulated, experts warn that loopholes and illegal activity still threaten the wild populations.",
    "Dr. Ruchira Somaweera, herpetologist and conservation biologist, emphasised the delicate balance between conservation and commerce.",
    "\u201cCrocodilians are an economic lifeline for many communities, but that success hinges on strict regulation and transparency. When the source of animals is unclear or enforcement is weak, it puts the wild populations at risk,\u201d Dr. Somaweera told The Island.",
    "According to the report, which assesses data from 2021 to 2023, the international skin trade \u2014 long the backbone of crocodilian commerce \u2014 has seen an overall decline. However, high-value species, such as the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), and Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) continue to drive strong demand.",
    "Over the past three years, 4.3 million crocodilian skins were legally traded, mostly through sustainable operations regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The bulk of these came from farming operations in the US, Australia, Africa, and Southeast Asia.",
    "The American alligator, a CITES Appendix II species that was once severely threatened, is now a model for sustainable use. Farmed in the southern US, its skin powers the global luxury leather market, appearing in everything from handbags and belts to high-end watch straps.",
    "Meanwhile, the Nile crocodile remains a key species in African crocodile farming, particularly in countries like Zimbabwe and South Africa. The Siamese crocodile, once nearly extinct in the wild, is now farmed extensively in Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia \u2014 though the wild populations still struggle.",
    "\u201cThailand\u2019s Siamese crocodile farms show how commercial use can actually ease pressure on the wild populations \u2014 if managed properly. But in countries where regulation is weak, illegal capture and laundering through farms can still occur,\u201d Dr. Somaweera cautioned.",
    "The live animal trade remains relatively limited, but Southeast Asia is the dominant player, with most exports involving Siamese crocodiles. However, the report notes a sharp drop in live exports to China since 2019, a likely consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased scrutiny of wildlife trade.",
    "Crocodilian meat, though less visible than the luxury leather market, continues to grow in popularity, particularly in East Asia. China and Hong Kong are major consumers, with Nile, saltwater (Crocodylus porosus), and Siamese crocodiles leading the trade. In some regions, crocodile meat is considered a delicacy and is marketed as a \u201chealthy\u201d alternative due to its low fat content.",
    "Despite the seemingly well-regulated trade, the report highlights continued concerns over illegal sourcing, particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to ensure traceability \u2014 knowing where an animal came from, whether it was farm-bred or wild-caught, and that it was acquired legally,\u201d said Dr. Somaweera. \u201cCITES provides the framework, but enforcement on the ground is what truly matters.\u201d",
    "The report also points to emerging trends in consumer behaviour, with increasing interest in certified sustainable products. Eco-labelling and traceability tools are gaining traction, especially among European luxury brands that want to distance themselves from unethical sourcing.",
    "In\u00a0 Sri Lanka, the wild crocodile populations are protected under national law, and there is no legal trade in crocodile parts. However, the global situation holds important lessons.",
    "\u201cFor countries like Sri Lanka that are home to iconic crocodilian species, such as the mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), it\u2019s a reminder that clear policies and conservation-led thinking are essential. Once demand rises \u2014 whether for meat, skin, or live animals \u2014 regulation must already be in place,\u201d Dr. Somaweera added.",
    "With crocodilians being among the few reptiles to generate consistent income for rural communities, particularly in developing nations, conservationists believe that striking a balance between use and protection is key.",
    "The global crocodilian trade may be evolving, but the challenges remain: closing loopholes, enforcing laws, and ensuring that the industry continues to benefit both people and nature \u2014 without sacrificing one for the other.",
