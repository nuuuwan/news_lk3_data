    "Jan. 22 (wisden) - Nuwan Thushara, bowling with a super-slingy action, claimed two wickets in two balls to kick off an electric death spell on SA20 debut.",
    "The 29-year-old, who has played six T20Is for Sri Lanka, is building a portfolio in franchise cricket, with today (January 21) marking his bow for MI Cape Town in South Africa\u2019s SA20. Handed the new ball up against the formidable opening pairing of Jos Buttler and Jason Roy, he began with an exemplary yorker and mixed slower balls in as well, but was hit for three boundaries in his first two overs as Paarl Royals began strongly.",
    "When he returned for the 18th over, Paarl Royals were 140-1 and aiming for an explosive finish, but Thushara had other ideas. His first ball zipped past Buttler\u2019s outside edge to send off-stump cartwheeling, and his second left Fabian Allen hobbling, a vicious yorker smashing the West Indies international on the top of the boot. He was given lbw.",
    "While Thushara ventured too full in search of a hat-trick, he went on to complete an excellent final two overs. Paarl Royals couldn\u2019t find the boundary, and he conceded 11 runs to finish with figures of 2-27 from four overs.",
    "MI Cape Town have won two and lost two from four games so far, while Paarl Royals, with three wins and a defeat, sit top."
