    "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya told Parliament yesterday that 63 individuals, including politicians, their family members and state officials, had been arrested for bribery and corruption during the last six months or so. Her statement coincided with the news that Shasheendra Rajapaksa, had been arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). His arrest came as no surprise; it had been in the air for months.",
    "Prime Minister Amarasuriya took great pains to have Parliament and the public believe that the CIABOC was independent and the government could not influence it. Her preemptive defence was as subtle as a brick through a window; it reminded us of a line from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet\u2014\u201dThe lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u201d",
    "All those who abused power to amass wealth and perpetrate various crimes, including the physical elimination of some of their political rivals, during previous governments, must be made to face the full force of the law. However, if these characters succeed in making the ongoing probes and legal action against them out to be a political witch-hunt, the NPP government\u2019s efforts to have them thrown behind bars and relegated to the political dustbin may come a cropper. One may recall that there were many arrests during the  Yahapalana government (2015-2019), which also made its political opponents languish in remand prison for months. But such action did not yield the desired results; most of the hurriedly filed cases collapsed, and the villains became heroes; the defeated rulers made a stunning comeback in 2018.",
    "Many a true word is said to be spoken in jest. The digital realm has become the main theatre of epic propaganda wars. There is a viral AI-generated TikTok video, where a newborn is interviewed. Dismayed that he has been born in Sri Lanka, the neonate says he would rather be sent whence he had come from than grow up there. The interviewer interrupts, saying the tiny interviewee has been born into the former ruling family, and the little one beams, \u201cThen, it\u2019s OK. I will be able to live in clover without doing any work.\u201d This fifty-second video, we believe, is far more effective than all the devastating propaganda attacks against the former rulers, who enriched themselves at the expense of the public. All other political families with parasitic progeny have done likewise. They also live high on the hog and spend billions of rupees on their political campaigns, but nobody knows where funds come from. The JVP politicians are no better. They claim that their well-wishers are looking after them and therefore they can live comfortably without being gainfully employed. There is no such thing as a free lunch, and no funds for political parties or individual politicians come without strings attached. It is said that when money talks, politicians, especially the self-righteous ones, are all ears. This may explain why the interests of moneybags take precedence over those of the ordinary people after elections.",
    "Soon after the Prime Minister\u2019s statement in Parliament yesterday, SJB MP Chaminda Wijesiri took the floor, tearing into the government. Welcoming legal action against those who were facing serious allegations of bribery, corruption and abuse of power, he demanded to know why some ruling party members who were responsible for several mega scandals had been allowed to remain above the law. He said the questionable release of 323 freight containers from the Colombo Port without Customs checks in January was as bad as the Treasury bond scams under the Yahapalana government. (The irony of his allegation may not have been lost on keen political observers. The SJB members were in the UNP, which led the Yahapalana government, and Wijesiri\u2019s allegation is tantamount to a self-indictment.) He likened the salt scandal under the incumbent government to the Sathosa garlic racket during the SLPP administration. He also asked whether any action would be taken against a company that had secured a wind farm contract in a questionable manner by leveraging its political clout.",
    "The current Opposition members can demand legal action against rogues in the incumbent government until they are blue in the face, but theirs will be an exercise in futility. Only a regime change will make it possible for the crooks among the present-day leaders to be brought to book.",
