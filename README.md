🟩

While Jayanthi Kamage was working in his work, his email came to a message from the University of London.

The 43 -year -old Sri Lankan woman's journey as a long -term journey will defile her journey. The trip has lasted several kilometers.

Kamage told us that when he was working as an audit assistant in Sri Lanka, Singapore has twice as much income than the salary.

Three years after he began his law, he left Sri Lanka for money for his education.

If she was very sure of her childhood, she was ready to face any crisis caused by her going abroad.

Kamage, the supervisor of the company, who is currently working on the refinery, said this was a very long task.

He said that I know that there is a way to be in the words of the words, but there is a way that my feelings are.

Kamage had been blindfolded for several days-he had difficulty in learning.

I did not buy a lipstick or cosmetics, he says.
