  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s new government, led by left-leaning President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, will launch a fresh investigation into the handling of the MV X-Press Pearl cargo ship disaster that devastated marine life along swaths of the island nation\u2019s coastline three years ago, a senior minister has told Al Jazeera.",
    "The announcement came amid allegations of corruption, delay tactics and mismanagement in dealing with the aftermath of the disaster, and a lack of compensation for the affected fishermen.",
    "In May 2021, the Singapore-registered cargo ship caught fire \u00a0near Negombo, a popular tourist destination off the Sri Lankan west coast, spilling tonnes of hazardous substances, including nitric acid and microplastic granules, into the Indian Ocean.",
    "The fire on the ship, heading to Sri Lanka\u2019s main city of Colombo from the Indian state of Gujarat, was believed to have been caused by a nitric acid leak. The toxic leak \u00a0from the ship killed a large number of fish, turtles and other marine mammals, and devastated the livelihoods of more than 20,000 fishing families.",
    "In the sweltering heat of western Sri Lanka, nearly 200 women are still busy collecting plastic nurdles washed ashore from the X-Press Pearl disaster [Aljazeera]",
    "Three years after the fire and oil leak on the ship, people are still awaiting justice in the form of compensation and accountability.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s government now plans to investigate the incident after the country\u2019s parliamentary elections conclude on November 14. His National People\u2019s Power (NPP) is expected to win the vote.",
    "\u201cThere are many allegations about the X-Press Pearl disaster,\u201d Vijitha Herath, the country\u2019s public security minister told Al Jazeera and Watershed Investigations, a United Kingdom-based nonprofit investigative journalism organisation focusing on water issues",
    "\u201cI am personally committed to finding out the truth. We will leave no stone unturned.\u201d",
    "Based on an estimate by a 40-member committee of experts appointed by the country\u2019s Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA) soon after the disaster, Sri Lanka is seeking $6.4bn from London P&I Club, the UK-based insurers of the X-Press Pearl, as compensation for the environmental damage \u00a0caused by the disaster. The lawsuit was filed in Singapore in April 2023 under the then government, headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "In September this year, a report by the country\u2019s Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC), formed to investigate the handling of the cargo ship disaster and mitigate future risks, said Sri Lanka has so far received nearly $12.5m from London P&I Club.",
    "In addition to that, over the last three years, the MEPA received 3.5m rupees ($11,945), while the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources accepted about 3bn rupees ($10.5m) from London P&I Club \u2013 all in local currency, a fact that has raised suspicions of corruption and will now be investigated by the new government.",
    "The incident occurred approximately 9.5 nautical miles (17.6km) from the shore. Locals recall the ship\u2019s enormous fireball, which led to a temporary fishing ban in the lagoon [Al Jazeera]",
    "Darshani Lahandapura, the former head of MEPA, had led the beach cleaning operations following the disaster. She told Al Jazeera that she had come under government pressure to accept the compensation payments in local currency at a time when the country was going through its worst economic crisis as inflation had soared and the Sri Lankan rupee was depreciating.",
    "\u201cGovernment officials from Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration exerted pressure on me several times to accept the payment in Sri Lankan rupees,\u201d Lahandapura said.",
    "By asking to pay the compensation in local currency, \u201cI believe the shipowners were trying to take an undue advantage of the economic crisis and some government officials were supporting their demand,\u201d she added. The value of the Sri Lankan rupee slumped by almost 50 percent against the US dollar in 2022 when the economic crisis started.",
    "Lahandapura\u00a0told the PSC she had \u201cstrongly resisted\u201d accepting payments in rupees. But the insurers still made two payments in the local currency.",
    "\u201cIn her view, accepting payments in rupees might pose a risk of money laundering,\u201d the PSC said in its report, referring to Lahandapura\u2019s statement.",
    "Al Jazeera reached out to the London P&I Club to comment on the allegations, but did not receive any response.",
    "The PSC\u00a0report concluded that the disaster \u201cexposed critical gaps in the country\u2019s ability to prevent and manage maritime pollution incidents\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe Committee found that delays in legal proceedings and inadequate coordination between government agencies had exacerbated the environmental and economic damage,\u201d it said.",
    "Moreover, the lawsuit demanding compensation from the London P&I Club was served by the Sri Lankan authorities 23 months after the disaster occurred, just days before the deadline, stipulated under international law, was set to expire. The law mandates that a claim for compensation in case of a marine accident must be made within two years of the incident. The lawsuit was filed under then-Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam.",
    "\u201cThere seemed to be some lethargy or intentional delay from the Attorney General\u2019s Department (AGD) in handling the X-Press Pearl vessel disaster case,\u201d Lahandapura, the former head of MEPA, told the parliamentary committee.",
    "The X-Press Pearl was carrying nearly 1,680 metric tonnes of plastic nurdles. Even three years later, mainly women workers continue to separate and collect the nurdles by hand [Aljazeera]",
    "However, the then minister of justice, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, blamed the MEPA for the delay in filing the lawsuit, saying the marine agency submitted its environmental impact report late.",
    "According to an anonymous official source in the Sri Lankan government, the Attorney General\u2019s Department responded promptly to requests from the shipowners, but took a long time to respond to MEPA\u2019s queries.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t have evidence to suggest anyone at the AGD received any financial benefit, but if the country\u2019s AGD was lethargic in handling such an important case, it certainly raises suspicion,\u201d the source told Al Jazeera.",
    "Al Jazeera reached out to the Attorney General\u2019s Department for its response to the allegation, but it has not yet received a response. Al Jazeera also sought a response from Rajaratnam, under whom the lawsuit was filed, but he refused to comment.",
    "Another contentious issue likely to be investigated is the decision for the compensation case to be heard in Singapore, where the ship was registered, instead of Sri Lanka, where the accident occurred.",
    "\u201cWhat\u00a0we recommended was to litigate the legal case in Sri Lanka,\u201d Dan Malika Gunasekara, a legal expert appointed by MEPA, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHowever, the Attorney General\u2019s decision to file it in Singapore raises severe questions as to how he arrived at such a decision considering all the surrounding circumstances, especially concerning the consequences.\u201d",
    "Gunasekara was referring to a problem, also highlighted in the PSC report, that due to Singapore being a signatory to the Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC Convention), the compensation could be limited to approximately 19 million GBP ($24.7m). As the government had estimated the legal costs could reach $10m, it would leave just about $14m for cleanup and compensation.",
    "Each woman earns about 3,000 rupees ($10) a day separating the nurdles [Al Jazeera]",
    "Critics say the decision to move the lawsuit to Singapore cost the government of Sri Lanka dearly.",
    "\u201cThe cabinet of ministers had initially estimated $4.2m as legal costs in Singapore but it was later amended and now $10m has been allocated for the Attorney General\u2019s Department,\u201d said Asela Rekawa, who succeeded Lahandapura as MEPA chairman.",
    "\u201cWe were told that we ended up spending precious foreign currency reserves at a time when Sri Lanka was facing bankruptcy because of the foreign currency deficit,\u201d said Professor Ajith de Alwis, co-chair of the MEPA-appointed scientific committee. \u201cIn addition, precious little support was available to study the issue in many ways.\u201d",
    "However, according to the PSC report, the London P&I Club had expressed concerns about coming to Sri Lanka \u201cdue to the adverse publicity and security fears\u201d and preferred to join the negotiations over the compensation in Singapore.",
    "The then Sri Lankan minister of justice, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, also defended the choice of Singapore to litigate the issue.",
    "\u201cSingapore\u00a0is home to thousands of shipping companies and no company would risk damaging their business by ignoring a ruling from a Singaporean court,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that the decision was made following advice from an Australian legal firm.",
    "\u201cIn any case, it might have been difficult to enforce the judgement on a UK company by a Sri Lankan court,\u201d he said.",
    "According to the country\u2019s Fisheries Department, nearly 20,000 fishermen have been paid a total of nearly $10m, but a leader of the fishing trade union said it was not enough.",
    "\u201cThe fishermen received different amounts of money as per the area, between 10,000 rupees ($66) and 270,000 rupees ($900) but some had to submit appeals and nearly 2,000 \u2018indirect\u2019 fishermen are still hoping to get any compensation,\u201d Roger Peiris, a leader of a fishing trade union, told Al Jazeera, referring to people who sell fish, own boats, or those involved in the dry fish industry.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t even count this as compensation, it was just for lack of an immediate income. Compensation for fishermen is something that needs to be discussed separately. Fishermen would only get proper compensation after the legal issues are over.\u201d",
