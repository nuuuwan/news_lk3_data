### The Use Of Dr. Or¬†‚ÄòAcharya‚Äô¬†Title By Elected Representatives: What Is The problem?

The debate about the use of Dr. title by the present Speaker in Sri Lanka‚Äôs parliament presumably without obtaining a PhD from a reputed university raises an important issue in the way such academic titles have been used in the political sphere in recent decades. It is well known that the higher education sector in the country was also politicised along with other government institutions where there should have been a high degree of autonomy. The issue is whether the matter relating to the speaker‚Äôs use of Dr. title in front of his name supposedly without obtaining a PhD is an isolated incident?¬† In other words, was this a common practice among political sphere?¬† Another issue is whether the use of these titles in English vs Sinhala vernacular had anything to do with the confusion? Before addressing these questions, let me explain the accepted way of using Dr. title or even Professor title by those who acquire them after years of research and study in universities.

Shyamala (my wife) and I arrived at Cagliari Airport in Sardinia with several friends from Rome to participate in a writers‚Äô workshop in Galteli, a remote Sardinian village. It was mid-January, and It was a sunny and warm afternoon. The sky was blue, and sun rays penetrated the airport‚Äôs thick, tall glass panes, warming us. The distant craggy mountains displayed their naked limestone spikes, occasionally releasing a glint. The dusty horizon looked distant, blurring the contours between the dry, flat land and disappearing grey mountains. Large concrete structures dominated the immediate landscape of the airport. They were engulfed in a mess of tentacles of the ring road. Still, a disciplined traffic movement emerged from the chaos. The landscape of Sardinia, with its rugged mountains, flat lands, and distant horizons, was a sight to behold.

### Georgian former footballer Kavelashvili elected as President by lawmakers

Georgia‚Äôs ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as the country‚Äôs president in a controversial election process amid a constitutional crisis and after weeks of mass pro-EU protests.

An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country‚Äôs next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said.

The sitting president Salome Zurabishvili has declared the vote ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù and refused to step down.

The Black Sea nation has been in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in contested October parliamentary elections.

Its decision last month to delay European Union membership talks ignited a fresh wave of mass rallies.

The opposition has denounced Saturday‚Äôs election as ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù and said sitting President Salome Zurabishvili remains the country‚Äôs sole legitimate leader.

### Who Broke Syria?

*2024-12-14 17:26:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/who-broke-syria/) ¬∑ `en`

By end of November, the situation in Syria was dire. Government forces were on the brink of exhaustion, stretched thin by an economic crisis that spiraled out of control. Soldiers earned a paltry $7 a month, with even high-ranking officers receiving only $40. This was in sharp contrast to militia fighters funded by external powers, who earned up to $2,000 monthly. This glaring disparity revealed not just economic fault lines but the extent of foreign intervention sustaining these militias. Meanwhile, protests erupted across Suwayda province, historically a stronghold of Assad support, highlighting widespread famine, collapsing services, and the devaluation of the Syrian pound. Discontent was palpable, threatening to upend the regime‚Äôs fragile grasp on power.

A legacy of achievements, the results of which have only now begun to show in what is today the strongest economy in the world. An economy created of bipartisan legislative miracles which will endure for decades to come. Which the contemptible Trump will claim he personally built, on the first day of his office, in January 2025.

### South Korea‚Äôs President faces second impeachment vote over martial law bid

A defiant South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a second impeachment vote on Saturday over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, a move that shocked the country, split his party and imperilled his presidency half way through his term.

Yoon rescinded his Dec. 3 move to impose military rule barely six hours later, after the opposition-controlled parliament defied troops and police to vote against the decree. But it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down on the grounds that he had broken the law.

Opposition parties plan to hold an impeachment vote at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), with large demonstrations planned ahead of the vote.

Yoon‚Äôs conservative People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote a week earlier, preventing a quorum.

Since then, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon has urged party members to vote for impeachment this time, and at least seven PPP members have said they would vote to impeach.
