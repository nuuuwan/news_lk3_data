“I appealed to the court that if the accused, who are extremely influential, are not arrested, it will be impossible to conduct the investigation,” chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said.

🟩

The Commission on Sunday attacks should be revealed to the country without deceiving the Catholic Church and the Catholic people.Former parliamentarian Nimal Lansa said that if there are any shortcomings or errors, they should be investigated immediately.

He further stated at a press conference held in Negombo on Thursday (17).

Life Sunday attack is the most emotional thing. Therefore, the Catholic Church and the Catholic people have demanded that justice be issued by issuing reports on those attacks.

This is not the play. Catholic people believe in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. So he must protect that belief.

When Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country, civil servants were unable to pay.

But, after he took office, the salary of state employees was increased. The salary was increased during goodwill.

I ran away from anywhere. Even when the country reached bankrupt, we have received two salary hikes in the hill country. As said in 2020, we paid a salary of 1000 rupees.

2024ஆம் ஆண்டு சம்பள நிர்ணய சபை ஊடாக 1350 ரூபாய் சம்பளத்தை பெற்றுக் கொடுத்தோம். இது கூட்டு ஒப்பந்தத்தினூடாக அல்ல. சம்பள நிர்ணய சபையில் தொழிலாளர்களுக்கு 1350 ரூபாய் சம்பளம் கொடுக்கக் கூடாது என தற்போதைய ஜனாதிபதியின் தொழிற்சங்கமே எமக்கு எதிராக வாக்களித்தார்கள்.

### Controversy erupts over Sri Lanka’s CEB move to continue fuel purchases sans tender

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s new government has come under fire over a reported move state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to continue to purchase fuel without competitive bidding, and with a deal struck with Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror newspaper reported that CEB has decided not to go ahead with competitive procurement of fuel but to strike a deal with Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, reversing decision by the earlier administration to move for open tendering.

The report said the CEB had decided not to go for competitive bidding since there was no substantial price variation among different suppliers, the report said.

The last government towards the end of its term had decided to call for bids from different fuel suppliers such as the CPC, LIOC and Sinopec for fuel supply, after multiple fuel distributors were established.

A senior CEB official said the state-run utility provider will issue a clarification on Friday without elaborating.

### CEB criticized for ‘delaying’ electricity tariff revision

The Petroleum Trade Unions have criticized the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for failing to implement the revision of electricity tariffs, which was supposed to take place on October 01, allegedly due to the irresponsible actions of the CEB.

During a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (16), the convener of the union, Ananda Palitha, expressed concerns over the issue.

“The Electricity Board has not yet provided the necessary data to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for the revision of the electricity tariffs. Currently, the CEB’s net profit exceeds Rs. 155 billion. Why is there room for further exploitation?” he questioned.

Further, he urged the President to intervene, stating, “If you are committed to the welfare of the people, you should question the CEB on what it has been doing all this time. Immediate action can be taken to revise the electricity bill, potentially reducing it by at least 45 percent.”

### Italy makes it illegal to seek surrogacy abroad

Italy’s parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime Minister’s Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners.

Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents.

The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year.

The legislation extends a surrogacy ban already in place in Italy since 2004 to those who go to countries such as the United States or Canada, where it is legal, imposing jail terms of up to two years and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.09 million).
