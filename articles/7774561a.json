    "(AP) \u2014 Israeli strikes Monday on Lebanon killed more than 490 people, including more than 90 women and children, Lebanese authorities said, in the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military warned residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of its widening air campaign against Hezbollah.",
    "Thousands of Lebanese fled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading toward Beirut in the biggest exodus since 2006.",
    "Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said the strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 people \u2014 a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.",
    "In a recorded message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate, saying \u201ctake this warning seriously.\u201d",
    "\u201cPlease get out of harm\u2019s way now,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cOnce our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.\u201d",
    "Israel\u2019s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army will do \u201cwhatever is necessary\u201d to push Hezbollah from Lebanon\u2019s border with Israel.",
    "Hagari claimed Monday\u2019s widespread airstrikes had inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah. But he would not give a timeline for the operation and said Israel was prepared to launch a ground invasion of Lebanon if needed.",
    "\u201cWe are not looking for wars. We are looking to take down the threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to do to achieve this mission.\u201d",
    "Hagari said Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 rockets and drones into Israel since last October, including 250 on Monday alone.",
    "The military said Israeli warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones. The spokesman said many were hidden in residential areas, showing photos of what he said were weapons concealed in private homes.",
    "\u201cHezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a war zone,\u201d he told a news conference.",
    "Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.",
    "Earlier Monday evening, the Israeli military said it had carried out a targeted strike in Beirut. It did not give details. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported three missiles hit southern Beirut\u2019s Beir al-Abed neighborhood. Hezbollah\u2019s Al-Manar TV said six people were wounded.",
    "Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said the earlier strikes hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for the displaced.",
    "Some strikes hit residential areas in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos, more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border north of Beirut.",
    "srael said it was expanding the airstrikes to include areas of the valley along Lebanon\u2019s eastern border with Syria. Hezbollah has long had an established presence in the valley, where the group was founded in 1982 with the help of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards in the wake of Israel\u2019s invasion and occupation of Lebanon.",
    "Israel\u2019s military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Israel was preparing its \u201cnext phases\u201d of operations against Hezbollah, and that its airstrikes were \u201cproactive,\u201d targeting Hezbollah infrastructure built over the past 20 years.",
    "Halevi said the goal was to allow displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel.",
    "Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it fired dozens of rockets toward Israel, including at military bases. It also targeted for a second day the facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa.",
    "The evacuation warnings were the first of their kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters.",
    "The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of all-out war, even as Israel battles Hamas in Gaza and tries to negotiate the release of scores of hostages taken in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group.",
    "A spokeswoman for President Joe Biden said the administration was concerned about what\u2019s happening between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and insisted that getting a cease-fire deal between Israel and Gaza was key to easing tensions in the region.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to resolve it quickly and diplomatically,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden to New York, where he is to deliver his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.",
    "A State Department official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the private diplomatic efforts, said the U.S. and numerous other countries were keen to present an \u201coff-ramp\u201d for both Israel and Hezbollah to reduce tensions and prevent an all-out war.",
    "The U.S. has \u201cconcrete ideas\u201d for restoring calm that it will present to allies and partners at this week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly, the official said. He wouldn\u2019t detail what the \u201cconcrete ideas\u201d were because he said they had yet to be presented to allies and partners for what he termed a \u201cstress test\u201d for their likelihood of success.",
    "U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border, meanwhile, have stopped their patrols and are staying in their bases \u201cgiven the volume of exchange of fire,\u201d a U.N. spokesman said. St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters that U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was \u201calarmed\u201d at the escalating violence and large number of civilian casualties reported in Lebanon.",
    "Monday\u2019s death toll far surpassed that of Beirut\u2019s devastating port explosion in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse detonated, killing at least 218 people and wounding more than 6,000.",
    "The Lebanese Health Ministry asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley to postpone non-urgent surgeries to treat people wounded by \u201cIsrael\u2019s expanding aggression on Lebanon.\u201d",
    "On Monday, residents received text messages reading: \u201cIf you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,\u201d Lebanese media reported.",
    "Lebanon\u2019s information minister, Ziad Makary, said his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building.",
    "\u201cThis comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,\u201d Makary said, and urged people \u201cnot to give the matter more attention than it deserves.\u201d",
    "Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied because of the near-daily exchanges of fire.",
    "Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in.",
    "An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children.",
    "Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.",
    "Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified.",
    "Hezbollah has said it will keep up attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary.",
    "Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.",
    "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."
