### New chapter for Sri Lanka: We cannot give something out of nothing

The railways, historically designed for goods transport, must be reimagined to meet modern needs economically

The nation spoke and a new Government was elected. Now itтАЩs time to unite and work collectively to pull ourselves out of the economic crisis we face. But in doing this, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. While rooting out corruption is critical, it is not the sole solution to achieving prosperity. To truly transform the country, we must prioritise efficiency and overhaul the sluggish State mechanism, reorganising the way in which it runs.

LetтАЩs take Sri Lanka Railways for example. Each year, the State pumps approximately Rs. 57 billion into the railway system in 2024, while its annual revenue from ticket sales is only a mere Rs. 12 billion. A staggering Rs. 45 billion was lost to the State due to inefficiency.

Amid these transformative efforts, a thought-provoking question emerged on social media recently: Should Sri Lanka retain the traditional eight-hour workday or explore a shorter six-hour workday? This debate touches on broader concerns about labour productivity and its critical role in driving economic growth.

Labour productivity is a fundamental driver of economic progress, directly influencing GDP growth and national prosperity. According to the Solow Growth Model of Economics, long-term economic growth is fuelled by labour growth, capital accumulation, and technological advancements.

### ChildтАЩs guide to Central BankтАЩs new monetary policy instrument: Overnight Policy Rate

*2024-12-02 00:15:18* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Child-s-guide-to-Central-Bank-s-new-monetary-policy-instrument-Overnight-Policy-Rate/4-769937) ┬╖ `en`

When the policy rate of the Central Bank is reduced, the banks immediately cut the deposit rates meaning that they are downward flexible

Since REPO bids should be below OPR and Reverse-REPO bids should be above OPR, they are synonymous with SDFR and SLFR, respectively. Since they should be around OPR, the earlier announced SDFR and SLFR become irrelevant. Also, commercial banks should fix their call rates around OPR. That is how call rates are manipulated by the Central Bank through rules and OPR practices

The manifesto of the NPP should essentially be the basis for preparing the strategic plan, as it is the document that formed a social contract between the NPP and the people of the country at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections

A publicly available, regularly monitored and updated strategic plan, where achieved outcomes or reasons for not meeting outcomes are truthfully told to the public, will change the mirage mentality to one of reality. Stating the truth however is paramount to make this happen as politically convenient untruths will be of no benefit to the people and the country and the strategic planning exercise will be a waste of time

Despite its size, Sri LankaтАЩs location in the Indian Ocean makes it a vital player in regional and global geopolitics. The growing interest from major powersтАФwhether through ChinaтАЩs Belt and Road Initiative or IndiaтАЩs regional ambitions, controversial initiatives by the QUAD in the regionтАФunderscores the need for Sri Lanka to carefully balance its foreign policy.

"13th Constitutional Amendment cancellation proposed. Acceptance of new constitution may render provincial councils unnecessary. Abolition planned only after new settlement scheme presented. Clarification needed to prevent misinformation."

ЁЯЯй

If all the people accept the constitution, there will be no need for the provincial council system or the 13th constitution in the country. It is not necessary for the country. Provincial Council system is a matter of failure in the country with no benefit. So we will not abolish the provincial council system without presenting a new settlement plan. This issue is to be clearly understood. Otherwise, there are opportunities for misconceptions to spread among people.

### Will Tibetans be led by a Reincarnated Dalai Lama, or One Picked by China?

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Chemi Lhamo, Campaign Director of Free Tibet would like to see more international support for preserving the Tibetan way of life and Dharma.

Citing The Resolve Tibet Act, which US President Joe Biden signed into law in June this year, Ms Lhamo added that she was optimistic that European countries that constantly speak on human rights would not hesitate to pass similar legislation in support of Tibet.

Tibet has been under the control of China since 1951, with a government in exile, also known as the Central Tibetan Administration being set up in neighbouring India, by the 14th Dalai Lama following the Lhasa uprising of 1959.

Though he divested himself of all political authority in 2011, the Dalai Lama, who turned 89 this year, continues to be the spiritual head of Tibetans, who consider him the living incarnation of the Buddha. The search for a new Dalai Lama begins when he passes away, by senior disciples who look for visions and signs to identify the successor.
