    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake ; \u201cLeftist\u201d Star Rises Over Sri Lanka \u2013 Part Two",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s newly elected ninth executive president Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) continues to be the focus of this column. In the first part of this article published last week, the early years of  Anura\u2019s eventful life were delved into in some detail. In this week\u2019s  second part,  AKD\u2019s steady rise as a   political leader within the Janatha  Vimukthi  Peramuna (JVP) will be related to some extent.",
    "As stated in this column last week , the JVP\u2019s second insurgency was ruthlessly suppressed by the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime. Tens of thousands of youths were killed or made to disappear. Thousands of youths were incarcerated for years. Hundreds of youths fled Sri Lanka for safety. Hundreds of youths avoided arrest  and possible execution while in Sri Lanka by changing identities and relocating elsewhere. Anura was among those who stayed in Lanka and evaded capture by going underground.",
    "The JVP\u2019s founder leader Rohana Wijeweera, the second leader Saman Piyasiri Fernando and rhe third leader Lalith Wijerathne were  among the top 14 JVP leaders killed by the state in 1989-90. The only senior top leader  and Pollitburo member to survive was Somawansa Amerasinghe alias Siri Aiyaa. He became the fourth JVP leader. Somawansa escaped to India in 1990 and from  there went to Thailand. He  later travelled  to  Italy  and from there sought  political  asylum in France.",
    "Somawansa Amerasinghe shuttled between various European countries and set up JVP branches among Sinhala expatriates. He also interacted with  dormant cadres in Sri Lanka and began a clandestine process of reviving the near extinct JVP. Tiny cells of 5 to 10 members were set up. Somawansa was in contact with these cells from France and the UK and coordinated activities.Meanwhile the security situation began easing. Detained cadres were gradually released but the JVP proscription remained in force.",
    "After Premdasa\u2019s death in May 1993, the political climate changed for the better as far as the JVP was concerned. Somawansa Amerasinghe returned to Sri Lanka in 1994 and began re-organizing the JVP quietly.  When Parliamentary elections were announced ,the JVP  was still a proscribed party. So Somawansa formed a front entity called   Sri Lanka Progressive Front (SLPF)  and contested only in the Hambantota district.The SLPF (JVP) got 15,309 votes. Janith Vipulaguna was elected MP. But he resigned soon and Nihal Galappaththi became H\u2019tota MP.",
    "The JVP worked for Chandrika Kumartunga in the 1994 Presidential elections. After she became President, the JVP ban was lifted. The JVP resumed its political work openly again. The JVP under Somawansa Amerasinghe\u2019s leadership held its national convention in Tangalle in 1995.",
    "Meanwhile  Anura had resumed his tertiary studies again . He became an undergraduate at the Kelaniya University in 1992. AKD adopted a low profile during his undergraduate days but participated in student union activity. He also conducted classes at a tutorial institution.",
    "Anura was also in contact with Somawansa and used to convey confidential messages from him to other JVP members.    AKD  completed his studies and obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree  (BSc) in Physical Science in 1995.Instead of seeking full time employment  AKD turned to full time politics.",
    "As mentioned earlier, Somawansa had returned to Sri Lanka  and was engaged in reviving the JVP. Somawansa liked Anura and was impressed by the young man\u2019s intellect, ability and convictions. He took Anura  under his wing.",
    "The JVP backed Socialist Students Association   was re-organized in 1995 after the national convention at Tangalle. AKD was appointed  National Organizer.Thereafter his rise was rapid within JVP ranks. In 1996 he became a member of the JVP central  committee. AKD was elevated to the all-powerful JVP Politburo (Political Bureau) in 1998.",
    "The first  JVP insurgency of 1971  was aiming for a socialist revolution. The  JVP second insurgency of 1987-90  objective was  patriotic resistance to an \u201cIndian Invasion\u201d. Now the JVP was in its third phase. It was a bruised and battered JVP.",
    "Even though people were sad and horrified about the massacre of thousands of youths by the state, the people were also terrified about the atrocities committed by the JVP. The reign of JVP terror was still fresh in memory. The JVP therefore required a new platform to launch its resurgence.",
    "The Sri Lankan forces were at war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE). The JVP led by  Somawansa  adopted a Sinhala  chauvinist line under the guise of Sri Lankan patriotism and anti-separatism. The JVP backed the war and fully supported the war effort in many ways. They engaged in promotional campaigns to recruit more personnel for the armed forces. The JVP  also visited the frontlines with the assignment of boosting the morale of soldiers.",
    "Even as the JVP was re-inventing itself in a bid  to transform its negative  anti-state image into  a positive pro-state image, the party commenced contesting in  elections regularly. Even though the JVP was against the Indo-Lanka accord and the 13th amendment, the party was not averse to contesting Provincial council elections.",
    "The JVP also contested Municipal councils, urban councils and divisional councils (pradeshiya sabhas). By contesting electoral bodies, the JVP broadened its support base. Party stalwarts gained recognition by becoming elected members.",
    "The prize sought after most was of course Parliament. The JVP contested the Parliamentary elections of 2000 and polled  518,774 votes. The JVP got 10 MPs(8 elected and 2 appointed).The JVP  again contested the 2001 poll and garnered 815,353 votes. The JVP got 16 MPs of whom 13 were elected and 3 were appointed on the national list.",
    "As stated earlier Anura was by now a key member of the JVP. He was the national organizer of the socialist  students association, central committee member and member of the Politburo. AKD was rather influential as the student union organizer. The students were the mainstay of the JVP when it organized demonstrations. Under Anura\u2019s direction, the pro-JVP students union had expanded considerably and established itself in most universities and institutions of higher studies.",
    "So when the JVP contested polls, AKD was placed on the national list so that he could engage in propaganda all over instead of being tied down to the district as a candidate. He had blossomed into an able speaker but  did not indulge in fanciful rhetoric. AKD  was a direct, straight to the point kind of speaker who appealed to reason. Sometimes he was emotional too.",
    "Thus in 2000 AKD  was appointed as national list MP and entered Parliament for the first time. In 2001 Anura was re-appointed as national list MP for the second time. Soon AKD made his mark as a  powerful  orator and  skilful debater in Parliament.",
    "Although Chandrika Kumaratunga was the president in 2001, her party the People\u2019s Alliance(PA)   came off second best in the election. The United National Front(UNF) led by Ranil Wickremesinghe came first with 4,086,026 votes and obtained 109 MPs. The Chandrika Kumaratunga led Peoples Alliance(PA) got 3,330,815 votes entitling it to 77 MPs. The JVP with 815,353 votes got 16 MPs. It was obvious that if the PA and JVP votes were combined the UNP led UNF could  have been  relegated to second place.",
    "It was on this basis that   former minister Mangala Samaraweera forged an alliance with the JVP for the 2004 elections. The envoy of a concerned country stationed in Colombo also facilitated this axis. Thus the JVP contested as part of the  SLFP led United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in the 2004 elections. The UPFA polled 4,223,970 votes entitling it to 105 seats.The UNF with 3,504,200 votes got 82 seats.",
    "The JVP performed very creditably in the 2004 election. The party fielded three candidates in each district as part of the UPFA list. JVP cadres worked hard to get the maximum number of preference votes for their candidates. Due to this, the JVP obtained 39 MP seats in the 2004 election.",
    "2004 was  watershed year for Anura Kumara Dissanayake.  The April 2004 election was his electoral baptism. AKD contested in the Kurunegala district on the UPF ticket. He was elected with 153,868 preference votes. When President Kumaratunga formed the cabinet, four portfolios were allocated to the JVP. AKD was appointed as the cabinet minister of Agriculture,Livestock,Land and Irrigation.",
    "AKD was delighted over his portfolio as farming and agriculture was a subject close to his heart. He set about his duties diligently and worked out plans to rejuvenate the Country\u2019s agricultural and livestock breeding sectors. Unfortunately matters took a different turn. Anura\u2019s ministerial duties came to an abrupt end. Dissanayake along with other JVP colleagues in the UPFA  Govt resigned their posts. All 39 MP\u2019s of the JVP quit the Govt.",
    "What had happened was this. The Country had experienced  terrible calamity in December 2004 in the form of  Tsunami. Deaths, destruction and displacement occurred on a mammoth scale. Large coastal areas in the regions controlled by the LTTE were also affected by the Tsunami. So too were other coastal areas in the North and East.",
    "International donors were prepared to allocate 3 Billion dollars aid for rehabilitation and reconstruction of Tsunami affected families and areas.   A  Strict condition for aid was that the money had to be spent equitably to help  affected  Tamil speaking regions also.",
    "President Kumaratunga entered into discussions  with the LTTE through Norwegian facilitation. An unconventional joint structure with the LTTE was set up by the Govt. This was known as the Post-Tsunami  Operational Management Structure(P-TOMS). The P-TOMS was set up to enable equitable distribution of funds procured through foreign assistance to affected Tamil speaking areas under LTTE control. The P-TOMS was a joint Govt-LTTE mechanism.",
    "However the JVP Led by Somawansa Amarasinghe strongly objected to the P-TOMS. The JVP  forgetting its own past  described the LTTE as terrorist and condemned the P-TOMS for equating the LTTE on par with the Government.",
    "Incidentally the JVP had opposed the ceasefire and Oslo facilitated talks with the LTTE. When the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe initiated the  peace process in2002, the JVP  organized huge protests against talks with the LTTE.",
    "When the P-TOMS agreement  came into being the JVP demanded that the Kumaratunga Govt abandon the project and set the  deadline  of June 15th 2005 to do so. When President Kumaratunga refused , the JVP quit the Govt en masse on 16 June 2005.  All the four ministers including Dissanayke resigned their posts.",
    "Somawanasa Amerasinghe, the JVP leader said at the press conference, \u201cWe now announce our leaving the United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance with a sense of deep regret of work unfulfilled.\u201d",
    "Thereafter all 39 MPs of the JVP filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court against the P-TOMS agreement that had been signed between the Govt and the LTTE. The JVP parliamentarians including AK Dissanayake cited five  reasons in their FR petition  for seeking an injunction  against the P-TOMS.",
    "A three- judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva heard the petition and issued an interim order  restraining the key operational clauses of the agreement for the P-TOMS. With Presidential elections being scheduled for November 2005, the P-TOMS became a non-starter.",
    "The JVP welcomed  the injunction  saying it had \u201ceffectively stopped\u201d the implementation of the joint mechanism. \u201cThere are no wheels in the bus,\u201d the JVP\u2019s former propaganda secretary, Wimal Weerawansa, gloated.",
    "The JVP Parliamentarians were now in the opposition. However the JVP supported Mahinda Rajapaksa in the 2005 presidential elections after signing a memorandum of understanding with him. The JVP helped Mahinda win in 2005. 19 years later the JVP has won a  presidential election on its own.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was a short lived cabinet minister in 2004-05 is now the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka. The story of Anura\u2019s political ascendancy within the JVP and within the country at large  will This rticle appeared in the \u201cDBS Jeyraj",
