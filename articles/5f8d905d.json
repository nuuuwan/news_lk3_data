    "The apex body of the plantation industry in Sri Lanka, The Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon (PA), issued a statement congratulating President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) on their recent and resounding electoral victory.",
    "The Association also extended its congratulations to Samantha Vidyarathna on his appointment as Plantation and Community Infrastructure Minister.",
    "Furthermore, it pledged its full support towards collaborative efforts to help develop the Sri Lankan plantation industry while uplifting the communities connected to it.",
    "Welcoming the new administration, PA Secretary General Lalith Obeyesekere said: \u201cThe plantation sector, including Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), has played a vital role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economy for decades. We are hopeful that the new Government will foster an environment conducive to sustainable development across the plantation industry, address the key challenges faced by plantation workers, and work towards policies that promote the resilience and growth of this essential sector.\u201d The PA noted that significant challenges still lay ahead for the plantation sector, particularly regarding the need for labour, productivity, and modernisation. The Association emphasised the importance of addressing these challenges in a collaborative and holistic manner, including the promotion of innovation, mechanisation, and automation, together with crop diversification and sustainable agroforestry policies, to ensure long-term productivity and sustainability. The Association also expressed optimism about the potential for enhanced Government support in adopting modern technologies, improving infrastructure, and boosting global competitiveness for key plantation exports, such as tea, rubber, and spices. Such initiatives will be instrumental in driving the sector forward amidst a rapidly evolving economic landscape.",
