    "By the year 2025, each and every Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) deport must be profitable; if not, this service cannot be continued, Transport, Highways and Mass Media Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.",
    "Addressing the media at an event organised to hand over buses received under the Indian credit line today, he said while 90 percent of the employees of the depots are honest about 10 percent of the employees do not hand over the full daily collections to the depots.",
    "They allegedly keep a percentage of the collections and hand over the balance to the depot, the minister said.",
    "Depots usually have to be closed if found corrupt or due to strikes, and the buses from these depots have to be handed over to the nearest depot, the Minister added.",
    "Several buses received under the India credit line were handed over today to the SLTB depots in the North-Western Province by Minister Bandula Gunawardena.",
    "Under the facility of the Indian Credit Line, 500 buses were received to be distributed throughout the country to facilitate public transport. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
