  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Court of Appeal today (Dec.06) ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to produce \u201cHarak Kata\u201d before a suitable Magistrate\u2019s Court if the evidence against him is insufficient to keep him in custody on detention orders.",
    "This was communicated when a petition filed by the notorious underworld figure Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne alias \u201cHarak Kata\u201d was taken up before the court earlier today.",
    "The judge bench also dismissed the petition filed by \u201cHarak Kata\u201d seeking a writ order invalidating the detention order issued to keep him in the custody of the CID.",
    "\u201cHarak Kata\u201d was arrested in Madagascar along with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d on Match 01 this year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials.",
    "The duo was brought back to the island after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry on March 08 of the arrest of eight suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures.",
    "\u201cHarak Kata\u201d had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies as well as transnational drug trafficking.",
    "While in the custody on detention order, the ill-famed underworld figure also attempted an escape bid at the CID premises in September, which was ultimately foiled by the officials."
