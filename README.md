ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka is planning to call bids to develop two 500 Megawatt wind plants offshore of Mannar and Puttalam after feasibility studies are concluded in 2027, Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman Tilak Siyambalapitiya said.

The CEB has to make detailed environmental studies, sea floor, and logistics before calling for bids, Siyambalapitiya told a forum organized by Sri Lanka‚Äôs Export Development Board.

The Mannar site is substantially superior in energy yield compared to Puttalam he said.

It will be about 100 kilometers off shore, but wind turbines could be planted on the sea floor.

Power will be brought to the shore by cables with no offshore grid substation and connected to the grid.

The Puttalam site was about 10 kilometres off shore but wind was not as good as Mannar.

Transmission cost was also higher requiring new lines as existing capacity was full.

A third location that could be developed later was Hambantota which was less attractive.
