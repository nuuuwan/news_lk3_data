Sri Lanka Police have launched an investigation to determine whether the recent fatal bus accident on Dunhinda Road in Badulla, was caused by a technical fault of the bus or driver error.

The incident, which involved a bus carrying a group of students of the Southern Campus of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) toppling across the road, resulted in the death of two female students, and injuries to 40 others.

The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in-charge of Badulla, Wasantha Kandewatta stated that a government analystтАЩs report on the bus is awaited to aid the investigation.

Preliminary assessments suggest the driver may have been operating the vehicle in third or fourth gear at the time of the accident. It is suspected that excessive speed on the steep, winding 4-kilometer stretch of road may have led the bus to skid out of control, according to police.

### Moldovans vote in presidential runoff amid fears of meddling

*2024-11-03 16:27:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103123/moldovans-vote-in-presidential-runoff-amid-fears-of-meddling) ┬╖ `en`

Moldovans were voting on Sunday in a presidential election that has been overshadowed by meddling allegations and could see Moscow claw back influence in the country at a time when it is trying to draw closer to the European Union.

Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu, who has accelerated the nationтАЩs push to leave MoscowтАЩs orbit and join the EU, faces Alexandr Stoianoglo, an ex-prosecutor general backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party.

The fortunes of Sandu, who set Moldova on the long path of EU accession talks in June, will be closely followed in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state hoping to join, re-elected a ruling party seen as increasingly pro-Russian.

Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).

MoldovaтАЩs future has been thrown into the political and diplomatic spotlight as the war in neighbouring Ukraine rages to the east.

### Sri Lanka crowned Hong Kong Sixes 2024 champions

Sri Lanka triumphed over Pakistan by three wickets to secure the Hong Kong Super Sixes 2024 title on Sunday. Chasing a target of 73 runs, Sri Lanka reached their goal with six balls remaining.

Sri LankaтАЩs captain, Lihuru Madhusanka, opted to bowl first, a decision that proved successful as his bowlers limited Pakistan to a modest total. Despite a valiant effort from Muhammad Akhlaq, who scored 48 runs off just 20 balls, Pakistan struggled to build a substantial score.

Akhlaq was eventually dismissed by Madhusanka in the final over. The next highest score for Pakistan came from skipper Faheem Ashraf, who made 13 runs off four balls.

Sri LankaтАЩs bowling was impressive, with Lakshan and Tharindu Rathnayake taking two wickets each. Nimesh Vimukthi and Lihuru Madhusanka also contributed with a wicket apiece.

### The death penalty for children who protested against the cost of living in Nigeria?: Appeared in court

Children protest cost of living Nigeria face death penalty court case controversy

Shocking reports have revealed that 29 children who were involved in the struggle against the increase in livelihoods in Nigeria could be sentenced to death.

The Nigerian government has imposed several allegations, including treason allegations against 76 people who were protesting against the cost of living.

The public is engaged in a series of protests in Nigeria due to frustration over the increase in cost of living.

The death penalty came into effect in Nigeria in 1976, but no one has been convicted since 1996.

Nigeria's Child Rights Act has not been allowed to investigate children and produce a court, a lawyer said.

Therefore, it is wrong to bring the boys to the court.

Motion of No Confidence in Government (Hansard of 1st September 1, 1953)

(Speech made by Dr. NM Perera published in his birth centenary memorial volume)

Dr. Perera:Before I deal with the subject, I want to say a word about the Hon. Prime Minister and his references to my good friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Bandaranaike). My friend the Prime Minister is not here. I hope that he has not had a recurrence of his affliction. Today while he was on the first part of his speech, he reminded me of the father; it was the same technique, the same type of personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I remember the last motion of No Confidence that we debated. I think it was moved just before the dissolution of Parliament, and it was one of the last debates which was attended by my good friend, the late Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake. He spoke in that debate and it was a tirade against my good friend the Leader of the Opposition.

After completing my Ford fellowship at Oxford University in 1991, I joined the Indus River Left Bank Outfall Drainage Project in Sindh, Pakistan, as its Senior Socio-Economist and resident team leader. The project, sponsored by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and several other international donors, aimed at improving irrigated agriculture in Sindh. The Sindh Development Studies Centre (SDSC) of the University of Sindh in Jamshoro (near Hyderabad) oversaw the socio-economic studies of the project.

I arrived at Karachi Airport in late December. Parvez Pathan, my SDSC counterpart, met me at the airport. We discussed my accommodation and security on our drive to Jamshoro, about 220 kilometres from Karachi. He told me a beautifully furnished bungalow awaited me on the university campus. He opined that I should always have a trustworthy person with me for my security. SDSC had found a reliable young man to be my housekeeper, cook, and personal security guard.

Democracy under threat, as Trump sows doubt on election integrity

President Ronald Reagan, тАЬThe Great CommunicatorтАЭ was famous for conceptualizing the American Dream, in a loose paraphrasing of the words enshrined in the Statue of Liberty.

Concluding his farewell speech in 1988, Reagan said, тАЬIтАЩve spoken of the Shining City all my political lifeтАж.But in my mind, it was a tall, proud city built on rocks, stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and heart to get here. ThatтАЩs how I saw it, and see it still.

Yet, as was to happen over and over again in the countryтАЩs politics, the vocal minority, in this case the hardliners finally won the day (in getting SWRD to abrogate the B-C Pact). In October 1957 the UNP under the leadership of J R Jayewardene set out on a march from Colombo to Kandy to protest against the pact. On the first day they covered 11 miles amidst some obstruction and skirmishes with government sponsored elements.

At the birthday party held in August to celebrate the 100th birthday of Raja de Silva, school friend of my uncle Tissa and former Director General of Archaeology, I was fortunate to meet his daughter Nerina, also an archaeologist. She has been working for some years on a dig in Turkey and, when I expressed interest in that site, she lent me a book produced to accompany an exhibition of artefacts found there.

I did not read all the articles in it, for they were quite technical, including NerinaтАЩs about the adhesives used to piece together broken material, ranging from pottery to statues. But they were fascinating, even though I could only read them cursorily. And they were illuminatingly supported by pictures, the articles being full of them, while the latter part of the book is pictures with detailed accounts of what they portray.

A sequel to this subject has become necessary after Biden was compelled/pressurized to drop out of the race on 21 July 2024 after his disastrous performance at the debate with Trump on 27 June 2024 which led to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the succeeding candidate under questionable circumstances. It is misleading to state it was a voluntary decision by Biden.

It is clear from what follows below that it is a SHAM for the Democratic Party now led by Kamala Harris to pretend that the Party is the standard-bearer of DEMOCRACY in the United States.
