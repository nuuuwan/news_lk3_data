    "While Israeli tourists represent a notable segment, they do not dominate Sri Lanka\u2019s overall tourist arrivals. However, their absence could still have a ripple effect on specific sectors, particularly in niche areas like adventure tourism, eco-tourism and local businesses that cater to backpackers and mid-range travelers. Smaller hotels, hostels and restaurants in popular Israeli tourist spots like Arugam Bay and Ella could face short-term revenue losses, Managing Director, MAC Holdings (Private) Ltd. Andre Fernando told  The Island Financial Review in an interview.",
    "Extracts from the interview: \u2018In the grander scheme however, Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry may not be severely impacted by the absence of Israeli visitors alone. Given the current state of global tourism, where many countries are diversifying their tourist profiles post-pandemic, Sri Lanka can mitigate potential losses by targeting emerging markets or enhancing promotional efforts in its more established tourist countries.",
    "\u2018The presence of Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka does raise legitimate concerns about security, particularly given the volatile situation in the Middle East. Israel has been involved in numerous geopolitical conflicts and Israeli nationals are sometimes targeted in acts of terror or political violence, both at home and abroad. But this risk can\u2019t be identified and isolated to Sri Lanka alone.",
    "\u2019Today terrorism is a common issue faced by the world and not necessarily common to Sri Lanka. However, the art of the suicide terror missions commenced here during the North- East war. Traveling on a busy London tube, holidaying in a Bali resort or walking on a New York street could be riskier for them, than visiting Arugam bay in Sri Lanka. So don\u2019t forget that there are many other destinations that Israeli tourist do visit.",
    "\u2018In Sri Lanka\u2019s case, the concern would be whether Israeli visitors might become targets for extremist groups, thereby posing a broader security risk to the general tourist population. Sri Lanka has already experienced the devastating consequences of such terrorist attacks, most notably the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, which targeted churches and luxury hotels, causing a significant decline in tourist arrivals.",
    "\u2018However, it is essential to note that the Sri Lankan government has substantially strengthened its security apparatus since those attacks, improving intelligence-sharing, airport security and hotel safety protocols. While the presence of Israeli tourists could make certain locations more attractive to potential attackers, it is unlikely that this would lead to a large-scale security threat for all tourists. Sri Lankan authorities are well aware of the need to ensure a safe and secure environment for both local citizens and international visitors.",
    "\u2018While the absence of Israeli tourists would have some economic impact on specific sectors & areas, it is unlikely to cripple Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry as a whole. On the other hand, their presence, given the current security landscape does raise legitimate concerns about targeted attacks, but the overall risk to other tourists remains relatively low.",
    "\u2018The challenge for Sri Lanka will be to continue strengthening its security measures while maintaining an open and welcoming environment for visitors from all nations, including Israel. For the tourism industry to thrive, perception matters as much as reality. Ensuring the safety of all tourists, whether Israeli or from any other country, will be crucial in maintaining Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation as a safe and desirable destination.\u2019",
