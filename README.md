### A common sense alternative

*2024-04-26 02:12:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-common-sense-alternative/172-281395) · `en`

Sri Lanka must integrate with global production networks that require trade reforms, removal of tariffs and protections across sectors and joining free trade agreements.

I hope to convince the reader that despite some of the commentary, Sri Lanka is not on the road to recovery. Numerous predictably dysfunctional policies with questionable rationalisations were implemented in 2019 and 2020; there was no discernible deliberative process. The underlying fragility of governance that precipitated the collapse is still prevalent. Two years on, the Wickremesinghe Government is exhibiting the same tendencies: a concentration of power in the office of the presidency with the executive holding the critical ministries of finance and defence; this Wickremesinghe Government has not materially altered the conditions that led to our crisis.

### Israel’s US-backed genocide in Gaza, 200 days on

What horrible times are we living in? “Never again” was the resolve that led to the formation of a rules-based world order in the aftermath of World War II, in which some 80 million people—3 percent of the then-world population—perished. But events that followed showed humans were incapable of living in peace. People continued to die in wars across the world.

But none of the myriad wars and conflicts could be as brutal as the war Israel’s hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been waging against the hapless people of the Gaza Strip for the past 200-plus days. What is happening in Gaza is not a war; it is genocide, period.

The tragic motor car accident that snuffed out the lives of seven people and injured over 20 people must be reviewed critically. At the time of writing this column only two drivers involved in the accident were initially nabbed and later released on bail. No member of the organizing committee has been arrested so far and this has led to a public outcry on social and online media platforms blaming the organizers.

The public wishes to know why the organizers of the event should go unpunished when there have been deaths and injuries to spectators. Both the Government and the Sports Minister have maintained silence over the incident. Only the Opposition alliance Samagi Jana Balawegaya has demanded to know whether the organizers of the sporting event carry a liability

The move was aimed at providing relief to consumers during the Avurudu season, with the maximum retail price set at Rs. 1,050 for a 400g pack.

The Milk Powder Importers Association emphasises that there have been no additional reductions in prices as of 25 April, contrary to the misinformation circulating in the media.  It has been confirmed that several milk powder brands are being sold at prices lower than the stipulated maximum retail price (MRP), with various promotional offers further driving down costs for consumers.

### New uterine loop for monkey birth control

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - The Veterinary Faculty at Peradeniya University has introduced a novel small-sized loop designed for implantation into the uterus of female monkeys to effectively prevent pregnancy

A one-and-half-year-old female monkey that had given birth once was used for this test.

Senior Professor Ashoka Dangolla from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Peradeniya University reported that during the X-ray examination conducted after the surgery, it was observed that the implanted loop was successfully in place.

Professor Dangolla explained that this form of birth control is intended to prevent pregnancy in women. Due to previous unsuccessful attempts using a normal-sized loop, the decision was made to create a smaller-sized loop.

He was not a mere propagator of a Social Market Economy, when he took over leadership from a right wing, J.R. Jayewardene led UNP that tried to dislodge Deputy Leader Premadasa from his well-earned Presidential candidature in 1989. The same right-wing forces in the UNP, tried to impeach him together with Feudalist sympathisers, who lost all their social status due to Premadasaism

I was socialised in my childhood, by an ardent Samasamajist, LSSP, father, in Moratuwa. However, I became disillusioned in my youth, as I witnessed the ground level actions of the Samasamaja Party, working with Feudalists, who pretended to be Progressive.

Chinese state energy giant Sinopec is pushing for greater access to Sri Lanka’s market, where rival India is also seeking to expand its presence, as it looks to build its first fully-controlled overseas refinery, reflecting a change in the firm’s global strategy to compensate for slowing demand growth at home.

Sinopec, the world’s largest oil refiner, is expected to complete a feasibility study by June for a plant at the Chinese-run Hambantota port, after winning Colombo’s approval last November, two senior industry sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

While the China-based sources say the investment, which Colombo pegged at $4.5 billion as the country’s largest-ever foreign investment, is commercially driven, neighbouring India is pushing a rival plan to build a fuel products pipeline to the island nation southeast of the subcontinent.

### Sri Lanka planning to cut withholding tax on interest to help retirees: Minister

*2024-04-25 17:38:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-planning-to-cut-withholding-tax-on-interest-to-help-retirees-minister-160056/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is planning to lift withholding tax on interest income below 100,000 a month to help older citizens who depend on interest income as interest rates fall, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

With deposit rates falling to around 9 percent from an earlier 16 percent, elderly persons who depend on interest get less income, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

“We are now planning to put in place a mechanism to lift withholding tax from retirees who earn interest below 1,000 rupees a month,” he said in statement.

It is likely to cost up to 40 billion rupees to pay interest subsidies to banks to give senior citizens interest of 16 percent when market rates fall.

The government still owed banks interest subsidies on previous years senior citizen interest subsidies, Siyambalapitiya told opposition leader Sajith Premadasa in parliament Thursday.
