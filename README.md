The Indian company has complained of a possible “vicious campaign” against its 250 MW wind-powered energy project in Mannar and has said it has followed all the procedures.

### Debate erupts in Sri Lanka over open market vs primary market purchases

ECONOMYNEXT – A debate is raging in Sri Lanka over open market operations of the central bank, several years after wide acceptance was gained among the public and policy makers that primary market purchases led to monetary instability.

The debate in part appears to have been sparked by a column in EconomyNext which warned against the dangers of open market injections of money by the central bank as private credit starts to recover.

After several years of debate which started about almost two decades ago, there is general acceptance in Sri Lanka now that outright purchases of Treasury securities primary market (auctions) are bad and also that so-called ‘provisional advances’ by the central bank is bad.

In an outright purchase by the central bank of a new issue of Treasury bills, the money goes into the DST accounts of a state bank, which will be spent and end up in a private or state bank account customer, boosting rupee reserves of the bank, explains EN’s economic columnist Bellwether.
