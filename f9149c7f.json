    "Austerity measures imposed and enforced; more moral than fiscal bankruptcy; corruption unaddressed amidst the old guard ensconced in secure, self-serving domains at the expense of the poor... now, truly, is the winter of our discontent! With, unhappily, no \u2018Son of Yore\u2019 to make of it a glorious summer \u2013 yet",
    "As one writes today (22 June), one is aware of being located in time between three significant days of summer.",
    "A first, the Summer Solstice (21 June), is a physical event wherein the sun reaches its apex point in the Northern Hemisphere. Signifying the astronomical start of northern summer, it has the earliest sunrise and longest day, and heralds the commencement of the summertime in climes north of the equator.",
    "An intimately related date (24 June), Midsummer\u2019s Day symbolises the midway point between planting (in March) and harvesting (in September). In Europe, it is a season of abundance and growth, celebrated alike in historical pagan religions and commemorated by reformed protestant faiths even today as a time of plenty.",
    "The night before, Midsummer\u2019s Eve (23 June), marks an evening\u2019s eager anticipation of summertime flourishing \u2013 in the full knowledge that six since months hence, \u2018winter is coming.\u2019",
    "May one, in June 2023, relate the spiritual realities behind these cosmic timelines, to events that transpired in July 2022? Sri Lanka had \u2013 and no doubt would still have \u2013 its solstices (Latin \u2018sol\u2019 \u2013 sun; \u2018stitium\u2019 \u2013 stand still) and summer times ahead.",
    "For one, there is a consensus that in the events of July 2022 \u2013 the 9th in particular, when (bolstered by the strength of myriads of peacefully protesting citizens) the crowd stormed the presidential premises to oust a sitting head of state widely perceived to be at the root of all Sri Lanka\u2019s then and ongoing ills \u2013 was a high summer of sorts. The sun shone bright and long that high summer\u2019s day.",
    "For another, that the incumbent regime\u2019s ouster would restore a semblance of democratic norms, clean and competent governance, and a rule OF \u2013 not BY \u2013 law... for many if not most islanders hungering for more than bread but also justice.",
    "This \u2018southern summer solstice\u2019 in Sri Lanka saw citizen dissent reach its apogee, sending a warm glow through the glad hearts of those islanders for whom authoritarian incompetence commingled with corruption goes against the grain of what the truer republic constituted by their vote might stand for.",
    "But to many minds, it did not come to encompass the passage of a fresh summer of new hope.",
    "Rather, it consolidated the wintry ethos that had prevailed ever since the ill-winds of ethno-nationalist majoritarianism had taken the island in a bitterly cold grip; warmed only by elites and their cronies greasing their palms on lucre garnered at the expense of the poor.",
    "This, on the backdrop of hot anger in the town hall against the \u2018other\u2019 and the flames of war\u2019s aftermath being fanned by those who benefit from strife in the city centre and marketplace.",
    "For sure, however, the ousted chief executive\u2019s successor has had his hands full fighting fires \u2013 often literally \u2013 set alight by sundry parties with vested interests.",
    "And rather than the bonfires of Midsummer\u2019s Eve in which a weary people look forward to the summertime promise of peace and plenty, the polity has been riddled with rumours of continued shortages and hardship ahead.",
    "But to give credit where it is due, on the domestic economic front at least, the powers that be have brought a modicum of stability to hearth and home of the middle classes.",
    "So why is there still anger in the hearts of the lower socioeconomic strata of our layered island electorates, as well as no mean smidgen of anxiety remnant in corporate and elite minds?",
    "On one hand, the much-anticipated fruits of summer have come at a high cost to electorate and polity. Postponed elections, entrenchment of the old guard, stringent fiscal reforms enforced, more belt tightening ahead, no guarantee that economic reforms would ensure social justice and the draconian aspects of the law being used to quell or stifle dissent.",
    "On the other hand, the dawning realisation that the season between planting and harvesting requires a far more sincere effort all-round than segments of the island-commonwealth appear ready to make, or commit to with a genuine pragmatism that entails sacrifices being made by all.",
    "So, is it any wonder then, that rather than the bonfires of a happy Midsummer\u2019s Eve, we seem to prefer to burn in effigy our scapegoats and sacrificial offerings?",
