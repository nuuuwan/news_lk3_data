    "Says Opposition will work together to prevent delay in holding polls",
    "Claims his party is ready to help Govt. hold presidential elections early",
    "Notes society which has no elections cannot be identified as a democratic society",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday said the Opposition will not allow for the presidential elections to be delayed. \u201cThe Opposition will act together to prevent such an occurrence,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP noted that the next presidential election must be held in October 2023. \u201cIf not, a referendum must be held,\u201d he added.",
    "Peiris said the FPC is ready to support the Government in its efforts to hold the presidential election before the scheduled time period. \u201cThe Opposition has joined hands to protect the people\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP also expressed his refusal to agree with the President\u2019s viewpoint that the populace of a democratic country lacks interest in elections.",
    "\u201cA society which has no elections cannot be identified as a democratic society,\u201d he said, adding that the President last week made the most severe comment on the country\u2019s political culture. \u201cHe suggested that the people have no interest in polls and that elections hold no importance,\u201d he noted.",
    "\u201cA ruler which says no to elections is not one that respects the mandate of the people,\u201d he added. The MP stressed that anyone ruling a country without the approval of the people is a dictator. He said the President\u2019s statement only bolstered the behaviour of the Government which seemingly appeared to be anti-elections."
