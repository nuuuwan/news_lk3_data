    "Denying reports that his wife Jalani Premadasa will take up active politics, Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa said none of his family members will engage in active politics, though they will be engaged in social service.",
    "\u201cSome are saying that my wife and others are to take up active politics. However, I assure you that none of my family members will take up politics, but they will be engaged in social service,\u201d Mr. Premadasa said speaking during a gathering where his wife was conferred the Sri Sugatha Sasana Prasadini title at a public ceremony.",
    "\u201cFirst ladies in the past actively participated in social service. Late Ms. Elina Jayewardene the wife of late President J.R. Jayewardene was engaged in social service through the Seva Vanthitha movement. Even my mother was involved in the movement. However, the Seva Vanitha Movement had died a natural death after 1994. A future Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) government will revive the Seva Vanthita Movement so that spouses of heads of state and Ministers will be able to engage in social service and serve the people,\u201d he added.
