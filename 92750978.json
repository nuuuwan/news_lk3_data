    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s National Medical Regulatory Authority (NMRA) can consider allowing the import of drugs with a shelf life below 9 months to ease recurring shortages, Chief Executive Officer Vijith Gunesekara said.",
    "Drugs with a shelf life below \u201c75 percent of a year\u201d were not cleared by Sri Lanka Customs at the point of import due to an NMRA regulation, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwelle had said addressing a tri-monthly summit held on 30 June.",
    "\u201cDepending on the supply, gaps, urgency or stock levels, we might consider lower percentages, so that is up to NMRA,\u201d Gunesekara said.",
    "Around 190 drugs out of the 800 in the Central Medical Centre are in shortage, while Medical Centres across the island are short of 90 drugs, Sri Lanka\u2019s Health Minister, Keheliya Rambukwelle had said when addressing the issue of medicine shortages.",
    "\u201cMedicines have protections and standards to be met in order to be imported,\u201d Minister Rambukwelle said.",
    "To see those processes through, it takes at least 9 months, \u201d said Rambukwelle said, noting that the Ministry is at a place where it can control the situation. (Colombo/July06/2023)"
