    "It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material",
    "The tragedy that occurred at internationally famed Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks on the spot and injuring six other Bikkus is another heartrending news that shocked the entire Sri Lanka within the last one month. From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.",
    "Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.",
    "Investigations are underway on the orders of the Mahawa Magistrate who made an inspection of the ill-fated cart and the accident in question to ascertain the causes of the snapped cable, as images showed frayed steel cable, blood-stained clothes, damaged equipment, and poorly maintained corroded tracks on which the cart had travelled.",
    "It is not the intention of the writer to point out the causes for the accident, as a full-scale investigation is underway and it is entirely left to the learned magistrate to give a verdict after ascertaining all the relevant facts.",
    "However, there are a few grey areas that demand closer attention.",
    "1. Maximum load: It is learnt that the maximum load of the passengers the cart carries is 800 kg and at the time of the accident the cart has taken 13 Bikkus on this ill-fated trip. If the average weight of a Bikku is around 80 kg, it can be safely assumed that the cart had carried a gross weight of 1,040 kg. What about the weight of the other paraphernalia, the Bikkus have taken as is visible from the incident scene. All in all, it could be assumed that the cart has had a full load of 1,100 kg. Obviously, this load of 1,100 kg is well above the recommended weight of 800 kg. Can a poorly maintained cart shoulder an excessive weight is a question that demands an answer!",
    "2. Inferior quality of materials used for construction: It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material, according to the eyewitnesses who spoke to the media. The writer visited this temple and spent almost a half a day by performing religious activities in the late 1990s and I just cannot remember this facility for the Bikkus to travel from their abodes.",
    "As a matter fact, one foreign Bikku whispered, when questioned, that he had to travel by foot a distance of 350 meters in a difficult terrain to reach the main hall twice a day spending 45 minutes to one hour where the almsgiving are arranged by the public.",
    "The manner in which that donor has constructed and gifted this facility by using leftover sub-standard materials is a matter that cannot be discounted, considering the safety and the vulnerability of the project on a hilly terrain. In the science of mechanical engineering, it is explicitly stated that no chain, rope or lifting tackle shall be used for a sensitive facility of this nature, unless it is of good construction, sound material, adequate strength and free from patent defect. Section 28 (1) A of the Factory Ordinance of 45 of 1942 has clearly specified this requirement. The donor would have undertaken this project in good faith to the monastery but if the substandard materials have been used from the leftovers, it is inevitable to experience such a calamity.",
    "3.Periodical maintenance: it has to be borne in mind that the cart which is extensively used for the transportation of Bikkus should be periodically serviced and maintained for the safety of the Bikkus. The Factory Ordinance in section 28 (1) d, states that all chains, ropes and lifting tackle shall be thoroughly examined by a competent person at least once in every six months or at such greater intervals. Has this vital and mandatory requirement been observed in the breach is the dollar million question.",
    "A monastery is a religious organisation and it does not have a rigid and systematic organisational structure to deal with specific internal segments. Thus, my gut feeling is no periodical examination or servicing has been undertaken by a qualified person or an institution. Periodically, the monastery might have undertaken minor repairs on ad-hoc basis. I have my serious doubt whether the District Factory Engineer or for that matter a reputed engineering institution or qualified engineer had ever visited this plant during the last 20 years.",
    "From the safety point of view, the provision of one cable to the cart cannot be endorsed. Had there been two cables, the extent of the damages could have been either averted or mitigated.",
    "It should have been the duty of the Dayake Saba to look into these aspects. Most of the Dayaka Sabas consist of elderly persons appointed on a routine basis and they lack the knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms that govern these basic facilities.",
    "4. Un-secured prime-mover: What I saw in the telecast was a frightening situation last night as regards the prime-mover to which the steel cable is connected. It is located in an isolated hut and it has not been either securely fenced or protected, thus leaving the hut at the mercy of any undesirable elements to meddle with the system. From the safety point of view this is a very dangerous situation. Anyone could have access to this hut and damaged the fly wheel directly connected to any prime mover, had he wanted to cause a wanton damage with an ulterior motive. The regulation says whether the fly-wheel or prime-mover is situated in an engine house or not, it shall be securely fenced.",
    "5. It is timely that the custodians of the temple or the Dayaka Saba revisit the safety aspects of this monastery and take precautionary measures to avoid health and safety hazards of this precinct on an utmost priority.",
    "6.There may be similar health hazards in other religious places, which pose a threat to the life and limbs of devotees. Hence, it is imperative that the Ministry of Buddha Sasana visit such religious places and take appropriate measures to avoid fatal accidents."
