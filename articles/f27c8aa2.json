They have been in control of what has happened in Sri Lanka for so long. They are not going to give up easily. But, People of this country is stronger than all of them. We have not realized our strength before. By coming together as an organized group, we are much stronger than all of them. They have ruined our country for the last 76 years. That era must come to an end. Ending that era is our responsibility. You can make that change. You must be part of that change,\u201d she appealed to the Sri Lankan community living in London."
