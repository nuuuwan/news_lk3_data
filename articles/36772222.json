    "Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said the proposed amendments aim to introduce new auditing provisions for the 1,092 Samurdhi Community-Based Banks and 335 Samurdhi Community-Based Banking Societies operating across the country to promote microfinance activities.",
