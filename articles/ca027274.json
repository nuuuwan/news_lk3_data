  "original_title": "Trump-Putin talks produced enough movement to justify Ukraine meeting, Rubio says",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin produced enough movement to justify a meeting with Ukrainian and European leaders, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday.",
    "Rubio also said both Russia and Ukraine would have to make concessions to end the war, adding that the United States might not be able to produce a scenario guaranteeing peace.",
    "European leaders will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to meet Trump in Washington on Monday, seeking to bolster him as the president presses Ukraine to accept a quick peace deal after meeting Putin on Friday.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskiy and the Europeans,\u201d Rubio told the \u201cFace the Nation\u201d show.",
    "Rubio\u2019s comments were among the first by senior U.S. officials present at the talks with Putin.",
    "In a social media post, Trump wrote, \u201cBIG PROGRESS ON RUSSIA. STAY TUNED!\u201d he gave no details",
    "Speaking separately to Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d program, Rubio said the talks had narrowed down the key issues. These included drawing borders, long-term security guarantees for Kyiv, and which military alliances Ukraine could have, he said, adding \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of work that remains.\u201d",
    "Putin has ruled out Ukraine becoming a member of NATO. Article 5 of the alliance\u2019s charter is a mutual defence pact obliging allies to defend a member from attacks.",
    "Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Russia, told CNN that the U.S. side had won \u201cthe concession that the United States could offer Article Five-like protection.\u201d",
    "Pressed for details, he said, \u201cthe United States is potentially prepared to be able to give Article Five security guarantees, but not from NATO, directly from the United States, and other European countries.\u201d This would be one of the topics for discussion on Monday, he said.",
    "According to sources, Trump and Putin discussed proposals for Russia to relinquish tiny pockets of occupied Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine ceding a swathe of fortified land in the east and freezing the front lines elsewhere.",
    "\u201cWe may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it\u2019s not going to get,\u201d said Rubio.",
    "In a separate interview with ABC, Rubio said if a deal could not be reached to end the war, existing U.S. sanctions on Russia would continue, and more could be added.",
    "When Zelenskiy visited the White House in February, the meeting ended in a shouting match. Rubio, speaking to CBS, dismissed the idea that the European leaders were coming to Washington to protect Zelenskiy.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskiy from being bullied. They\u2019re coming here tomorrow because we\u2019ve been working with the Europeans,\u201d he said."
