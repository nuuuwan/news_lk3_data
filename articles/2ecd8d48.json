  "original_title": "The Krishanthi Kumaraswamy Tragedy and the  Chemmani  Mass Graves Phenomenon.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Chemmani, a sparsely populated area in the northern peninsula  of Jaffna has in recent times  acquired a  somewhat dubious  image. Just as Nallur in Jaffna is associated  positively in public perception with the famous Kandasamy temple, Chemmani  is associated negatively with mass graves. The long war between the  Sri Lankan armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE)  has resulted in innumerable instances of enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings. The mass graves uncovered in  Chemmani  are  symbolic proof  of those disappearances and killings.",
    "In July 1998, Corporal Somaratne Rajapaksa and some other soldiers were convicted for the rape and murder of a Jaffna schoolgirl Krishanthi Kumaraswamy  and the killing of  her family. Rajapaksa revealed at his sentencing  that between 300 and 400 Tamil civilians  killed in 1996  were buried in the Chemmani area.",
    "This disclosure resulted in excavations in 1999 that yielded fifteen skeletons, two of which were identified as  of youths   made to disappear in 1996. Despite forensic confirmation of assault and execution, there was no  follow up prosecution.Justice was not  meted out. The uncovered human remains taken to the University of Glascow for analysis are still in Scotland.",
    "On February 13 this year, construction workers  uncovered human skeletal remains  at the Sithuppaathi  Hindu  cemetery in the Chemmani area. They were engaged in a project to  re-develop the  Cemetery. The Jaffna Magistrate\u2019s Court  formally declare the site a mass grave and ordered a court-supervised excavation under judicial scrutiny.",
    "67  skeletons including those of infants and children have  been exhumed  so far. Several personal artefacts such as a schoolbag, a  toy doll, bangles, sandals and fragments of clothing have also been discovered. Currently excavation has ceased but will be resumed from 21st July.",
    "The discovery of  skeletal remains of over 60 people including infants and children along with the discovery of artefacts like a school bag and toy doll have made a profound impact on  the  Tamil  people. It appears  that the skeletal remains are those of Tamil civilians. Many Sinhalese too have expressed their horror over the discoveries. It is believed that the human remains being uncovered at Chemmani belong to the hundreds of civilians made to disappear in 1996. The  Chemmani earth is speaking out again after so many years!",
    "What happened in 1996 was this. The LTTE had been in control of the Jaffna peninsula and the greater part of the Northern mainland since 1990  after the Indian army departed from the North and East.   Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected  president on a platform of peace in 1994. Initially there was a ceasefire and negotiations commenced between the Kumaratunga Govt and the LTTE. However the tigers went to  war again in April 1995.",
    "The Sri Lankan army launched a phased out military offensive codenamed \u201cOperation Riviresa\u201d which resulted in the  re-capture of the Jaffna peninsula from LTTE control. The LTTE engineered a mass exodus of Tamil civilians from  the Peninsula into the Northern mainland known as \u201cWanni\u201d.  Although this engineered  exodus was partly successful, a very large number of Tamil civilians opted to remain in their homes in Jaffna and take their chances with the Armed forces.",
    "Initially the armed forces while establishing their authority also  tried to win the hearts  and minds of the Tamil people in Jaffna.  It was believed  that the LTTE presence had been eradicated in Jaffna. The Govt  wanted to commence a program of re-construction in war ravaged Jaffna. The then minister of Housing and Construction  Nimal Siripala de Silva  undertook a visit to Jaffna.  He was the head of the Presidential Task Force on Northern rehabilitation and re-construction. A public meeting was held in Stanley Road,Jaffna with Minister Siripala de Silva attending as chief guest and the then Jaffna  town commandant Brig. Ananda Hamangoda presiding.",
    "What the Govt and the Army top brass did not realise was that the LTTE had been infiltrating the Jaffna peninsula clandestinely. They had blended with the population and were planning strikes. The LTTE announced it\u2019s return with a \u201cbang\u201d literally and metaphorically. A woman strapped with explosives exploded herself near the vehicle in which the minister and Brigadier were leaving after the July 4th meeting. Though Nimal Siripala de Silva was the prime target, the minister escaped with injuries. But 23 others including Brig.Hamangoda were killed.Subsequently Hamangoda was promoted post-humously as Major -General.",
    "Two weeks later the LTTE struck again this time in the Northern mainland. The LTTE attacked the Mullaitheevu army camp on 18th July 1996 The camp was overrun and hundreds of soldiers were killed.",
    "The two  attacks in July 1996 changed the politico-military environment especially in Jaffna. The  winning  of hearts and minds approach  in Jaffna was abandoned. Instead an aggressive campaign to clean Jaffna of tigers commenced. Since the LTTE was suspected of  swimming like fish in an ocean of Tamil people, civilians were  subjected to  much hardship.",
    "Several people mostly youths were arrested or made to disappear. It was as if an unofficial license had been given to defence personnel to target  Tamil civilans and engage in mass scale human rights violations.  Consequently  over 600 enforced disappearances were recorded  during this phase.",
    "It was in this situation that Chemmani got identified with mass graves. As stated earlier it was Cpl. Somaratne Rajapakse who first  disclosed  in 1998 that hundreds of civilians had been buried in mass graves in Chemmani in 1996. Fifteen skeletons were exhumed in 1999. Now  decades later more skeletal remains were being exhumed. It seems that  buried in the soil of Chemmani are many dark secrets waiting to be unearthed if  governments in power have the political will to do so.",
    "The Chemmani mass graves  matter has also evoked much interest in the Krishanthi Kumaraswamy murder and rape case. It was the first accused in that case Corporal Rajapakse who first raised the spectre of Chemmani mass graves in court after being convicted. There is much mention of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy these days  and  a lot of interest in knowing what happened to her then. It is against this backdrop that this column focuses on the tragedy of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy in this two part article.",
    "The tragic tale began on September 7, 1996 when  Krishanthi Kumaraswamy an 18-year-old student of Chundikuli Girls High School, a prestigious educational institution run by the Anglican church in Jaffna, was returning to her home at Kaithadi. Krishanthi was a brilliant student who had obtained eight distinctions at the GCE O/L. (She was currently sitting for her A levels. She had obtained \u201cA\u201d in the two subjects she sat for before her life was cut short).  Her ambition in life was to make her mother happy by becoming a medical doctor.She used to cycle to school and back daily.",
    "After sitting for her AL  chemistry paper on 7th  September  1996, Krishanthi along with a friend Gauthami Sundaram   visited the home of a classmate Janaki  who had died in an accident the previous day. She had been knocked down by an army vehicle. Thereafter Krishanthi and Gauthami parted ways and Krishanthi proceeded home on her cycle.",
    "Krishanthi was fatherless. Her mother  59 year old Rasamma Kumaraswamy  was a graduate l teacher and school vice principal.. Kushanthi\u2019s 20-year-old sister  Prashanthi was studying accountancy in Colombo. Her younger brother, 16-year-old Pranavan was a student at St. John\u2019s College. The family with the exception of the elder daughter were residents of Kaithadi, a village in the Thenmaratchchi Division of Jaffa.",
    "Kaithadi is virtually on the border of Thenmaratchchi in close proximity to Navatkuli although the Jaffna lagoon separates a greater part of both places. Adjacent to Navatkuli is Ariyalai from where the Jalina municipality limits begin. An archway saying  \u201cJaffna welcomes you\u2019 demarcates the municipal area from Thenmaratchchi on the Jaffra-Kandy road. A road from this point leads to Nallur via Chemmani, Nayanmarkattu and Kalviyankadu.",
    "Another road from the Maambalam junction at Ariyalai also cuts through Chemmani. This area is sparsely populated with large chunks of marshlands. The greater part of Chemmani including these marshlands was in those days a high security zone and declared a no-go area for civilians because of the presence of army camps in the vicinity.",
    "There was  a checkpoint-cum-sentry post on the Jaffna-Kandy road on the Ariyalai-Chemmani-Navarakuli border. Technically the security post was located in the general area of Chemmani. Krishanthi had been cycling to and from Jaffna through this check post for quite some time.  As  someone who passed by the  check post regularly,Krishanthi was usually not subjected to checking or  questioning. However  on her way back on that fateful day, she was stopped  and taken inside the  bunker of the check post for  questioning .Krishanthi  was told that she was \u2018a Tigress\u2019  and had to be interrogated intensively.",
    "When this so-called interrogation was going  on, other residents of Kaithadi also happened to pass through the same point. There is evidence that Krishanthii was heard pleading with the soldiers and policemen on duty ,that she was not an LTTE member at all. She had cited her O level qualifications and the fact that she was doing her A levels and said that her only aim was to enter university. She told the soldiers she had no father and that her only ambition in life was to become a doctor and make her mother happy. She stated vehemently that she was not interested in politics at all. A pathetic plea she made was, \u201cWe trusted you and came back to live here. Why are you doing this to me?\u201d",
    "All those words had no effect on her interrogators. Psychoanalysts may also conclude that the middle class,intelligent and articulate Krishanthi symbolised the bourgeois Tamil image to the rustic Sinhala soldiers who were now of the \u2018powerful\u201d class. In that context, the desire to demonstrate their authority may have been overwhelming. Whatever the motivating factors, Krishanthi Kumaraswamy was never seen alive after that day.",
    "The mother Rasamma  got worried as her daughter had not returned home even in the afternoon. She got information from some people of Kaithadi that Krishanthie had been detained at the Chemmani checkpost.  This was confirmed to Rasamma by a  35 year old  trusted  neighbour  Chidambaram Kirubamoorthy.So the mother, brother and the  good hearted neighbour, Kirubamoorthy got on their cycles (the most common mode of transport in Jaffna then )and made their way to the checkpost. Rasamma seated herself on the bar of her son\u2019s cycle. Kiruba rode his own cycle.",
    "They  arrived at the checkpoint around 3 pm and were seen asking those on duty there about the whereabouts of Krishanthi. Thereafter all three went  \u201cmissing\u201d. A family and their  neighbour  had \u2018vanished\u2019.",
    "Some others in Kaithady went to some military posts in Chemmani and Ariyalai ,the following day and asked about the  family. \u201cOfficialdom\u201d denied having any knowledge of Krishanthi,her family and neighbour.",
    "But news about this \u2018disappearance\u201d began spreading and  percolated  down to Colombo. A Tamil lawyer who was Krishanthi\u2019s relative was informed of this by her sister. Then other Tamil lawyers, politicians and human rights activists also became aware.  Former TULF Batticaloa MP Joseph Pararajasingham raised the issue in Parliament  on 13 September 1996.. Former deputy defence minister Anuruddha Ratwatte replied  that  he will look into the matter.Pressure was  exerted on the government at the highest level by several diplomats in Colombo  who  displayed great concern  in the matter.",
    "Former TULF National list MP  Dr.Neelan Tiruchelvam gathered  available details  of the incident and prepared a document. He  gott an appointment with  the then President Chandika Kumaratunga and presented the document. To her credit President Kumaratunga   was sympathetic and receptive.  Since the \u201cdisappearance\u201dhad occurred in an area controlled by the Army, the Govt was accountable opined Chandrika.As a result  immediate action on the matter was ordered by President Kumaratunga.",
    "Unlike in other cases of human rights violations, the state and its organs did not seek to cover up the matter in this instance.  The Attorney -General\u2019s department and the military police division of the Army collaborated in the mission to  find out what exactly had happened. The then A-G Sarath Nanda Silva assigned a young state  counsel Prashanthi Mahindaratne to the case. She worked under the guidance of former Solicitor General D.P .Kumarasinghe.",
    "Prashanthi Mahindaratne relocated to Jaffna and started working on the case. She was given the fullest coooperation and assistance by the then head of the military police in Jaffna Col.Kalinga  Gunaratne .There was also a team of Police officials  from the Criminal Investigation Department(CID) engaged in the investigation.",
    "As the investigation got underway those on duty at the check point on September 7th  were rounded up for questioning. There were eight soldiers and three reserve Police constables  on duty at the checkpoint.  The intensive questioning  yielded positive results. The investigators  received valuable information about a particular spot in Chemmani. A buried cycle was found first. Then came the major discovery. The decomposed bodies of Krishanthi, her mother, brother and neighbour were discovered. Krishanthi\u2019s body had been chopped while the others had been strangled to death. The bodies were exhumed in late October.",
    "Initially  indictments were served on  all 11 persons on duty at the check post on that particular day. Of these, two turned state witnesses, a most welcome development from the point of view of the prosecution as otherwise there would have been no eyewitness testimony  to most of what had happened on that day.",
    "The two  state witnesses were two Policemen on duty on Sep 7th. . They were reserve Police constables P.A.Samarawickrema and A.H.Nazaar. Both of them  were given conditional pardons as they were not involved directly in the rape or muders. They had only been involved in disposing of the bodies.  Subsequently, nine persons consisting of eight soldiers and one  policeman were charged under trial at bar proceedings without a jury.",
    "The nine  accused comprised  eight soldiers and a reserve police constable. They were :",
    "They were charged under sections 140,146,296 and 357 of the penal code for the alleged offences of being members of an unlawful assembly, abduction, rape and murder.  These charges related to Krishanthi.The accused were further charged with abducting and committing the murders of Krishanthi\u2019s mother, younger brother and neighbour at the same time.",
    "The  Trial-at-bar commenced in November 1997 in Colombo. The three-member bench comprised high court judges Nimal Dissanayake, Gamini Abeyratne and Andrew Somawansa. The legal spade work was done by State Counsel Prashanthi Mahindaratne. Later, Additional Solicitor General  D.P. Kumarasinghe added stature to the prosecution by becoming chief counsel for the state.",
    "As the case progressed , the   fifth accused Wijayananda Alwis died in custody due to  meningitis.There were accusations of neglect by the prison authorities.  The 9th accused Pathiranalage Nishantha was discharged for want of strong evidence in the early days of the trial. The 6th accused DG Muthubanda was acquitted on Judgement day  because the court held that the evidence against him was not substantial.",
    "During the trial,two of the accused escaped from court in a manner that smacked of connivance with those detailed to guard them. One of them, the first accused Corporal Somaratna Rajapakse, was apprehended at Ratnapura after some days. The other escapee , 8th accused DV Indrajith Kumara was never caught and  is still at large.",
    "Although the indicted  offenders were all security personnel, the facts of the case made  it clear that these  crimes were  not committed in the heat of battle or in its immediate aftermath. This was not done in retaliation for some LTTE attack. The perpetrators were not engaged in genuine action aimed at arresting suspected tigers at the time. Instead it was a low crime of rape and murder, compounded further by the killing of the entire family to cover up that crime.",
    "The judges  delivered on 3rd July 1998 , a comprehensive verdict against all six persons convicted  including the absconding soldier.  The details of the sentences imposed, as  well as information  about how the investigation into  the Krishanthi Kumaraswamy rape and murder case was conducted, would be  related in the second part of this article.",
