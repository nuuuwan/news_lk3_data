    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday accused the Government of disregarding orders issued by the Supreme Court and opening the doors to allow the destruction of the rule of law in the country.",
    "The MP addressing a press conference yesterday highlighted that the Supreme Court plays a pivotal role in intervening when a Parliamentary act clashes with the fundamental rights of the country\u2019s citizens.",
    "Peiris stated that despite the expectation for the Speaker to be impartial, the current Speaker is seen to be implementing a biased agenda.",
    "As the no-confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is scheduled for discussion in Parliament today and tomorrow, Peiris emphasised that the motion was brought forth by the Opposition with the objective of protecting human rights.",
    "According to Peiris, the current Speaker is considered the weakest among the 25 speakers thus far, having been perceived as an extension of the executive.",
    "He emphasised that if any bill presented by the Parliament conflicts with human rights, the Supreme Court has the authority to propose amendments and recommendations for those bills. Additionally, he asserted that when a Government fails to meet the needs of the public, the Constitution itself grants the public the right to oppose it.",
    "Furthermore, he highlighted that after the Supreme Court notifies the President and the Speaker, within three weeks of submitting recommendations on a proposed bill, the Government is obligated to accept the recommendations and suggestions put forth by the Supreme Court. He further criticised the recently presented Online Security Act and said that it has severely undermined democracy."
