Prabagar said: \u201cThe challenges faced by banks in the BIMSTEC countries as well as the expectations of customers and regulators, are fairly similar. Being assessed by a panel of eminent banking industry personalities from the region is therefore of particular value, and we are extremely pleased to win the award for Best Bank in Sri Lanka as well as five Best Performance awards for our operations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\u201d",
    "Focusing on the stellar role played by banks in promoting economic growth and using monetary policy as an engine of growth during the times of the pandemic and the post-pandemic war in Europe, the awards considered the best practices and innovative steps taken by banks to overcome the myriad challenges they faced in their operations. Innovation in payment systems, digital asset management, anti-money laundering, big data analytics, cyber compliance and regulatory compliance, empathy, financial health and guidance of their clientele were among the aspects assessed for the awards.",
