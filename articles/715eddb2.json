    "In 2020, the number of single households accounted for 38% of the total.",
    "Among the elderly living alone in 2050, 59.7% of men and 30.2% of women are projected to have never married, up from 33.7% and 11.9%, respectively, in 2020, according to the data by National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.",
    "The projected trend suggests that the central and local governments need to enhance support for elderly people in areas such as nursing care."
