  "original_body_lines": [
    "Expresses outrage over the arrest of Tamil women for commemorating loved ones lost due to war",
    "Questions actions of Police, emphasising importance of Tamil community\u2019s right to remember their loved ones",
    "Criticises UNHRC for failing to ensure the basic right of commemorating the dead",
    "Suggests unity between Tamil and Sinhalese to address shared concerns and commemorate those lost in the war",
    "Democratic People\u2019s Front (DPF) Member of Parliament Mano Ganesan yesterday condemned both the international community and Sri Lankan authorities following the recent arrest of Tamil women in Sampur, Sri Lanka. Taking to X (formerly Twitter) Ganesan criticised the international community, alleging its failure to support the Tamil community throughout Sri Lanka\u2019s turbulent history.",
    "\u201cThe international community has completely failed the Tamil people of Sri Lanka,\u201d remarked MP Mano Ganesan in a recent statement.",
    "Ganesan highlighted the international community\u2019s role in granting approval for an all-out final war in Sri Lanka and subsequently closing the Vanni office of the United Nations, effectively creating a \u201cwar without witnesses.\u201d He further criticised the promises made by the international community to provide political solutions and accountability to Tamil national parties, which he claims have not been fulfilled.",
    "Turning his attention to the recent arrest of Tamil women in Sampur, Ganesan expressed outrage over the actions of the Sri Lankan Police. The women were reportedly arrested for commemorating their loved ones who were lost during the war by preparing and consuming porridge in their memory.",
    "\u201cWhy did the Sri Lankan Police go to courts in the first place when there is already a law preventing the usage of symbols of proscribed organisations?\u201d questioned Ganesan.",
    "He also questioned the timing and manner of the arrests, emphasising the importance of the Tamil community\u2019s constitutional and UN-declared right to remember their deceased loved ones.",
    "Ganesan further criticised the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for its failure to ensure the basic right of commemorating the dead, despite numerous resolutions brought forth by the United States. He also lamented the lack of action from the current US Ambassador to Sri Lanka in addressing the plight of marginalised Tamil workers.",
    "In conclusion, Ganesan suggested that the way forward for Tamil communities in Sri Lanka is to collaborate with southern Sinhala social democratic groups to address common issues and commemorate the war dead together."
