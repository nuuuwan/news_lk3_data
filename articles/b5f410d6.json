    "In recent weeks, data regarding pending cases in courts was collected, and the Commission has now instructed the judges to begin expediting the clearance of these cases without delay.",
    "The Judicial Service Commission has emphasised that District Judges, Magistrates, High Court Judges, and Additional District Judges\u2014who are administratively responsible for their respective courts\u2014are directly accountable for clearing the pending caseload in their courts.",
    "The Commission is also expected to monitor the clearance process through local-level inspections, and has instructed all judges to submit monthly progress reports on the matter.",
