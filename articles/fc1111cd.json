    "New Delhi, April 22 (Indian Express) - The Supreme Court Monday permitted the medical termination of a nearly 30-week pregnancy of a 14-year-old rape survivor, setting aside the Bombay High Court order declining the minor\u2019s mother\u2019s plea in the case.",
    "\u201cWe will allow the medical termination since she is 14 and it is rape case and this is an exceptional case,\u201d the Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud was quoted as saying by Bar and Bench.",
    "The SC bench also directed the Dean of Lokmanya Tilak Hospital in Mumbai to set up a team of doctors for the abortion, and ruled that the State will bear all medical and transportation expenses for the procedure.",
    "The bench stated that the minor should get transport arrangements and any medical care, if needed, post termination.",
    "Under law, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP Act) allows the termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks on the advice of one doctor. If a pregnancy is 20-24 weeks, the right to seek abortion is determined by two registered medical practitioners as an exception, but only under certain categories."
