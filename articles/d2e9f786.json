    "The 2023 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR 2023) \u2013 prepared by the Independent Group of Scientists (IGS) appointed by the United Nations Secretary General (representing both developed and developing countries) \u2013 arrived at the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda. It has reiterated that business-as-usual approaches to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be replaced by transformative approaches operating at a systemic level that address multiple SDGs simultaneously.",
    "The Report discusses essential transformations under six entry points to accelerate the progress on the SDGs. These are: 1) human well-being and capabilities, 2) sustainable and just economies, 3) food systems and healthy nutrition, 4) energy de-carbonization with universal access 5) urban and peri-urban development, and 6) the global environmental commons. The Report outlines the transformations required at each entry point at a country and regional level. It also identifies five levers that will drive transformation; 1) governance, 2) economy and finance, 3) science and technology, 4) individual and collective action, and 5) capacity building.",
    "To complement the publication, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), New York in partnership with the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) and the GIZ GmbH, convened a Regional Workshop for Asia and the Pacific in New Delhi. Held over 3 days from 22-24 October 2024, the workshop brought together policy makers, senior government officials and civil society to deepen knowledge of vital areas for sustainable development. The workshop was oriented around the 2023 GSDR Framework, its applicability to different contexts and to develop and platform national, local and regional sustainable development strategies.",
    "Speaking during the High Level Closing of the Workshop, the Director General of the Sustainable Development Council (SDC), Chamindry Saparamadu, highlighted that while Sri Lanka has already commenced its transformative journey, the GSDR 2023 Framework is a useful resource to develop a greater capacity within Sri Lanka and strategically plan transformations underpinned by the vision of the SDGs. She noted that the SDC\u2019s analysis of the government\u2019s policy proposals found that 108 of 169 SDG targets are explicitly addressed in the policies outlined in the Policy Document titled \u201cA Thriving Nation \u2013 A Beautiful Life\u201d, while there are spillover effects on the other SDG targets. The Director General of SDC emphasized the importance of taking specific actions to breakdown, destabilize and phase out dominant unsustainable practices in parallel to specific actions taken to accelerate sustainable practices for transformative change. She also described the importance of proper assessments to monitor and evaluate the distributional effects of transformative actions on different social groups and communities.",
    "Further, the 2024 Sustainable Development Transformation Forum (2024 SDTF) convened by the United Nations Office for Sustainable Development (UNOSD) from 29-31 October 2024 in Incheon, Korea focused on the application of the 2023 GSDR Framework for specific SDGs prioritized by the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) during 2025. These include SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The 2024 STDF facilitated peer learning through discussions on challenges, solutions, success stories, and lessons learned among a diverse group of participants, including policymakers, government officials, civil society representatives, local communities, youth, academia, and private sector leaders. This broad representation fostered inclusive dialogue and knowledge-sharing across sectors.",
    "During the Roundtable Discussion on \u201cFuelling Future Green Growth \u2013 Competing Crises, the Demographic Dividend, and Decent Jobs,\u201d Assistant Director of the Sustainable Development Council (SDC), Nadeeka Amarasinghe, highlighted key issues influencing Sri Lanka\u2019s SDG progress. She discussed the implications of the demographic dividend, the role of women\u2019s economic inclusion, the importance of creating decent jobs, and the impact of targeted investments on green growth and future well-being. Furthermore, the critical role of science and evidence-based policies in addressing these competing crises and mitigating future challenges was also emphasized.",
