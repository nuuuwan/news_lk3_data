    "His meals often include sprouts, grilled chicken, broccoli, and sometimes dhal. And don\u2019t we all love dhal!",

On shooting days, I wake up by 9 or 10 in the morning. After coming back home late at night \u2014 sometimes around 2.00 am \u2014 I take a shower and get a workout in before I finally sleep.\u201d",
