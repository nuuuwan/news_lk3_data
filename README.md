*2024-12-01 01:06:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-elusive-rs-1700/) ┬╖ `en`

It is now six months since Ranil Wickramasinghe announced at the Kotagala May Day Rally of the Ceylon WorkersтАЩ Congress that the daily wages of estate workers would be increased to Rs. 1,700 and that they would be paid Rs 80 for every kilogram of green leaf plucked above the norm. The government gazetted the decision as an order from the Commissioner of Labour, the daily wage being made up to Rs. 1,700 by adding a Rs. 350 special allowance not liable to statutory payments of EPF and ETF to the basic wage of Rs 1,350. However, the Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) obtained an interim injunction against implementing the gazette as they were legally challenging the decision as being unilateral and arbitrary.

The unparalleled victory of JVP/NPP in the national elections of November 14, 2024 has created an unprecedented sense of euphoria among Sri Lankans. This was no ordinary achievement as a lot of hard work went into changing the mindset of communities that had hitherto blindly followed the elitist policies of the major political parties.

### Fine sportsman, great debater, big appetite but weak stomach

Dudley Senanayake in the short Parliament of March to July 1960

Family and background had been central in Dudley SenanayakeтАЩs case too. Greatness had literally been thrust on him when he had been appointed prime minister on the death of his father D S, in 1952. That had been a time of intrigue and maneuvering which had soured the relations between Sir John, his close relative and him.

Sir John had struck back with the Premier Stakes which he later denied having any connection with. So Dudley had been anxious to win his spurs for himself through the hustings as early as possible. And he had proved his legitimacy by winning the 1952 elections handsomely, helped by the sympathy vote created by the death of his father. But his first stint as prime minister did not last long. Plagued by illness, chronic gastritis and the hartal of August 1953 which resulted in police firing and some civilian deaths, Dudley resigned.

### SHALL WE SHOP TODAY?

The one phrase calculated to galvanize any young person into flying out of bed is that magic question, тАЬShall we shop today?тАЭ

тАЬWhere, where?тАЭ To KitKat, my granddaughter, the word тАШshoppingтАЩ has a sort of intonation that no other sound can equal. It is an incantation of magic.

Really, I am so crafty I surprise myself. I need KitKat to help me carry a few new books from Vijitha Yapa Bookshop to my car plus a few household necessities.

She bounds out of bed and is ready so fast I have barely time to turn round and catch my breath before casually mentioning that I do need to have a short stop at the Crescat Supermarket before treating ourselves to those Palaces of Delight тАФ namely the new clothes shops opening up all over the city these days. She resigns herself to my perfidy.

тАЬI knew youтАЩd make me pay for this,тАЭ says she. тАЬI trust you will make it worth my while,тАЭ she adds sternly.

тАЬHow much will it take?тАЭ I am cautious. KitKatтАЩs ideas of economy do not exactly dovetail with mine.

### As a result of the Tamil nationalist parties splitting and contesting elections as different factions, the parliamentary representation of Tamils тАЛтАЛfrom the north and east has been weakened even more than before. Tamil politicians had ignored the warnings given in advance in this regard.

*2024-11-30 18:00:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=85150) ┬╖ `en`

What is the future of Tamil nationalist politics in Sri Lanka? This question, which has arisen in the aftermath of the recent Parliamentary Elections, should not be viewed simply in terms of the future electoral prospects of Tamil parties. It is a question related to the anxiety regarding the prospects for the fulfillment of the legitimate political aspirations of the Tamil people.

The Tamil nationalist political parties that have represented the Tamil people of the north and east in Parliament for more than 15 years since the end of the civil war have suffered a major setback in this Parliamentary Election.

It seems difficult to expect that these parties, which have never shown any moral interest in introspecting on the reasons why the past struggles for the political rights of the Tamil people have not been fruitful, will look back and correct their political path after this defeat.

тАЬWe expect Lion to maintain its solid market position in the local beer industry over the medium term,тАЭ Fitch said.

тАЬOur view is underpinned by LionтАЩs range of product offerings across price points, which makes cash flow defensive through cycles. It also benefits from prominent shelf space across its sales channels.

тАЬHowever, we expect competition will increase over the medium-term from the recent new beer product launch, owned by a leading local spirits manufacturer.

тАЬThe competition will benefit from an established retail-channel and distribution network, although Fitch believes the impact on LionтАЩs revenue will be gradual given production capacity will only ramp-up gradually over the medium-term.тАЭ
