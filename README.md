### Government attempts to bring an emergency bill to the country - Kiriella

*2024-07-11 14:50:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188218) · `ta`

The government aims to amend the constitution for a five-year presidential term through an emergency bill, despite the Supreme Court's confirmation of the same term limit. Opposition leader Lakshman Kiriella suspects Presidential intervention due to national unrest. He questions the urgency of revisiting the constitutional amendment, suggesting potential misuse of the emergency clause for political gains rather than addressing constitutional clarity.

🟩

The government is trying to submit an emergency bill to the High Court for amendment to the constitution for five years.

I suspect that the President will take some action as the President and the Executive Officer, based on the chaos within the country, ”said Lakshman Kiriella of the Opposition.

He was speaking at the time of the House adjournment motion on the presidential election in Parliament on Thursday (11).

The Supreme Court has confirmed the presidency three times as 5 years. So there is no issue in connection with the president's term. The United States Constitution is 250 years old.

Nothing of that enlightenment has been entered into the constitution. This is because the US High Court is considered part of the constitution of the country.

There is no Constitution in Big Britain. The constitution of the country is customary and case judgments.

If the Supreme Court ruled that the president's term in our country is five years, it is part of the constitution.
