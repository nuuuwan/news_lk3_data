    "Britain on Wednesday (22) won the first World Cup of a Japanese-invented sport scored on the basis of the variety and amount of litter collected.",

    "The sport, launched in 2008, is called \"SpoGOMI,\" derived from the word \"sport\" and \"gomi\" \u2014 the Japanese word for trash",
    "Drenched in sweat, three-member teams looked for empty cans and cigarette butts on roadsides and between buildings.",

    "\"It's frustrating because we wanted to win this event,\" said Tomoe Takahashi, a member of the Japanese team from Niigata Prefecture. \"But I hope more people around the world will be interested in environmental issues.\"",
