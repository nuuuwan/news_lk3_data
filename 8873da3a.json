    "High Court Lawyers\u2019 Association criticises Minister\u2019s remarks associating Attorneys-at-Law with drug traffickers",
    "Says it undermines role and duty of Attorneys defending various types of suspects",
    "Stresses Minister must refrain from creating any impediments to lawyers carrying out professional duties",
    "The High Court Lawyers\u2019 Association yesterday strongly criticised Public Security Minister Tiran Alles\u2019 recent remarks associating Attorneys-at-Law with drug traffickers.",
    "The Association said the Minister\u2019s statement,\u00a0 broadcast on all media platforms, undermines the role and duty of Attorneys defending various types of suspects produced before the court according to the established law of this country.",
    "\u201cIt is important to reiterate that the defence of suspects, regardless of the allegations against them, is a constitutional right of every citizen in Sri Lanka. This right is not subject to the wishes or whims of any individual, including the Public Security Minister,\u201d it noted.",
    "The Association also highlighted that the presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle in the legal system of Sri Lanka and it is a cornerstone of justice that asserts that every individual is to be considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",
    "It said, in accordance with the presumption of innocence, it is the duty of judges, attorneys, and all stakeholders in the legal system to uphold and respect this principle.",
    "\u201cIt also imposes an obligation on attorneys to vigorously defend their client\u2019s rights and challenge the prosecution\u2019s case within the framework of the law. The presumption of innocence is not a mere technicality but serves as a powerful safeguard against wrongful accusations and unjust outcomes. It demands that the guilt of an individual be established through a fair and transparent legal process, where the rights of the accused are protected and respected at all times,\u201d it noted.",
    "\u201cIt is unfair to blame learned attorneys for their ability to represent their clients in accordance with established law, especially, considering the criticisms of corruption within the police department\u2019s administration. The professionalism and integrity of attorneys should not be questioned based on the shortcomings of other entities\u201d the Association added.",
    "The lawyers stressed that the Minister must refrain from creating any impediments to the legal professionals carrying out their professional duties under the Constitution of Sri Lanka and this commitment is of utmost importance as it upholds the values of justice, fairness, and the rule of law."
