    "Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India Chairman Prof. Mahendra Dev",
    "Food systems lie at the heart of sustainable development. They influence how people produce, access, and consume food and are intricately tied to livelihoods, public health, natural ecosystems, and economic growth. For South Asia, where a large share of the population remains dependent on agriculture and food-related services, strengthening food systems is both a developmental and strategic priority.",
    "Against this backdrop, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), in partnership with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), convened a high-level regional policy dialogue, \u201cFood Policy for a Changing World: Lessons and Priorities for South Asia,\u201d on 16 September, in New Delhi. The event also marked the South Asia launch of IFPRI\u2019s 2025 Global Food Policy Report (GFPR).",
    "The dialogue brought together senior policymakers, researchers, and development partners to reflect on how South Asia can secure resilient, inclusive, and sustainable food systems amid mounting pressures of climate change, malnutrition, and demographic transitions.",
    "The chief guest, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India (EAC-PM) Chairman Prof. S. Mahendra Dev, reminded participants that the food systems agenda cannot lose sight of traditional priorities: \u201cWhile we are focusing on newer challenges like food systems, environment, and nutrition, we should not forget that earlier priorities like agriculture growth linkages and rural investments remain critical. Governments and the private sector must work together to reshape food systems that deliver affordable, healthy, and diversified diets.\u201d",
    "Nutrition was another central theme. NITI Aayog Member Dr. Vinod K. Paul, emphasised early interventions: \u201cIf we truly want to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, we must act before pregnancy. Preconception health and nutrition for women can reduce growth restriction by up to 25%, and when coupled with later interventions, can cut childhood stunting by nearly half.\u201d",
    "State innovations also featured prominently. Government of Odisha Development Commissioner \u2013 cum \u2013 Additional Chief Secretary Smt. Anu Garg, reflected on her State\u2019s progress: \u201cOdisha\u2019s journey from districts once infamous for starvation deaths to becoming the fifth-largest rice producer in India shows what determined institution-building and investment in irrigation can achieve. Today, our focus is on embedding climate resilience into agriculture so that this progress endures.\u201d",
    "Continuing this theme, Government of Odisha\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Empowerment Principal Secretary Dr. Arabinda Kumar Padhee, highlighted Odisha\u2019s integrated approach: \u201cOdisha is perhaps one of the few states where we have both a climate resilience cell and we are going to have a Gender Responsive Cell. Through CRC and GRC we wanted to build into our design the gender and climate lens from the beginning.\u201d He also noted that regional cooperation initiatives, such as Seeds Without Borders, demonstrate how cross-country collaboration can accelerate the spread of climate-resilient varieties.",
    "The broader environmental dimension was brought into focus by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) India Representative Dr. Angela Lusigi, who observed: \u201cThe challenges we face are not merely about numbers or statistics. It\u2019s about justice and equity as a fundamental right to food security. Climate vulnerability is deeply intersectional \u2013 it intersects poverty, gender, geography, and social status.\u201d She called for inclusive and integrated solutions that combine innovation with traditional knowledge.",
    "IFPRI Senior Director, Food and Nutrition Policy and Acting Director, Transformation Strategies Dr. Purnima Menon reinforced IFPRI\u2019s role as a global connector of policy evidence: \u201cAt IFPRI we really do believe in the transformational power of policy \u2013 whether sub-national, national, or regional. We see our role as connecting the dots across regions, from South Asia to Africa, so that lessons here can inform solutions globally.\u201d",
    "Summing up the stakes for the region, IFPRI-South Asia Director Dr. Shahidur Rashid noted: \u201cThis year\u2019s Global Food Policy Report is special \u2013 it not only marks IFPRI\u2019s 50-year journey, but also reflects on the future policy challenges that will shape food and agriculture in the decades ahead. For South Asia, the report highlights three stubborn challenges that demand urgent attention: climate change, persistent undernutrition, and the need for healthier, more diverse diets.\u201d",
    "As South Asian countries strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and envision resilient, inclusive, and sustainable food systems by 2050, the urgency for coordinated, evidence-based policy action has never been greater.",
    "The South Asia Dialogue, co-hosted by IFPRI and ICAR, underscored the region\u2019s shared responsibility and opportunity to lead. Anchored in evidence, enriched by experience, and committed to collaborative solutions, the discussions set the stage for food systems transformation that prioritises resilience, equity, and nutrition for all."
