    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Rajapaksas have their share of responsibility for Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis but his critics in the now-divided opposition who shirked their responsibility also played a part in the collapse of the country\u2019s political system, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said insisting that he\u2019s not a \u201csurrogate\u201d for the powerful dynasty.",
    "In an interview with India\u2019s Firstpost, Wickremesinghe told journalist Palki Sharma on Wednesday November 22 that both the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) are now split.",
    "Asked if he agrees with a recent Supreme Court verdict that held former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, then Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and a number of officials of that government responsible for Sri Lanka\u2019s worst financial crisis in decades, Wickremesinghe said: \u201cWell, that is what the court has said.\u201d",
    "Pressed by Sharma, Wickremesinghe stopped short of concurring with the verdict but said \u201cThe crisis took place during their time\u201d and added later on in the interview that the Rajapaksas have \u201ctheir share of responsibility\u201d.",
    "Wickremesinghe also defended his controversial participation in a birthday celebration organised for former PM Mahinda Rajapaksa last week, claiming that the two have always wished each other for their birthday and, this time, he had merely accepted an invitation by Rajapaksa\u2019s son Namal, who incidentally abstained from voting for Wickremesinghe\u2019s 2024 budget. Wickremesinghe said he would accept an invitation to any parliamentarian\u2019s birthday celebration if he could find the time.",
    "The president also criticised the opposition for \u201cducking\u201d from their responsibility to take over following the resignation of Prime Minister Rajapaksa in May 2022 and again in July following the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The whole political system had collapsed as a result, he claimed.",
    "\u201cSo the whole politics of this country has been topsy-turvy. There were a lot of irresponsible actions by everyone. So I think you have to look into all that, not merely one part of it,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka had been used to a system of \u201cslogans\u201d designed to make the people happy and no one was prepared to make the \u201chard decisions\u201d, Wickremesinghe said explaining his decision to take over.",
    "\u201cSo if you look into that, the record is not good for anyone. As far as President Rajapaksa and PM Rajapaksa are concerned, they were there at that time. But it was a process that had started. Let\u2019s say that they left office, what would\u2019ve happened if the opposition was not willing to take over and I was not there?\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not defending the Rajapaksas. I\u2019m saying Rajapaksas are responsible, but then [there was] no one to take responsibility thereafter. The critics are the ones who ran away,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked if he feels pressure from the SLPP, the president said: \u201cSometimes they have their requirements. They come along. Other times they won\u2019t. It\u2019s sort of not a normal parliament.\u201d",
    "Insisting that he\u2019s not a surrogate for the Rajapaksa family, Wickremesinghe said the SLPP, the party controlled by them, is now split.",
    "\u201cOne half is working with the SJB. The other half is with me. If you ask me if the whole of the Rajapaksas\u2019 party is supporting me, no. And if you ask me if the whole of the SJB is supporting [opposition leader] Sajith Premadasa? No. All parties are split,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI just asked people to get together, to pull the country out. And I got this majority. If I didn\u2019t have the numbers, what would\u2019ve happened?\u201d (Colombo/Nov23/2023)"
