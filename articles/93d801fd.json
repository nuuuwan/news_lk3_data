    "UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said in tribute that Tata was a \u201ctitan of the business world\u201d who \u201cplayed a huge role in shaping British industry\u201d.",
    "A profile published in the Economist magazine in 2011 called Tata a \u201ctitan\u201d, crediting him with transforming the family group into \u201ca global powerhouse\u201d.",
    "\u201cHe owns less than 1% of the group that bears his family name. But he is a titan nonetheless: the most powerful businessman in India and one of the most influential in the world,\u201d the magazine said.",
    "In 2012, he retired as chairman of the group and was appointed chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, the group\u2019s holding company.",

He studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University in the US.\u00a0 In 1962, he joined Tata Industries \u2013 the promoter company of the group \u2013 as an assistant and spent six months training at a company plant in Jamshedpur.\u00a0 From here, he went on to work at the Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Radio and Electronics (Nelco).",
    "In 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor. \u201cJRD Tata was my greatest mentor\u2026 he was like a father and a brother to me \u2013 and not enough has been said about that,\u201d Tata later told an interviewer.",
    "In 2008, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Vibhushan, the country\u2019s second-highest civilian honour.",
    "Peter Casey, author of The Story of Tata, described Tata as a \u201cmodest, reserved and even shy man\u201d who had a \u201cstately calm\u201d about him and a \u201cfierce discipline\u201d.",
    "He was drawn into a rare unsavoury controversy in 2016, when his successor as Tata Sons chairman, Cyrus Mistry, was ousted from the role, sparking a bitter management feud. Mistry died in a car crash in 2022.",
    "The business tycoon also had a lighter side to him. His love for fast cars and planes was well-known \u2013 the Tata group website describes these as some of his \u201cenduring passions\u201d.",

And yet, two-three years down the road, my home becomes too empty and too quiet for me to live without them, so there is another dog that gets my affection and attention, just like the last one,\u201d he said.",
    "He was also often praised for his simplicity. In 2022, a video of him travelling in a Nano car \u2013 one of the world\u2019s cheapest cars, now mostly remembered as one of Tata\u2019s failed dreams \u2013 went viral on social media.",
