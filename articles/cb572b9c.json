    "Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said the death toll had leapt to 93 from the attack in which camouflage-clad gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons at concertgoers near the capital on Friday. It said some died from gunshot wounds and others in a huge fire that broke out in the complex.",
    "Interfax quoted the FSB security service as saying the four suspected gunmen had been arrested while heading to the Ukrainian border, and that they had contacts in Ukraine. It said they were being transferred to Moscow.",
    "Russia has not made public any evidence of a Ukrainian connection. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with Friday\u2019s attack, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.",
    "Russian lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein said the attackers had fled in a Renault vehicle that was spotted by police in Bryansk region, about 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Moscow on Friday night and disobeyed instructions to stop.",

    "The shooting took place on Friday evening at Crocus City Hall, a concert venue just west of Moscow where a Soviet-era rock band was due to perform.",
    "Verified video showed people taking their seats in the hall, then rushing for the exits as repeated gunfire echoed above screams. Other video showed men shooting at groups of people. Some victims lay motionless in pools of blood.",
    "\u201cSuddenly there were bangs behind us - shots. A burst of firing - I do not know what,\u201d one witness, who asked not to be identified by name, told Reuters.",
    "Long lines formed in Moscow on Saturday for people to donate blood. Health officials said more than 120 people were wounded.",
    "\u201cThe death toll is expected to rise,\u201d the Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes in Russia, said on Telegram.",
    "The Moscow city and regional governments said they would provide financial support for families of the victims and those injured, as well as paying for funerals.",
    "Islamic State, the militant group that once sought control over swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group\u2019s Amaq agency said on Telegram.",
    "Islamic State said its fighters attacked on the outskirts of Moscow, \u201ckilling and wounding hundreds and causing great destruction to the place before they withdrew to their bases safely\u201d. The statement gave no further detail.",
    "The United States has intelligence confirming Islamic State\u2019s claim of responsibility for the shooting, a U.S. official said on Friday. The official said Washington had warned Moscow in recent weeks of the possibility of an attack.",
    "\u201cWe did warn the Russians appropriately,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, without providing any additional details.",
    "The attack on Crocus City Hall, about 20 km (12 miles) from the Kremlin, happened two weeks after the U.S. embassy in Russia warned that \u201cextremists\u201d had imminent plans for an attack in Moscow.",
    "Hours before the embassy warning, the FSB said it had foiled an attack on a Moscow synagogue by Islamic State\u2019s affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K, which seeks a caliphate across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran.",
    "Putin changed the course of the Syrian civil war by intervening in 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad against the opposition and Islamic State.",
    "\u201cISIS-K has been fixated on Russia for the past two years, frequently criticizing Putin in its propaganda,\u201d said Colin Clarke of the Soufan Center.",
    "The broader Islamic State group has claimed deadly attacks across the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Europe, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.",
    "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was a \u201cbloody terrorist attack\u201d that the world should condemn.",
    "The United States, European and Arab powers and many former Soviet republics expressed shock and sent their condolences. The United Nations Security Council condemned what it called a \u201cheinous and cowardly terrorist attack\u201d.",
    "Russia tightened security at airports, transport hubs and across the capital - a vast urban area of over 21 million people. All large-scale public events were cancelled across the country.",
    "Putin, who was on Sunday re-elected for a new six-year term, sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022 and has repeatedly warned that various powers - including countries in the West - are seeking to sow chaos inside Russia."
