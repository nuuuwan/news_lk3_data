A total of 100,000 scholarships have been awarded through this program, including a LKR 6,000 for G.C.E. Advanced Level students. To support these initiatives, we have allocated LKR 4 billion from the President\u2019s Fund.",
    "The past three years have been challenging for all of us. We faced hardships, shortages of food, and difficulties in providing transportation for children to attend school. However, those times are now behind us. As President, I have made a commitment to ensure that no child in this country suffers. Consequently, we swiftly implemented necessary economic recovery programs to restore our nation\u2019s stability.",
    "We have initiated essential programs to steer the country away from bankruptcy, with the goal of creating a better future for our children within the next 5-10 years.",
    "Following the recent economic crisis, many lost their sources of income. As part of our response, we have provided assistance to 2.4 million families through the Aswasuma program. Additionally, the Urumaya program was introduced to grant legal ownership of land to residents. This initiative extended property rights to individuals residing in urban apartments without legal entitlements. Moreover, our focus on education has culminated in the awarding of these scholarships to all deserving students across the country.",
    "Hence, we have endeavoured to provide livelihoods, secure rights, and ensure children receive education. Therefore, I encourage these children to make full use of these scholarships and advance their education.\u201d"
