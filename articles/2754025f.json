    "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the secondary tariffs on India could go up if \u201cthings don\u2019t go well\u201d during talks between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.",
    "Last week, Donald Trump imposed tariffs totalling 50 per cent on India, including 25 per cent for Delhi\u2019s purchases of Russian oil that will come into effect from August 27.",
    "\u201cI think everyone has been frustrated with President Putin. We expected that he would come to the table in a more fulsome way. It looks like he may be ready to negotiate. And we put secondary tariffs on the Indians for buying Russian oil. I could see, if things don\u2019t go well, then sanctions or secondary tariffs could go up,\u201d Scott Bessent said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday.",
    "When asked about China, the main buyer of Russian crude, Bessent said he is \u201cnot going to get ahead of the President, but the President is the best at creating leverage for himself, and he will make it clear to President Putin that all options are on the table.\u201d On whether sanctions can go up or loosened, Bessent said, \u201cSanctions can go up, they can be loosened. They can have a definitive life. They can go on indefinitely. You know, there\u2019s this Russian shadow fleet of ships around the world that I think we could crack down on.\u201d He added that even as Trump is meeting with Putin, the Europeans \u201cneed to join us\u201d and need to be willing to \u201cput on these secondary sanctions.\u201d",
    "Bessent recalled that at the G7 meeting in Canada this year, when he asked the leaders at the table whether they were willing to put a 200 per cent secondary tariff on China. \u201cAnd you know what, everybody wanted to see what kind of shoes they were wearing.\u201d He added that Trump is committed to ending the bloodshed in the Ukraine war. \u201cIt\u2019s put up or shut up time. The President is creating his own leverage. We need the Europeans to come in and help create more leverage,\u201d Bessent said.",
    "Responding to the tariffs, the Ministry of External Affairs has said that the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. \u201cLike any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,\u201d it said."
