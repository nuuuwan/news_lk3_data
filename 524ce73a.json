    "Cinnamon Air, Sri Lanka\u2019s premier domestic airline, recently announced the launch of scheduled flights to Jaffna, which will provide travellers with easy access transport to the most popular city in the northern region of the island along with an exceptional travel experience. Scheduled flights to Jaffna will commence from 16th June 2023, with weekly departures from Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and Sigiriya Airport to Jaffna International Airport every Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. At the same time, Cinnamon Air will resume daily scheduled flights to Trincomalee and Batticaloa from BIA.",
    "As the only domestic airline to offer scheduled flights from their dedicated domestic terminal at BIA, Cinnamon Air has meticulously designed its scheduled flight service between Colombo and Jaffna in order to meet the needs of discerning travellers who need a quick, seamless, cost-effective, and reliable transport option. While these scheduled flights ensure speed and comfort, the careful synchronisation of departure times with arrival times of major international airlines substantially reduces transit times for connecting passengers.",
    "In order to maximise the utility of the service for travellers, Cinnamon Air\u2019s scheduled flights to Jaffna from Colombo will be routed via Sigiriya, providing swift access to Jaffna from Sri Lanka\u2019s Cultural Triangle. The stopover in Sigiriya enables tourists who are exploring the cultural heritage of Sri Lanka in regions such as Polonnaruwa, Habarana, and Dambulla to widen their exposure to the diverse Sri Lankan culture by easily travelling to Jaffna.",
    "Furthermore, the resumption of scheduled flights to East Coast destinations offers speedy travel to the coastal tourist attractions in Trincomalee and Pasikudah (through Batticaloa). In addition to scheduled flights, Cinnamon Air continues to offer exclusive charter flights to Jaffna (and all other aerodromes in Sri Lanka). These private charter flights provide unparalleled speed, comfort, and flexibility to travellers.",
    "Commenting on the new development, Sean Dwight, the Chief Executive Officer of Cinnamon Air, said, \u201cWe are committed to providing the quickest and most convenient mode of transport in Sri Lanka with a memorable travel experience, and the introduction of scheduled flight service to Jaffna is the latest example of that commitment.\u201d",
