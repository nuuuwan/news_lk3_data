    "Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet approval was granted today to commence the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (A/L) classes immediately after the completion of the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations.",
    "Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said it will take at least three months for the Examinations Department to release the results after the completion of the GCE (O/L) examinations.",
    "\"During this period, the students' deviation from school education is the reason for the decrease in their tendency to proceed for the GCE (A/L) education, and it also creates various social issues,\" he said.",
    "Taking these facts into account, it has been identified that it is appropriate to start the GCE (A/L) education in schools with the completion of the O/L examinations in 2024. This makes it possible to manage the students' time effectively and provide enough time for teachers to cover the GCE (A/L) syllabus, Minister Gunawardana said."
