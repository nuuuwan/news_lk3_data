    "Sinopec has already signed the agreement to distribute fuel in Sri Lanka. Sinopec will be allocated 150-dealer operated fuel stations in the country. Besides, two other foreign fuel companies will be allowed to operate in the country later. Currently, the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Lanka Indian Oil Company are the only fuel distributors in the country.",
    "A government source told Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity that a floor and ceiling rate would be introduced according to a pricing formula in the future once these foreign companies start operations.",
    "\u201cThe companies are required to be competitive within the stipulated limit. We cannot expect a drastic price reduction soon, though,\u201d the source said.",
    "The source also said the government will also move away from the QR code system introduced for rationing fuel trade soon.",
