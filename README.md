ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s budget deficit has collapsed to 361 billion rupees up to April 2024 from 824.2 helped by higher tax revenues and a falling interest bill, official data show.

Revenues surged 48 percent to 1,216 billion rupees to April 2024, ahead of the 35 percent annual growth projected in a budget, with higher value added and income tax rates as well as economic activity recovering close to previous levels.

Sri Lanka is emerging from the worst case of ‘policy support’ deployed by macroeconomists since the central bank was set up in 1950 where the usual inflationary rate cuts which trigger currency crises and IMF programs, was also backed up tax cuts.

Giving policy support and denying monetary stability has become mainstream in the age of inflation and ‘age of external defaults without a war’ due to so-called Saltwater-Cambridge doctrine, critics say.

Rohit, 37, and 35-year-old Kohli are number one and two respectively on the all-time list of T20 international run-scorers.

“I’ve loved every moment of this,” said Rohit. “I started my India career playing this format. This is what I wanted. I wanted to win the cup and say thank you.”

On former captain Kohli, Rohit said: “He’s been a champion player without a doubt. We all know what he has done for us.

“At some point everyone has to say goodbye to the game and Virat was very clear that this is what he wanted to do.”

Both men will continue to be available for India in Tests and one-day internationals.

### Two aged US presidents square off in debate for the ages

*2024-06-30 00:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/two-aged-us-presidents-square-off-in-debate-for-the-ages/) · `en`

The Biden-Trump debate, touted as the political face-off that would change the course of history, was held Thursday night at the CNN studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The rather unusual ground rules for the debate had been agreed upon by the candidates weeks ago. It was the earliest presidential debate in history, held as it was more than four months before election day in November.

These ground rules were considered to be essential to avoid a repetition of the debate between these two when they were candidates for the presidency in 2020. During that first debate nearly four years ago, the general consensus was that Trump was “unhinged, bullied, bulldozed and obfuscated” (CNN), talked “incoherently and rattled off unfounded and baseless attacks” (NBC) spewed “misleading claims and outright lies” (New York Times) and showed he had “nothing but contempt for the values and norms that are essential to democracy” (Washington Post). No one wanted to see that kind of confrontational fiasco again.

### The Idea of the Global South

*2024-06-30 00:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-idea-of-the-global-south/) · `en`

It is easy to celebrate the return of Asia, the rise of the Global South, the resurgence of the Non-Aligned nations of the world. It is harder to chart a course for these countries and regions, to strategise the way forward for them.

The Global South, to be sure, has never been stronger before. The present moment is rife with many possibilities. The US and its allies have effectively lost the moral high ground, though some would argue and not incorrectly that it never held that high ground in the first place. South Africa’s intervention in the ongoing genocide in Gaza is an example of the immense potential of Global Southernism: the trial was launched at the behest, not of China or Russia or any of those countries that have a major issue with the US-led Western alliance, but of a state that had no rivalry or issue with that alliance.

### Sri Lanka government repays foreign debt on a net basis in 1Q 2024

*2024-06-29 18:52:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-government-repays-foreign-debt-on-a-net-basis-in-1q-2024-170244/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka’s budget foreign financing was negative in the first quarter of 2024, as the government repaid debt on a net basis, official data show.

Sri Lanka has a debt moratorium and unless new budget support loans come from agencies like the World Bank or Asian Development Bank, or some earlier projects disburse funds, the government has to keep servicing multilateral debt.

Foreign financing was a net repayment of 14.9 billion rupees in the first three months of the year, the central bank said which was lower than the negative 41.4 billion in 2024.

While interest payments will have to be serviced with the restructuring agreements of the bilaterals, new principle disbursements will take place as soon as projects are resumed.

Domestic financing was also lower at 296.1 billion rupees, down from 666.1 billion last year. (Colombo/June29/2024)
