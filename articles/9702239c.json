    "Eggs are now freely available, and they are not too expensive, as well, and that\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve decided to concentrate on eggs for this week\u2019s beauty scene.",
    "In fact, many blogs and beauty websites include a variety of egg white face mask recipes to suit different skin types.",
    "Well, the first step is to separate the egg white from the yolk, without breaking the yolk. (One egg white is usually sufficient for a face mask)",
    "Whisk the mixture together, thoroughly, until the mixture becomes frothy.",
    "Apply a thin layer to the face, using a clean facial brush or cotton pad. Avoid rubbing the mixture into the eyes.",
    "Beat an egg white until it is white and foamy, and then mix in 01 teaspoon of lemon juice and 01 teaspoon of honey.",
    "Wash face with warm water and apply the mask to the skin using a fan brush or cotton pad.",
    "Leave on the skin for 15 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water.",
    "(By the way, if you experience any stinging after applying a mask containing lemon juice, it\u2019s best that you remove the mask immediately)",
