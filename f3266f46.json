    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Customs is looking for more informants who could provide information on undervaluations and other measures that people use to pay less customs duty in trade in a move to boost the crisis-hit nation\u2019s revenue, as the island nation is in an attempt to reach the revenue target set by the International Monetary Fund in return to a $3 billion loan.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s government revenue was just above 8 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) last year, one of the lowest in the world after the state income plummeted following a politically-motivated tax reduction by former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in December 2019.",
    "Sri Lanka has agreed to raise the revenue and grant target to 11 percent of the GDP in 2023.",
    "P.B.S.C.\u00a0Nonis, the director general of Sri Lanka Customs said the authority is now looking for more ways to boost the revenue to raise the government income.",
    "\u201cWe urge the public to provide us information on these kind of activities,\u201d Nonis told a media briefing at Finance Ministry on Thursday (13)",
    "\u201cWe have a 24-hour hotline and we have dedicated lines to handle this information. The informer\u2019s confidentiality will be protected.\u201d",
    "Undervaluation and other deceptive measures to pay less customs duty are not unusual in Sri Lanka.",
    "Sri Lanka Customs has been rewarding informants according to the accuracy of information they provide, Customs officials say.",
    "The reward amount is based on the total value of confiscated goods and the penalty imposed for the offence. Out of the total value, 50 percent goes to the Treasury\u2019s consolidated account, while 5% percent goes to the disaster management unit at the Customs.",
    "Out of the remaining 45 percent, depending on the accuracy of the information, informants are likely to get 60 percent, an official at the Customs said. (Colombo/July 13/2023)"
