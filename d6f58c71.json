    "With the aim of elevating Sri Lanka\u2019s youth talent in the tourism and hospitality sector, the Swiss Hotel Management Academy Ltd., (SHMA) of A. Baur & Co. Ltd., declared open its second learning centre of the Skills for Sustainable Growth (SSG) program at the Kandy National Youth Corps.",
    "Following its first centre at Matale last Month, Kandy was chosen being a focal point for the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation together with whom Baurs has forged a private and public sector partnership to implement the SSG program, and a majority preference from the applicants from across the island.",
    "Over 70 students have successfully enrolled at the Kandy learning centre, from different areas in the country including Ratnapura, Monaragala, Kurunegala, and Negombo who are now boarded in close proximity to the Kandy National Youth Corps. SHMA is also planning to call out for its second intake during the beginning of 2024.",
    "The SSG program in Kandy is carried out by veteran hotelier Sam Rajamanthri who gears students through various learning techniques to gain employability skills. Many renowned hotels in the area have already shown their support of the SSG program, and have extended their scope to provide and internship opportunities for students, and some of these students have already made it through the interview and selection rounds for the blended learning phase.",
    "Students had the opportunity to experience a study tour at the Hotel Grand Kandyan, where the hotel staff expressed their encouragement and guidance to the students in their future career plans These value added live hotel experiences enable students to gain industry exposure prior to entering on-the-job training, preparing them for a successful internship.",
    "SHMA has also implemented the Learning Management System (LMS) to enhance the study program at the Kandy learning centre. The LMS enables and facilitates lecturers in seamlessly delivering lectures and effectively monitoring and planning their tasks in advance. The LMS also gives students access to additional learning content at their fingertips and are monitored during their on-the-job experience.",
    "The course content is based on a Swiss Vocational Skills Development (VSD) curriculum, including 70% practical and 30% theoretical lessons, followed by the on-the-job learning at start class hotels and restaurants. Further, students have access to various soft skills development workshops including life skills training with team building activities.",
    "Distinguishing itself from the existing hospitality education model in Sri Lanka, the SSG program stands out with a unique approach. Approximately two-thirds of its 9-month curriculum are dedicated to addressing both student and industry requirements, emphasising hands-on practical training through internships. In classroom soft skill development is a highlighted topic among the rest of the hospitality related courses we offer during the program.",
    "With the aim of producing highly qualified world-class hoteliers, SHMA is an education institute licensed to deliver the VET (Vocational Education Training) by EHL Professional Diploma program offering specialised tracks in Culinary, Food and Beverage, and Hotel Operations, provided by \u00c9cole h\u00f4teli\u00e8re de Lausanne, a pioneer in hospitality education since 1893."
