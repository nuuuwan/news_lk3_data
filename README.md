### Why two-third majority for NPP?

*2024-10-20 23:02:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-two-third-majority-for-NPP/4-768190) · `en`

A supportive parliament with two-third majority for NPP is an absolute must for the new regime to translate its promises into action

AKD expects his JVP-led NPP to win a majority of seats in the legislature to make his task easier. The question is whether that majority should be a simple working majority or a solid two-third majority. Disastrous consequences under governments that ruled with two-third majority in the past had provoked political pundits and opinion makers to question the wisdom of electing governments with two-third majority. Without questioning their wisdom however, a special case could be argued in favour of such a majority to the regime (the terminology is employed neutrally) headed by President AKD.

The people have confidence that AKD, with his progressive policies and a genuine agenda for national development, is the leader who can guide the country forward

Unlike the traditional political parties that have operated under a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” arrangement, the NPP under President AKD stands independent, promising nothing but results for the people. The parties that have suffered crushing defeats are now devoid of manifestos or visions, as they have plundered the nation’s resources and sold off valuable assets. It is crucial that the public be vigilant in casting their votes, ensuring that corrupt individuals do not return to power
