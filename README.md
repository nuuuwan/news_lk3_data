### All at sea?

*2024-12-07 00:16:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/All-at-sea/4-770205) · `en`

But if the Chabad House movement’s ideology – politics, if you will – is the core issue here, why so in one place, but apparently not in another?

Mental gymnastics – something Gunasekara suggests I am guilty of indulging in – are hardly needed to appreciate the wider context here. A fair bit of media commentary on these events includes a final note to the effect that three-quarters of all Dutch Jews – many of my own relatives included – were murdered by the Nazis, mostly in concentration camps but all too many, like those Israeli and Jewish football supporters, hunted down on the streets of Amsterdam and a host of other Dutch towns and villages. It’s this history that underlies Dutch politicians’ responses to the recent violence

### Sri Lanka’s energy independence through climate finance

*2024-12-07 00:13:01* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-energy-independence-through-climate-finance/4-770204) · `en`

Sri Lanka can significantly advance its climate change ambition and negotiate from a point of strength for increased flow of concessional climate finance to realise its ambitious strategy for energy transition to achieve energy sovereignty

Now it is technically possible to operate power grids comprising of close to 100% renewable energy sources such as hydro power including pump storage hydro, solar and wind and battery energy storage. The Sri Lanka Electricity Act of 2024 provides the legal framework for this. For a country like Sri Lanka, which is entirely dependent on imported fossil fuel such as oil, coal and LNG (in the future), this provides an opportunity to achieve complete energy sovereignty by eliminating the need for fossil fuel imports. This would provide reliable, indigenous electricity which is not exposed to fluctuations in global fuel prices and exchange rate

### 2024-12-06 (Friday)

### Blueprint for new Constitution

*2024-12-06 23:56:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Blueprint-for-new-Constitution/4-770198) · `en`

The Constitution, which is the supreme and fundamental law, must be sufficiently flexible to enable different shades of political opinion to be developed and implemented from time to time

When the citizens agree to be governed, what they insist in return from the rulers is that their rights and freedoms be effectively guaranteed. The Constitution should provide, as it does in many other countries, that an international human rights treaty, when ratified, will have the force of law, superseding any inconsistent existing law. If the Government is unwilling to do so, why ratify a treaty at all? Alternatively, at least the provisions of the two international human rights covenants should be incorporated in the Constitution. That is not only a matter of sound commonsense and prudent governance; it is also a solemn treaty obligation

### Interim order issued against increasing liquor license fees

The Supreme Court has issued an interim injunction order preventing the implementation of a Gazette notification issued by the previous government to increase the  annual fee for liquor licenses.

The three-judge bench, comprising Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe, and Priyantha Fernando, issued this order while granting leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition filed by the Sri Lanka Liquor Licensees’ Association.

The petition, which names the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and several others as respondents, argues that increasing the annual fee to Rs. 20 million, stipulated in the 2024/1 gazette notification, causes severe injustice to license holders and constitutes a violation of their fundamental rights.

The petitioners requested the court to issue a directive to relevant authorities to revert to the fee structure back to the one outlined in the 2017 Gazette notification.

Brown Sugar made at the SOE is also charged a 2.5 percent social security levy, he said.
