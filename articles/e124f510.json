    "Investigators of the Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Mahinda Kodituwakku, a man professing to be the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara yesterday in Pannipitiya.",
    "Kodituwakku who suddenly shot to fame recently through viral videos of him preaching flanked by groups of followers is being accused of distorting Buddhist teachings and engaging in irreligious activities.",
    "According to Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa, the suspect has been apprehended on four charges, including violations under the Computer Crimes Act. Additionally, Thalduwa said he faces allegations of insulting the Buddhist doctrine by delivering various sermons, thereby offending religious sentiment.",
    "The Police Spokesperson said the suspect is also facing charges under Sections 291 (a) and 291 (b) of the Penal Code for allegedly uttering words with the explicit intent of causing religious offence and insulting the religion or beliefs of a specific class. Charges under the Money Laundering Act have also been brought against Kodituwakku.",
    "On 12 January the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court also imposed an overseas travel ban on him after the police received many complaints, particularly from Buddhist clergy against his activities.",
    "The Magistrate issued the order following Senior Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris requesting a travel ban as it was required for an investigation led by the CID\u2019s Computer Crimes Division.",
    "Peiris revealed that the suspect, who recently arrived from Egypt, organised extravagant ceremonies to welcome himself at the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya. He said ongoing investigations aim to ascertain whether the suspect misrepresented himself as a Bodhisattva to serve the objectives of a religious fundamentalist organisation or if he acted under the influence of a fundamentalist group. Concurrently, the suspect is under investigation for potential violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.",
    "DSG Peiris accused the suspect of exploiting religion for personal financial gain. He highlighted that the suspect\u2019s sermons, disseminated through his YouTube channel, distort Buddhism and pose significant dangers. Furthermore, he noted that the suspect has publicly admitted to sexually abusing his daughter, potentially making him liable to charges of sexual abuse of a minor. The case against Kodituwakku will be taken up again on 17 January.",
    "Meanwhile, the Mahanayaka Theras also sent a letter to President Ranil Wickramasinghe over the weekend urging him to institute the requisite legal measures to enforce the law against persons involved in distorting Buddha Dharma.",
    "In Buddhism, Avalokiteshvara is a tenth-level bodhisattva associated with great compassion."
