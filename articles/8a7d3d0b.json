    "When the five Fundamental Rights petitions challenging former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s decision to grant a presidential pardon to ex-soldier Sunil Ratnayake, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the Mirusuvil murder case, were taken up for argument, neither Gotabaya Rajapaksa nor a lawyer represented him.",
    "Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda and Achala Wengappuli further directed the petitioners to serve notices on Sunil Ratnayake, a respondent in the petitions as he was also not represented by a lawyer.
