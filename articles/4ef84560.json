    "Former President of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe today expressed deep concern over the situation in Kathmandu, Nepal, condemning the recent violence and calling for the restoration of peace and stability in the country.",
    "\u201cFirst of all, I condemn all kinds of killings, including those of the youth that has occurred in Nepal. Similarly, the burning of the former Prime Minister\u2019s house and the killing of the former Prime Minister\u2019s wife is an extremely sad situation. I express my condolences over that murder,\u201d he said issuing a special statement.",
    "He further noted that the attacks on ministers, particularly the Foreign Minister, were a continuation of the tragedy, emphasizing that women\u2019s rights had been gravely violated and that such acts had tarnished Nepal\u2019s international reputation.",
    "The former president said the situation in Kathmandu \u201cshould not have gone this far\u201d and that the shooting by the police was an \u201cunacceptable course of action\u201d.",
    "Citing reports, he said the unrest could have been controlled without gunfire on the very first day and warned of the dangers of such developments escalating further.",
    "He also highlighted the influence of global social media platforms, saying:",
    "\u201cThe opportunity that American owned Social Media companies like Google, Facebook, and YouTube have presented to overthrow governments in countries around the world cannot be underestimated.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe argued that Nepal\u2019s crisis stemmed from long-standing issues that were neglected while politicians focused on day-to-day politics.",
    "\u201cEveryone was focused on day-to-day politics according to the South Asian tradition, without finding solutions to the acute problems. This has caused great frustration among the younger generation.\u201d",

    "He further added: \u201cHowever, in the end, what was left was a Nepal without a constitution. It is the responsibility of the military that took power to establish peace in the country and hold elections according to the constitution.\u201d",
    "Reflecting on Sri Lanka\u2019s historic ties with Nepal, he noted that as the birthplace of the Buddha, Nepal holds a special place. He condemned the violence as \u201cbarbaric acts\u201d which cannot be tolerated in such a country.",
    "\u201cIt is possible to think that the incompetence shown in state governance has also led to this situation,\u201d he noted.",
    "Quoting the teaching of Buddha, Wickremesinghe urged Nepal\u2019s current leaders to follow a path of harmony.",
    "\u201cThe Buddha preached to gather in harmony, discuss in harmony, and disperse in harmony. I hope that the current government in Nepal will take the \u201c\u0dc3\u0db4\u0dca\u0dad \u0d85\u0db4\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd3 \u0db0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db8\u0dba\u201d preached by the Buddha as a model,\u201d he said in conclusion."
