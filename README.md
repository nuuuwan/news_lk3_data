The People's Alliance (PA) faces challenges in nominating a presidential candidate due to past political dynamics, but potential opportunities exist for candidates supporting the PA, especially with the possibility of multiple contestants in the upcoming presidential election. This could allow any candidate to secure over 50% of the Sinhalese vote, potentially uniting Tamil Muslims and hill country people as a formidable force.

However, government spokesmen continue to be emphatic that a presidential election will be held first. Wickremesinghe himself had said on several occasions, as recently as this week, that parliamentary elections will be held after.

### SLFP faction led by ex-President Maithripala relocates operations

In light of the current political situation, the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to carry out the future activities of the party from a new location instead of the party headquarters.

Reportedly, this new location in Colombo will replace the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Colombo 10, for future political activities.

The party’s internal sources said that ongoing internal conflicts and court orders have made it impractical to convene constituency and district organizers of the party at a permanent location.

Therefore, the faction led by former President Sirisena has deemed it more appropriate to operate from a different location. The new political center will serve as a venue to convene district and constituency organizers from across the island to discuss upcoming political matters, as per sources.

Residents of the area said flocks of migratory birds live and breed freely during this season in Anawilundawa Ramsar bird sanctuary, which is a tourist attraction.

They were of the opinion that chemical waste dumped haphazardly from a factory in the area resulted in the death of birds and fish in this manner.

Meanwhile, Range Forest Conservator W.L. Upananda said he referred specimens of the dead fish and birds to the Peradeniya Special Veterinary Unit for laboratory tests to determine the cause of death. He said the results of the laboratory tests were yet to be received.

However, officials of the Aqua Culture Development Authority said watercourses had been contaminated due to neglect of clearing algae, resulting in the death of fish and birds.

### Insights on educational opportunities available in the UK for Sri Lankan students

*2024-05-27 04:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/insights-on-educational-opportunities-available-in-the-uk-for-sri-lankan-students/) · `en`

The Students Visa, a premier student migration consultancy hosted the “Educate to Elevate” panel discussion at Hatch Works, Colombo. This event aimed to shed light on the boundless educational opportunities available in the United Kingdom, a country renowned for its prestigious higher education system.

Sri Lanka is a significant market for UK higher education, particularly in the realm of transnational education. In recent years, Sri Lanka has recorded the third-highest number of students pursuing UK qualifications internationally. Each year, approximately 160,000 Sri Lankan students are ready for tertiary education. However, with state universities able to enrol only 42,000 students annually, competition for these limited spots is fierce. In 2022, only 23% of the 166,938 qualifying students gained admission to state universities. As a result, around 29,000 students seek higher education abroad each year, with an additional 60,000 engaging in various academic programs.
