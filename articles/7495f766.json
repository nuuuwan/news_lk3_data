  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Court of Appeal has ordered that a petition filed seeking an order be issued to the National Police Commission to take disciplinary actions against the former Director of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena, to be taken up on November 13.",
    "This petition has been filed against the former SIS chief over his failure to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday terror attack despite receiving intelligence in advance.",
    "The petition filed by the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) was taken up before a two-member Appeals Court judge bench consisting of Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Mahen Gopallawa today.",
    "During the hearing, President\u2019s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for the defendant, stated before the court that the relevant petition filed against his client should be dismissed since the National Police Commission has already initiated a new investigation regarding the matter following a Supreme Court order.",
    "Accordingly, the court ordered the next hearing to be scheduled on November 13, in order to consider whether to confirm the facts presented regarding the petition or allow its withdrawal."
