    "As one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest foreign exchange earners, the plantation industry, primarily known for Pure Ceylon Tea, also includes other key crops such as rubber, coconut, spices, and palm oil. The sector provides employment to approximately 125,000 individuals in Regional Plantations.",
