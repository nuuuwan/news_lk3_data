    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state will expropriate sugar stocks imported by private traders before a 50 rupee a kilogram midnight tax was slapped, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando has said as more dramatic state interventions follow the controversial tax hike.",
    "Under Sri Lanka\u2019s so-called Special Commodity Levy law, taxes can be raised by the executive while the population is sleeping to be rubber stamped by a parliament.",
    "After hiking taxes by 50 rupees a kilogram, price controls were slapped for a month in the first episode of state interventions.",
    "\u201cToday the cabinet decided to expropriate stocks imported for 25 cents are kilogram and issue them to Lanka Sathosa, Supermarkets and selected Co-operatives to be sold at 275 rupees,\u201d Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said in the latest in a series of state interventions following the midnight tax drama.",
    "Sri Lanka is supposedly operating a \u2018social market economy\u2019 (Soziale Marktwirtschaft) which helped create a German economic miracle after post-World War II with the help of a strong Deutsche Mark, but the sugar interventions are more in line with the earlier controlled economy (Zwangswirtschaft) that it replaced, analysts say.",
    "State Miniter for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said 19,000 metric tonnes of sugar imported before the tax, remained in the country until last week.",
    "Minister Fernando said after the expropriation, a price control on sugar will be removed.",
    "Sr Lanka\u2019s ruling party came under corruption allegations after midnight tax was slapped, on top of an earlier tax on wheat.",
    "There were similar corruption allegations against the last administration after a tax was cut.",
    "\u201cThe special commodity levy is a very unusual type of tax: when it applies, no other indirect taxes (such as excises or the VAT) are due,\u201d an International Monetary Fund corruption diagnostic report said.",
    "\u201cMoreover, the levy\u2019s scope (and hence the scope of all other indirect taxes) and applicable rates can be changed overnight by signature of the Minister of Finance.",
    "\u201cGazette notifications and approval by Parliament are only required as soon as convenient, which seems to create a tension with Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution, requiring that Parliament have full control of public finances.\u201d (Colombo/Nov20/2023)"
