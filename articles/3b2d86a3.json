    "The National List (NL), a ticket for unelected entry to Parliament, is a subject of ongoing controversy, especially in the context of the opening of this country\u2019s 10th Parliament last Thursday. Mr. Ravi Karunanayake\u2019s entry into the legislature via the NL continues to make waves. As far as the NPP or NPP/JVP, whatever you may prefer to call it, there was no serious problem if the nomination of two defeated candidates is discounted. This party which won a stunning better than two thirds majority at the last general election was entitled to 18 National List seats in proportion to its total national vote. It submitted the list of its nominees days after the conclusion of the election \u2013 16 from the list of names placed before the electorate, i.e. pre-election, and two names of candidates who unsuccessfully ran on Nov. 14. The law permits NL places to be filled either from the submitted list or from candidates who ran at the election. This latter provision was allegedly smuggled into the statute.",
    "As at previous elections there has been criticism, as was the case this time round too, that those who were rejected by the voters have been permitted \u201cbackdoor entry.\u201d The ruling party, despite its earlier profession that it would not nominate defeated candidates, justified its decision to nominate two such on a basis that was not without some logic. As the JVP\u2019s General Secretary Tilvin Silva explained on a television talk show, the two nominations were made from the Digamadulla and Vanni electoral districts. At Digamadulla, with a sizable Muslim population, his party won four seats that did not include a Muslim. So they nominated a defeated Muslim candidate to represent that segment of the electorate in parliament. In the Vanni they won two seats, both by Tamil candidates. Since the district included many Sinhalese who contributed to their victory, they decided to give their Sinhala district organizer a slot. There had been many other requests they had not conceded, Silva said making the point that in politics there must be room for some flexibility.",
    "Where the opposition is concerned, Mr. MA Sumanthiran, a defeated ITAK candidate from the Jaffna district very properly declined his party\u2019s single NL entitlement on the grounds that he had been rejected by the voters. The main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) was undecided at the time this comment is being written of who will take four of the five slots it won having already nominated its general secretary, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, for one of the places. It is reportedly pondering over six names \u2013 Dullas Alahapperuma (who ran against Ranil Wickremesinghe for president in the parliamentary vote), Imthiaz Bakeer Markar (the SJB chairman) Sujeewa Senasinghe (lawyer and former state minister) Eran Wickremaratne (former banker and state minister), Tissa Attanayake (SJB national organizer) and Mano Ganesan (former minister and leader of the Democratic People\u2019s Front influencing an Indian Tamil segment of the electorate). Hirunika Premachandra has also gone public saying she\u2019s seeking a place. Whatever the selection criteria, the party is in a tight bind to make its choice.",
    "Namal Rajapaksa correctly judged that he would not be able to win a seat under the SLPP\u2019s pohottuwa symbol and wisely had himself placed on the party\u2019s NL. He has thus been able to enter parliament and keep the Rajapaksa name alive in the legislature. Ravi Karunanayake\u2019s nomination on one of the two NL seats that the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led National Democratic Front (NDF) had earned has since seen a lot of smelly stuff hitting the fan. Wickremesinghe is on record saying he knew nothing about the nomination made by Sharmila Perera, the NDF secretary. Karunanayake was quoted in Friday\u2019s Daily Mirror saying Wickremesinghe had been misled by two people he did not want to name \u201cas everyone knows who they are.\u201d He further accused: \u201cNo one is talking about the injustice done to me but only talk about negative things about me.\u201d Karunanayake is the third ranking \u201cassistant leader\u201d of the UNP and now risks expulsion from that party. But whether he can be expelled from the NDF and lose the seat he has just occupied is an open question.",
    "Whether this country does need a National List enabling backdoor entry to as many as 29 seats in a 225-member House is a matter that merits serious re-examination. The current NL succeeded the previous six Appointed MPs representing \u201cunrepresented interests\u201d under the Soulbury Constitution. They were appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and included Burghers, Estate Tamils (after they were disenfranchised), European interests, Malays etc. SWRD Bandaranaike nominated Mr. Asoka Karunaratne in 1956 to represent the so-called depressed castes and Mrs. Bandaranaike nominated the well known pediatrician, Dr. LO Abeyratne to represent the children of Sri Lanka. The 1978 constitution created the National List (NL) of 29 members on the basis of bringing in talent unwilling to run for election or could not be elected. But this became a convenience for political parties and their leaders and an avenue of extending patronage. As far as we can recall, Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the best foreign minister we had during a difficult period in our history was one of the few if not the only adornment in parliament through the NL.",
    "Are we keeping this backdoor permanently open with beneficiaries receiving generous pensions for life after only five years of parliamentary service? This as much as the long list of \u201crecognized parties\u201d in the books of the Elections Department require urgent review. These parties are brazenly traded, acquired by various vested interests for their own benefit and cost the tax payer hugely as demonstrated in this year\u2019s elections. Hopefully something would be done about both these matters sooner than later.",
