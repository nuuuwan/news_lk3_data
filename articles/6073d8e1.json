    "The LunuDehi-Bathiya and Santhush (BNS) combination has been creating a storm with their music, especially overseas.",
    "Of course, their music is very infectious here, too, but the demand for them overseas is stupendous\u2026and they do it differently, as well.",
    "Their unplugged concerts are crowd-pullers where they perform using all acoustic instruments \u2013 guitars, piano, brass instruments, violins, cajons, etc.",
    "In fact, their next overseas unplugged concert will be in Australia.",
    "BNS will be doing \u2018Hadagasma\u2019, a special edition Unplugged Concert at Palms at Crown, in Melbourne, on Sunday, 27th October, with LunuDehi providing the backing, using acoustic instruments.",
    "The organisers are expecting a full house and it\u2019s very likely that would happen as 70% of the tickets have already been purchased by fans of BNS/LuniDehi.",
