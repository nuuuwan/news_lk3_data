  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the procurement of five power sets to be deployed for suburban and long-distance passenger services.",
    "The decision has been taken considering the shortage of power sets required to operate trains in suburban areas by the Railways Department.",
    "Announcing the decision at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Tuesday, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said due to the shortage, there is constant passenger congestion on the trains that operate daily. Since most of the power sets currently in operation have been in service for over 20 years, they are continually susceptible to sudden interruptions and breakdowns.",
    "He said according to recent estimates, the Railways Department requires a minimum of 96 power sets to maintain its existing service levels.",
    "The proposal to this effect, submitted by Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Minister Bimal Rathnayake, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."
