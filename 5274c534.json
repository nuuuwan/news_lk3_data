    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Transport and highways minister Dr Bandula Gunawardena said that steps are underway to digitalize functions of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) within the next year.",
    "\u201cThe government is working to implement many digital projects in the SLTB in the coming year,\u201d Gunawardena said at the presentation of appointment letters to a group of new drivers and conductors recruited to fill vacancies.",
    "\u201cAll new appointees should be determined to work towards that,\u201d Gunawardena was quoted as saying in a statement by the government information department.",
    "\u201cBecause of conductors and bus drivers not depositing the monies collected at their depot, for a day, the SLTB loses 10 million rupees [kho-tiya], so for a year 3,650 million,\u201d Gunawardena told parliament on Tuesday (29).",
    "He was replying to a question by MP Rishad Bathiudeen on suspension of certain bus routes in Mannar, Vavunia, and Mullaitivu.",
    "\u201cThe only way to avoid these losses is through the introduction of an e-ticketing system. We will implement this next year.\u201d",
    "He added that a former director of the Police Special Task Force, who was in charge of the Western Province, was appointed last week to investigate the fraud and corruption in the SLTB.",
    "After Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, many global institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have strongly recommended the Sri Lankan government to fully digitalise its transactions to reduce human interventions and eventually corruption. (Colombo/Nov30/2023)"
