    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The crisis in Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is so severe that it has had to import an acting chairman from a different party, ousted SLFP general secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara said.",
    "Speaking at an event, Jayasekara lamented the state of the once-powerful party.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m still a member of the SLFP. I was removed illegally. Today the SLFP is facing a number of crises. All of these crises began after my removal. There were no such crises when I was there,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cToday, I\u2019m saddened to note that the SLFP crisis has become so severe that a new chairman has been brought from outside, from a different party has been made the party\u2019s acting chairman,\u201d he added.",
    "He was referring to a controversial decision by one faction of the SLFP appointing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the party\u2019s acting chairman, even as Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva continues to function as acting chairman following the latter\u2019s appointment last week.",
    "Speaking to reporters, Rajapakshe said: \u201cIf we consider challenges a problem, we won\u2019t be able to do anything. We have always accepted challenges and are ready to face them.\u201d",
    "Rajapakshe has also expressed interest in contesting the presidential election due to be held between September 17 and October 18 this year.",
    "Asked to comment on social media speculation that his candidacy could be a way for former president Maithripala Sirisena to have the legal cases against him removed, Rajapakshe said: \u201cThere is no such law in Sri Lanka yet.\u201d",
    "Last week, the Colombo District Court extended an enjoining order preventing Sirisena from serving as SLFP chairman.",
    "The order, made by the court following a case filed by former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, will be in effect till May 09.",
    "The SLFP last week appointed its incumbent vice president Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party\u2019s acting chairman, amid much controversy. The appointment was made at a politburo meeting held April 08 morning after the the Colombo District Court issued an interim order the previous week preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from serving as SLFP chairman.",
    "The pro-Sirisena faction appointed Justice Minister Rajapakshe as acting chairman on Sunday April 21. (Colombo/Apr22/2024)"
