    "The NPP government is in overdrive to probe all crimes that shook the country during the Rajapaksa regime. Minister Bimal Rathnayake has claimed that the Rajapaksas ran what he describes as a \u2018crime raj\u2019. \u2018He that hath an ill-name\u2019 is said to be half-hanged; the Rajapaksas will have their work cut out to counter such allegations against them. Rathnayake\u2019s claim may have struck a responsive chord with the public, given the sheer number of unsolved crimes during the Rajapaksa regime, which was characterised by a culture of impunity. However, other political parties are no better.",
    "Crime and Sri Lankan politics are conjoined twins. Since 1977, when violence came to be institutionalised, all governments have been led by political parties with criminal records. The UNP\u2019s 17-year rule (1977 to 1994) began with the release of a notorious underworld figure, Gonawala Sunil, who had been serving a jail term for raping a teenage girl, from prison on a presidential pardon. The UNP had a powerful underworld army, which attacked the Opposition, suppressed democratic dissent and rigged elections; one of its members, Kalu Lucky, stoned the houses of the Supreme Court judges who dared stand up to President J. R. Jayewardene. Soththi Upali, another underworld figure working for the UNP, terrorised not only ordinary people but also the police, with top cops saluting him in public. Presidents Jayewardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa institutionalised political violence and shielded criminal gangs openly.",
    "Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga came to power, vowing to eliminate state terror and corruption as a national priority, but her government also became corrupt and had an underworld army consisting of the likes of Beddegana Sanjeewa, a contract killer, who was appointed a Reserve Sub Inspector and absorbed into the Presidential Security Division. The SLFP goon squads carried out abductions, extrajudicial killings and attacks on the Opposition besides rigging elections. President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s government had criminals like Wambotta to do its dirty work, and its goons openly operated alongside the police to attack Opposition protests. It was held responsible for some high-profile assassinations such as those of Wasim Thajudeen and Lasantha Wickrematunge.",
    "The Yahapalana government consisted of the UNP and the SLFP\u2014two parties with criminal records. The SLPP is an off-shoot of the SLFP, led by the Rajapaksas, but its government could not flex its underworld muscles because it ruined the economy, causing its leaders to head for the hills, with irate people in close pursuit. The incumbent government is led by the JVP, which committed many crimes, such as murders including political assassinations, armed robberies and arson attacks on public property. One of its hitmen, Lionel Ranasinghe, arrested by the CID confessed to as many as 41 murders including the assassination of Vijaya Kumaratunga during the JVP\u2019s second uprising. His shocking confession has been reproduced verbatim in Dharman Wickremeratne\u2019s book, Comrade Lionel. He was killed by his captors.",
    "Successive governments have had crimes probed selectively to serve their political interests. This practice must be abandoned. All crimes committed by the UNP, the SLFP, the SLPP, the JVP, etc., must be probed. After all, as we pointed out in a previous editorial comment, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, speaking at a ceremony to mark the 159th Police Day, on 03 September, declared that serious crimes were not subject to any statute of limitations and remained prosecutable indefinitely, and his government would ensure that no crime would go unpunished.",
    "Crimes must be investigated in a credible and fair manner. Political leaders should leave such probes to the police without making political statements thereon. The police ought to refrain from acting in such a way that they are seen to be at the beck and call of the ruling party politicians. Worryingly, the current government leaders and some senior police officers give ball-by-ball commentaries, as it were, on ongoing criminal investigations, and their political statements undermine the integrity of those vital probes.",
