    "The state-owned Sevanagala sugar factory remains embroiled in a protracted crisis, with sugarcane farmers and transporters demanding their overdue payments. Farmers\u2019 associations have accused the government of trying to close the sugar factories owned by the state by allowing the country to be flooded with imported sugar at the expense of the local sugar industry. They have also claimed during their recent protests that a large stock of locally produced sugar remains unsold due to imports.",
    "The revenue of the Sevanagala and Pelwatte sugar factories, which are fully owned by the state, can be boosted by increasing the production of ethanol and compost, they have pointed out. The government has taken exception to their claims and blamed its political rivals for fishing in troubled waters.",
    "Meanwhile, fires have ravaged large tracts of sugarcane fields in Sevanagala during the last several days. Farmers and the government are blaming each other for the mystery fires, as it were. Farmers see a political hand behind the fires, while some government politicians have accused farmers of causing fires to \u2018make the harvesting of sugarcane easy\u2019. Farmers have denied this claim.",
    "The Sevanagala sugar factory initially refused to buy scorched sugarcane, but later walked back its decision due to farmers\u2019 protests. Farmers warned that they would not sell their produce to the factory unless it bought the burnt sugarcane. The government gave in to their demand, but farmers have claimed that it is going to pass its losses on to the cultivators by lowering the purchasing price of normal sugarcane.",
    "Why the government is hesitating to absorb the losses the sugarcane farmers have suffered due to fires is understandable. The country has not fully recovered from its rupee crisis; state revenue has to be increased significantly to meet the targets set by the IMF, whose bailout programme has put the government in a financial straitjacket. The Cabinet has decided to close down 33 non-performing state ventures in two phases, according to the Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa.",
    "What is playing out is something neither the NPP nor those who voted for it bargained for. Rice growers are also up in arms, demanding fair prices for their produce. They accuse the government of keeping the purchasing prices of paddy low for the benefit of the large-scale millers who are known to look after the interests of political parties and politicians.",
    "The NPP promised farmers the stars and the moon before elections and they voted for it overwhelmingly, propelling it to power with a steamroller majority in Parliament. But the sobering economic reality has prevented the government from fulfilling some of its key promises. The sugarcane farmers must have expected to be paid their dues forthwith immediately after last year\u2019s regime change. Similarly, paddy farmers must have thought the new government would bring the big-time millers, who have formed a powerful cartel, to heel, and put an end to unscrupulous market manipulations that have facilitated the exploitation of the grower and consumer alike. The government has failed to live up to their expectations, and farmers say they cannot even meet the NPP ministers, who led their protests against previous governments from the front.",
    "Farmers are a force to be reckoned with, and losing their support is a disconcerting proposition for any political party. Farmers were the first to rise against the Gotabaya Rajapkasa government. The JVP-led NPP cannot be unaware of this political reality. But whether it will be able to fulfil its promises and solve the problems the farming community is facing remains to be seen. Most of all, it will have to carry out its pledge to protect and develop local industries.",
