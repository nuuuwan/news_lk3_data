    "Rarely do we get access to how this dark art works and the impact. Recently we did. The public vindication of Dr. Shafi Sihabdeen had been profound and emphatic. There is a backstory to how the media played chorus to vicious racists who attacked him without any justification",
    "This is the big elephant in every Sri Lankan media outfit that we don\u2019t want to acknowledge. Big or small, online or offline, start-up or legacy, it really does not matter. Like we all know where the best spots in the office for the air conditioning, we all know the undercurrents of what flies and what does not.",
    "It could be the politicians that the organisation backs, or may be the editor is chummy with. It may be the bank that provides the steady stream of ads. It could even be the retired sports star we hang out with. There is that line in the sand not to be crossed.",

    "When allegations were levelled against Dr. Sihabdeen in 2019, most of the media became public amplifiers of the fake news cycles created for the benefit of political expediency. Not all though.",
    "Because in the labyrinth of the media house Tharindu worked for then, one editor spoke to another and another to create the hum that running his reporting would detrimental to the newspaper and provoke the ire of the mob. Never mind it was the same mob, the whisperers themselves were part and parcel of",
    "Among the few who followed up on the allegations was Tharindu Jayawardena. I had worked with Jayawardena in the past when he was part of a mentoring program I oversaw. He is a",
    "Tharindu Jayawardena recently said that he had verified most of the details levelled against Dr. Sihabdeen soon after the medical practitioner was arrested as either lies or misleading. He had all the details and the official documents. But he could not get the story published.",
    "hulk of a chap, slow moving but diligent in chasing down the paper trail. He would look into every morsel of information and verify every detail.",
    "It was rare to see such talent and dedication, especially among vernacular journalists. There was more good news as Jayawardena was among a group of young journalists who showed signs that they were willing to put in the hard yards. A bit ideological but that was manageable.",

    "There was even a petition sent by the provincial correspondent from Kurunegala that alleged that Jayawardena was being paid by non-governmental organisations and his reporting was not to be trusted.",
    "His experience is an instance where institutional censorship not only denied the public with a vital voice coming from critical reporting that did not dance to the tune of the political puppeteers. It also derailed the role of\u00a0the press",

    "Instead of being accountable to the public, the media had reneged its role and turned into the marching band for political hooligans.",
    "If this was a one-off incident, even then it would be troubling. It is not one-off, it is endemic. It is like the foul-smelling stench that comes off the public drains. You pretend it is not there, but you know very well its there.",
    "In the past also Jayawardena had felt under pressure inside his newsroom. But he took the advice then that his reach as a national journalist outweighed any desire to quit.",
    "He was pushed out to start his own outlet. Removed from the structured discipline that accompanies a multi-layered media operation ideology takes over. Now his reporting is swayed by activism. His then mentors are no longer active in Sri Lanka.",
    "It is unfortunate to lose talented and dedicated journalism like this. But that is what this evil system does.",
    "At least Jayawardena has the courage to not only pursue the story, but also to name out his distractors. Again, rare in our journalism culture where norms like seniority and dinosaurs chugging through the hallways of media houses discourage such honesty.",
    "More power to those like Jayawardena who are prepared to buck the trend at great personal cost.",
