    "There are only 94 elephants that can parade along streets on perahera processions in the country, and more than 60 of them are over 50 or 60 years old, Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela of the Sri Dalada Maligawa said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said this situation is very critical when looking at the culture of the country. As a result of not receiving tamed elephants, the elephant count will be limited to a maximum of 11 by the year 2040.",
    "Therefore, some procedure should be followed to provide tamed elephants to the elephant breeders to maintain the tamed elephant population.",
    "He said elephants cannot be bred at this time at all because there are no female elephants who are of breeding age. If long and short-term programmes ate not implemented, the country would face a very critical situation.",
    "\"There is no other country in the world using tamed elephants for perahera processions, so this has been a huge challenge for us. Although we criticise ourselves for imposing many ideologies on our society, we are unable to give ourselves chances to change the culture of the country. For that, the use of these tamed elephants is essential,\" he said.",
    "Zoologists and environmentalists cannot create these elephants and tuskers as they want, he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
