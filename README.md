### Licence for indiscipline? Perils of Sri Lanka’s new child rights agenda

The ban immediately undermines the authority of teachers and parents, replacing traditional respect with what is perceived as a permissive legal framework

The amendments to Sri Lanka’s Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO) and the push for a new comprehensive “Compact Act” are being hailed as long-overdue reforms, aligning the nation with international child rights conventions. Yet, beneath the veneer of progress lies a profound anxiety: will these rights-centric laws, particularly the outright ban on corporal punishment and the shift toward rehabilitation, inadvertently dismantle the traditional mechanisms of discipline that underpin Sri Lankan society?

A growing chorus of critics—from concerned parents and overburdened teachers to social conservatives—argues that these reforms are being enacted without adequate preparation, threatening to unleash a wave of juvenile indiscipline that the State is ill-equipped to manage.

Sherry Turkle, the American sociologist, once said: “Technology doesn’t just change what we do; it changes who we are. Online, without empathy and respect, we risk treating people as objects rather than as human beings.”

She said this more than a decade ago, during the golden era of Motorola, Nokia, and Sony Ericsson. Soon after, between 2010 and 2013, the analog lifestyle began to fade. The COVID-19 pandemic, with its lockdowns and social distancing, accelerated this shift. The digital revolution brought us fully online, from emails and social media to automation and AI. More than ever before, we began to socialise, share, comment, like, and dislike in a screen-mediated world.

### Leading with authenticity and accountability: Insights and impacts

Leadership is often misunderstood as positions and titles without referring to decisions and actions. One common complaint around the globe is that the so-called leaders give lame excuses to avoid accountability of their own actions. It also shows the need for authenticity in required actions. It may be true not only for political leaders but of leaders representing all walks of life. Today’s column reflects on leadership lessons associated with authenticity and accountability.

Authenticity refers to being genuine in showing the real you. When applied to leadership, it involves acting with sincerity, integrity, and transparency. It also includes practicing of one’s core values in setting an example to his/her team members. Authentic leaders emphasise ethicality in inspiring, influencing and initiating. They are high in demand in a world where principles are compromised for privileges.

Sri Lanka has to develop its economy in order to provide a fair, equitable, healthy, knowledgeable and dignified lifestyle for its citizens and its future generations

Sri Lanka GDP growth rate needs to rise above 8% over 10 years to achieve a GDP of $ 200 million and a GDP per capita of $ 9,000 to qualify as an upper middle-class status. A high-income status requires a per capita of $ 13,846 or more. Can Sri Lanka achieve these targets?

Singapore’s projected GDP will be $ 900 billion in 10 years with a per capita of $ 130,000. Sri Lanka must decide where it wishes to be in 10 years

Embedding sustainability in business models for future-proofing Sri Lankan enterprises

Sustainability has emerged as one of the most critical strategic imperatives of our era, particularly in nations acutely exposed, with economies closely tied to delicate natural and social ecosystems. Sri Lanka, with its rich agricultural exports and thriving apparel sector, finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. As we approach tangible evidence of sustainability progress from both nations and corporates, Sri Lankan enterprises must recognise that the foundations they lay today will determine their ability to respond credibly to these demands.

Reduction in labour demand from rubber industry a significant 15.6% in event of non-compliance

Shift from compliance to competitiveness needs to be national political choice

Leading industry experts last week underscored the urgency of strategic collaborations to support exporters, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), to navigate challenges and help them remain competitive in the European market.

They emphasised that if Sri Lanka’s struggling exports are to transform from challenge to opportunity, compliance needs to be tapped as a unique selling proposition (USP).

These and other useful insights were shared at a program jointly hosted by Verité Research and the EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives under the theme ‘From Compliance to Competitiveness – Securing Sri Lanka’s Place in the Global Market.’

He explained that while some former Presidents have voluntarily returned vehicles previously allocated for their security, such matters are separate from the repealed law.

Wijepala added that providing protection for former presidents remains a State responsibility. He noted that if any requests are made for security vehicles or other assistance, the Government is prepared to supply the required resources.

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) yesterday launched a new digital Case Tracking System aimed at improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability.

CIABOC Chairman Justice Neil Iddawala described the new platform as “a transformative step” that goes beyond a mere technological upgrade. He said the system represents a major shift in how the Commission manages and processes information, records, and case files central to its work.

“Corruption thrives where there is opacity, delay, and inefficiency. Transparency and accountability are the strongest deterrents,” Justice Iddawala said, calling the new system “an instrument of reform” that will strengthen public trust.

The Case Tracking System integrates automation and centralised digital recordkeeping to improve accuracy, enable real-time case monitoring, and streamline workflows. It also introduces data-driven decision-making tools to enhance institutional performance.

### Jaffna lawyers protest Police action

*2025-10-08 05:37:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Jaffna-lawyers-protest-Police-action/56-782690) · `en`

Lawyers in Jaffna yesterday staged a strike to protest what they described as an illegal search carried out by Police at the residence of a fellow attorney without court authorisation.

The protest followed an incident on Sunday in which police officers reportedly entered the home of a lawyer accused of involvement in land deed fraud and conducted a search in an attempt to arrest him. The search was allegedly conducted without a court warrant or prior judicial approval.

The incident comes amid ongoing police investigations into several lawyers suspected of participating in land deed fraud cases in the Jaffna area.

In response, members of the legal community gathered outside the Jaffna courts to condemn what they called a violation of legal procedure and professional rights.

Lawyers facing related allegations are expected to submit anticipatory bail applications to court today to prevent possible arrests.

Sri Lanka Police have issued a public warning about an increase in online scams being carried out through popular messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp.

Once the information is obtained, the fraudsters block the original owners from their accounts and use them to carry out further scams.

Investigations have revealed that these criminals often lure victims by offering fake job opportunities and requesting payments under various pretexts.

The Police urged the public to exercise caution when responding to unsolicited messages or offers circulated through social media groups, even if they appear to come from known contacts or familiar platforms.

Worldwide war crimes have been imposed on military officers such as Vasantha Karanagoda, Shavendra Silva and Kamal Gunaratne and have imposed sanctions against them.. But why not the international ban on Sarath Fonseka, the then military commander who killed Prabhakaran? Former President Mahinda Rajapakse's spokesman Manoj Kamage questioned.

He further stated this at a press conference held at the PA office in Colombo on Tuesday (7).

Sarath Fonseka has said a few things with great excitement and hatred. In it he mentioned my name. He must learn about two animals who want to teach Sarath Fonseka: one animal lion, the other is Devang. Sarath Fonseka must realize the biggest difference between the lion and the Deva.

Whether the lion is old or sick, it will never eat grass. But although Devang is generally known to be a meat -eating animal, some Devangs eat bark. There are opportunities that go becoming a dog. But I would like to tell Sarath Fonseka the fact that the lion will never be a dog.
