  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed federal prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation into allegations that members of Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration manufactured intelligence on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.",
    "The Justice Department said late last month it was forming a strike force to assess claims made by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard about \u201calleged weaponization of the U.S. intelligence community.\u201d",
    "Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has leaped on comments from Gabbard in which she threatened to refer Obama administration officials to the Justice Department for prosecution over an intelligence assessment of Russian interference.",
    "Fox News first reported that Bondi personally ordered an unnamed federal prosecutor to initiate legal proceedings and the prosecutor is expected to present department evidence to a grand jury, which could consider an indictment if the Justice Department pursued a criminal case. The report cited a letter from Bondi and a source. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment.",
    "Referring to the probe in a post on Truth Social, Trump said: \u201cThe TRUTH always wins out. This is great news.\u201d",
    "Last month, Trump accused Obama of treason, alleging, without providing evidence, that the Democrat led an effort to falsely tie him to Russia and undermine his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump won the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
    "A spokesperson for Obama had denounced Trump\u2019s claims, saying \u201cthese bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\u201d",
    "Gabbard had declassified documents and said the information she released showed a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d in 2016 by top Obama officials to undermine Trump, claims that Democrats called false and politically motivated.",
    "An assessment by the U.S. intelligence community published in January 2017 concluded that Russia, using social media disinformation, hacking, and Russian bot farms, sought to damage Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and bolster Trump, who won that election.",
    "The assessment determined the actual impact was likely limited and showed no evidence that Moscow\u2019s efforts actually changed voting outcomes. Russia has denied it attempted to interfere in U.S. elections."
