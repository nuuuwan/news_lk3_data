    "NEW DELHI (AFP): India\u2019s capital will catch, sterilise and hide thousands of stray dogs roaming its streets as part of a campaign to clean up the megacity before it hosts next month\u2019s G20 summit.",
    "New Delhi\u2019s municipal government plans to use nets to trap the canines from dozens of locations including around boutique hotels and some of the city\u2019s most impressive monuments and tourist hotspots, such as the 17th century Red Fort. On Thursday authorities directed city employees to begin rounding up dogs for transport to local animal sterilisation centres \u201cdue to the G20 summit\u201d.",
    "\u201cAll stray dogs picked up from these locations shall be kept... for their further care and feeding till the programme is over,\u201d the order said.",
    "The Delhi metropolitan area, home to around 30 million people, has been on an intense beautification drive since India assumed the G20 presidency last year.",
    "Authorities have cleared illegal slums near summit venues and revamped major arterial routes on the city\u2019s gridlocked roads ahead of September\u2019s summit, which will host leaders of the world\u2019s top economies. More than 60,000 stray dogs live on Delhi\u2019s streets according to India\u2019s Livestock Census of 2012, the most recent available government figures.",
    "Sterilisation campaigns have been regularly employed by local authorities to keep the canine population in check, though dog packs remain present in parks and residential neighbourhoods around the city.",
    "\u201cThese government people take them away to do sterilisation then bring them back again,\u201d Mohmmad Irfan, a shopkeeper based near the city\u2019s Jama Masjid mosque, told AFP. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a permanent solution.\u201d\u00a0 Many of Delhi\u2019s strays are beloved by their adopted neighbourhoods despite lacking formal owners, with some dogs clothed in special canine jackets to keep warm during the city\u2019s harsh winters. But they are also a hazard to humans, with local media regularly reporting on the mauling of young children by aggressive dog packs across the country.",
    "In 2018, angry villagers killed 13 stray dogs in Uttar Pradesh state after three children under the age of 12 were mauled to death on the same day.",
    "Roughly 17 million dog bites are reported across India each year and the World Health Organisation says that nearly 20,000 people nationwide die of rabies annually.",
    "Delhi\u2019s relocation plan risked dangerously agitating the dogs, Meet Ashar of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) told AFP.",
    "\u201cThey are not used to being handled and picked up with nets and being transported,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe next time they are approached by a human being, perhaps they could react in a defensive manner out of fear. \u201c"
