  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved calling for Expressions of Interest (EoIs) and technical proposals from local manufacturers for the supply of medicines and other medical equipment for 2026, continuing efforts to boost domestic pharmaceutical production.",
    "Addressing the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the decision follows the appraisal of local manufacturers earlier this year, which led to the selection of 24 companies through a process overseen by a committee appointed by the Health Ministry Secretary.",
    "\u201cThese manufacturers were contracted to supply 130 essential medicines and medical supplies for 2025, with agreements due to expire on 31 December 2025,\u201d he added. To ensure continuity in the local procurement program and to meet the country\u2019s pharmaceutical needs in 2026, he said the Health Ministry will once again invite EoIs and technical proposals from eligible local suppliers.",
    "The move also aligns with the Government\u2019s broader policy of promoting local industry and reducing reliance on imports for essential healthcare needs.",
    "The proposal to this effect submitted by Health Minister Dr. Jayatissa was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers."
