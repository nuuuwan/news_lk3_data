    "Sri Lanka men\u2019s cricket team fielding coach, Anton Roux, announced that he is stepping down from his position.",
    "Roux, a former South African first-class cricketer and former coach of the Netherlands, took on the role with Sri Lanka in March 2022.",
    "\u201cOn the 14th of August 2024, I decided to step down from my role as the National Fielding Coach for Sri Lanka Cricket. This week will be my last with SLC as I finish my handover. It has been an immense honour and a truly humbling experience to serve the Sri Lankan national cricket team. I will forever cherish the memories and experiences that came with this journey.\u201d",
    "\u201cWitnessing the resilience and unity of the Sri Lankan people during times of crisis, especially during the incredible series win against Australia on home soil, was a testament to what this nation, and team, can achieve when it comes together. The electric atmosphere, the passion of the fans, and the triumphs on the field will remain etched in my memory,\u201d wrote Roux in a post on LinkedIn.",
    "It means the third and final Test at the Oval, where Sri Lanka beat England by eight wickets at the Oval, as the visitors\u2019 claimed their maiden win in the longer format over the hosts in a decade, was Roux\u2019s final international game in the national fielding coach role.",
    "He further talked about being a witness to what all Sri Lanka achieved in his tenure as a fielding coach. \u201cReaching two Asia Cup finals, and ultimately winning the 2022 Asia T20 Cup, was a spectacular achievement that demonstrated the true potential of this team. Bringing that trophy back to Sri Lanka and seeing the joy it brought to the fans is something I will cherish for a long time.",
    "\u201cI also had the privilege of spending a short period of time with the Sri Lanka Women\u2019s Cricket Team, and I was deeply impressed by their hunger to learn, passion to play and compete, and their athletic ability in the field.",
    "\u201cThey have grown from strength to strength and have become a beacon of hope and inspiration for women in Sri Lanka. Their progress has been remarkable, and I have no doubt that they will continue to achieve great things in the future.\u201d",
    "Roux also expressed gratitude to the people who made his life in Sri Lanka unforgettable. \u201cSri Lanka has also become a part of my family\u2019s story. It is the country of birth for my second son, Aiden, and the love and care we received at Joseph Fraser Hospital in Colombo will always be a fond memory and a lasting connection to this beautiful country.\u201d"
