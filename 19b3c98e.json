    "Japan\u2019s SLIM space probe has entered the moon\u2019s orbit in a major step towards the country\u2019s first successful lunar landing, expected next month.",
    "The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) is nicknamed the \u201cMoon Sniper\u201d because it is designed to land within 100 metres (328 feet) of a specific target on the lunar surface.",
    "If successful, the touchdown would make Japan only the fifth country to have successfully landed a probe on the Moon, after the United States, Russia, China and India.",
    "On Monday, SLIM \u201csuccessfully entered the moon\u2019s orbit at 04.51pm Japan time\u201d, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said in a statement.",
    "\u201cIts trajectory shift was achieved as originally planned, and there is nothing out of the ordinary about the probe\u2019s conditions,\u201d the agency said.",
    "The lander\u2019s descent towards the moon is expected to start around midnight Japan time on January 20, with its landing on the surface scheduled for 20 minutes later, JAXA said.",
    "The H-IIA rocket lifted off in September from the southern island of Tanegashima carrying the lander, after three postponements linked to bad weather.",
    "JAXA said this month that the mission would be an \u201cunprecedentedly high precision landing\u201d on the Moon.",
    "The lander is equipped with a spherical probe that was developed with a toy company. Slightly bigger than a tennis ball, it can change its shape to move on the lunar surface.",
    "Compared to previous probes that landed \u201ca few or 10-plus kilometres\u201d away from targets, SLIM\u2019s purported margin of error of under 100 metres suggests a level of accuracy once thought impossible, thanks to the culmination of a 20-year effort by researchers, according to JAXA.",
    "With the advance of technology, demand is growing to pinpoint targets like craters and rocks on the lunar surface, Shinichiro Sakai, JAXA\u2019s SLIM project manager, told reporters this month.",
    "\u201cGone are the days when merely exploring \u2018somewhere on the moon\u2019 was desired,\u201d he said.",
    "Hopes are also high that SLIM\u2019s exactitude will make sampling of lunar permafrost easier, bringing scientists a step closer to uncovering the mystery around water resources on the moon, Sakai added.",
    "Japanese missions have failed twice \u2013 one public and one private.",
    "Last year, the country unsuccessfully sent a lunar probe named Omotenashi as part of the United States\u2019 Artemis 1 mission.",
    "In April, Japanese start-up ispace tried in vain to become the first private company to land on the Moon, losing communication with its craft after what it described as a \u201chard landing\u201d."
