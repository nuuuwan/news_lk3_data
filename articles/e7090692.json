    "SLT-Mobitel said yesterday it has successfully landed the SEA-ME-WE 6 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 6) submarine cable in Matara, on 29 December 2024, achieving a historic breakthrough in Sri Lanka\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure.",
    "The cable system will be in commercial operation by mid-2026, it added.",
    "The Matara landing was completed in collaboration with Subcom LLC, USA, and under an agreement with SEA-ME-WE 6 Consortium including Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, as the legal signatory to the consortium, further strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s position in global connectivity.",
    "The landing operation was overseen by key SLT-Mobitel officials including SLT Chief Operating Officer Prabhath Ambegoda, General Manager \u2013 Projects Nalaka Siriwardhana, General Manager \u2013 Transport Networks Buddhi Manage, and Deputy General Manager \u2013 Network Infrastructure Projects Rohan Ashton and the SLT Operational Team.",
    "The 21,700 km SEA-ME-WE 6 submarine cable connects Singapore to France through key points across Asia and the Middle East. Built with advanced fibre optic technology, it delivers 130 Tbps of high-speed, low-latency connectivity. As a consortium partner, SLT\u2019s connection to the network enhances Sri Lanka\u2019s global digital infrastructure and meets growing connectivity demands across Europe, Middle East, and South Asia. Moreover, the accomplishment of the SEA-ME-WE 6 landing represents a significant step forward in SLT-Mobitel\u2019s mission to enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s digital infrastructure and global connectivity capabilities.",
    "Notably, environmental sustainability remained a top priority throughout the project. SLT-Mobitel worked closely with Government departments and local authorities to secure an environmentally conscious landing route. The marine path was carefully selected following comprehensive environmental assessments and strict adherence to marine protection policies. The company utilised existing infrastructure to minimise environmental impact when connecting the submarine cable to the Matara landing station.",
    "The latest addition complements SLT-Mobitel\u2019s existing global connectivity infrastructure, which includes SEA-ME-WE 4, and 5, as well as the Bharat-Lanka and Dhiraagu cables, while noting the retirement of the SEA-ME-WE 3 from service. The company aims to continue to invest in submarine cable systems, reinforcing a commitment to delivering uninterrupted, superior global connectivity services to customers.",
    "SLT-Mobitel said its integration with the advanced network enhances Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy capabilities, facilitating seamless communication between Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia. The strategic development addresses growing customer demands while positioning Sri Lanka as a vital hub in the global telecommunications."
