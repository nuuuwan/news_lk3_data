    "The launch event, which took place recently at the Shangri-La Colombo, ushered in a new era of smart, connected healthcare in Sri Lanka.",

Patients will now receive interactive, easy-to-understand, and visually rich diagnostic reports \u2013 personalised to their health status and powered by real-time AI analysis. From detecting early warning signs to helping clinicians prioritise care, the new platform provides a 360-degree view of a patient\u2019s health profile, making healthcare smarter, faster, and more empowering for all.",
