    "The stock market indicated a downward trend yesterday because local and foreign investors are anticipating interest rates to remain unchanged at the Central Bank\u2019s monthly policy review meeting scheduled for today. Consequently, selling pressure was noted and retail participation was relatively low, market analysts said.",
    "Amid those developments mixed reactions in the indices were noted. All Share Price Index went down by 26.62 while S and P SL20 rose by 1.4 points. Turnover stood at Rs 1.28 billion with four crossings.",

    "In the retail market top seven companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; JKH Rs 83.9 million (441,000 shares traded), ACL Cables Rs 78.2 million (933,000 shares traded), Vallibel One Rs 75.3 million (1.5 million shares traded), First Capital Treasuries Rs 53.3 million (1.8 million shares traded), Capital Alliance Rs 51.3 million (959,000 shares traded), Agarapathana Plantations Rs 39.1 million (5.2 million shares traded) and NTB Rs 34.4 million (328,000 shares traded).

    "Yesterday the rupee opened at Rs 302.80/303.00 to the US dollar in the spot forex market, stronger from 303.30/45 last Friday, dealers said, while bond yields were broadly steady. A bond maturing on 15.12.2026 was quoted at 11.20/40 percent from 11.30/38 percent. A bond maturing on 15.12.2028 was quoted at 12.10/20 percent from 12.10/18 percent.",
