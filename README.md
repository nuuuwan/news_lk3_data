### UN Security Council demands immediate ceasefire in Gaza after US abstains

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Monday demanded an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages after the United States abstained from the vote.

The remaining 14 council members voted for the resolution, which was proposed by the 10 elected members of the body.

Washington had been averse to the word ceasefire earlier in the nearly six-month-old war in the Gaza Strip and had used its veto power to shield U.S. ally Israel as it retaliated against Hamas for an Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people.

But amid growing global pressure for a truce in the war that has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, the U.S. abstained from the vote on Monday to allow the Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire for the month of Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends in two weeks.

### Sri Lanka central bank cuts rates 50 basis points to 9.50-pct

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has cut its policy corridor by 50 basis points to 8.50 percent (floor) and 9.50 percent (ceiling) citing stable external conditions and low inflation.

Subdued aggregate demand , the lesser-than-expected impact of the recent SriLanka taxes, cut in electricity prices, well-anchored inflation expectations and the absence of excessive external sector pressures made the rate cut possible, the central bank said in its March monetary policy statement.

The central bank itself by allowing the exchange rate to appreciate in the wake of deflationary policy has helped mitigate the effect of a valued added tax hike on traded goods, and also made possible an electricity price cut, analysts say.

Sri Lanka central bank mainly responsible for electricity price cut: Minister

Since external monetary stability was restored by the central bank in September 2022, index measured inflation in Sri Lanka had increased by only 5.9 percent over 17 months.

### Issues facing Inland Revenue Department in tax collection

The IRD has encountered significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets. As of October 2023, the IRD collected 82% of the projected revenue, amounting to Rs. 740 billion out of an expected Rs. 908 billion.

The slowdown in collection was particularly noticeable in the second half of the year, attributed to the Central Bank’s interest rate policy directive in August, which impacted corporate tax inflow. Financial institutions, which are major contributors to corporate taxes, have been affected by the monetary policy, leading to a shortfall in Government revenue.

The IRD set ambitious targets for corporate taxes at Rs. 603 billion and non-corporate taxes at Rs. 305 billion for 2023. By October, 77% of the corporate taxes and 91% of the non-corporate taxes were collected.

The 2024 Budget aims to increase tax revenue to Rs. 4 trillion, up from Rs. 3 trillion in 2023, with a significant portion expected from taxes on income and profit.

“The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists” – Ernest Hemingway

After concluding its review on SL’s economic progress during last year and commending the regime for its “unwavering commitment to the program’s implementation”, the IMF review commission has recommended the release of the next tranche of $ 337 million to bring it to a total $ 1 billion since March 2023, but with a reminder that “sustaining the reform momentum and addressing governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities are critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth”. What this means is that lasting recovery is not possible unless there is going to be a system change.

Whilst efforts to protect the environment must be lauded, however, the statement added the European Union had agreed on a ban, with Belgium and Netherlands already putting the ban in place. This is a complete misrepresentation of the truth. It once again spotlights organisations lobbying Government for regulatory changes bandying misinformation that ultimately impacts much larger value chains and the public.

When I was told about The UNSTOPPABLE Band, what first came to mind was UNSTOPPABLE! Why such a name! And then the explanation came my way from the group’s female vocalist, and manager, Nicola Andrea.

She said the members of this outfit, before they teamed up, found the going pretty tough in the scene here. There were obstacles to overcome and when they decided to join forces, as one unit, they were adamant that nothing would STOP them from achieving their goals…and it was Nicola who came up with the name UNSTOPPABLE.

This five-piece outfit comprises Malintha Peiris (lead guitar and leader), Nicola Andrea (vocals and manager), AJ Stefan (rhythm guitar and vocals), Janiru Fernando (drums) and Valenteno Lenora (bass).
