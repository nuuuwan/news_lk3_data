Apply the mask all over dry hair, focusing on your ends and also applying to your scalp. Leave the mask on for one hour, and then wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner, as usual.",
    "On clean skin, take one slice of your orange and gently rub it on your skin.

Keep the juice on your face for 10 minutes while you enjoy a glass of juice or your orange \u2013 got to get those vitamins inside for glowing skin and a good immune boost \u2013 then rinse your face with water and apply any serums and moisturisers.",
