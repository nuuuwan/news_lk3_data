    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Objections raised by a parliamentary committee to the proposed sale of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) on national security grounds hold no water and have no basis in historical fact, according to former Director General of Telecommunications Prof Rohan Samarajiva.",
    "Speaking to EconomyNext on Friday June 09, Samarajiva said the concerns raised by the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security displays an ignorance of the history of Sri Lanka\u2019s telecommunications sector as well as developments in the region.",
    "Government MP Sarath Weerasekara who chairs committee in question told parliament Friday June 09 morning that divestment of the 49.5 percent stake in SLT held by the government could \u201cexpose the country\u2019s strategic communication infrastructure and sensitive information to private companies that are motivated by profit, which could pose a threat to national security\u201d.",
    "The claim came despite satellite links and international cables connecting the country being built and managed by foreign conglomerates in which many connected countries are also shareholders. The committee will not recommend a sell down of shares, the MP said, adding that any individual or organisation proscribed or otherwise that \u201caided terrorists or extremists\u201d must not be allowed to purchase shares or control Sri Lanka\u2019s national assets.",
    "Weerasekara also suggested that the government retain the right to repurchase shares held by the majority shareholder of SLT whose second biggest shareholder is Malaysia-based Usaha Tegas Sdn Bhd with a 44.9 percent stake in the company.",
    "Most of Sri Lanka\u2019s mobile firms were also built and owned not just by private firms but foreign ones. SLT\u2019s own mobile network, Mobitel, was a build-operate-transfer project by Australia\u2019s Telstra.",

    "According to Samarajiva, trade unions had made the same arguments in 1989 when the then government mooted privatising SLT, which was a corporation at the time. The unions, he said, even managed to persuade then Minister of National Security Lalith Athulathmudali that selling SLT would pose a national security threat.",
    "By 1997 when the war between government security forces and the separatist Tamil Tigers was raging, the professor said, the \u2018national security\u2019 argument no longer had any weight.",
    "\u201cNot only did we privatise the company, but we also gave complete management control to the minority investor,\u201d he said, referring to the 35 percent stake sold to the Tokyo-based Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) group.",
    "The Japanese company would go on to hold management control of SLT for several years.",
    "\u201cThis was in the middle of a war and nothing untoward happened. If these fears were true, something bad should\u2019ve happened, but it didn\u2019t,\u201d said Samarajiva, recalling the new connections and parallel developments that were taking place through competition.",
    "He noted that, prior to privatisation, the state-owned corporation had in fact been \u201cextremely neglectful\u201d of national security-related vulnerabilities.",
    "SLT\u2019s entire international gateway at the time had continued to be located on Lotus Road, the site of more than one bomb blast, with no backup nor restoration capabilities. Samarajiva said that upon his directives as Telecommunications DG, the Japanese company was quick to create a backup facility so that, in the event of a security incident, the operations could be quickly resumed from another location.",
    "\u201cNow that is a concrete threat to national security, and we can see how state ownership dealt with it and how private ownership with regulation dealt with it,\u201d he said.",
    "Samarajiva also invited parties concerned about national security purportedly posed by SLT\u2019s proposed privatisation to consider international examples. Australia, which has concerns about Chinese infiltration, for instance, does not have a state-owned provider, while military-run Pakistan has privatised its fixed line operator.",
    "One way to address national security concerns, according to Prof Samarajiva, is to ensure the stringent functioning of SLT\u2019s management and to ensure resource adequacy for investments for backup facilities and the like. Additionally, the Data Protection Act has provisions that could deal with any concerns regarding records purportedly being used by foreign entities.",
    "Appointments to key positions of the company could be not only Sri Lankan citizens but have gone through a strict security clearance process and are party to agreements and mandates that are in line with the country\u2019s national security objectives.",
    "He added that what exactly constitutes a \u2018national security concern\u2019 must be established first.",
    "\u201cA specific example would be the international gateway, which is a software based facility, in a place where there is no backup and no restoration capabilities. That to me is a national security concern,\u201d he said.",
    "The professor said that he would be happy to work with anybody to address national security concerns of that nature. With regard to records, he said, special safeguards can be put in place in addition to protections provided by the new Data Protection Act.",
    "\u201cNational security is not a slogan. National security takes specific forms. Most people who talk about national security talk about it as a slogan; but people like me, who have thought about it, will talk about its operationalised forms,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jun09/2023)"
