The emphasis was not only on aesthetics but also on functionality and compliance with international standards.",

These sessions facilitated a dynamic exchange of ideas, ensuring that the final packaging solutions were not only innovative but also aligned with the specific requirements of the European market.",
    "The culmination of this program took place at the Design Code 2023 event, where the students of University of Moratuwa presented the developed packaging solutions. The four-day event provided a platform for SMEs to witness the unveiling of their enhanced packaging designs, fostering a collaborative environment and knowledge exchange.",

By leveraging academic expertise and industry insights, the program not only enhances the packaging capabilities of participated SMEs but also positions Sri Lanka as a hub for innovative and sustainable packaging practices.
