    "Uma Oya multipurpose development project is the largest since the end of the Mahaweli projects",
    "Sri Lanka-Iran ties began long ago as 1961 when the latter had an embassy in Islamabad and over the years, Iran has funded a number of development projects in Sri Lankaining financial help from Israel\u2019s enemy Iran for development work",
    "Iran, like other ambitious nations, would want to sow seeds of their interests here in this island, as no nation with military might would wish to see their interests being absent in a country which is followed by so many nations in the world",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s latest news in the international scene is generated with its dealings with Iran, a nation considered as a super power in tactical ballistic missiles and UAVs. Iran\u2019s President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi was in the island on Wednesday (April 24) to declare open the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project along with Ranil Wickremesinghe, the President of Sri Lanka.",
    "Now, the people of this country are wondering why the first citizen of Iran was invited here for this opening ceremony. Iran has been supporting this project since 2010 with an assurance of over US$ 450 million, made back then, to get the project started. Uma Oya is a venture that\u2019ll feed the irrigation system and support as much as 15,000 acres of paddy land during both Yala and Maha seasons.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition is criticising government moves taken in the past to twice open this project. This is the third opening of the project in an effort taken by the state to hand the project over for the use of the public.",
    "Sri Lanka is a country which is now open to the world and cannot that easily shun the attention given to it by other countries. Sri Lanka-Iran ties began long ago as 1961 when the latter had an embassy in Islamabad. Over the years, Iran has funded a number of development projects in Sri Lanka. Iran has also, over the years, invested on oil refineries here; which ventures have boosted Sri Lanka\u2019s oil production by two-fold.",
    "Iran, like other ambitious nations, would want to sow seeds of their interests here in this island. No nation, with military might, would wish to see their interests being absent in a country which is followed by so many nations in the world; all done from the perspective of spreading their military tentacles in an island recognised as being so important on the Indian Ocean sea route.",
    "Sri Lanka needs to be careful in pursuing its international relations. This is because a wrong message carried to the outside world can tarnish already existing ties with other nations. Over the last decade, ambitious Sri Lankans have been immigrating to countries like China, USA, Australia and even Israel in search of employment. Just before the Uma Oya project, Sri Lanka had concerns because the focus was on the safety of Sri Lankans working in Israel farms. This is because Iran is at present engaged in a conflict with Israel. Iran has been accused of firing missiles into Israel territory. According to agency press reports, this attack is in response to Israel bombing Iran\u2019s consulate in Damascus, Syria.",
    "The Government of Sri Lanka never took a strong stand in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. This is despite there being a sizeable Muslim population in this island and these followers of the Quran going to the extent of carrying banners on some days, after Friday Prayers, supporting the Palestine cause and praying for their safety. At present, some portions of Palestine resemble a mass grave following ruthless bombings by Israel.",
    "So what would confuse Sri Lankans is why this government takes the best out of both worlds; this is in terms of sending the island\u2019s workers to Israel and then gaining financial help from Israel\u2019s enemy Iran for development work. One must be aware of the fact that Israel has strong allies in the likes of Britain, France, Jordan and the United States of America who are backing the former\u2019s \u2018war in Gaza\u2019. On the other hand, these four nations also have healthy ties with Sri Lanka.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s statesmen must have the acumen to maintain healthy foreign relations with countries that matter when taking into account the interest and future of this island nation. Many years ago, when this island was under the tenure of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, it had a close and cordial relationship and even the support of its closest neighbour India. The arrogant politician and Sri Lanka\u2019s first ever Executive President J.R. Jayewardene changed that when he fell out of favour with the Gandhi family. Subsequently, when the civil war broke out in Sri Lanka, it came as no surprise when Tiger rebels were comforted and nurtured by the Tamil Nadu Government. Having relations with other nations and even using them is fine, till a war breaks out and such a volatile condition forces you to take a side. War experts are predicting more nations being drawn into the Iran-Israel conflict. The Russian-Ukraine conflict is also simmering at the moment and Sri Lanka has its dealings with Russia as well.",
    "Iran\u2019s President Dr. Raisi was here in the island for other reasons as well. Dr. Raisi is expected to sign five MOUs with the Government of Sri Lanka to boost bilateral relations between the two nations. The first citizen of Iran and his contingent landed at the Mattala International Airport, in Hambantota. These Iranians only have to check Sri Lanka\u2019s recent history to get goose bumps. During President Sirisena\u2019s tenure, the Mattala Airport, which was built by the Mahinda Rajapakse regime, was turned into a warehouse to store paddy. Interestingly, the Iranian funded Uma Oya project supports paddy cultivation. Sri Lanka must get its priorities right and learn to take a stance on global matters and with whom it will forge international relations. Sri Lanka can no longer play balancing games with some of the nations it is already dealing with because \u2018war experts\u2019 predict a slow build-up to a potential hostile world; this is if the words \u2018world war III\u2019 are extremely harsh words to use in this column."
