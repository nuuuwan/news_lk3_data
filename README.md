### Sajith Premadasa presents social democratic, progressive-centrist alternative; Namal goes Rahul

*2024-08-15 03:56:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sajith-Premadasa-presents-social-democratic-progressive-centrist-alternative-Namal-goes-Rahul/4-765546) · `en`

“Sri Lankans are more likely to think the country is headed in the wrong direction than people in any other country where this is polled. In June–July 2024, a global average of 62% of adults polled by IPSOS in 29 countries thought their country was headed in the wrong direction compared with 93% in Sri Lanka.”

With only 8% of citizens thinking that the country is going in the right direction and 72% thinking it is “on the wrong track”, it would be borderline lunacy to assume that Ranil, ably supported by the most detested parliamentarians since 1970-77, could get into double-digits in September. “…Public views towards the country’s direction have worsened since July 2023, driven by a steady decline in uncommitted respondents.” (Ibid)

Assuming that the 21 September Presidential election would be held as scheduled, the two most challenging issues facing the winner would be to reform Sri Lanka’s moribund system of governance and renegotiate with IMF parts of its economic reparation agenda so that the local economy could be put on sound footing to withstand the negative effects from turbulence from outside. Governance and economy are inseparable twins and no economic model or development plan could succeed when governments that are responsible to implement them remain corrupt and incompetent.

Ukraine said on Wednesday its forces had advanced further into Russia’s Kursk region in the biggest foreign incursion into Russia since World War Two, posing a dilemma for President Vladimir Putin according to U.S. President Joe Biden.

Thousands of Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of Aug. 6 into Russia’s western Kursk region in what Putin called a major provocation aimed at gaining a stronger hand in possible future ceasefire talks.

Ukraine has carved out a slice of the Russian border region of Kursk and though Putin said the Russian army would push out the Ukrainian troops, more than a week of intense battles have so far failed to oust them.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s forces were continuing to gain ground in the Kursk region and that they had taken another one to two kilometres on Wednesday.

### Our choice is Ranil Wickremesinghe;He is the one who bravely declares that the 13th Amendment should continue and practice it - Ali Sabri

*2024-08-14 17:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191086) · `ta`

In the midst of Sri Lanka's political climate, the focus shifts towards Ranil Wickremesinghe, praised for his bravery in advocating for the continuation and implementation of the 13th Amendment, a stance considered bold amidst the pre-presidential election dynamics. Despite historical political differences, the emphasis is on addressing current challenges, particularly economic ones, rather than adhering strictly to party lines. Wickremesinghe is highlighted for his experience and potential to navigate the complexities of governance, including economic management and foreign relations. The decision by the Sri Lanka PA to field its own candidate is noted, with internal support leaning towards Wickremesinghe due to his leadership in initiating economic recovery efforts. The majority of the Sri Lanka PA's MPs have chosen Wickremesinghe, indicating a significant alignment within the party. Criticisms from Namal Rajapaksa are acknowledged as part of democratic discourse, while Wickremesinghe's suitability in fostering a common Sri Lankan identity is underscored through his track record of addressing issues affecting the common good. The upcoming election is anticipated to feature strong contenders, with the outcome to be determined by the voters on September 21st.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe is brave enough that the 13th Amendment should continue and implement it. It is impossible to report this in Sri Lanka's political environment before the presidential election. External Affairs and Justice Minister Ali Sabri said that this is the most difficult issue, saying that Ranil Wickremesinghe is very relevant in our choices.

Question - What are your feelings about campaigning in favor of someone who has worked against you throughout your political life?

Answer - This is a part of politics. It is necessary to examine the current challenges and priority to the country than to be stubborn about parties and political leaders.

So what is important in this moment. Especially economics.

We must choose someone who can face these challenges. Because of this I choose him.

Question - You have consistently stated that it is the most important thing to strengthen the country's stability. Do you not think that anyone like Dhammika can help at this moment?
