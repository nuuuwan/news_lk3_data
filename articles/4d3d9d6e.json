    "Chartered accountant-turned- author Hafiz Sheriff announced the launch of his second book, \u201cCharacter\u201d, which will be released worldwide on the 15th of August 2025 by Austin Macaulay Publishers (U.K). Offering a sharp and thought-provoking exploration of values and how they shape the human experience, the book arrives at a pivotal moment in world history.",
    "Sheriff is a keen observer of current events and an accomplished thinker on how they shape the march of civilization. For Character, he was inspired by the recent emergence of hard-right, authoritarian leaders around the world. In particular, he references the re-election of Donald Trump in the 2024 US Presidential Election as a key moment that compelled him to explore the true meaning of character, highlighting qualities that he does not believe are embodied by President Trump. In the book, Sheriff positions Trump in contrast to the legendary American president Abraham Lincoln, which he hopes will strike a chord with the American people.",
    "Character is written for any reader seeking to embody the values that define truly remarkable figures throughout history. Sheriff draws from his experience meeting figures from all walks of life as the CEO of an apparel company operating across Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Hong Kong to explain how everyone can embody these traits. The stories are grounded in his deep interest and research on world history and psychology, offering readers a compelling guide to cultivate character in their own everyday lives.",
    "A prolific writer, Sheriff\u2019s books explore the themes of humanity and the choices we make (and those we could make) and how these affect us and those around us. His \u2018no holds barred\u2019 writing style has become popular with those that want to do better and step into their full power as strong, confident leaders in their communities and organizations. Sheriff\u2019s debut publication was the thought-provoking \u201cHistory as I See It\u201d. Following the launch of Character this month his next book \u201cWhy Work Hard?\u201d, which is heavily influenced by his own approach to professional life, will be released in October 2025. Sheriff\u2019s fourth book \u201cWhy it is Important to Have Gratitude in Your Life\u201d exploring the role of gratitude in living a more fulfilled life is currently under review with publishers.",
    "Hafiz Sheriff is also\u00a0an accomplished singer/song writer, and his music is available on Spotify and iTunes.",
    "Character will be available for purchase on Amazon from the 15th of August 2025, and \u201cWhy Work Hard\u201d will also be available on the platform from the 10th of October 2025.",
