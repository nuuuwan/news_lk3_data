    "Three patients who permanently lost their vision after using contaminated Prednisolone Acetate eye drops following cataract surgery at a State-run hospital have filed a lawsuit against former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and several others before the Colombo District Court today, seeking Rs. 300 million in damages.",
    "The plaintiffs have named Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandraguptha, National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Head Professor S.D. Jayaratne, NMRA CEO Dr. Vijith Gunasekara, Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Asela Gunawardena, Chamee Chemist Ltd. of Yakkala, Indiana Ophthalmics LLP and the Attorney General and several others were named as the defendants of these plaints. One plaintiff, Makkari Rajaratnam from Kandapola maintained he was admitted to the District General Hospital Nuwaraeliya and underwent a cataract surgery on 5 April 2023.",
    "Rajaratnam, who experienced severe discomfort after using the eye drops said that he was admitted to the National Eye Hospital on 10 May 2023, where it was discovered that he was losing sight in the eye treated with the drops.",
    "In May 2023, at least 30 patients across various government hospitals in Sri Lanka developed serious complications after being administered Prednisolone eye drops, which are commonly used following cataract surgeries. These complications were allegedly caused by the presence of the bacteria Burkholderia cepacia in the medication, resulting in at least 10 patients losing their vision completely."
