Asian Human Rights Commission urges reforming Supreme Court, combating corruption, restructuring Attorney General's Department to strengthen rule of law in Sri Lanka.

ЁЯЯй

The Asian Human Rights Commission has urged the President of the Human Rights Commission to focus on the three main issues, such as rehabilitation of the Supreme Court trial, controlling corruption, and rehabilitation of the Attorney General's Department.

In a letter sent to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake by Bernando, the Director of the Asian Human Rights Commission, Basil Fernando, said:

I will bring to your notice of three reorganizations to be maintained in the reorganization of the law in Sri Lanka and the value of human rights.

We have continuously pointed out about the rule of law that has been disrupted in Sri Lanka for the past several years. This has been embodied in the speeches you have made in Parliament for a long time and in the last election by the National People's Power, and many have come together on the basis of the general purpose of establishing the best governance administration.

### Sri LankaтАЩs IMF deal: Turning point, but caution is key

*2024-12-23 01:50:29* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-IMF-deal-Turning-point-but-caution-is-key/4-770896) ┬╖ `en`

The IMF deal marks the beginning, not the end, of its journey

While Sri LankaтАЩs IMF deal offers hope, the risks are real. Political instability could derail reforms, as vested interests resist change. Reform fatigue, too, is a genuine concernтАФif the public does not see tangible benefits soon, support for the program could waver. Globally, external shocksтАФrising interest rates, slowing trade, or geopolitical tensionsтАФcould further complicate the recovery. The Government must proceed with caution. An IMF deal is not a panacea; it is a foundation on which Sri Lanka must build its recovery. Strong institutions, consistent policies, and effective communication will be critical in navigating these risks

### Demand to release Indian fishermen

DMK urges release of Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankans. Meeting calls for action to free captives and return boats, citing impact on bilateral ties and fishermen's livelihoods.

ЁЯЯй

It has been urged to release the Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankan fishermen.

The issue was investigated at a meeting of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Executive Committee at the Chennai -Artist Stadium yesterday (22) chaired by party leader MK Stalin.

Meanwhile, members of the party at the Executive Committee said that the arrest of Indian fishermen and confiscating their boats would question their livelihood.

The prison sentence imposed on Indian fishermen in the Sri Lankan courts has been pointed out to disrupt the friendship between the two countries.

The DMK Executive Committee meeting has asked the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to take steps to release the Indian fishermen who are currently captured in Sri Lanka and the release of their boats.. (A)

### Rumpus about campus qualifications

*2024-12-22 23:52:57* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rumpus-about-campus-qualifications/4-770884) ┬╖ `en`

A highly qualified politician without integrity or empathy can cause more harm than an unqualified but ethical leader

Sri LankaтАЩs Parliament is ablaze with a fiery debate over questionable campus qualifications, with the spotlight now on the JVP/NPP. Since voters placed their trust in the party as champions of honesty, integrity, and anti-corruption, the party now finds itself entangled in a web of controversy. Their rise to power on a platform of transparency has hit a stumbling block, as allegations of fabricated academic credentials leave them scrambling for cover, raising eyebrows and questions about their credibility.

It is important to emphasise that in past governments, such questions and investigations were often curtailed immediately, sometimes with verbal and physical threats. Therefore, citizens must welcome this change. However, the ability to question alone should not be considered a success.

Fear not, Mr. President, you may not speak the language of the King but you speak the language of the heart

Firstly, a very Merry Christmas to you and yours. This year it must be a very different Christmas for you. You seem to have been a good boy and Santa came early for you. All your Christmases came at once. It is good to see that now you are playing Santa Claus and distributing goodies all around. Some are gleefully dreaming of their bright and shiny new cars in the near future! Hopefully you are making sure that all those naughty little boys and girls who brought our country down to the lowest ebb will also receive their just desserts in due course.

### Central Bank, NGO Secretariat and weaponisation of Financial Action Task Force

As FATF has pointed out, blanket and arbitrary measures can drive financial flows underground, thereby undermining the entire purpose of the FATF standards and instead increase terror financing risks

Two entities play a visible and critical role in State attempts to place repressive controls on CSOs; the NGO Secretariat and the CBSL. The third entity that is the driver of these attempts but has largely operated in the shadows is the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The issuance of the 12 December instructions by the NGO Secretariat, indicates the MOD is slowly becoming visible and its role in State attempts to control CSOs/NGOs is being legitimised

### Removing ban on vehicle imports: Is it a prudent plan?

*2024-12-22 23:41:45* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Removing-ban-on-vehicle-imports-Is-it-a-prudent-plan/4-770881) ┬╖ `en`

The highest risk is not the decision to import vehicles but linking the tariff income as a source of funding to pay the proposed salary increases, because if dollar outflow is going to be significant destabilising the existing macroeconomic stability, there is no way to contain vehicle imports as such restriction will reduce the targeted tariff income jeopardising the Government plan to provide money for salary increases without increasing taxes

The GovernmentтАЩs plan to lift the ban on vehicle imports is out. But it is not a prudent plan, perhaps it cannot prevail. Sometimes it might create macroeconomic chaos and uncertainty among the vehicle importing entrepreneurs. Any policy that cannot be sustained or justified in view of┬а strengthening the macroeconomic environment of the country is usually treated as a bad policy.

### Deleted CCTV footage recovered in Hatton bus accident

Police have recovered the CCTV footage alleged to have been deleted from the private bus involved in a tragic accident in the Malliappuwa area on Saturday (21), which claimed the lives of three people including a school student.

The accident occurred at around 10.00 a.m. when a private passenger bus travelling from Hatton to Kandy veered off the road and plunged 20 feet down a concrete embankment. Initial investigations suggest that the driver lost control of the vehicle.

During police interrogations, the bus driver claimed that the bus door had opened, causing him to lose balance and nearly fall out. In an attempt to hold on to the steering wheel, he was unable to regain control, leading to the crash.

Police have discovered that someone had later deleted the CCTV footage recorded during the accident. However, using advanced technology methods, the police successfully recovered the footage, which they say provides critical evidence regarding the incident.

### A nation is the same election: a description

*2024-12-22 17:31:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201898) ┬╖ `ta`

India conducted simultaneous national elections from 1951 to 1967. This practice, known as "same election," refers to holding all parliamentary and state assembly polls on a single day. The rationale behind this approach includes efficiency in resource allocation and voter turnout. However, it also presents challenges such as coordinating across various states and managing potentially conflicting political agendas.

ЁЯЯй

Conducting elections on the same day is not a new experience for India. From 1951 to 1967, that was the case.
