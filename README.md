“Persistently high interest rates could raise borrowing costs further and affect financial stability if fiscal improvements do not offset higher real rates amid lower potential growth.

Global inflation went up after economic bureaucrats in the US, UK, Europe and many other countries printed money and states also expanded spending during Coronavirus, using some of the printed money.

Hence, the repayment capacity of the borrower can be affected by unpredictable circumstances; subsequently the liabilities of the bank will be transferred to non-performing category. These borrowers cannot be treated as wilful defaulters, and should be immediately remedied out by different tools and techniques like Restructuring, Rescheduling and Revival with Rehabilitation

The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Investment Promotion Minister, to submit the Colombo Port City (Charges) Orders to Parliament.

The move is in accordance with Section 71 of the Act and the Colombo Port City (Charges) Orders No. 2 of 2024, was imposed by gazette notification on 6 June.

These orders, enacted under the provisions of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act No. 11 of 2021, require Parliamentary approval within three months of their publication in the Government gazette.

The orders, declared in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2387/38, are designed to regulate charges within the Colombo Port City, a key economic zone.

The move is a step towards ensuring that the regulations governing the economic activities within the Port City are aligned with the broader legislative framework and receive the necessary legislative oversight.
