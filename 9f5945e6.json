    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe is keen to implement the 13th amendment to the constitution and is open to discussing devolution of police powers to the provinces, according to Jaffna district MP and former Northern Province Chief Minister C V Vigenswaran.",
    "The MP told reporters on Monday July 24 that the president had told his party during a discussion that he is agreeable to appointing a five-member advisory committee on devolution with regard to all nine provinces of the country.",
    "Wickremesinghe has called a party leaders\u2019 conference for Wednesday July 25 to discuss the India-backed constitutional amendment.",
    "\u201cI can say clearly that the president is interested in implementing the 13th amendment,\u201d said Vigneswaran.",
    "Though Wickremesinghe had previously said a discussion on police powers would have to wait, the MP said, he had told them at Monday\u2019s discussion that what kind of police powers are being sought can be taken up for discussion at Wednesday\u2019s party leaders\u2019 conference.",
    "The law already provides for police officers at the provincial level, but it is not being implemented, said Vigneswaran.",
    "He said the president and the group of Tamil MPs had also discussed alternatives such as a provincial police force that does not have the authority to use weapons but can enforce traffic and other laws as well as record complaints.",
    "Last week, legislators representing Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil-majority northern and eastern provinces and President Wickremesinghe were unable to reach a consensus on the inclusion of police powers in the full implementation of the India-sponsored devolution mechanism",
    "At a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on July 18, opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran said excluding police powers in the implementation of the 13th amendment to the constitution would not amount to a meaningful devolution of power.",
    "\u201cSo now to go back and say [there is gong to be an] exception with police powers\u2026\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t seem meaningful at all,\u201d he said.",
    "Responding to the MP, President Wickremesinghe said while he agrees with Rajapaksa that there should be full implementation of the 13th amendment, there was an outcry when Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration had proposed the same.",
    "\u201cFirstly, I\u2019m Ranil Wickremesinghe, not Ranil Rajapaksa. I\u2019m not bound by \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say what President Rajapaksa did, but I do go along with him that there has to be full implementation of the 13th amendment. But in the discussion we had earlier, when I mentioned full implementation, there was a big outcry and we decided that we\u2019ll go ahead and take up police powers later. So you have to decide on that,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "The ongoing talks on a permanent solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-old ethnic issue are taking place around an official visit to India by the president last week.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and",
    "Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment would see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more nationalist-oriented parties including sections of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). In February, sections of Sri Lanka\u2019s Buddhist clergy took to the streets against the proposed full implementation of the constitutional amendment.",
    "A statement from the President\u2019s Media Division said on July 18 quoted him as saying that he had already put forth a \u201ccomprehensive proposal to address the problems faced by the people in those regions and it is up to the Tamil parliamentarians whether to take it forward or not\u201d.",
    "\u201cUltimately, the president underscored that the full enforcement of the 13th amendment can only be achieved if all party leaders in the parliament agree to a comprehensive devolution of powers,\u201d the statement said. (Colombo/Jul25/2023)"
