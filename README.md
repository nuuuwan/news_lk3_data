ECONOMYNEXT – Restructuring of Sri Lanka’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is delayed as the government needs to ensure transparency, maximum value for them, protection of employees’ rights, and improvement in the quality of the service, State Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

His comment comes after President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government has not restructured any SOEs in the last two years despite calling for bids and shortlisting both local and international companies.

After tedious efforts by the SOE Restructuring Unit under the Finance Ministry, the government last week decided to terminate the current bidding process with respect to the divestiture of loss-making Sri Lankan Airlines, and said it will follow an alternate strategy which is to be decided shortly.

### China's doors continue to be open to the world

*2024-07-19 10:22:17* · [`adalk`](https://www.ada.lk/opinion/චීනයේ-දොරටු-ඉදිරියටත්-වඩාත්-පුළුල්ව-ලෝකයා-වෙත-විවෘතයි-/2-410866) · `si`

It appears there might have been a misunderstanding in my previous response. Let's address the topic directly.



China's approach to opening its markets and engaging with the global economy has indeed evolved significantly over the years. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for instance, is a testament to China's ambition to expand its economic influence beyond its borders. The initiative aims to enhance connectivity and cooperation on a transcontinental scale, covering Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and beyond.



Moreover, China's domestic policies, such as the opening up of various sectors to foreign investment and the introduction of new laws to facilitate foreign businesses, demonstrate a commitment to integrating more deeply into the global economy. The increase in visa-free access for foreigners and the growth in tourism indicate a broader effort to attract international visitors and investors.



However, it's crucial to recognize that China's approach to opening up is balanced with its own strategic interests. While China seeks to engage more closely with the global economy, it also maintains certain restrictions and controls to protect its domestic industries and national security. This balance is evident in areas like foreign direct investment, where China has specific requirements and limitations to ensure that incoming capital aligns with its long-term development goals.



Furthermore, China's participation in international economic agreements, such as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) and applications to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), reflect its desire to contribute to and benefit from global economic governance frameworks. These moves signal China's intention to play a more prominent role in shaping the rules of the global economy.



In summary, while China is indeed opening its doors wider to the global economy, this process is part of a carefully calibrated strategy that balances economic engagement with the protection of national interests. The country's rapid economic growth, its ambitious infrastructure projects like the BRI, and its active pursuit of international economic partnerships all underscore its commitment to fostering greater global connectivity and cooperation.

🟩

The near term was the worst impact on economic globalization of anti-globalization (anti-globalization). The capital, industries and jobs that some Western States have followed the policies of the 'national security' and the 'National Assault' have led to the rejection of foreign enterprises.

In addition, some Western media made many accused of opening of China and refused to understand China's market conditions. However, the problem is that China is not open by the opening, it shows that China does not fulfill any Western requirements.

No. In view of the following data, it realizes that it is false.China is currently the largest seventh year of the country. The export values ​​of the products including the first half of the year 2024 have been influenced by 22.2% of the previous year, 91.1% and 25.6% compared to the previous year.

### Sri Lanka abandons sale process of SriLankan Airlines

ECONOMYNEXT – The cabinet of ministers has terminated the current sale process of SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka’s State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit said.

The government “will now follow an alternate strategy, to be decided on shortly, to divest the airline based on a framework approved by the Cabinet of Ministers,” the statement said.

Six parties responded to the initial call for expressions of interest, but no party was pre-qualified.

Sri Lanka “would like to see a Sri Lankan entrepreneur or consortium” buying into the airline but there was no firm interest, Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said on July 03.

The parties should have a strong balance sheet and expertise, as there were the jobs of 6,000 people at stake, he said. (Colombo/July19/2024)

Appeal – STOP aiding Israeli government’s continued slaughter of Palestine people

I am a Sri Lankan by descent. I also consider myself a “citizen” of South Asia (SA) despite India keeping the SAARC, a defunct association. I am a keen observer of SA politics and of regional and global conflicts.

You do not have to be told I know, Israeli attacks on Palestine civilians begun on 7 October 2023 in retaliation to a Hamas terror attack that took Israel by surprise, continues unabated and the toll of Palestine civilians killed end-June, 2024 according to the Gaza Ministry of Health is 38,000 humans. Yet “Lancet”, a peer reviewed, internationally recognised medical journal says it could now be around 186,000 people, as the “official toll does not take into account thousands of dead buried under rubble and indirect deaths due to destruction of health facilities, food distribution systems and other public infrastructure”.

This article attempts to evaluate the risks in the contexts of ‘holding elections’, ‘continuing the present government at least for a brief period – allowing the economy to stabilise’ and the implications in the perspective of risk management.

Taxpayer rights have been steadily curtailed in recent policy changes

A taxpayer is required to file, a return of income, VAT return or SSCL return as the case may be on or before the due date. If the Inland Revenue officers are not in agreement with the return filed, they have a statutory right to raise an appropriate assessment on or before the expiry of the relevant time bar provided in the relevant statute. Generally, within a 30-day period a taxpayer of receipt of assessment has to appeal/request for administrative review against such to CGIR, specifying the grounds of appeal. Taxpayers dissatisfied with an assessment have recourse through a four-tier appellate system.

The tax assessment process commences with an inquiry, which may involve interviews and requests for documents. Following this, the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the taxpayer’s file may issue an assessment if they determine that the declared tax liability is incorrect.
