    "Out of a total of 1,531 GigaWatt hours of energy generated in May 2025, 986 GWh came from renewables, data published by the central bank showed.",
    "CEB\u2019s hydro generation rose to 575 GWh up 44.7 percent from a year earlier, helped by good rainfall while fuel oil generation dropped from 208 to 35 GWh.",

    "As the economy contracts in the stabilization crisis that follows an inflation crisis, electricity demand slows.",
    "From January to May 2023, electricity demand fell 8.5 percent, amid the stabilization crisis triggered to restore confidence in the rupee. (Colombo/Aug20/2025)"
