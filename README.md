### Sri Lanka financial account turns negative in 2023 amid heavy net repayments

*2024-04-24 08:22:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-financial-account-turns-negative-in-2023-amid-heavy-net-repayments-159825/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s external financial account turned negative in 2023, official data show as bilateral lenders stopped financing the government, multilaterals had to be paid, and banks repaid credit lines which counterparties refused to roll over.

The financial account was 1.3 billion dollars in deficit in 2023, subject to errors and omissions of 318 million dollars.

Sri Lanka defaulted on official credit in April 2022 after money printed to keep an artificially low policy rate depleted forex reserves, but the country had to repay multilateral lenders and banks and to repay counterparties.

Though rates were hiked in April 2022, the Reserve Bank of India gave credits to the central bank, leading to more money printing to offset interventions, delaying a correction in the external accounts.

The balance of payments turned positive only in the third quarter of 2022 and monetary stability was restored. A positive overall balance of payments also denotes outflows through the central bank.

Agriculture Minister and SLFP senior vice president Mahinda Amaraweera claimed at a press conference on Tuesday April 23 that Rajapakshe’s appointment as acting chairman was made by a group of people that do not represent the party’s executive committee.

“We are reliably informed that there was some coercing and threats. There was also the involvement of the security detail deployed for former presidents,” Amaraweera claimed.

The minister represents a faction of the SLFP that opposes former President Maithripala Sirisena, whom the Colombo District Court has issued an enjoining order against, preventing him from serving as SLFP chairman.

In 2020, six people from Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India were arrested by the Ramanathapuram Police for attempting to smuggle around 5000 explosive materials similar to gelatin sticks, purportedly for blast fishing. According to a Times of India report, one of the groups was contacted by a fisherman from Sri Lanka. Police investigations revealed that the suspects were anticipating gold or other valuable items instead of money in exchange to the smuggled explosives. While many such explosives including detonators are being manufactured in Tamil Nadu and are being smuggled by boats to be distributed among Sri Lankan fishermen, incidents of dynamite fishing or blast fishing along the Sri Lankan coastal belt has increased by manifold over the recent past, posing a threat to unique maritime ecosystems.

*2024-04-24 03:08:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Myanmars-junta-takes-revenge-on-its-people/172-281224) · `en`

The army has 150,000 troops while the rebel strength is 20,000. It has  700 tanks, 2000 artillery pieces (big numbers for a poor country with no  external enemies)

What a turn of events in Myanmar–in  2021, the Generals seized power again from the legitimately elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the second military coup staged since 1962. The Generals had total power for much of Myanmar’s post-independence period, then relinquished briefly only to seize it back a few months later. She was jailed for 33 years on trumped-up charges. Widespread protests were crushed by killing over 3000 people, imprisoning 20,000 and destroying 55,000 houses over the past two years. Thus, the junta hoped to silence her forever and crush the country’s hopes of ever returning to democracy.

### Those whom Gods wish to destroy, they first make mad - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-24 02:45:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Those-whom-Gods-wish-to-destroy-they-first-make-mad-EDITORIAL/172-281223) · `en`

The saying “Whom the Gods would destroy, they first make mad” is  believed to have been made by the Greek Tragedian Euripides and has been used in English literature since the 17th century. Leon Tolstoy in his novel ‘War and Peace’ uses the phrase in reference to Napoleon.

Wikipedia quotes Sri Lankan Catholic Priest Father Simon Gregory Perera, SJ using the phrase about the belief of Portuguese colonialists that the loss of Sri Lanka to the Dutch was divine punishment.

Today, our country is gripped in election fever. We are witnessing the applicability of this phrase in many a political party and candidate. The dramatic twists and turns of our political establishment bear ample testimony to this. According to media reports the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has barred party members from commenting on whom that particular party may nominate as its presidential candidate!

### Exploring FDI and export potential of Sri Lanka under the new normal

This article captures the core insights from the recent webinar hosted by the Daily FT, Board of Investment, SLID, CIMA, ACCCA and the International Chamber of Commerce. The event fostered dialogue with the diplomatic community from crucial markets about the critical role of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in Sri Lanka’s growth trajectory.

As Sri Lanka works to recover from its recent economic crisis through robust macroeconomic and fiscal policies, its future growth prospects remain constrained. The country faces challenges such as underperforming exports, which are projected to increase by only 5.27% annually from 2024 to 2028, and structural economic weaknesses, including persistently low labour productivity that has grown at a mere 1.4% over the past decade. To foster sustainable economic growth, Sri Lanka must enter new markets through efficiency-enhancing free trade agreements (FTAs), simultaneously addressing domestic constraints to unlock its FDI and export potential.

The World Bank recently held a press briefing to discuss the future of Sri Lanka's economy. World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-Zervos stated: "Sri Lanka's economy is on the road to recovery, but sustained efforts to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable are critical, alongside a continuation of the path of robust and credible structural reforms."

Currently, Sri Lanka's overall recovery path is becoming clearer, especially through policy-level measures and structural reforms, particularly concerning state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have been incurring losses. The maintenance of loss-making SOEs poses a significant burden on the Government's Balance Sheet. In 2023, the cumulative net losses of SOEs amounted to 1,323 billion rupees, with some showing marginal profits. However, overall, these entities face challenges in overcoming historical cumulative losses.
