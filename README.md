### NPP’s Political Culture Change Project: A Path Forward For Sri Lanka?

Sri Lanka has long been a country grappling with political instability, entrenched corruption, and cyclical economic crises. In 2024, National People’s Power (NPP) emerged as a beacon of hope for many Sri Lankans seeking a new political paradigm. Representing a coalition of left-leaning political entities, academics, and civil society members, the NPP captured public attention by promising reforms and transparency, emphasizing a government accountable to the people. Amid record-high inflation of around 50% in 2022 and a significant GDP contraction of 7.8%, Sri Lankans sought leadership that could prioritize economic stability and integrity, marking a shift away from personality-driven politics. However, the question remains whether the NPP can truly transform the nation’s political culture and deliver a meaningful economic recovery.

Although there was a brief dip in the number of Israeli tourists surfing, partying, digital working, or downward-dogging on the coast after 7 October 2023, these numbers have picked up, and, outside of peak season, Israelis are the largest demographic of holidaymakers in Arugam Bay.

Kishore Mahbubani, an esteemed scholar, diplomat, and author, is well-known for his incisive analyses of global geopolitics and economic development.

I have been reading and watching YouTube videos that are abundant on Ratan Tata who died about two weeks ago. He was a great man – successful businessman, clever entrepreneur, most generous philanthropist and a truly compassionate human being. My interest is enhanced by my son having given me a birthday gift about a decade ago of four days at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai, full name Taj Mahal Palace, Colaba, very near the Gateway of India. I heard much about him and other Tatas then.

### An important strategy to mitigate elephant-vehicle collisions

*2024-10-27 01:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/an-important-strategy-to-mitigate-elephant-vehicle-collisions/) · `en`

(Author of the award-winning book “The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants”)

According to a report by the World Bank, Sri Lanka has the highest road density in South Asia. On the other hand, Sri Lanka is a country with rich biodiversity and wildlife-collisions with trains/motorists have been there for aeons without a successful mitigating measure. This can risk the lives of wildlife as well as motorists or passengers. The latest one happened on October 18, 2024, in which two wild elephants died and two others were injured in a Batticaloa-bound fuel tanker train accident.

When considering train accidents, the best solutions would be an underground railway-transit line in wildlife-sensitive areas. But considering the economic status of the country, such projects can be difficult to initiate in the near future. So, this article proposes a strategy that can be implemented just within a few days and has a strong potential to at least mitigate the issue.

### Historicising the Sri Lanka Law College

*2024-10-27 01:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/historicising-the-sri-lanka-law-college/) · `en`

The Sri Lanka Law College, reputedly Asia’s oldest professional institution, was established 150 years ago, in 1874. Today, it has become an institution unto itself.To commemorate the anniversary, the institution came out with a publication: “Uplifting Legal Education in Sri Lanka: 150 Years of Law College.” Compressing what could have been two, if not three, years of hard research into six months, the book saw the light of day at a launch on October 18 – that is, last Friday.

The book tries to make its contribution to our society, its continuing relevance, clearer. It does this by exploring its historical evolution from multiple perspectives.

It also raises many questions. Perhaps the most important of them is this: how do institutions become relevant to the societies they inhabit, how do they become more representative of the people they serve?

To answer that question, it is necessary to go back in time.
