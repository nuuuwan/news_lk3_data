    "Sociologists argue that ethnic tensions and intolerance can manifest itself at all levels of the society. It prevents democracy from taking place and hampers human\u2019s socio-cultural and economic development. Many scholars argue for separation as a solution to ethnic conflict. However, complete separation among ethnic groups is difficult to achieve in many situations and separation can work only if all groups in the conflict see it as a solution. At the same time, hostilities do not destroy the possibility of inter-ethnic cooperation. In fact, most ethnic groups coexist peacefully most of the time. Therefore, how can reconciliation be effective in contexts with a legacy of ethnic wars, ethnic hostilities, and ethnic intolerance? In this brief article I argue that \u2018reconciliation\u2019, intercultural dialogues, peace and unity must be incorporated into a country\u2019s broad development efforts in order to achieve a post-conflict stable society and mere economic development alone will not bring stability or sustainable peace for ethnically divided societies. It views reconciliation as the transformation of relationships. Moreover, involves creating alliances for the benefit of the common good; and appealing to individual and group rationality to overcome destructive emotions for the sake of development. The reconciliation approach is based on the principles of equality, non-discrimination and communal functionalism. The premise is that interdependent ethnic groups are better off learning to coexist than being separated from one another after a violent conflict.",
    "Like many countries in the world, Sri Lanka is no stranger to the repercussions of ethno-religious violence, having gone through a 30-year armed conflict, ethnic riots, Easter Sunday terrorist attack and recent people\u2019s uprising \u2018aragalaya\u2019 with far-reaching consequences to its people and the country. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) highlights the importance of peace education in promoting unity and reconciliation (Chapter on Peace Education, page 312). It further stresses that \u201cyouth can play a special role\u201d in \u201cpeople-to-people contact in promoting understanding, amity and reconciliation.\u201d",
    "Towards creating a harmonious Sri Lanka, the universities should develop the central concepts, strategies and models to promote moderation, toleration and coexistence. Furthermore, Sri Lankan universities should spearhead initiatives to train and groom a new generation of staff and students to create a harmonious society.",
    "In this context, the University Grant Commission (UGC) has taken these issues seriously and has come forward to set up Social Reconciliation Centers (SRCs) in our 17 universities and two campuses under the UGC Circular 10/2021. The circular has clearly spelt out the objectives of those centers together with their tasks and functions as well. There are 18 Directors operating under each university and they work closely with students, staff and the communities by conducting various programmes related to Social Reconciliation. We must appreciate their commitment and untiring effort to promote reconciliation and peaceful communal living in our country in a voluntary manner.",
    "Personally, as the chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Reconciliation and UGC in general, I recognise the significant role undertaken by the Social Reconciliation centers established under the Circular to promote intercultural dialogue and social cohesion in our Public University system. The Public Universities in Sri Lanka accommodate a unique demography where Academics and Youth representing a microcosm of the entire Sri Lankan society engage in academic and extracurricular activities together.",
    "Our Standing Committee on Social Reconciliation also recognises the role intercultural dialogue can play to foster a culture of unity, and social cohesion among the ethnically diverse university community. Sri Lanka currently faces an unprecedented opportunity where the country is embarking on ambitious social, economic, and political reforms where it becomes necessary for all Sri Lankans to come together under a common vision to implement sustainable reforms. However, reconciliation cannot be achieved if societies are fractured. With global challenges such as inequality, ethno-nationalism, and violent extremism growing, it is more important than ever to find ways to bridge divides.",
    "In the face of all these challenges, the public universities have been an increasing awareness of the importance of intercultural and interethnic dialogue as a vital tool in the pursuit of peace, inclusion, and cooperation. Recognising this, UGC is quite happy to build partnerships with the local and international agencies which are keen in promoting reconciliation and social cohesion, sustaining peace, upholding and protecting human rights. This year USAID/SCORE (Social Cohesion and Reconciliation) programme came forward to sponsor several such activities to promote social reconciliations among students, staff and communities while strengthening Social Reconciliation Centres in our university system. The USAID/SCORE aims to enhance the centres\u2019 sustainability through strategic planning, training, networking, and research. By engaging university leaders, academic staff, and student representatives, SCORE facilitates dialogue and initiatives that extend from university communities to national platforms, influencing policy and empowering students as agents of change in Sri Lanka\u2019s reconciliation efforts. Similar efforts have been taken by UNESCO to support training our Directors and students in the field of social reconciliation, peace building and inter-cultural dialogues. The UGC Standing Committee on Social Reconciliation is also closely working with the Parliamentary Sectorial Oversight Committee on Reconciliation and National Unity, and Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism (ISTRM). With those collaborations we are planning to enhance the understanding and the commitment towards promoting social cohesion and reconciliation among diverse religious and ethnic groups within university communities while enabling SRC directors and University Vice Chancellors to develop clear and achievable goals to implement effective social cohesion and reconciliation initiatives at their respective institutions and to execute impactful activities that contribute to social harmony and reconciliation within university environments and beyond.",
    "As one such effort a two day \u2018Youth Convention\u201d has been jointly organised by USAID/SCORE and UGC to celebrate International Youth Day which is falling on 12th August at Vavuniya University with the participation of student representatives from 17 universities and 2 campuses, SRC Directors, Rectors, Vice-chancellors and Officials of UGC and USAID/SCORE programme. The aim of the convention is to empower youth to lead community engagement while addressing local challenges to promote social cohesion and create opportunities for youth to influence the implementation of national policies by engaging with diverse stakeholders for social reconciliation.",
    "Let me say this as a final remark, if we are imagining a prosperous and peaceful Sri Lanka, satisfying the ethnic minorities\u2019 aspirations is a pre-condition. I am certain that our Social Reconciliation Centres can contribute to this endeavor positively!",
