### A Call For Unity: Seize This Rare Opportunity For Tamil Representation

*2024-10-01 11:11:30* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-call-for-unity-seize-this-rare-opportunity-for-tamil-representation/) · `en`

With the presidential election behind us and the parliamentary elections on the horizon, it is time for us, as representatives of the Tamil community, to act with clarity and purpose. Our people have endured decades of hardship, their basic rights eroded, and it is now our responsibility to ensure that these rights are restored. To achieve this, we must speak with one voice, unified under a common goal, to represent the needs and aspirations of the Tamil population.

In the past, we have allowed ourselves to become fragmented—split into various groups with disparate agendas. This has weakened our collective voice, and the end result has often been failure. We cannot afford to repeat these mistakes. Now more than ever, our people need a clear and unified leadership to negotiate with the central government. Splintered groups with incoherent demands will only continue the cycle of disappointment and missed opportunities. Our strength lies in unity, and we must act accordingly.
