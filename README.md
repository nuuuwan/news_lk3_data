ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s female employment lags Asian peers and clearing barriers to their work could be an important economic driver in the context of an ageing population and migration, Deputy Treasury Secretary R M P Rathnayake said.

Sri Lanka’s female labor force participation was estimated at 29.4 percent, according to the latest survey, compared to men’s participation which is at 67.4 percent.

However, many women also go abroad to countries with better monetary regimes and send back remittances.

“If you compare the participation of the labor force with other regional countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, they are very ahead of Sri Lanka,” Rathnayake said.

“In Indonesia it’s 53% and Malaysia 52%, Vietnam 68%. So, it’s very high. And Singapore 62%.”

Making it easier for females to work could also boost economic growth.

When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J.

They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.

I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.
