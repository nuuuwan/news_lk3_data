### Sri Lanka’s ambitious governance and macro-linked bonds explained

Sri Lanka’s restructuring of $12.55 billion in international bond debt is set to lead to the launch of a series of new, as-yet-untested instruments linked to economic growth and governance.

Observers say it is one of the most complex set of instruments ever arranged in a restructuring. The bonds aim to give the country additional debt relief if the economy falters and to encourage it to improve its governance.

The governance-linked bond (GLB) is the first of its kind and is designed to reward Sri Lanka for transparency and effective economic management by reducing the interest on its debt. To earn that reduction, Sri Lanka must meet targets, or key performance indicators (KPIs), seen as indicating better governance.

The first KPI demands that Sri Lanka exceed a baseline ratio set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for total revenue to GDP in both 2026 and 2027, which the Fund has projected at 15.3% and 15.4% respectively.

### Bolivia opens fuel imports in Sri Lanka-style move amid money printing

*2024-12-17 07:59:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/bolivia-opens-fuel-imports-in-sri-lanka-style-move-amid-money-printing-194564/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Bolivia has authorized 27 companies to import fuel, breaking the monopoly of state-run Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) media reports said, as fuel shortages and queues hit the country amid foreign exchange shortages.

“I went to the pump on Calle 35 in Chasquipampa and there was nothing, then to the one on Calle 21 in Los Pinos and there was none either,” a fuel user was quoted as saying by the publication El Diario.

In late November even worse queues and diesel and petroleum had bigger shortages, the newspaper said.

Bolivia was once a natural gas exporter and the YPFB was broken up and privatized under a rightwing president.

However, the domestic currency Boliviano collapsed from around 6.0 to the US dollar to 2,000 to 7.4 to the US dollar two years later as macroeconomists printed money.

In the inflation and stabilization crisis that followed, leftist President Eva Morales came to power amid public protests.
