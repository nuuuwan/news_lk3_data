  "original_body_lines": [
    "US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has raised concerns pertaining to the \u2018continued use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA)\u2019, highlighting the importance of the need to protect certain \u2018fundamental freedoms\u2019.",
    "In a post on \u2018X\u2019, formerly known as Twitter, Ambassador Chung raised concerns over the repeated use of the controversial legislation as a tool for\u00a0 the arrest of peaceful protesters and the inhumane treatment of detainees in prison.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s vital to ensure freedom of expression and humane treatment of those in custody. Especially as the government looks to replace the PTA in line with its international commitments and implement key reforms, it must protect fundamental freedoms\u201d, Chung said.",
    "The much-disputed PTA is set to be replaced by Sri Lanka\u2019s new Anti-Terrorism Bill, after the PTA came under fire for being repeatedly abused and violating several fundamental rights."
