    "Sri Lanka\u2019s former President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has urged voters to send experienced members back to Parliament in the upcoming General Election, set for 14 November. In a special statement made yesterday, Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for seasoned politicians who worked alongside him to return to Parliament to address the country\u2019s ongoing economic challenges.",
    "\u201cWithout experience, you cannot run Parliament, and you cannot achieve the goals we have set. Those who worked with me have the expertise to solve the economic challenges,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. He added that these experienced politicians should be elected to Parliament, whether as part of the Government or the Opposition.",
    "Reflecting on his Presidency, which began when Sri Lanka had defaulted on its debt, Wickremesinghe outlined his key goal of achieving debt sustainability and steering the country out of bankruptcy. \u201cWe were able to reach agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 18 creditor countries, and private bondholders,\u201d he noted, crediting the collaborative efforts of those in the previous Parliament for this success.",
    "Wickremesinghe explained that Sri Lanka\u2019s next major task is to implement the agreements reached with creditors and move toward full debt sustainability. This will enable the country to access foreign funding from banks and donor agencies. However, he expressed concern about potential amendments to these agreements, as hinted by current President Anura Dissanayake. Wickremesinghe stressed that Parliament, which holds financial authority, will bear the responsibility for any such changes.",
    "The former President also highlighted the challenges that the new Government will face, particularly the need to increase state revenue to 15% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2028 when Sri Lanka must begin repaying its foreign debt. Currently, Government revenue stands at 12% of GDP, and Wickremesinghe warned that the country must achieve 1% economic growth annually to meet the revenue target.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s call for experience extends to his political allies. He announced that members who worked with him during his Presidency would contest the election under the symbol of the gas cylinder, representing the New Democratic Front. \u201cThe Pohottuwa, United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and all other groups came together and supported me. These people have worked under my leadership. Now all of them have come together once again,\u201d he said. These persons, he claimed, have the necessary skills and experience to navigate the economic crisis and ensure the success of the nation\u2019s recovery.",
    "\u201cThe next Parliament needs an experienced team that will not shirk from their responsibilities,\u201d Wickremesinghe stated. He urged voters to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous Parliament, where some members, according to him, refused to accept their roles in addressing the country\u2019s financial woes. \u201cI came forward and gathered members from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, United National Party, and the Pohottuwa to form a Government. This should not happen again,\u201d he said.",
    "Addressing the current political landscape, Wickremesinghe pointed out that no party achieved an absolute majority in the recent Presidential Election, a situation that underscores the need for unity and experience in the upcoming Parliamentary term. He concluded by calling on all Sri Lankans, including those who did not vote in the previous election, to support candidates with a proven track record in handling the nation\u2019s economic crises.",
    "\u201cYour future will be decided by the new Parliament,\u201d Wickremesinghe emphasised, urging voters to support experienced candidates and give their valuable vote to the gas cylinder, the symbol of his political alliance."
