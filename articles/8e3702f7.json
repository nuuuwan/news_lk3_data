    "\u201cI\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a ceasefire now,\u201d Biden told reporters when he was asked if he was aware of reports of Israeli plans for a limited operation, and if he was comfortable with one going ahead.",
    "Israel had intensified air raids against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon from September 23, when Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said at least 558 people were killed, in the deadliest day of violence since Lebanon\u2019s 1975-90 civil war.",
    "Israeli officials have been hinting at a potential ground invasion into Lebanon, following attacks which decimated Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and communications this month.",
    "After Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel, Hezbollah began firing at Israeli military positions and communities along the border, in what it called \u201csupport\u201d for Hamas.",
    "Tens of thousands of Israeli residents were evacuated from their country\u2019s northern border area nearly a year ago.",
    "Israel said earlier this month that it was shifting its focus from Gaza to securing the northern border with Lebanon.",
