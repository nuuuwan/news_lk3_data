    "The Government has decided to conditionally lift the ban on five Islamic organisations out of 11 organisations which were banned following the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019.",
    "Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa issued a gazette notification in April 2021 banning these five organisations along with six others under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.",
    "The ban on the five organisations is being lifted in line with recommendations by a committee comprising experts from investigative and intelligence agencies after a probe lasting more than a year, and following talks between representatives of these groups and government authorities.",
    "The ban on five groups was lifted considering the current peaceful situation in the country, subjected to conditions with the aim of religious reconciliation.",
    "Accordingly, the ban on the following Islamic organisations will be lifted subject to strict conditions: Jamiyathul Ansaari Sunnathul Mohomadiya (JASM), Sri Lanka Thawheed Jamma\u2019ath (SLTJ), All Ceylon Thawheed Jamma\u2019ath (ACTJ), Ceylon Thawheed Jamma\u2019ath (CTJ) and United Thawheed Jamma\u2019ath (UTJ).",
    "Nevertheless, the expert committee has recommended that even after the ban is lifted, authorities should keep a close watch on the activities of these organisations, their funding and education programmes.",
    "If there is any kind of threat to the national security from these organizations in the future,the committee has recommended to strictly implement the law and reimpose the ban.(DSB)"
