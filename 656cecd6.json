    "Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Sajith Premadasa has declared that Sri Lanka\u2019s existing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be renegotiated under an SJB government.",
    "Speaking in Parliament this morning (13 Dec.), the Opposition Leader claimed that the current agreement between Sri Lanka and the IMF will be renegotiated under an SJB-run government in a manner that would not inconvenience the people of the country.",
    "Speaking with regards to the recent approval given by the IMF for the second tranche of funds for Sri Lanka under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Premadasa alleged that the only reason the global lender allowed for its disbursement was due to the increase in electricity tariffs, Value Added Tax (VAT) and other taxes, which only further burdened the public.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019ve taxed every possible thing that can be taxed, and now they\u2019re saying this is the only way out\u2026 This might be the only way out for the Head of State that is a part of the SLPP gang that led this country to bankruptcy with the blessings of the Rajapaksas. But that is not the only way out for this country\u201d, Premadasa charged."
