  "original_title": "Ranil\u2019s Arrest: A Turning Point Or Just Another Act In Colombo\u2019s Political Drama?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The arrest of Ranil Wickremesinghe last week, followed quickly by his release on bail, has thrown Sri Lanka\u2019s political establishment into chaos. For some, this was long overdue accountability for a man who, along with his uncle JR Jayewardene, presided over decades of corruption, authoritarianism, and complicity in state violence. For others, it was nothing more than a political stunt\u2014a show trial staged by the NPP to prove its toughness.",
    "But the bigger story is what comes next: how this moment reshapes the opposition, how it tests the NPP\u2019s credibility, and how it impacts the upcoming provincial council elections.",
    "Ranil\u2019s arrest has done what years of backroom deals could not\u2014it has united the otherwise fractured opposition. UNP loyalists, SJB reformists, and minority party brokers are suddenly singing from the same hymn sheet: that the NPP is weaponising the law to crush rivals.",
    "This unity is fragile but dangerous. If it grows, the NPP could find itself fighting not just tired old parties, but a consolidated opposition front with a ready-made narrative of \u201cpolitical persecution.\u201d",
    "The next real battleground will be the provincial council elections. For the North and East, these elections matter because the councils are the only institutions left that give Tamils even a sliver of autonomy under the battered 13th Amendment.",
    "\u2022 If the NPP stalls or dilutes the elections, Tamil voters will write them off as just another Sinhala-led regime playing for time.",
    "\u2022 If the elections go ahead under fair rules, the NPP has a chance to prove it is different from the UNP, SLPP, and the rest who used devolution as a bargaining chip.",
    "This is not just a technical issue\u2014it will determine whether Tamils believe the NPP is genuinely committed to democratic reform.",
    "Nobody believes Ranil will be the last big fish. The files on corruption, war-time abuses, and economic crimes are thick, and the public appetite for justice is strong. But with every new arrest comes the same danger:",
    "\u2022 The streets will heat up with protests, strikes, and counter-mobilisations.",
    "The NPP needs to decide whether it wants to lead a process of accountability or simply act out revenge politics in public view.",
    "\u2022 On the one hand, the NPP\u2019s need to prove itself could open doors for negotiations on devolution, land rights, demilitarisation, and justice for wartime atrocities.",
    "\u2022 On the other, if Tamil leaders get sucked into the new \u201call-opposition\u201d chorus led by Ranil and Sajith, their core demands will once again be buried under Sinhala elite power games.",
    "The choice is stark: remain independent, leverage the moment, and demand specifics from the NPP\u2014or become pawns in a Colombo theatre that has little interest in Tamil self-determination.",
    "\u2022 Show absolute transparency in every case\u2014due process, evidence, and judicial independence must be front and centre.",
    "\u2022 Hold the provincial council elections on time, without gimmicks.",
    "\u2022 Engage Tamil civil society directly, not just the usual Colombo-based brokers.",
    "Otherwise, the NPP risks becoming what it promised to replace: just another government that uses power to punish enemies and silence critics.",
    "Ranil\u2019s arrest is not the end of an era. It is the start of a dangerous game. How the NPP handles this will decide whether it can hold onto its credibility\u2014or whether it will hand the opposition the very ammunition they need to bring it down.",
    "For Tamils, the message is simple: don\u2019t get lost in Colombo\u2019s theatre. Use this moment to demand real change\u2014or watch, yet again, as Sinhala politics writes the script and everyone else is left as extras."
