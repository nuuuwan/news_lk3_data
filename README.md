### Israel and Hamas signal resistance to ending Gaza war after Sinwar’s death

Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza and reiterated its stance that hostages the militant group took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops.

The group’s staunch position pushed back against a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin a day earlier that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming.

The conflicting stands signal continued deep resistance on both sides to ending the war, even as President Joe Biden and other world leaders press the case that Sinwar’s death is a turning point that should be used to unlock stalled cease-fire negotiations.

### Does President AKD Borrow Money Like Ex-Prez Ranil?

“Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education” ~ Stephen Covey

Recent bitter criticisms by some opposition ex-parliamentarians regarding government borrowing (i.e., President Anura Kumara Dissanayake) have no substance; it is for mudslinging and due to ignorance of the subject matter. President AKD is performing his mandatory work responsibilities as the Minister of Finance, similar to ex-Prez Ranil Wickremesinghe. Borrowing by President AKD has no burden on the total debt or Debt to GDP as per the IMF Program. Payment to pensioners, fertilizer, and fuel subsidies are within the fiscal space. No funds have been borrowed and wasted at all. Fertilizer and fuel subsidies greatly benefit the economy in numerous ways. Given the recent meeting by President AKD with the agricultural officials, formulating a National Agricultural Policy and having a public discussion on the same is a top priority of the government in the right direction.

### How important was India’s help to Sri Lanka in 2022?

*2024-10-18 23:42:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-important-was-India-s-help-to-Sri-Lanka-in-2022/4-768162) · `en`

India’s help was significant at a crucial time as Sri Lanka was going through a nightmarish

The IMF program is to give Sri Lanka $ 3 billion over four years with conditions. India gave $ 4 billion in one year to Sri Lanka with no conditions. Also, the timing is important to note. The IMF program came in 2023 when Sri Lanka had stabilised to a large extent under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also, most of the toughest policies that were needed for Sri Lanka to achieve macroeconomic stability were already put in place by the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe when the IMF program was approved. But India came to Sri Lanka’s aid when Sri Lanka was staring at the abyss with a Government that was behaving very irrationally in January 2022 with the country facing macroeconomic instability. This point should not be forgotten by the Sri Lankan public

### Towards a climate-smart tourism sector: Building resilience through financial instruments

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector holds great economic and social importance, but it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change

The tourism sector is an important pillar of Sri Lanka’s economy, providing income and employment for more than 400,000 people directly and indirectly across areas such as hospitality, transportation, and retail. However, like many other sectors, it is facing serious challenges and risks connected to climate change, necessitating a transformation towards sustainability and resilience.

Innovative financial instruments and risk transfer solutions could play an important part in enhancing the sector’s capacity to withstand climate-related shocks, recover from losses and damages, and adapt to long-term climatic changes. If Sri Lanka can pioneer new business models and creative risk management tools, it could help communities, entrepreneurs, tourism companies, and other stakeholders to turn the country into a more vibrant, resilient, and prosperous destination.

### In appreciation of Professor Kumar David

Professor Kumar David, once an academic in the Engineering Faculty, Peradeniya University, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in the UK and Hong Kong has left for eternal rest, last Monday while in Los Angeles, USA. We believe the “left” leaning English reader would miss Kumar’s forays into political controversies, with his own reading of issues that often provided dissenting, but populist perspectives, he developed over the decades since leaving the NSSP in 1980 July. Politically, he was advocating for “unity in the scattered left”.

Professionally too, he stood out as an exceptional, pragmatic thinker and was accepted for that. We believe he still remains the youngest to be appointed to the Director Board of the CEB way back in 1970, perhaps after the change of government in July. Kumar would not have been 30 years then. He was also a strong critic of the Mahaweli Development power generation scheme in 1979, when the blueprint was out for academic observation.

Political parties use Ampara as transit camp - Chandranayagam



Former MP Chandranayagam stated political parties use Ampara as transit camp. He criticized current political situation in Ampara, saying it affects people without considering their opinions. Parties now select candidates based on money rather than public input. This approach is unhealthy for democracy.

🟩

அரசியல் கட்சிகள் அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தினை ஒரு இடைத்தங்கல் முகாமாக பயன்படுத்துவதாக முன்னாள் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் சந்திரநேரு சந்திரகாந்தன் தெரிவித்தார்.

He made the above statement at a media briefing in Tirukovil.

The Ampara district has been affected by the current contemporary politically, like a slave on all sides.

அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தில் சமகால அரசியல் போக்கானது மக்கள் கருத்து இல்லாமல் அரசியல் கட்சிகள் தாமாக சிந்தித்து செயற்படுகின்றது.

ஆரம்பத்தில் தேர்தல் கேட்பது என்றால் பிரதேச புத்திஜீவிகள், அதிபர்கள் , இளைஞர்கள், ஆலய அறங்காவலர்கள் என மக்களின் கருத்து கேட்டதன் பின்னரே வேட்பாளர்கள் அரசியல் கட்சிகளில் நியமிக்கப்படுவர்.

ஆனால் இப்போது யார் வேண்டுமானாலும் தேர்தல் கேட்கலாம் என்று புதிய கோட்பாடு அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தை பெறுத்த மட்டில் உருவாகியுள்ளது.

தேர்தல் காலத்தில் மாத்திரமே அரசியல் கட்சிகளின் வரவு அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தில் காணப்படுகின்றது தமிழ் கட்சிகள் அனைத்தும் ஒன்றிணைந்து ஒரு வேட்பாளரை முன் நிறுத்தி குறித்த வேட்பாளருக்கு களம் அமைத்து வெற்றி பெற வைக்க வேண்டும்.

Palestinians vow continued resistance against Israel after Yahya Sinwar's death, citing broader conflict spanning over a century.

🟩

The Palestinian people have pledged that the war against Israel will continue, despite the killing of Yahya Sinwar.

The Palestinians in Khan Unis, who have been destroyed by the destruction war, are sure to continue the war, but the BBC reports that the war will continue.

The BBC has obtained the opinion of the Palestinians using independent journalists (it is noteworthy that Israel does not allow the BBC into Palestine.)

Dr. Ramadan Paris said the Palestinian people did not carry out this war with confidence in any leader or officer.

He said that this is much greater than Yahya Sinwar, the destruction war and the issue against the Palestinian people.

Israel is not just destroying us, he wants to destroy the entire Middle East.

He said the war between us and the Jews has been going on since 1919 for over 100 years.

I do not think that Sinwar's death will affect Hamas.

### CEB clarified about fueling thermal power plants

*2024-10-18 15:32:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202314) · `si`

Here's a 200-character summary:



CEB clarifies fuel supply for thermal power plants. Uses HFO (5.8%), naphtha (1.9%), diesel (1.1%) for electricity generation. Diesel purchase via CPC at fixed price due to lack of competitive bids. CEB considers diesel uneconomical but uses temporarily to meet demand until other power plants restored.

🟩

The Ceylon Electricity Board has issued a special announcement on supplying fuel to thermal power plants.

It states that some recent newsletters are expected to explain the word 'fuel'.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (Ceylon Electricity Board) is also used to generate three types of fuel to generate electricity.

* Receipt oil (HFO) - 715.3 GWh (5.8% of total electricity production) in 2024

* Napatha (Naphatha) - 235.5 GWH (1.9% of the total electric production) in 2024

* Diesel (Diesel) - 133.1 GWH (1.1% of total electric production) in 2024

Both credits (HFO) and Naupta (Naphatha) are bypace on the oil refinery.

Since there is no other supplier, the Ceylon Electricity Board is purchased by CPC from an anciently agreed price.

Competitive bidding is diesel, and some of them have recently commenced their business for diesel.

However, even under the management of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Diesel has not purchased competitive bids for electricity generation.
