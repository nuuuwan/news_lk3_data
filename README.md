Sajith Premadasa calls for compensation for COVID-19 cremation victims' families, citing alleged discrimination and WHO guideline violations.

ЁЯЯй

The last government's resolution to cremate those who died in the Kovit infection targets a nation. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said the government should take action to pay compensation to the victims.

The Gotabhaya Rajapaksa government was aimed at a race and religion during the spread of the Kovit virus.. The Gotabhaya Rajapaksa government has acted in violation of the guidelines provided by the World Health Organization. Justice should be established for the violated Islamic community and the affected Muslims.

So I urge you to pay compensation for the fugitives of the people who have been cremated by the wrong decision of the last government.

And there is no problem in providing the names of the cremated persons.All rights have all the rights to know these details for victim families. So, as Rauf Hakeem has heard, the government should take steps to provide details of the people who died in the Kovit infection.

Sri LankaтАЩs restructuring of $12.55 billion in international bond debt is set to lead to the launch of a series of new, as-yet-untested instruments linked to economic growth and governance.

Observers say it is one of the most complex set of instruments ever arranged in a restructuring. The bonds aim to give the country additional debt relief if the economy falters and to encourage it to improve its governance.

The governance-linked bond (GLB) is the first of its kind and is designed to reward Sri Lanka for transparency and effective economic management by reducing the interest on its debt. To earn that reduction, Sri Lanka must meet targets, or key performance indicators (KPIs), seen as indicating better governance.

The first KPI demands that Sri Lanka exceed a baseline ratio set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for total revenue to GDP in both 2026 and 2027, which the Fund has projected at 15.3% and 15.4% respectively.
