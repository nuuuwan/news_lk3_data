කෙසේවෙතත් ඊශ්‍රායලය පවසන්නේ ඉරාන ප්‍රහාරවලින් සියයට 99ක්ම සාර්ථකව ව්‍යර්ථ කළ බවය.

ඉරාන හමුදා ප්‍රධානියෙකු ඇතුළු 13 දෙනෙකු එම ප්‍රහාරයෙන් මියගොස් ඇත.

එවන් පසුබිමක අමෙරිකාවද ඊශ්‍රායලයට දැනුම්දී තිබුණේ ඉතාම ආසන්න දිනක ඊශ්‍රායලය වෙත ප්‍රහාරයක් එල්ලවනු ඇති බවටය.

ඉරානය, සිය හමුදා සහ අවි කලාපයේ ස්ථානගත කරමින් ඇති බවටත් අමෙරිකාව තහවුරු කර තිබුණි.

(Reuters) - Debt-for-nature swaps, where poorer countries have debt written off in return for protecting ecosystems such as barrier reefs or rainforests, could provide $100 billion for the fight against climate change, a new report has calculated.

The UK-based, non-profit International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) based the estimate on the possibility of debt swaps in many of the 49 less developed countries seen as most at risk of debt crises.

Belize, Ecuador, Barbados, Gabon and Cabo Verde have all done such swaps in recent years and Laura Kelly, the director of IIED’s sustainable markets research group, said many of those in debt distress and also often most threatened by global warming, were looking at them.

The IMF and World Bank, whose figures the analysis is based on, estimate the countries focused on collectively owe $431 billion, mostly to wealthier governments, the IMF itself and pension and hedge funds.

ECONOMYNEXT – The rights and protections of the LGBTQIA+ community have been fraught with challenges and continue to be so, despite the many gains achieved in recent years.

Nor are those handful of rights universally applied, a recent discussion which looked at the European and South Asian perspectives on same-sex rights and unions revealed.  Most developed nations have introduced protections for those identifying as LGBTQIA+, and a view from a distant lens paints a picture of tolerance. Yet, a closer look at the European arena throws up the many gaps that are evident in the application of the law.

In the so-called conservative South Asian nations, changes to legislation are slow to be implemented.  That may come as a surprise, for, contrary to popular belief, same-sex relationships were culturally acceptable in the South Asian region and is not a Western concept points out Ruhaan Joshi, a Public Policy Practitioner from India.
