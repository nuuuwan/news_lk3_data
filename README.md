### Is the Muslim minister's demand racist?

*2024-11-24 14:04:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/199546) · `ta`

Here's a summary of 200 characters:



The question of whether a Muslim minister's demand is racist stems from historical context. In Sri Lanka's political history, there were no Muslim ministers. The current situation involves Muslim MPs elected under the National People's Power. Some argue they may be unsuitable for the new regime. However, questioning their suitability isn't inherently racist, as it's based on performance rather than religion.

🟩

In the past, there are no Muslim ministers to tear down so we see those who call it the Muslim Minister. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked the people to vote for newcomers, saying that all those who have been in the past have not managed the country properly.. If so, are Muslim MPs elected on behalf of the National People's Power, but are they inappropriate for new regime change?If they are inappropriate, it is not the crime of Muslims to contest them as candidates.

### Far right eye breakthrough in Romania presidential vote

Romanians were voting Sunday in the first round of a presidential election amid a surge in inflation and fears over the war in neighbouring Ukraine that could favour far-right leader George Simion.

The vote kicks off two weeks of elections in the poor NATO member country, including a parliamentary vote and a December 8 presidential run-off.

Social democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is leading a field of 13 hopefuls in the polls, with about 25 percent, followed by AUR leader Simion on 15 to 19 percent.

Simion is targeting people like Rodica, a 69-year-old who was among the first to vote in Bucharest’s chilly sunshine. The pensioner, who would not give a family name, was afraid of the Ukraine war and wanted “better living conditions and peace”.

The stakes are high in the race to replace President Klaus Iohannis, a liberal and staunch Ukraine ally, who has held the largely ceremonial post since 2014.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) states that there will be no revision of electricity tariffs for 2024, citing delays in the submission of necessary proposals by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

The PUCSL Corporate Communications Director, Jayanath Herath pointed out that the CEB submitted an initial set of tariff revision proposals at the end of September. However, the PUCSL deemed the proposed reductions insufficient and requested a revised submission by November 8.

Despite the initial deadline, the CEB sought multiple extensions, most recently requesting an additional two weeks after failing to meet the extended deadline of November 22. Consequently, the PUCSL has planned to grant an extension until December 6.

Even if the CEB submits the revised proposals on December 6, the PUCSL clarified that it would take six to eight weeks to review and finalize the tariff adjustments. As a result, any potential revisions to electricity tariffs will be postponed to 2025.
