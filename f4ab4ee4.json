    "Peiris warned restructuring domestic debt would negatively affect the day-to-day lives of the people and called it a secret attempt to paralyse the country, the banking system and the stock market. \u201cThey are attempting to use this time during which the country will be distracted to wreak havoc,\u201d he claimed.",
    "\u201cThe process of domestic debt restructuring has a direct impact on the daily lives of individuals. It is anticipated that the challenges faced by the people will multiply significantly. The citizens of our nation possess the absolute right to be informed about it and participate in meaningful discussions regarding the matter. We are vehemently opposing this in Parliament and will vote against it,\u201d he said.",

    "The MP said the statements made by the Governor of the Central Bank are \u2018nominal\u2019. He also maintained that the IMF had not proposed the Government restructure domestic debt and it was instead proposed by the Sri Lankan Government.",
    "\u201cUnder a government headed by us we will reconsider harmful proposals presented by the IMF,\u201d he said. Peiris also claimed the new Aswesuma program initiated by the Government was without any transparency."
