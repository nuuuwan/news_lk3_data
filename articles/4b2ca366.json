    "A drop in volumes and a steep decline in freight rates have impacted Revenue and Gross Profit, resulting in Operating Losses. Margins faced pressure due to declining freight rates and volumes. Profitability decline was visible across both Air and Ocean Freight and was more pronounced in the latter due to experiencing visible freight rate corrections during the year.",

Reinforced efficient working capital management has enabled the settlement of Rs. 10.02 billion in debt over the nine-month period.
