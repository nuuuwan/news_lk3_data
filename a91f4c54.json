    "Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the government plans to increase liquid milk production by 50 percent by 2030.",
    "While addressing the 19th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in Italy, he said the Ministry and the Animal Production and Health Department of Sri Lanka have launched many projects to overcome this challenge.",
    "Therefore, it has been decided to implement two project proposals for the development of large-scale dairy farms with more than 500 cows in order to increase the production of liquid milk in Sri Lanka with the support of the Indian government, he said.",
    "\"India has taken measures to start a new technology as well as an exchange programme for dairy cows. At present, Sri Lanka's milk production is at a level of 35\u201340 percent. Our government's target is to produce 50 percent of the liquid milk production required by Sri Lanka by 2030.",
    "\"President Ranil Wickremesinghe, with his broad vision, has discussed with the Indian government on improving the dairy industry in this country.",
    "\"About 60 percent of the milk required by our country is obtained from imported milk powder. But in order to eliminate the malnutrition of the people of the country, the consumption of liquid milk should be increased. But it must be said that there has been no change in the liquid milk consumption in our country,\" the Minister said.",
    "After the discussions, the Minister met Tanawat Tenzin, the Director General of the Animal Production and Health Department of Italy.",
    "\"I believe that Sri Lanka's dairy industry will be able to reach its goal by 2030, and the government aims to implement projects in public-private partnership (PPP) with dairy processing companies by introducing new techniques to attract young people to the dairy sector,\" the Minister said.",
    "Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government has requested the Italian government to provide financial and technical support for the development of the local dairy sector. It was also mentioned that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has also expressed its support. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
