    "A peaceful, fair, and corruption-free national election is a rare achievement for a developing, financially struggling country. However, we should take pride in our Election Commission, which excelled in planning, executing, counting, and releasing the results of a significant and complex election in a remarkably short time. Additionally, the Commission effectively mitigated post-election celebrations, preventing the violence and intimidation that often follow.",
    "First, we must congratulate the Chairperson, R.M.A.L. Rathnayake, the Election Commission board members, and all staff for their outstanding work. Such recognition is seldom seen, even in the media, which tends to focus more on inflammatory stories that threaten peace.",
    "While our Election Commissions have not always been immune to political influence, including occasional improprieties, the impact of such influences was notably weaker this time. This is largely due to the exceptional professionalism of everyone involved, including the judiciary, which played a pivotal role in upholding the integrity of the election process.",

This is the path to both peace and development for our nation."
