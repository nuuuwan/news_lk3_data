Iran’s new president Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in on Tuesday, after winning an election earlier this month by promising to improve ties with the world and ease restrictions on social freedoms at home.

I first encountered Mr Jude Perera in late 2007 during a community discussion in Victoria. This gathering took place amidst the intense period of Sri Lanka’s prolonged civil war. Professor Joe Camilleri of La Trobe University’s Centre for Dialogue convened the event, which marked the inception of the Sri Lanka Community Dialogue—a year-long initiative.

Mr Jude Perera, who recently passed away at the age of seventy-one, held a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Jaffna. His professional journey spanned market research and information technology roles across Sri Lanka, New Zealand, and Australia. His memoir chronicled a personal and political odyssey—from Katana in Sri Lanka to Jaffna, then to Niue, New Zealand, and finally Melbourne, Australia. His travels were driven by both personal and political imperatives.

### The controversy relating to the policeman may not be allowed to intensify

*2024-07-30 17:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189830) · `ta`

A controversy surrounds the appointment of the Sri Lankan police chief, Tennakoon, amid concerns about democracy and the rule of law. Despite a Supreme Court injunction against his appointment due to past human rights violations and a controversial promotion, the government supports his continued service. This stance challenges the separation of powers and judicial review, potentially undermining public trust in the legal system.

🟩

As for the democracy of Sri Lanka, the police chief is trapped in the midst of a controversy that is important. The Supreme Court has issued an interim injunction, preventing his act as police chief, until he is fully investigated on all fundamental rights petitions filed against his appointment.

The government's announcement that the government will not take action in accordance with the interim injunction on Tennakoon has shocked the law respected people.. Although the country's highest court has issued such an order, the government's announcement that the Inspector General of Police will continue in his post is not in accordance with a society that ruled by law.The threat of democracy cannot be underestimated.

Addressing the parliament, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena announced that the High Court could not change the approval given by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current police chief and that he would continue in his post.

The Opposition's allegation that Ranil is protecting Rajapakse by the PA is not supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Former United National Party (UNP) parliamentarian Lakshman Vijayamanna said that Ranil Rajapaksa's campaign was also false.

He was speaking at a press conference held at the UNP headquarters in Sirikotha on Tuesday (30).

The Sri Lanka PA has decided to appoint a candidate in the upcoming presidential election.

Through this resolution, the opposition has been defending Ranil Wickremesinghe Rajapakse.. Ranil Rajapakse was campaigning against us.

But now, through the PA's resolution, the allegations made by the opposition parties against us have now become a bus.. It is certain that Ranil Wickremesinghe did not protect Rajapakse.

Ranil Wickremesinghe will contest the upcoming presidential election as an independent and pure candidate.

In the election campaigns. We are happy with this.
