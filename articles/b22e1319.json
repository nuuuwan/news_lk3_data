    "Stresses importance of acquiring strong political power to implement transformative policies and ideologies championed by NPP",
    "Says three-member Cabinet, including the President, is by no means sufficient to make their program reality",
    "Emphasises that true political power goes beyond mere numbers in Parliament and stresses importance of quantity and quality in political representation",
    "Urges NPP candidates to commit to task of restoring trust in Parliament by providing both strong representation and integrity",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday stressed the critical importance of acquiring strong political power and leadership to implement the transformative policies and ideologies championed by the National People\u2019s Party (NPP).",
    "Making his first political speech since taking office, Dissanayake addressed the NPP\u2019s Parliamentary election candidates at an event held yesterday at the Grand Monarch, Thalawathugoda.",
    "Dissanayake acknowledged the challenges the party faces, citing its current lack of sufficient political power.",
    "\u201cEven if we come up with a new ideology and program, only if there is the strongest political leadership required for it, that ideology and program can be made a reality,\u201d he said. He pointed out that the NPP\u2019s current political representation, including a three-member Cabinet headed by him, is inadequate to achieve the sweeping changes the party envisions. \u201cThere is a three-member Cabinet including the President. It is by no means sufficient to make this courageous conversion a reality,\u201d he said.",
    "Looking ahead to the 14 November Parliamentary election, Dissanayake underscored that acquiring stronger Parliamentary representation is essential for the NPP to direct its transformative agenda swiftly and effectively. \u201cThe challenge before us is to acquire that political power on 14 November. In order to quickly direct our program and activities in a transformative direction, we must acquire a stronger power in the Parliament on 14 November,\u201d he asserted.",
    "Dissanayake further emphasised that true political power goes beyond mere numbers in Parliament. He highlighted the importance of both quantity and quality in political representation. \u201cStrong power is not just about the number of heads in Parliament. It should be a quantitative representation as well as strong power represented by a large number of qualitative characteristics that society expects,\u201d he said.",
    "Reflecting on the makeup of the previous Parliament, Dissanayake noted the negative public perception of its members, who were often seen as being above the law and abusing public power. He described the outgoing Parliament as being \u201cfilled with persons who were widely viewed in a negative light\u201d by the public, particularly towards the end of its tenure in 2024.",
    "\u201cEven considering the difference between the start of the last Parliament in 2020 and its conclusion in 2024, the final year was marked by a significantly worse public perception,\u201d Dissanayake observed. He urged NPP candidates to commit themselves to the task of restoring trust in Parliament by providing both strong representation and integrity.",
    "\u201cThe NPP has been given a big role in cleaning the Parliament. Citizens are looking forward to it. The expectations placed on the NPP can be reached only on the condition of how much you dedicate yourself to it and how successful you are,\u201d Dissanayake said.",
    "Dissanayake also reflected on the NPP\u2019s recent victory in the Presidential election, which he described as a pivotal moment for Sri Lanka\u2019s political and cultural landscape. \u201cWe achieved a great victory in the last Presidential election. It was a fierce competition between the camp that stood for the continuation of the old, failed economic and political journey and the camp that we represented, advocating for a new economic, political, and cultural journey,\u201d he remarked.",
    "He acknowledged the risks and challenges faced by the electorate in making such a bold choice. \u201cFrom the people\u2019s point of view, it was a risky step they took; but also a decisive and a courageous step,\u201d he said, expressing gratitude to the voters who placed their faith in the NPP.",
    "Looking forward, Dissanayake stressed that the responsibility of building a strong and ethical Parliament now rests with the NPP candidates. \u201cYou have been entrusted with the responsibility of creating a Parliament composed of a group of people who are the majority in terms of size and have played a great role in quality, without letting the expectations of the people of our country for a quality Parliament be broken in any way,\u201d he urged.",
    "Dissanayake noted that the Presidential election victory has also triggered a political awakening across various regions of Sri Lanka. He highlighted the increased support the NPP is seeing in regions such as the North, East, and Hill Country ahead of the general election. \u201cIt is clear that the North has more faith in us in the general election than in the Presidential election. It is the same in the East and in the Hill Country,\u201d he said. He admitted that the NPP had not fully convinced voters in these regions during the Presidential race, but the victory has now sparked a greater sense of belief in the party\u2019s platform.",
    "The President concluded his speech by emphasising the need for a unified effort within the NPP, underscored by the party\u2019s motto, \u2018Malimawe Api Ekata\u2019 (Compass Stands Together for Victory). He pointed to a new era in Sri Lankan politics, where, for the first time, the idea of \u2018retiring from politics\u2019 is becoming part of the national discourse \u2013 marking a shift from the old political culture where losing or dying were the only two outcomes for politicians.",
    "\u201cSuch situations are called political transformations. Determining the behaviour of others by the influence we have on society is also a political transformation,\u201d Dissanayake said.",
    "He expressed confidence that the NPP is on the cusp of achieving a significant victory in the upcoming Parliamentary elections, urging his candidates to move forward with determination. \u201cWhile some in other parties are lamenting that they have not received nominations, we at the Compass remain united and continue to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these elements have strengthened our belief that we are on course for a significant victory in this election,\u201d he noted.",
    "The event was attended by prominent members of the NPP, including Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Cabinet Minister Vijitha Herath, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna General Secretary Tilvin Silva, and National People\u2019s Force General Secretary Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe."
