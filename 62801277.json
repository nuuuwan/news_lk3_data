    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has raised a question in parliament about profits said to have been earned by the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) from increased hydro power generation and why that benefit cannot be passed on to the consumer.",
    "Premadasa told parliament on Monday December 04 that half a million Sri Lankan electricity consumers have been disconnected from their power supply.",
    "\u201cA few million have received a red notice warning of disconnection. Officials have even visited Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero\u2019s Abhayarama temple to disconnect it illegally,\u201d he said.",
    "The monk had told reporters Monday morning that he would take up the matter with Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara.",
    "\u201cPeople of this country are living with great difficulty. I don\u2019t know if people in this house don\u2019t understand that. At a time when hydro generation has gone up and the CEB is making massive profits, this increase in tariffs is unnecessary. Half a million people have received red notice. Is this fair?\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers recently approved a proposal to change the frequency of power tariff revisions from every six months to every three months. This was after the Sri Lanka Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL), the power regulator, approved power tariff hikes by about 18 percent for domestic consumers taking the energy charge for users above 180 units to 89 rupees while hotels and industry rates were hiked by around 11 to 12 percent.",
    "Cost-reflective market pricing energy is required under an ongoing International Monetary Fund programme to stop the CEB from borrowing from state banks.",
    "Premadasa complained that he had yet to receive a response from the government to his question about the profits earned by the CEB from increased hydro generation in the wake of heavy rains and why this benefit has not been passed to consumers in the form of lower tariffs.",
    "\u201cAre we to keep our mouths shut when half a million people are going to lose their electricity. Does the government have no feeling for these consumers?\u201d he said, calling for a report to be provided to parliament detailing CEB profits.",
    "Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha said Minister Wijesekara will provide a response to Premadasa\u2019s question in the coming days.",
    "Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella, meanwhile, said CEB profits cannot be used for other government expenditure and must be relevant to the activities of the relevant ministry. (Colombo/Dec04/2023)"
