    "MullenLowe Sri Lanka was awarded the Most Effective Agency for 2022/23 at an event held on Tuesday night an award it jointly shares with Dentsu in a tie of points. The company came back strong this year to clinch the top spot after falling short by just two marks when they became runners-up the previous year breaking a stronghold which they have dominated the past decade. MullenLowe achieved the rare feat of being the only company to win the title three years in a row when they cleared the awards in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and have collectively won the title six times in just the past eight years alone.",
    "MullenLowe Sri Lanka is widely recognised for its astute creative work with a high level of strategic leverage that it creates for brands. Thayalan Bartlett the Chief Executive Officer of the MullenLowe Group said \u201cAdvertising is very simply about staying true to people, ideas, and brands.
