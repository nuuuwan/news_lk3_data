    "Fresh insights to unfold at SLDF 2024 Craft Leadership Forum",
    "South Asia, with countries like Sri Lanka and India with millennia-old craft heritages, is celebrated as a region heavy with cultural richness. However, the economic potential of these crafts and their associated creative cultures remain largely untapped. Their potential as a resource in contemporary design, and their ability to imbue stories, cultural significance and emotional value into products is yet to be fully and strategically utilised. The time has come to change that narrative.",
    "Over the past two decades, the Academy of Design has been reimagining Sri Lanka\u2019s potential in craft by blending its rich tradition of craftsmanship and the newly honed strengths in design and sustainable manufacturing, is ready to facilitate this transformation to craft a distinctive South Asian aesthetic. Positioned as an emerging creative hub for South Asia, Sri Lanka is now gearing up to lead regional conversations in merging cultural heritage with contemporary design practices. The South Asian Craft Leadership Forum, held as part of the Sri Lanka Design Festival 2024, with regional economic power India as a partner nation, sets out to champion this new direction.",

Drawing parallels to the Industrie Africa movement, which propelled African craftsmanship into global consciousness, AOD and SLDF Founder and Chairperson Linda Speldewinde commented on SLDF\u2019s 10-year plan, \u201cAOD\u2019s unique pedagogy and focus took a lead in shaping a new Sri Lankan design identity, and our vision is to collaborate with regional partners to forge a distinctive South Asian aesthetic, one that seamlessly blends heritage with modernity, shaping a globally relevant and uniquely compelling narrative.\u201d This reimagined cultural identity is not merely a tribute to tradition, but a forward-thinking blend of sustainability, contemporary design, and craftsmanship, offering fresh perspectives to a global audience.",

    "The South Asian Craft Leadership Forum dives into the transformative forces reshaping the craft and design landscapes, with key thought leaders exploring how tradition can meet modern innovation to drive economic growth.

    "Festival patron and Vogue India former editor-at-large Bandana Tewari will present the keynote address \u2018Craft Diplomacy, Cultural Sustainability and the Power of Storytelling\u2019 exploring the role of storytelling in preserving artisanal legacies. Rooted in Gandhian principles of simplicity, non-violence, and self-reliance, Tewari brings to light how craft can be a powerful tool for cultural diplomacy and sustainability in a globalised, increasingly homogenous world.

This discussion sheds light on the challenges and triumphs of creating a brand rooted in regenerative principles, offering attendees practical insights into the intersection of sustainability, agriculture, and fashion.",
    "The intersection of education, craftsmanship, and entrepreneurship offers a powerful platform for driving social change, as seen in the work of OCAD University Associate Professor of Social Innovation Design Sarah Tranum. By blending design with business principles, this approach empowers creators to not only develop aesthetically innovative products but also to embed social impact within their ventures. Tranum\u2019s focus highlights how education can equip designers with the tools to harness craftsmanship and entrepreneurial strategies for sustainable solutions, creating pathways for economic empowerment and community transformation. The forum also brings forward a distinctly Sri Lankan perspective in \u2018Craft as the Great Enabler\u2019, where AOD/SLDF Founder Linda Speldewinde discusses about how Sri Lankan craft can empower communities and bolster economic resilience, using over a decade of work as an example that can set the pace for the South Asian region. By integrating heritage with modern innovation, crafts can serve as a key driver for both export markets and tourism, positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for creative industries while preserving its cultural essence \u2014 a tried and tested model for the South Asian region.",

This emerging movement champions the balance between preserving traditional craftsmanship and embracing innovation. Through captivating stories from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, Priti highlights the growing trend of slow design, handmade creations, and small-batch production, where the provenance is as revered as the finished product. This fusion of artisanal heritage with contemporary design and technology is giving rise to limited-edition crafts that are increasingly celebrated as art by galleries and collectors worldwide.",
