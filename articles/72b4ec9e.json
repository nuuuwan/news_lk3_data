  "original_body_lines": [
    "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane and left Damascus for an unknown destination on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.",
    "Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting \u201cFreedom\u201d, witnesses said.",
    "\u201cThe tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled\u201d and \u201cwe declare the city of Damascus free\u201d, the rebel factions said on Telegram, adding that \u201cafter 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison,\u201d said the rebels.",
    "Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts of Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.",
    "The leader of Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, ordered forces Sunday not to approach official institutions in Damascus, saying they would remain under the prime minister until they are \u201cofficially\u201d handed over.",
    "\u201cTo all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former prime minister until they are officially handed over,\u201d Jolani said in a statement on Telegram, using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa instead of his nom de guerre, and adding: \u201cIt is forbidden to shoot into the air.\u201d",
    "In rural areas southwest of the capital, local youths and former rebels took advantage of the loss of authority to come to the streets in acts of defiance against the Assad family\u2019s authoritarian rule.",
    "Syrian rebels announced they gained full control over the key city of Homs early on Sunday after only a day of fighting, leaving President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s 24-year rule dangling by a thread as insurgents marched on Damascus.",
    "Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting \u201cAssad is gone, Homs is free\u201d and \u201cLong live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad\u201d.",
    "Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military.",
    "The fall of Homs gives the insurgents control over Syria\u2019s strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from the coastal region that is the stronghold of Assad\u2019s Alawite sect and where his Russian allies have a naval base and air base.",
    "Homs\u2019 capture is also a powerful symbol of the rebel movement\u2019s dramatic comeback in the 13-year-old conflict. Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out.",
    "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm \u201cthose who drop their arms\u201d.",
    "Rebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents.",
    "Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down.",
    "Syrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early Sunday that operations were ongoing to \u201ccompletely liberate\u201d the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital."
