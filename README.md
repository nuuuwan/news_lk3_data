A 34-year-old man was charged Monday with murdering two men whose remains were found in two suitcases in southwest England.

London’s Metropolitan Police said Yostin Andres Mosquera has been charged with murdering Albert Alfonso, 61, and Paul Longworth, 71. He is due to appear in a London court later Monday.

Police said the victims had previously been in a relationship and still lived together, and that the suspect had been staying with them at their west London apartment.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said “the evidence gathered so far does not suggest there was a homophobic motive” to the killings.

“I hope it will be of some reassurance that whilst enquiries are still ongoing and the investigation is at a relatively early stage, we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the two murders,” Valentine said.

வடக்கின் பெரும்பான்மை மக்களின் நம்பிக்கையை பெறக்கூடிய நடைமுறைசாத்தியமான தீர்வாக அது காணப்படவேண்டும் எனவும் அந்த குழு வேண்டுகோள் விடுத்துள்ளது.

தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தி என்பது 2022 ம் ஆண்டு மக்கள் போராட்டம் மூலம் வெளிப்பட்ட மக்கள் அபிலாசைகளுடன் தொடர்புபட்ட பிரதான இயக்கமாக தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தி மாற்றமடைந்துவருகின்றது.

இந்த நிலைமை 1947ம் ஆண்டு சிலோனின் முதலாவது தேசிய தேர்தலின் போது காணப்பட்ட நிலைமைக்கு ஒப்பானது - நாங்கள் பொன்னான வாய்ப்பை தவறவிட்டோம்.

ஆகவே எதிர்வரும் தேர்தலில் வெற்றிபெறுவதற்கும் அதன் பின்னர் இலங்கை சமூகத்தில் கடும் கருத்துவேறுபாட்டை தொடர்ந்தும் உருவாக்கிவரும் இனப்பிரச்சினை உட்பட தேசிய பிரச்சினைகளிற்கு தீர்வை காண்பதற்கும் பின்வரும் விடயங்களிற்கு முன்னுரிமைவழங்குமாறும்  நாங்கள் கேட்டுக்கொள்கின்றோம்.

Children admitted to Minnetale Hospital for drug allergies underwent investigations related to their condition.

All children have now received treatment and been discharged from the hospital after being monitored for 24 hours without any adverse effects. The director suspects environmental changes could also cause similar allergies.

ECONOMYNEXT – A court decision blocked an attempt to give freehold rights to people 20 years ago, Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, at a ceremony where 662 people in the Badulla District were given deeds.

“The “Urumaya” Program was implemented in this country in 2002 and 2003 but was halted by a court decision.”

“The government took the land from the people to build the Kotmale Reservoir and the Theldeniya Reservoir, relocating those affected to these areas,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.

When he tried to do this in 2002-03, the court said a referendum was needed to do so.

“This necessitated a new law to provide these lands under the Land Development Ordinance. I presented the draft law, but the Supreme Court ruled that a referendum was necessary to pass such legislation.”

Ramanathan was elected to the seat largely by the votes of the Sinhalese. Admittedly, he was a brilliant speaker and had held the high office of Solicitor-General. He defeated Sir Marcus Fernando, a distinguished physician and a man of rare ability in many fields.

The 125th Anniversary of the birth of Ramanathan will fall on Friday April 16, 1976. As a young man he was a hard-working lawyer who was nominated a member of the Legislative Council at the age of 28 to succeed his uncle Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy as the ‘Tamil member’. He had to give up his seat when he was appointed Solicitor-General.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank was a net seller in forex markets in June 2024, official data shows, data shows after a build-up of excess liquidity from dollar purchases up to May.

The central bank sold 57 million US dollars to banks in June and did not buy any dollars, data shows, after buying 224.5 million US dollars and selling 32 million dollars in May.

There was a build-up of excess liquidity up to 200 billion rupees after dollar purchases in April and May.
