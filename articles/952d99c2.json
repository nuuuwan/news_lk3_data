    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has expressed interest in learning from India\u2019s expertise in power and energy sector development when he met the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "The President\u2019s expression comes as India\u2019s Adani renewable energy project is facing a delay due to a raft of legal cases filed in the island nation\u2019s Supreme Court due to environmental concerns amid higher cost per tariff quoted in the Adani project.",
    "\u201cThe President expressed interest in learning from India\u2019s expertise in power and energy sector development and the digitalization process, with a view to advancing these areas in Sri Lanka with India\u2019s support,\u201d PMD said in a statement on the Dissanayake\u2019s meeting with the Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha today.",
    "\u201cThe discussion centered on strengthening the longstanding relationship between the two nations, including a detailed review of Indian-assisted projects in Sri Lanka, where progress and challenges were highlighted.\u201d",
    "The meeting also comes two weeks ahead of Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament election in which Dissanayake\u2019s Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led ruling National People\u2019s Power has an edge.",
    "An NPP member last week said Sri Lanka will revisit and discuss the Adani renewable energy project among many other key topics when a government delegation visits New Delhi in January next year on the invitation of the Indian government.",
    "The Adani deal was signed without any tender with Dissanayake\u2019s government having sought time from the court to review Adani\u2019s wind power deal in the island nation\u2019s north-western coastal town of Mannar, as several legal cases are ongoing.",
    "Before the presidential election the NPP said it will not approve any projects without open tenders and promised to review the Adani project approved under the previous government.",
    "Adani had proposed setting up 500MW of wind plants in Mannar and Pooneryn. An energy permit was approved by Sri Lanka\u2019s Sustainable Energy Authority for the Pooneryn plant for 234MW as well in February this year.",
    "Environmentalists and the Bishop of Mannar have sought legal actions saying that the plants are in the way of a migrant bird route, and that the price paid for power generated by the project is too high.",
    "Petitioners have questioned the basis for the negotiated tariff at a fixed 8.26 US cents per kilowatt-hour (KWh) for a period of 20 years, when the environmental impact assessment (EIA) was based at a cost of 4.6 US cents, potentially causing considerable financial loss to the country and a burden on consumers.",
    "In seeking relief, the petitioners urged the Supreme Court to declare that there is a violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioners and citizenry at large, declare that the decisions made to award the project to Adani as wrongful, and call for any consequential actions undertaken to be declared illegal.",
    "Long term power purchase agreements set by negotiated rates have been controversial especially after the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) law was amended to allow large plants without competitive tender. (Colombo/November 1/2024)"
