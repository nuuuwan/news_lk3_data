    "\u201cI would have never thought that the richest, the most decadent, the most interesting and the most delicious Christmas cake of all would come from Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "The Sri Lanka Christmas cake is a mix of foreign and local ingredients. The cake came from Sri Lanka\u2019s colonial period when some local ingredients were substituted (or enhanced depending on how it is viewed) with imported fruit preserves.",

    "Butter is taxed at 750 rupee a kilo duty and 400 rupee cess in additional to value added tax. Cheese has similar nationalist taxes (650 rupees + 500 rupees). As a result of protectionist taxes Sri Lanka a kilo of dairy butter under nationalist autarky, costs about 6000 rupees a kilo compared to about 2000 rupees in India.",

    "Sri Lanka experienced a series of balance of payment crises under 5 percent inflation targeting and defaulted on its foreign debt Latin America style without a war.",
    "Part of Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation through traded goods comes from the US Federal Reserve as the rupee is pegged to the US with the dollar used as the intervention currency to manage the exchange rate.",
    "The Fed has seen some of the worst monetary policy in its history under Jerome Powell, hitting levels seen in the tail end of Great Inflation.",
    "The Fed jettisoned the concept of excess reserves and also claimed inflation was due to supply chain bottlenecks (cost-push). That inflation was not monetary (or is only partly monetary) also existed in the 1970s. (Colombo/Dec25/2024)"
