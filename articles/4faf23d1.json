    "MP Rauff Hakeem says it is worrying that the arrest of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe was announced in advance by a \u2018YouTuber\u2019.",
    "Speaking in Parliament, the former minister referenced the arrest of Wickremesinghe by CID officers after recording a statement from the former president.",
    "\u201cA few days ago, there was a YouTuber who was showing his affection in a very inappropriate way, in my opinion. But then this particular YouTuber also went on record virtually announcing that the former President would be arrested.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo, it appears there\u2019s an inspired leak. This worries us,\u201d the MP stressed.",
    "The former minister explained that normally, when statements are recorded by the police, a \u2018B report\u2019 is filed before the magistrate.",
    "\u201cYou have a basic courtesy. You give it to a former head of state. Then if the magistrate felt right, his attorneys could have made submissions and the magistrate could have decided whether to remand them or bail him out.\u201d",
    "\u201cEverybody should be treated equally. But then, when it comes to a former president, at least some courtesies, minimum courtesies should be extended,\u201d Hakeem declared."
