    "The program was implemented by the Consumer and Development Banking Division and the initiative is targeted at enhancing financial literacy and livelihoods of the rural population residing in underprivileged rural outskirts of the country. Accordingly, BOC has structured a range of special programs to reach these target groups and a number of programs have already been implemented successfully. As a leading State-owned bank, BOC strongly believes that being somewhat an assistance to uplifting of living conditions of the rural population as a corporate social responsibility and accordingly, the bank launched the \u2018BOC Gammana\u2019 program as a landmark rural development initiative.",

Perera, General Manager Russel Fonseka, Deputy General Manager Branch Operations Priyal De Silva, other officials from the bank, and residents of the area.",

Simultaneously, several key programs such as enabling access to micro financing facilities through BOC Mithuru Groups and distribution of plants for home gardens were also underway.",
    "With the support of the bank, a fund has also been established to raise required funds for the proposed building for the Meegasthenna College consisting of two classrooms for Advanced Level students. Moreover, the rural library along with BOC Ran Keklu Sansadya was opened on the same day, and in support of the school handball team, new jerseys were handed over. A blood donation campaign was also organised along with these activities during these days.",
    "In addition to supporting the rural agricultural sector, a main aim of the BOC Gammana program is to enhance financial literacy among the rural population, while expanding and popularising digital banking services even to outskirts of cities.",
    "The BOC Gammana program was the first instance that a Sri Lankan bank pioneered a national project of this nature.
