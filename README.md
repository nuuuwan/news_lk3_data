### Brain damage to a schoolgirl who is fed up with a swimming lake in Colombo; Father complains to police!

*2025-10-01 17:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226616) · `ta`

The father of an 8 -year -old schoolgirl has lodged a complaint at a school in Colombo against the Colombo Swimming Club.

My son was attending a birthday party at the Colombo Swimming Association.

We did not answer the questions asked by the doctors as to how much time the son was given and when the ambulance came.

This is because the authorities of the Colombo Swimming Corporation did not provide us with the right information regarding the incident. They have no CCTV cameras.

The negligence of the Colombo Swimming Association is responsible for the brain damage to my son.

Therefore, the father said in the complaint that I would like to ask the police to conduct a proper investigation into the matter.

### US government faces brain drain as 154,000 federal workers exit this week

More than 150,000 federal employees will leave the U.S. government payroll this week after accepting buyouts - the largest single-year exodus of civil servants in nearly 80 years, triggering what unions and governance experts warn is a damaging loss of institutional expertise.

The official resignations begin on Tuesday for workers who opted into a deferred exit program that kept them on the payroll through September. The buyouts are a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s push to shrink the federal workforce, combining financial incentives with threats of dismissal for those who declined the offer.

Many left their agencies months ago, according to the federal government’s HR office, and have effectively been on paid leave.

Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said the biggest impact of this week’s exodus will be the brain drain of so many experienced civil servants, a loss of talent he says will be hard to reverse.
