  "original_body_lines": [
    "As academics based abroad who address Sri Lanka in our scholarship and creative work, we write in support of Swasthika Arulingam, a Tamil attorney-at-law and well known human rights activist who was scheduled to deliver a lecture on the subject of judicial independence in the University of Jaffna\u2019s law faculty on 31 October.",
    "Arulingam arrived at the University of Jaffna only to find that her invitation to speak had been abruptly rescinded. The administration cancelled her talk after some undergraduates expressed their opposition on the basis of a comment she had made in an earlier speech in another forum, during which she referred to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a fascist organisation.",
    "We were alarmed and disappointed to learn that Arulingam was disrespectfully prevented from delivering her invited lecture. In a post-war context in which the military and other State-aligned actors regularly violate citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and expression, the University of Jaffna must set the very highest standards for open discourse. Members of the University of Jaffna community have been pressured to be silent about violations of their and other communities\u2019 rights, as well as with regard to the memorialisation of the war dead. They have additionally faced repression at protests and in militarised contexts.",
    "Having endured such experiences, the university community must prioritise freedom of expression and diversity of thought, and should ensure that university-sponsored events featuring a range of speakers can proceed without obstacles. This is a vital part of protecting the education and advancement of students. University of Jaffna scholars should contribute to ongoing academic discourse globally as well as within the country, and to do so, its members must be able to participate in robust intellectual engagements at their home institution.",
    "A strong university makes space for all members of its community to benefit from freely and rigorously discussing diverse ideas and perspectives. For the sake of all students and scholars more broadly, we urge that the administration, faculty, and students act with all haste to re-issue Arulingam\u2019s invitation. Further, the university administration should take responsibility for making sure such an incident does not occur again.",
