    "Due to a lack of vocational education in taking care of elephants Muthu Raja, also known as Sak Surin, was sent to Thailand, Venerable Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said it was sad to hear about the sending of an elephant to its native country as the animal was badly abused while being kept at a Buddhist temple.",
    "\"We are a country enriched with Buddhist philosophy, but we have failed to treat and take care of such a tamed animal,\" he said.",
    "While explaining the situation, the Thera thanked the Thai government and the people who participated in sending back the elephant.",
    "\"Due to a lack of vocational education in taking care of elephants, a number of tamed elephants suffer. Only a few of the elephants under very rich people, under nilames, and in some homes are treated correctly. But the majority of these animals are being abused,\" he said.",
    "These tamed elephants are used for peraheras once a year, and the rest of the days they are in hotels and tourist areas. These elephants are used as a method of earning foreign exchange.",
    "Ven. Sagara Thera claimed that these elephants were used as a business that even the earth cannot not bear.",
    "Therefore, handing over elephants to temples through Sannasas should be stopped. He requested that the president intervene in this issue and prevent elephants being killed daily due to the human elephant conflicts.",
    "He blamed the Wildlife Department, saying they do not care about the elephant resource in the country.",
    "After returning Muthu Raja to Thailand, several activist groups and Thai citizens have appealed not to return the tusker to Sri Lanka. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
