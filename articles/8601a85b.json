    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka leader Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s presidential election campaign is facing a dilemma over coalition due to rivalry parties with different political ideologies, sources said.",
    "President Wickremesinghe is yet to announce his candidacy for the presidential poll which is expected to be declared by the island nation\u2019s Election Commission after July 17.",
    "However, his close allies and some ministers in the current coalition government have already started a campaign to promote him assuming that President Wickremesinghe will declare his candidacy.",
    "Three sources who spoke to EconomyNext said legislators from the main opposition center-right Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) are ready to join, but they do not want to be in coalition with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujna Peramuna (SLPP).",
    "\u201cSJB members who want to join Wickremesinghe are bit nervous because people wanted to oust SLPP in 2022 for their past sins including corruption and wrong economic policies,\u201d on source who is in a member in the core campaign strategy group told EconomyNext.",
    "Another source said majority of nationalist party SLPP are with the president, but a few key SLPP leaders do not want to back Wickremesinghe because of his market-led economic policies.",
    "\u201cSLPP does not want to be seen as backing Wickremesinghe\u2019s privatization moves. So a few leaders are worried to join the campaign and have different idea of fielding their own campaign,\u201d the second source who is indirectly involved with facilitating meeting between Wickremesinghe and legislators said.",
    "The SJB is leaned towards somewhat liberal economic policies and has ensured to treat all ethnic people equally, while SLPP has backed a state-controlled economy and has given priority for ethnic majority Sinhala Buddhists.",
    "There is no formal and transparent survey to assess the popularity of possible presidential candidates.",
    "However, an informal survey shows Opposition and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa is leading followed by Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.",
    "The same survey has shown a gradual gain for Wickremesinghe in the last three months.",
    "\u201cHe is confident of winning, but he has to win most of the undecided voters for that,\u201d a third source, who is in the campaign planning team, said.",
    "\u201cStill things are very fluid. Majority of the people still don\u2019t understand the benefits of economic recovery and the country getting out of the debt default under the current president. We will have a clear picture by end of next month.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe was elected as the president in July 2022 by the parliament after his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in fear of his life amid mass protests and outside the presidential palace.",
    "Wickremesinghe has implemented some tough economic reforms including raising taxes, imposing new taxes, freezing recruitments to state-owned companies, and privatizing loss making government-owned entities in line with commitments agreed with the IMF.",
    "Those reforms have made him unpopulour mainly among government employees and lower income groups.",
    "He has raised the salaries of government employees from April this year while has introduced a new transfer payment called Aswesuma for lower income and vulnerable groups.",
    "Sri Lanka faced an unprecedented economic crisis with a sovereign debt default in 2022. But it has recovered faster than expected under Wickremesinghe administration with difficult and unpopulour reforms.",
    "People protested against the SLPP-led government in 2022 and ousted then leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa and all his relatives from the key ministerial positions for their alleged involvement in corruption and wrong economic policies.",
    "The SLPP which had more than two-third majority in the parliament after 2020 general election, is worried about its perception and electoral performance after the economic crisis.",
    "Analysts say Wickremesinghe has a greater chance to win if he join with SJB than SLPP because of the SLPP\u2019s negative perception.",
    "Sources, however, said they are in discussions with both SLPP and SJB legislators to agree on a common programme for Wickremesinghe\u2019s presidency.",
    "Presidential election is likely to be held either in October first week or second week, Election Commission officials say.",
    "Wickremesinghe lost the parliamentary election in 2020, but entered the parliament in 2021 using the solo seat his party won through the national list. \u00a0(Colombo/July 13/2024)"
