    "Visitors and distinguished guests at the official opening of the \u2018It\u2019s About Time\u2019 Travelling History Museum at the Colombo Public Library",
    "The \u2018It\u2019s About Time\u2019 Travelling History Museum opened its doors to the public on Tuesday at the Colombo Public Library, a joint statement by the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the German Embassy said.",
    "Since its inception in February 2019, the museum has visited 11 towns across 10 districts and seven provinces, including Jaffna, Kandy, Kurunegala, Badulla, Batticaloa, Mannar, and Galle. Drawing on feedback from more than 52,000 visitors, it has been reconceptualised for a renewed visitor experience. The updated iteration will be open to the public for the first time in Colombo from 19 to 23 August, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s About Time\u2019 seeks to deepen people\u2019s understanding of Sri Lanka\u2019s post-independence history by encouraging reflection and dialogue on how Sri Lankans remember and relate to their complex and often contested past. Through interactive and multimedia exhibits, visitors are invited to look beyond history books to engage with everyday peoples\u2019 stories. The museum offers a space to explore multiple perspectives of history, reconnect with collective heritage, and consider citizens\u2019 roles in shaping Sri Lanka\u2019s future.",
    "The official opening of the museum brought together stakeholders from Government, civil society, media, and the diplomatic community, including National Integration Deputy Minister Muneer Mulaffer, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Carmen Moreno, German Embassy to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Deputy Head of Mission Sarah Hasselbarth, and Colombo Mayor Vra\u00eee Cally Balthazaar.",
    "\u201cThis travelling museum connects us to the real stories and lived experiences of Sri Lankans, giving us a chance to understand different perspectives. It offers a meaningful space to reflect on how we can build a shared future together,\u201d said Moreno.",
    "Emphasising the EU\u2019s and Germany\u2019s shared commitment to promoting innovative approaches in Sri Lanka for social cohesion, Hasselbarth noted: \u201cThis museum invites visitors to engage \u2013 through interactive exhibits, asking questions, and reflecting on different perspectives. It opens a space where people can challenge their own assumptions and learn about the experiences of others. In doing so, it transforms history from something distant and static into something living, relevant, and shared.\u201d",
    "The new iteration of the \u2018It\u2019s About Time\u2019 Traveling History Museum is implemented by the Collective for Historical Dialogue & Memory (CHDM); previous museums were implemented in collaboration with Search for Common Ground (SFCG). The museum is supported by the Strengthening Social Cohesion and Peace in Sri Lanka (SCOPE) program, which is co-funded by the EU and the German Federal Foreign Office and is implemented by GIZ in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka."
