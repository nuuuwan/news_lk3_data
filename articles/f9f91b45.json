    "Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennekoon has sworn to eradicate the country\u2019s underworld. \u201cThis is their last act. We will not tolerate this any longer. We are continuing to curb underworld activities according to a proper plan,\u201d he declared.",
    "The IGP made these remarks in response to media questions during the inauguration of a two-day workshop for police inspectors, funded by the Australian Federal Police, at the Taj Samudra Hotel yesterday.",
    "According to the IGP, over 800 individuals involved in organised crimes have been apprehended in the last four months under Operation Yukthiya.",

    "\u201cDo not put up posters claiming to be from the underworld. If you do, you will be brought to justice,\u201d he warned, referring to the ongoing poster wars with death threats reported between underworld gangs. The IGP said he has directed the Maharagama Police and intelligence services to investigate a poster recently put up near the Godigamuwa Cemetery. The poster featured an image of the notorious underworld figure Samarasinghe Arachchilage Madhush Lakshitha, also known as Makandure Madush, who was killed in October 2020.",
    "The poster included text indirectly issuing death threats to those who betrayed Madush, coinciding with the day the final rites of Sunhill Group of Companies Chairperson Surendra Wasantha Perera were held.",
    "\u201cWe will conduct investigations into who is attempting to revive the underworld which has destroyed many youth through drugs and other activities in this country,\u201d he said.",
    "The IGP mentioned that the police have also taken notice of additional posters challenging groups linked to Madhush. He acknowledged the ongoing infighting between these organised crime groups and swore to end their activities soon."
