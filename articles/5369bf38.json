    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank said it kept its policy rate unchanged at 7.75 percent, saying the stance will support steering inflation towards the target of 5 percent and help to expand the economic growth.",
    "In Sri Lanka there is a belief that high inflation is needed for growth.",
    "\u201cThe Board arrived at this decision after carefully considering both domestic and global developments,\u201d the central bank said.",
    "\u201cThe Board is of the view that the current monetary policy stance will support steering inflation towards the target of 5%.\u201d",
    "The central bank has so far been running broadly deflationary policy, providing East Asia style external stability and undershot its attempt to drive up inflation (cost of living) to 5 to 7 percent.",
    "\u201cGlobally, policy uncertainty has intensified due to the evolving trade landscape and recurring geopolitical conflicts,\u201d the central bank said.",
    "Headline inflation based on the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) turned positive in August 2025, ending eleven months of deflation.",
    "\u201cInflation is projected to gradually increase towards the target of 5% by mid-2026. Reflecting strengthening domestic demand, core inflation is also expected to pickup, and stabilise thereafter around the headline inflation target. Medium term inflation expectations remain anchored around the inflation target.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe economy is estimated to have grown by 4.8% in H1-2025. Leading indicators reflect a continuation of this momentum into Q3-2025. Credit to the private sector recorded a notable and broad-based expansion thus far in 2025.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis expansion has been supported by the low-interest-rate environment and the recovery in economic activity. The continued expansion in private sector credit is expected to further support domestic economic activity in the period ahead.\u201d",
    "The Monetary Policy Board decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at the current level of 7.75% at its meeting held yesterday. The Board arrived at this decision after carefully considering both domestic and global developments. The Board is of the view that the current monetary policy stance will support steering inflation towards the target of 5%.",

This expansion has been supported by the low-interest-rate environment and the recovery in economic activity. The continued expansion in private sector credit is expected to further support domestic economic activity in the period ahead.",
    "The external sector remained resilient, supported by improved inflows from tourism and workers\u2019 remittances, despite a widening trade deficit. Continued net foreign exchange purchases by the Central Bank have helped maintain gross official reserves at US dollars 6.2 billion by end August, amidst debt service payments. The Sri Lanka rupee remains broadly stable. All three major rating agencies have now raised Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign ratings, confirming the improved credit standing. Meanwhile, global financial conditions have eased, although geopolitical uncertainties remain.",
    "The Board will continue to monitor and assess incoming data on developments on the domestic and global fronts and emerging risks. The Board remains prepared to implement appropriate policy measures to ensure that inflation stabilises around the target, while supporting the economy to reach its potential.",
    "The release of the next regular statement on the monetary policy review will be on 26 November 2025. (Colombo/September 24/2025)"
