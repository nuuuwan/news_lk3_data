    "Richard Simon\u2019s monumental two volume history of S. Thomas\u2019 College runs into 869 quarto-sized pages, inclusive of endnotes but excluding front matter and indices of subjects and persons. The book is extremely well written, in a very erudite but engaging style, and unique in that the history of the school (founded in 1851) is interspersed with that of Lanka (i.e. its political, economic, ecclesiastical and educational landscape), covering the 200 years, from 1801 to 2001. In fact, the book is subtitled, \u201cThe entangled histories of Lanka and her greatest public school\u201d. I cannot, in this article, hope to be truly representative of Simon\u2019s magnum opus, but will focus on aspects and themes that struck me. Apart from being purely illuminating and both sobering and inspirational, history can also serve as a critique of the present, and I make some attempts at this, too.",
    "\u2013 referring, of course, to Thomians fashioned by Warden William Stone. But all Thomians, as well as S. Thomas\u2019 College itself, are also often described by the term \u2018grit\u2019 (the title of a chapter in Volume II) \u2013 literally small pieces of stone, but used metaphorically to characterise the trait of perseverance. SWRD Bandaranaike himself is portrayed as displaying this attribute through his calm demeanour on his deathbed after being fatally shot down while in office as Prime Minister. The chapter on Stone is titled \u201cThe Cornerstone\u201d, reflecting his central role in the school, not only in shaping its values, but also in overseeing its transition from Mutwal to Mt. Lavinia. I recall my grandfather saying that the early Thomians were called \u201cGal Palliye\u2019 Kollo\u201d (boys from the stone church), a reference to their grit through an analogical link to the then Anglican cathedral on their Mutwal premises, described by Bishop James Chapman (both the founder of the school and first Anglican bishop of Colombo) in his memoirs as having its foundations and columns constructed of stone. As you may have guessed, the above serves to justify the title of this article.",
    "Simon identifies four key wardens of the school while giving them appropriate chapter titles \u2013 Rev. Edward Miller, \u201cThe Paragon\u201d (1878-1891); Rev. William Buck, \u201cOne of the Boys\u201d (1896-1901); Rev. William Stone, \u201cThe Cornerstone\u201d (1901-1924); and Rev. Reginald De Saram, \u201cThe Defender\u201d (1932-1958) \u2013 after all of whom four of the school\u2019s houses are named today. As you may gather, the titles of Simon\u2019s chapters are as intriguing as their contents. The author speaks highly also of Neville de Alwis (1983-1998), who is credited with a restoration of the college after somewhat of a decline.",
    "The continuity of both funds and heads was a serious problem that S. Thomas\u2019 had in its early years, with Bishop Chapman having to intervene from time to time. Edward Miller\u2019s tenure is the one that put the school on a firm footing after such vicissitudes, which included the collapse of the coffee plantations. The patience, humility and fortitude of the Paragon would have been a key factor in such stabilisation. We should marvel at the commitment of these early pioneers of modern education in Sri Lanka, and, indeed, try to emulate their willingness to leave the comforts of the familiar for service in the uncomfortable.",
    "Although the youthful William Buck was warden for only six years, he is probably immortalised for his statement on the tension between a public school\u2019s intra and extra mural activities: \u201cA public school does not exist only, or chiefly, for the culture of the mind \u2013 there is a nobler culture even than this, the culture of character. The first and primary object of a school is to turn out men, and so long as there is an advance in the manliness and honour of our boys, I care but little what happens in other respects\u201d. This tension exists to date, with Buck\u2019s sentiments preserved in the school \u2013 the trick, however, is to ensure that there is, in fact, a tension, rather than \u2018one-way traffic\u2019 (to change the metaphor) in one direction or other. It is also interesting that the Buck House motto is \u201cMens sana in corpore sano\u201d \u2013 \u201cA healthy mind in a healthy body\u201d.",
    "We now come to William Stone, whose chapter title could even have been \u201cThe Enigma\u201d (which title Simon allocates to a separate short-lived warden). For one thing, Stone came from a working class background, and would have completed a Cambridge education probably only because of a conjectured benefactor. Simon wonders whether this is why Stone preferred Ceylonese company to that of his compatriots on his sojourn in this land. This warden was, however, one of the most erudite the school has had, being a Greek scholar of considerable repute and serving as a Classics lecturer at the University College in Colombo, after his wardenship at S. Thomas\u2019. This did not prevent him, while being warden, to introduce a \u2018Commercial\u2019 stream of study, to promote a very practical education that was readily supported by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. Stone was thus attuned to the realities of the future in his time. He also ensured, after the relocation to Mt. Lavinia, that the limited funds available were used first for constructing science labs, while the chapel had to wait its turn. His churchmanship, too, was of the non-ritualistic \u2018low church\u2019 form, and somewhat at variance with the \u2018high church\u2019 tradition that has dominated the college chapel. So, although William Stone may have been the greatest warden the school has had (\u201cThe Cornerstone\u201d, according to Simon), he certainly did not easily fit the mainstream of sentiment that the school represented; and there is surely a lesson in that.",
    "By the time Reginald De Saram became warden, the school needed a \u201cDefender\u201d \u2013 i.e. against populist Lankan sentiment that the British public school type elitist education offered at institutions like S. Thomas\u2019 had outlived its time, if not actually prevented the flowering of a more \u2018grassroots\u2019 educational system in the country. A lot of Volume II (1948-2001) is devoted to this fascinating tension, which was heightened by nationalistic feelings engendered by Ceylon\u2019s independence from British rule. De Saram is portrayed as fulfilling his \u2018defender\u2019 role admirably, in some cases even \u2018going on the offensive\u2019 (to remain with the metaphor) and stealing a march over other nationalists, especially through his fostering of an enviable array of Sinhala teachers, whose \u201cHela havula\u201d movement (one seeking to promote indigenous purity in the Sinhala language) found a home at the college. The son of one of those teachers is today a Professor of Sinhala at the University of Colombo, after having studied at S. Thomas\u2019 himself and later obtaining a doctorate from Cambridge University.",
    "In fact, although S. Thomas\u2019 is often identified with an ethos of westernised education, Simon\u2019s history makes it clear that, apart from the  Hela havula teachers, there were many subsequent nationalists of various hue who passed through its portals as students, including SWRD Bandaranaike, Anagarika Dharmapala, Ediriweera Sarachchandra and Devar Surya Sena, who is mentioned here because he provided the musical setting for the Sinhala Anglican liturgy. The book also describes how Thomians were victorious in the All-Island Inter-School Sinhala Debating Championships in 1978 \u2013 almost 50 years ago, to be sure, but just 30 years after Independence and on the 50th anniversary of the Sinhala Literary and Debating Society. So, today, on the 175th anniversary of the college, there are various competitions being held on English essay writing and oratory, open to students all over the country. That is a good way to celebrate Thomian contributions to English language competence over the years. But maybe the school should follow this up with corresponding competitions in Sinhala, as well, because she has clearly played a part in the fostering of that language, too. Arisen Ahubudu, one of the Hela havula teachers, is a household name in Sri Lanka.",
    "The school\u2019s contributions to Tamil are not so evident, maybe because institutions in Jaffna had a monopoly on that. But it did produce SJV Chelvanayakam, who is referred to in the book as having been a master at Mutwal under Warden Stone (in Volume I). He would have been a contemporary of SWRD Bandaranaike, both in school and politics, and their \u201cBanda-Chelva\u201d pact in 1957 is reported on in Volume II. Perhaps, S. Thomas\u2019 should take greater cognizance and \u2018ownership\u2019 of \u201cChelva\u201d, as they do of \u201cBanda\u201d; because while the latter is either consigned to the pages of history or blamed for all our current ills in some quarters of the South, the former is still treated with respect and affection in the North as \u201cThanthai (Father) Chelva\u201d. Maybe that could have been another chapter title for Simon to write on. It is rumoured that Banda and Chelva were members of the same college debating team as well; and perhaps S. Thomas\u2019 could think of adding Chelvanayakam\u2019s name to its English inter-school debating competition, named after Bandaranaike.",
    "Schools, such as S. Thomas\u2019 that were established in 19th century colonial Ceylon, were western in orientation because their principals or headmasters (\u2018wardens\u2019 at S. Thomas\u2019) came from the west. In fact, it was an unwritten rule that such wardens be graduates of Oxford or Cambridge Universities (and also ordained Anglican ministers). Although this was not always possible after the middle of the 20th century, many of the wardens had overseas exposure. It is this exposure that bestowed upon these schools a link to the outside world and a global perspective.",
    "There were others masters from overseas who helped in this process as well. Special mention is made of W.T. Keble, a historian who was also the first Headmaster of the Kollupitiya branch school, and R.L. Hayman, a scientist (and more pertinently an \u2018outdoorsman\u2019) who was a Headmaster at the Gurutalawa branch school. At Mt. Lavinia, however, they joined forces in fostering The Literary, Scientific and Historical Society \u2013 \u201can exclusive club for the brainiest boys, membership being by invitation only, which met every Friday evening to listen to lectures and discussions on assorted highbrow subjects\u201d (e.g. readings from Chaucer, recordings of Elizabethan madrigals, lectures on \u2018Heavy Hydrogen,\u2019 etc.,). The school has been trying, for some time now, to broaden the horizons of A/Level students through a Current Affairs class, but the above exclusivity in the domain of the mind (similar to that in a competitive sports team) may be something that will spur the best students to subsequent heights of intellectual achievement. And this was possible in the day because of teachers with such expertise and global exposure. Once again, schools like S. Thomas\u2019 appear to be seeking overseas expertise today in sports (e.g. rugby) coaches, but not so much for cultivating the mind. Rev. Roy Bowyer-Yin emulated Keble and Hayman in the field of music, and was responsible for transporting the much-loved festival of nine lessons and carols from Cambridge to Mt. Lavinia. He also helped a few boys to further their musical exploits globally.",
    "Schools that have long histories develop strong traditions. Tradition will of course be tested against current relevance, but will also serve to critique the superficial interests of immediacy. S. Thomas\u2019 had two institutions that are specifically mentioned in its Board of Governors Ordinance, namely the Divinity School and the Orphanage. The former has been relocated to the Cathedral Premises and the latter closed down in 1940. I am not calling for a re-establishment of these institutions in the school. But their presence in the premises must have surely shaped the character of the school and its boys. So, perhaps today\u2019s school can consider the setting up of contemporary structures for serving the poor, presumably in nearby communities, and exposing the boys to the process too; and also for religious education. One possibility for religious education (in its broadest sense) is a model similar to that adopted by King\u2019s College London for their Associateship of King\u2019s College (AKC), conducted in parallel with all its other programs and open to all students and staff, which is described in its website as being \u201cat the heart of the College\u2019s commitment to an international, interdisciplinary, and innovative curriculum \u2026 [and] seeks to foster an understanding of different beliefs and cultures that can be taken into wider society\u201d.",

Thomas\u2019 College Board of Governors, from 2002 to 2010, is an emeritus professor in civil engineering of the University of Moratuwa, professor at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology, and a past president of the National Academy of Sciences of Sri Lanka.)",
