  "original_body_lines": [
    "The National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection (NMCRP) today claimed that a group of people who claim to be traditional coconut oil producers are paving the way to increase the price of coconut oil in the local market.",
    "NMCRP president Ranjith Withanage said currently a coconut is sold at a high price such as Rs.120 and Rs.130 in the market.",
    "\"Due to various reasons, the price of coconut is increasing in the market. Despite the rise in coconut prices, coconut oil is sold at a fair price in the market due to efficiency in the supply,\" Withanage said.",
    "He said the aim of this group is to increase the price of coconut oil by disrupting the supply to the market and creating an artificial shortage.",
    "\"Last year, their aim was to increase the coconut oil price by disrupting the supply in the market and creating an artificial shortage. Last year this group increased the coconut oil price artificially,\" he said.",
    "\"This group produces coconut oil without using proper raw material. They artificially increased the price of coconut oil beyond that of palm oil. They forced consumers to buy the cheaper palm oil, which is harmful to the body and gained high profits,\" he said.",
    "If their attempt succeeds, the consumer in this country will not only have to buy coconut oil at a high price, but also have to buy coconut oil that has been adulterated with toxic palm oil, Withanage said warned. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
