    "\u201cWe would like to reassure our key stakeholders and the public that\u2026 the vehicles in question imported directly from the manufacturer, BYD in China, are 100 kW models,\u201d the JKCG said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThese are identical to the models offered for sale in some other international markets such as Singapore,\u201d it said.",
    "\u201cThe motor power of these vehicles has been verified through test reports issued by BYD in China and further certified by an independent testing body. As a responsible corporate, JKCG also confirms that all vehicle imports have been conducted in full compliance and applicable local regulations.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe remain committed to transparency and are cooperating fully with the authorities to provide all clarifications regarding this matter. JKCG will continue to keep its customers and the other stakeholders informed as the matter progresses.\u201d",

    "BYD in Singapore sells an Atto 3 model with a 100kW rated motor to conform to what is called a Category A certificate of entitlement in Singapore, according to the company website.",
    "A lower rated motor means its performance will be lower, and for example may not be able to accelerate as quickly as the one with the higher output motor.",

    "If it is determined that the tax applicable for a 150kW car is charged on the 100kW vehicle, a user may have to pay about 4 million rupees extra, an official source said.",
    "Already over 1,000 vehicles have been released to end users.",
    "At a meeting of the Parliament\u2019s Committee on Public Finance earlier this year, some participants raised the matter that the same model car was being charged different taxes based on the motor output declared in the documents submitted by the manufacturer.",
    "The higher taxed car appeared to have been imported as a used car from a market where 150kW BYDs are sold, which has led to the controversy. (Colombo/July 29/2025 \u2013 Updated)"
