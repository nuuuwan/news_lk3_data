    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013Sri Lanka government\u2019s failure in supplying an adequate number of passports has led to a long queue similar to what the island nation saw during the economic crisis in 2022.",
    "Sri Lanka saw long queues for fuel, cooking gas, and medicines when former leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s government ran out of foreign currency after the rupee collapsed in 2022 due to wrong economic policies.",
    "However, Rajapaksa\u2019s successor Ranil Wickremesinghe has been widely acclaimed for ending the long queues with International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed economic reforms.",
    "However, the latest queue outside the Department of Immigration and Emigration comes after the government has gone out of new passport books amid higher demand for the document that people needed to leave the country.",
    "\u201cThere is a deficiency. I apologize on behalf of the government. It happened because. We have migrated to a new electronic passport system,\u201d Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.",
    "\u201cAccording the order we placed, we will get the new passports from October 16. Until then, we will have to manage with what we have. I agree that we could have kept a large number of blank passport books and managed this better. I also accept that this should not have happened.\u201d",
    "The Department of Immigration and Emigration in a statement on Monday said it has limited the number of blank passports available at the moment and has had to limit the issuance of passports.",
    "\u201cThe government has taken the initiative to introduce new digital passports, and for that purpose, it has already invited international bidders to a foreign company,\u201d it said, adding that the tender had been already awarded.",
    "The Department of Immigration and Emigration said that taking into account the limited number of empty passports, it has made plans to provide the 50,000 units of blank passports from the foreign firm that has been awarded the tender to issue the new electronic passports.",
    "\u201cBoth passports are expected to be available on the island by the end of October or later.\u201d",
    "The Department also said that out of the total number of passports issued in the last year, only 23 percent of the new passport holders traveled abroad and urged the public to get their passport only if it is essential to travel abroad. (Colombo/August 28/2024)"
