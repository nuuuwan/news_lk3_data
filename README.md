(BBC) – It is the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen.

Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old property developer stands accused of looting one of Vietnam’s largest banks over a period of 11 years.

The numbers involved are dizzying. Truong My Lan is charged with taking out $44bn (£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. Prosecutors say $27bn may never be recovered.

The habitually secretive communist authorities have been uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They say they have summoned 2,700 people to testify. There are 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers involved.

The evidence is in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five defendants are on trial with Truong My Lan, who denies the charges. She and 13 others face a possible death sentence.

ECONOMYNEXT — A civil society activist has lodged a complaint at the Committee to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against a recent cabinet decision to increase the deposit placed by candidates contesting elections.

Jamuni Kamantha Thushara, Chairman of the Citizen’s Movement Against Fraud, Corruption, and Waste, who filed the complaint, told reporters on Wednesday April 11 that the deposit has been increased by 5,200 percent, which he claimed would give “corrupt” political parties who can afford such exorbitant rates the upper hand.

“With such a high amount, only corrupt political parties that engage in thievery can contest this election. An innocent person who can only manage to pay a small deposit can no longer contest,” said Thushara.

“Only thieving parties will be able to contest elections in the future,” he added.

Thushara also criticised the Commissioner of Elections for his support for the deposit increase citing rising election costs.

“We invited the NPP first to a debate at the economic council level. Now they’re saying because it’s a presidential election, their leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake will come. Our leader gladly accepted, but this debate still hasn’t happened as they’re giving various reasons and wasting time. I think it’s because the NPP has no plan to take the country forward,” he said.
