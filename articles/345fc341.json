    "Thousands took to the streets in Tel Aviv on Saturday to call for an end to the war in Gaza, a day after the Israeli government vowed to expand the conflict and capture Gaza City.",
    "Demonstrators waved signs and held up pictures of hostages still being held in the Palestinian territory as they called on the government to secure their release.",
    "AFP journalists at the rally estimated the number of attendees to be in the tens of thousands, while a group representing the families of hostages said as many as 100,000 people participated.",
    "Authorities did not provide an official estimate for the size of the crowd, though it dwarfed the ones at other recent anti-war rallies.",
    "\u201cWe will end with a direct message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: if you invade parts of Gaza and the hostages are murdered, we will pursue you in the town squares, in election campaigns and at every time and place,\u201d Shahar Mor Zahiro, the relative of a slain hostage, told AFP.",
    "On Friday, Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet greenlighted plans for a major operation to seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of domestic and international criticism.",
    "Foreign powers, including some of Israel\u2019s allies, have been pushing for a negotiated ceasefire to secure the hostages\u2019 return and help alleviate a humanitarian crisis in the Strip.",
    "Despite the backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Netanyahu has remained defiant over the decision.",
    "In a post on social media late Friday, Netanyahu said \u201cwe are not going to occupy Gaza -- we are going to free Gaza from Hamas\u201d.",
    "The premier has faced regular protests over the course of 22 months of war, with many rallies calling for the government to strike a deal after past truces saw hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.",
    "Out of 251 hostages captured during Hamas\u2019s 2023 attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27 the military says are dead.",
    "The Palestinian Authority (PA) on Saturday lambasted Israel\u2019s plan to expand its operations in Gaza.",
    "According to a statement carried by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa, PA president Mahmud Abbas said the plan \u201cconstitutes a new crime\u201d, and stressed \u201cthe urgent need to take action to stop it immediately\u201d.",
    "He also emphasised \u201cthe importance of enabling the State of Palestine to assume its full responsibilities in the Gaza Strip\u201d.",
    "In the same meeting that approved the Gaza City plan, the security cabinet adopted a set of principles for ending the war in Gaza that included establishing a new \u201cadministration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority\u201d.",
    "The PA, conceived as a first step towards a Palestinian state, exercises limited administration over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but does not have a presence in Hamas-run Gaza.",
    "Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said at least 37 people were killed by Israeli fire across the territory on Saturday, including 30 civilians who were waiting to collect aid.",
    "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry, figures the United Nations says are reliable.",
    "Hamas\u2019s 2023 attack on Israel -- which triggered the war -- resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, according to an AFP tally based on official figures."
