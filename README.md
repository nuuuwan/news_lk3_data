### Sri Lanka sees less election complaints than in previous years

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs Election Commission had received 188 complaints on Monday (11) when campaigning officially ceased ahead of the Parliamentary Election on November 14.

A majority of the complaints were on election law violations, with only one incident reported of actual violence.

Total complaints received by the commission since the election was declared on September 26 was 2,999.

The number of incidents are considerably less compared to the 8,683 reported in the previous parliamentary election in┬а August 2022.

Historically, Sri Lanka has seen violent incidents sometimes leading to deaths, in the run-up to general elections as not just candidates from opposing parties, but also inter-party contenders vie for preference votes (manapa pora). (Colombo/Nov13/2024)

### Explainer: Sri LankaтАЩs key political risks after parliamentary elections

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs President Anura Dissanayake faces a range of key political risks and challenges, particularly given his position as the leader of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP), a historically leftist alliance.

The NPP is tipped to win the November 14 parliamentary polls, but it is uncertain what number of seats it will gain in the 225-member legislature.

DissanayakeтАЩs JVP has been involved in two insurrections in the past, while his broader NPP coalition is accused by rivals of having no experience in handling critical issues as a ruling party in the government.

Here is a detailed overview of the major political risks and policy dilemmas for DissanayakeтАЩs government after forming an extended NPP government beyond the current three-member cabinet:

### Flights cancelled to and from IndonesiaтАЩs Bali due to volcanic ash

Several international airlines cancelled flights to and from IndonesiaтАЩs resort island of Bali on Wednesday, after further eruptions of a volcano that has spewed ash clouds as high as 10 km (32,808 ft) and forced thousands to evacuate.

Jetstar and Qantas said they had stopped flights to Bali on Wednesday for safety reasons because of volcanic ash, while plane tracking website Flightradar24 showed flights to the island by AirAsia and Virgin were also cancelled.

Bali is IndonesiaтАЩs top tourist hotspot and is a popular destination for Australian visitors.

The first eruption of the Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki on Nov. 3 in the East Nusa Tenggara province, about 800 km (497 miles)from Bali, killed at least nine people. It has since erupted repeatedly, including multiple times on Tuesday.

From Nov. 4 to Nov. 12, 80 flights in Bali were cancelled, including from Singapore, Hong Kong, and several Australian cities, said Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, general manager of BaliтАЩs Ngurah Rai airport.

### 'Our son does not commit suicide, he needs justice'

"Parents dispute suicide claim for son. Cite his helpful nature & love for life. Seek justice rather than accepting death as self-inflicted."

ЁЯЯй

The death of two students of an international school in Colombo's luxury series has caused great controversy and many questions.

Although many claimed suicide, the parents of one of the students who died, Joro Singh's parents, have rejected it and have reported that there have been many misunderstandings.

They have shared their memories of Givon and have reported the events that caused him to die.

The attitude of Jivon, who helped others, was the cause of his death on July 2 at luxury.

Jivon tried to help someone who was in need of his help that day. It was his natural attitude.

However, due to his dedication to help others, we have decided to respond to the false information about his death.

Givon did not commit suicide, and his immense love for life and the attitude of thinking favorably were his characteristics, and we are trying to protect his memories and ensure that his character is understood.

Like everyone, the government knows that the economic crisis continues to be harshly embedded in the midst of the possibility of re -climbing. National experts and international experts have pointed out this as the International Monetary Fund has said that the country is on the knife.

The action taken by the government in transporting the country through such a situation includes the action of the International Monetary Fund's assistance program.. Although the main opposition opposed the aid plan, the previous government negotiated and obtained it. The government also considered it a great success. Today's government is not involved in self -interest that can lead to massive costs, like the previous government.

The government has expressed great admirable order and control by not abuse of state resources for election purposes. This shows that today's government leaders act as a law -abiding rule, unlike the previous leaders who considered themselves as law.

A bus carrying about two dozen wedding guests fell into the Indus River in northern Pakistan on Tuesday, killing at least 18 people, officials said.

It happened in the Gilgit Baltistan region as the bus was heading to Chakwal, a city in Punjab province, government spokesman Faizullah Faraq said.

He said so far only one woman had been found alive and was being treated at a hospital. Police said rescuers will resume searching for missing passengers on Wednesday.

Police also said it was unclear what caused the crash, and officers were yet to record the lone survivorтАЩs statement.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari offered condolences and asked rescuers to expedite efforts to find missing passengers.

Road accidents are common in Pakistan due to poor infrastructure and disregard for traffic laws and safety standards. In August, 36 people were killed and dozens of others were injured in two separate bus crashes.

### Piy─Бsara Samaya: Lest History Be Forgotten

Chandrarathna BandaraтАЩs most recent novel Piy─Бsara Samaya,of which the title might be loosely translated as A Time for Flying (or even a Time to Flee), is a thought-provoking novel which offers the reader a space to connect their lived experience with the narrative. It deals with the socio-political realities which were our lived experience as Sri Lankans in the recent past. The novelistтАЩs previous work Prem─Бnishansa received the Swarnapusthaka award and the Vidyodaya award for best novel in 2022. Piy─Бsara Samaya which came out this September has themes which are in common with Prem─Бnishansa and the novel is set in such a way that the narrative deals with recent happenings in Sri Lanka. However, what is most noteworthy is its contribution to the literary genre of diasporic writing or novels of expatriation.

The novelist introduces two protagonists and through their characters offers many insights to certain aspects of life.

### Class conflict shattered, politics returned to people

I have always been struck by two distinct moments in history. First, in June 1865, during the tenure of President Abraham Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the United States of America. And yet, there were slaves who were reluctant to embrace the associated freedoms. They appeared to be too attached to their chains.

Then, in July 1945 C.W.W. Kannangara introduced an act in parliament to ensure free education for all Sri Lankans. He was compelled to debate for hours extolling the virtues of this move. There were many who attempted to throw sand in his wheels. Among the elites there were even those who argued that if this piece of legislation was passed, they wouldnтАЩt be able to find a boy to pluck coconuts on their extensive properties.
