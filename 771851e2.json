    "In response to a request made by the Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa to walk the talk and thereby put into practice what he had talked of, President Ranil Wickremeinge today told Parliament those in Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will walk towards a common journey with him soon.",
    "\u201cI must tell the President\u00a0 that he should walk the talk,\u201d Premadasa said.",
    "\u201cI will walk the talk but I would like to tell you that those in SJB will start walking with me,\u201d the President said.",
    "\u201c I assure that on one in SJB will walk with you,\u201d Opposition Leader said.",
    "Mr. Premadasa requested the President to appoint SJB MP Harsha de Silva as the chairman of the public finance committee as an act of good faith. \u201cOne wonders as to why the government cannot appoint Dr. de Silva as the Chairman of the Public Finance Committee. The President wanted our support today but it was his government which is delaying the appointment of Dr. de Silva as the Chairman of the Public Finance committee. The government has appointed protem?? chairman to get what it wants. We are ready to work as a constructive opposition and refrain from each and every thing which the government does. However we request that Dr. de Silva be appointed as a Chairman of Finance Committee,\u201d he said.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
