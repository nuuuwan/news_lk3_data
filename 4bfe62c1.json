    "Inspector General of Police (IGP) C.D Wickramaratne has been reportedly given another three months service extension by President Ranil Wickramasinghe, sources at the police headquarters said.",
    "Wickramaratne's term as the IGP had come to an end on June 26 this year after getting two extensions.",
    "His term was reportedly extended again by the President following the concerns and criticism from the opposition that the Sri Lanka Police is functioning without an IGP for more than a week and the President is unable to find a suitable replacement for the post.",
    "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told Parliament yesterday that the President\u00a0 will name the new IGP within the next 48 hours.",
    "According to the current seniority list, Senior DIG (Administration) Nilantha Jayawardena, Senior DIG (North Western Province) L.S. Pathinayake, Senior DIG (Western Province) Deshabandu Tennakoon and Senior DIG Ajith Rohana are among the names that are contesting for the topmost position."
