    "The top 1 % of Sri Lankans own 31% of the total personal wealth in the country.",
    "The bottom 50 % only owns less than 4 % of the overall wealth in the",
    "While the people\u2019s main burden and the main target of their invective is Ranil\u2019s economic policy which is ravaging their lives, the SJB targets the JVP-NPP and Anura Dissanayake much more than it does Ranil\u2019s policies. Perhaps this is why UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena proclaims \u201cthe current Opposition is also ours\u201d. (https://www.ft.lk/top-story/Presidential-stakes-hot-up/26-756516)",
    "The JVP and I were bitter enemies when it was at its most violent and ideologically extreme. Wijeweera\u2019s JVP killed my comrades and friends. At the time I strained every nerve fighting him politically, ideologically and strategically. Wijeweera had more consecutive pages (5) denouncing me by name in his magnum opus on Marxism & the Tamil Question, than he had on Velupillai Prabhakaran. None of those attacking the JVP hysterically today from right-wing positions (SLPP, UNP, SJB), accusing it of \u2018extreme socialism\u2019, have that history, those credentials. Therefore, it amuses and annoys me to hear their shrill, ignorant, misplaced and misleading denunciations of Anura Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP.",
    "I have observed the JVP\u2019s positive evolution and it reminds me of the Provisional IRA and its political-electoral wing, Sinn Fein. The JVP-NPP today is like the Sinn Fein, and Anura Dissanayake and his comrades are taking the Lankan version of the Gerry Adams-Martin McGuinness route. (By the way, I interviewed McGuinness twice).",
    "A leading Sunday paper reported a fissure in the Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) over the SJB\u2019s unwillingness to accommodate its request for a more progressive economic platform.",
    "\u2018Dr Harsha de Silva\u2026said the party has already presented two blueprints for the economy at various junctures, and a third proposal would be presented in February...De Silva notes the SJB is willing to work with any party at the election that agrees to its economic agenda and is free of corruption.\u2019 (https://www.ft.lk/front-page/2024-offers-multiple-challenges-election-mantras-will-not-solve-Harsha/44-756464)",
    "Any party that \u201cagrees to its economic agenda\u201d needn\u2019t ally with the SJB; it can merge with it. Conversely, \u201cagreeing to its economic agenda\u201d-- the \u2018blueprints\u2019-- cannot be the basis of a political alliance. That requires a broader consensus platform on economic policy.",
    "The failure of the protracted SJB-FPC talks and closing window for a Sajith-Dullas partnership provide an opening for a political breakthrough by Anura Dissanayake and the NPP. Politically, the heavy-hitters in the FPC are Dullas Alahapperuma and Prof. Charitha Herath. If Anura wins over this grouping he may secure a \u2018swing factor\u2019.",
    "The JVP has valuable political experience in a centre-left bloc led by the centre ( CBK, MR) Now, instead of a centre-left, history provides the portal for a left-centre under Left leadership, that of AKD-NPP-JVP. That\u2019s the chance the Left pioneers disastrously spurned at Sri Nissanka\u2019s residence \u2018Yamuna\u2019 in 1947.",
    "The SJB attacks Anura and the JVP on the grounds that they helped bring Mahinda Rajapaksa into office in 2005 while the pristine SJB comprises those who never once sullied themselves by supporting Mahinda. That\u2019s ironically self-incriminatory. If MR didn\u2019t win in 2005, Prabhakaran would have. The SJB-- at the time UNP-- never supported MR, but they did support Ranil who supported and saved Prabhakaran.",
    "While UNP, SJBers detested Mahinda more than they did Prabhakaran who had murdered Ranasinghe Premadasa, Ranjan Wijeratne, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali. When the decisive existential choice before the nation in wartime was \u2018MR or Ranil?\u2019 today\u2019s SJBers opted for Ranil. In 2005, the voters and the JVP were right.",
    "\u201cDr. Harsha De Silva said he anticipates the general election to take place first.\u201d (ibid)",
    "A fortnight earlier, on Siyatha TV\u2019s Aluth Katha (Dec 5th) I speculated precisely on that \u2018snap election\u2019 scenario, suggesting that in the public interest it would be tactically smarter for the electorate to pre-position the NPP as majority party in Parliament and catapult Anura in as PM, while deciding on the presidency after the candidates\u2019 TV presentations and debates. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW8Djw2-zXA)",
    "President Wickremesinghe is brimming with satisfaction over his economic stabilisation and recovery efforts. Going by all available reports, whatever and whoever is \u2018recovering\u2019 or \u2018stabilising\u2019, it is neither the citizenry at large nor Ranil\u2019s popularity.",
    "The IMF is more lucid about future prospects than Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cSocial unrest could re-emerge, fuelled by falling real incomes, including from tax rate hikes and cost-recovery pricing in the energy sector, insufficient anti-corruption efforts, and delayed local elections\u201d the report said.\u2019",
    "\u201cThe IMF expects Sri Lanka\u2019s economy to contract by 3.6% by the end of 2023, surpassing their earlier projection of a 3% contraction and the Central Bank\u2019s expectation of a contraction between 1-2%\u2026Moreover, it said that inflation is expected to edge up to 4.8% by the end-2023 following the 18% electricity tariff hike in October while further increases are projected in 2024 up to 6.6% due to tax policy measures such as the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate increases...\u201d",
    "Would you bet on an incumbent or administration imposing 18% VAT, surviving an election within the year?",
    "I was shocked and saddened when I looked in the mirror of the latest report by an unimpeachable, universally respected \u2018flagship\u2019 UN organisation. According to the UNDP\u2019s new report, we have nose-dived and crashed as a society in a cardinal respect: Inequality.",
    "The presentation came from the UNDP\u2019s Country Economist who is one of the island\u2019s most crystalline minds and articulate speakers in the field of political economy: US-educated Dr. Vagisha Gunasekara. In a meritocratic Sri Lanka, she would be Finance Minister. For a better Sri Lanka, she should be.",
    "\u2018Fragile and uneven economic recovery has further exacerbated income and wealth inequalities in the country, placing Sri Lanka among the top five most unequal countries in the Asia Pacific, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).",
    "\u2026 \u201cIn the context of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, multiple assessments and simulations speculate that previous poverty reduction gains may now be lost,\u201d said Dr. Vagisha Gunasekara, Country Economist from the UNDP Policy and Engagement Team.",
    "Even before the economic crisis, the country was grappling with prevalent disparities and enduring structural exclusions, including entrenched inequality, gender biases, and a sizable informal sector. These challenges were further exacerbated by the pandemic and economic crisis, compounded by rising inflation resulting from geopolitical conflicts. On top of this, the region and Sri Lanka are facing a triple planetary crisis\u2014 climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss, which are hitting the most vulnerable populations the hardest.",
    "Dr. Gunasekara highlighted that high income and wealth inequalities, which remain persistent, specially after the pandemic and economic crisis, are major concerns for the country.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is\u2026in the top one third of the highest unequal countries in the world, and wealth inequality is also very high. For example, the top one percent of Sri Lankans own 31 percent of the total personal wealth in the country, while the bottom 50 percent only owns less than 4 percent of the overall wealth in the country. This provides us with a snapshot of how unequal our country is,\u201d she noted.",
    "These remarks were shared at the national launch of UNDP 2024 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, titled \u2018Making Our Future: New Directions for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific,\u2019 held in Colombo.",
    "According to the report, Sri Lanka is among the top five countries exhibiting the highest wealth inequality, as measured by the wealth share of the top 10 percent, along with Thailand, China, Myanmar, and India.",
    "Although Sri Lanka scored 0.782 in the Human Development Index (HDI) in 2021, gaining 0.002 points over the previous year with a rank of 73, Dr. Gunasekara pointed out that the country loses 10.6 percent points when the HDI is adjusted for inequality.\u2019",
    "Dr. Gunasekara then focused on the phenomenon of galloping household indebtedness.",
    "\u2018\u2026she also expressed concerns about the looming indebtedness of the population, with 33.4 percent of the populace grappling with vulnerability and deprivation concerning debt-related metrics.",
    "The primary catalysts behind incurring debt included economic activities (42.5 percent), housing construction or repair (32.8 percent), and basic consumption of food, fuel, and other household expenses (19.3 percent).",
    "For households seeking funds for consumption, the primary sources of debt include pawning (31.1 percent), money lenders (24 percent), and banks (23.5 percent). In particular, urban areas had a higher proportion of households that borrowed for basic consumption (26.2 percent) compared to rural areas (17.9 percent).\u2019 (ibid)",
    "\u2018The UNDP report recommended mainstreaming human development, recalibrating growth strategy, and making change happen as the way forward.",
    "To make this happen, Dr. Gunasekara stressed that the government needs to expand people\u2019s choices by focusing on governance, enhancing civic engagement, and eliminating discrimination, while enhancing human security through social protection programmes and insurance and risk finance tools, and accelerating the transition towards carbon-neutral and climate-resilient development.\u2019 (ibid)",
    "The \u2018inequality shock\u2019 cannot be attributed to low income, because when we had a lower growth-rate and income, we didn\u2019t have anything like this unconscionable level of inequality.",
    "\u2018\u2026Clinical Nutrition Specialist Dr. Renuka Jayatissa\u2026said \u201c\u2026We estimate that 70 per cent of people are having hardships to reach a healthy diet\u2026During the current economic crisis, the micronutrient gap is getting wider due to high prices of foods...approximately half of the Sri Lankan population has some form of micronutrient deficiencies...Micronutrient deficiencies lead to potential impacts on human health and nutrition which are life threatening\u2026Millions of people will be more vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies due to diet with less diversity.\u201d\u2018",
    "The collapse in the wealth share of the bottom 50% as spotlighted by the UNDP\u2019s Dr Vagisha Gunasekara reveals not merely appalling asymmetry but also explosive economic injustice.",
    "The bottom 50% contributes far more to the national income than the paltry 4% it receives of national wealth.",
    "The top 1% which has 31% of the wealth, doesn\u2019t seem to be contributing 31% of the tax revenue.",
    "The VAT will hit both the top 1% and the bottom 50% equally, though with shatteringly unequal consequence.",
    "The inequality chasm also reflects, and causes, a shrinkage of purchasing power and consumer demand, which accelerates the downward spiral.",
    "Unlike in China and India, inequality in Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t accompany a rapid rise in general prosperity, but does accompany plummeting growth, nutrition levels and school attendance.",
    "Social indicators will worsen when the Wickremesinghe administration or a neoliberal successor accedes to the bond-holders demands next year.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka needs to enter into agreements with its official and private creditors before the second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which is expected to be concluded by the end of the first half of next year, IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer said.",
    "He said the agreements that have been entered with creditors in-principle need to be converted into real agreements before the second review. The IMF team \u2026is expected to finish the second review by June.",
    "Sri Lanka has entered into in-principle debt restructuring deals with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC)...However, Sri Lanka is yet to strike a deal with its commercial creditors or the bondholders\u2026\u2019",
    "Through its ISB bulge, the Yahapalanaya UNP of PM Ranil Wickremesinghe and his economic team contributed greatly to the crisis that engulfs us. Logically, the SJB economic troika which was present during and still defends that surge cannot be trusted with the task of rescuing us from this abyss, not least since there is no guarantee this unacknowledged, unconscionable folly will not be repeated.",
    "Social science literature confirms that when a society which is accustomed to a relatively fair share-out of wealth suddenly turns greatly unequal, it triggers rebellions, even revolutions.",
    "The solution, in the UNDP\u2019s language, is \u201cmainstreaming human development, recalibrating growth strategy, and making change happen as the way forward.\u201d",
    "We\u2019ve \u201crecalibrated growth strategy\u201d and \u201cmainstreamed human development\u201d before, and to good effect, in the late 1980s-early 1990s. There too a UN report was the catalyst.",
    "President Premadasa\u2019s poverty reduction program Janasaviya, rolled-out during the presidential election campaign of 1988, was his response to the Report of the Warnasena Rasaputram Commission on Poverty appointed by him as Prime Minister. The Rasaputram Commission was appointed after Premadasa had been shocked by a new UN report on poverty, inequality and nutrition, almost a decade of the UNP\u2019s Open Economy.",
    "Janasaviya stemmed from Premadasa\u2019s explicit development philosophy that the broad base and not the narrow apex of the social pyramid should be the priority focus of economic policy. If the base was uplifted, so would be the whole pyramid. If the base sank so too would the entire pyramid.",
    "On a panel in Colombo with the new PM in 2015, Nobel Prize winner Joe Stiglitz advised Ranil Wickremesinghe and his economic team (including the current SJB Economic Council) that \u201cequity\u201d should guide Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018post-conflict economic strategy\u2019. He was ignored and Ricardo Hausmann preferred. The latest UNDP report proves Stiglitz right, retrospectively and prospectively.",
    "Paradoxically the SJB founded and led by President Premadasa\u2019s son, is not presenting an economic policy agenda which \u201cmainstreams human development\u201d through \u201crecalibrating growth strategy\u201d--a classic Ranasinghe Premadasa move. Instead, the SJB\u2019s economists and economic program wax nostalgic about Ranil\u2019s policy model of 2001-4 and 2015-2019 (\u201cour government\u201d), while tacitly accepting his current vision.",
    "While Sajith occasionally mentions \u2018social democracy\u2019, Harsha-Eran-Kabir studiedly shun it and instead emphatically use the term \u2018social market economy\u2019 which Ranil introduced to Sri Lanka (and them) and continues to deploy. Social Democracy and \u2018social market economy\u2019 belong to competing ideological-political histories and \u2018extended families\u2019; they aren\u2019t synonymous or interoperable.",
    "When, at a glitzy conclave of the SJB\u2019s umbrella organisation of professionals, Prof Lakshman R Watawala glowingly recounted his experiences of helping implement President Premadasa\u2019s policies, criticised the SJB for hardly mentioning them, and urged Sajith to follow in his father\u2019s path, fulfilling Premadasa\u2019s vision and mission, Eran Wickramaratne flatly contradicted him, declaring \u201cthat was then; policy will be collegiate now\u201d.",
    "If Sajith continues to patronise and propagate the Harsha-Eran model instead of pivoting to his late father\u2019s, he\u2019s making the politico-existential choice to front an unsuccessful, unpopular, elitist Establishment project in decline, rather than revive a successful, pro-people, progressive one.",
    "January 2024 marks Lenin\u2019s 100th death anniversary. Anura and the JVP-NPP should:",
    "Launch a 21st century version of Lenin\u2019s New Economic Policy (NEP).",
    "Adopt Lenin\u2019s United Front policy unveiled in 1920 for national liberation struggles (Comintern 2nd Congress) and 1921 against capitalist counterrevolution/ incipient fascism (Comintern 3rd Congress).",
    "With Lenin\u2019s death, the United Front concept was abandoned until 1935, and Fascism assumed power. If AKD and the JVP-NPP adopt both the NEP and the United Front, Lenin\u2019s death centenary year-- 2024--can become Sri Lanka\u2019s Vimukthi Vasara, the Year of Liberation."
