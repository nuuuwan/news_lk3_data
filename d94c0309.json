    "The Chinese envoy specially paid most sincere appreciation and highest tribute to the nine brave divers, as well as all the countries and agencies involved in the search and rescue operation for their timely help. \u201cThis is not only a joint action to fulfil international obligations, but also a glorious mission to demonstrate the spirit of international humanitarianism,\u201d said Ambassador Qi. \u201cThe Chinese Government, the Chinese people and all the families of the crew members of the fishing boat will always remember this special friendship.\u201d",
    "Ambassador Qi further stressed that the ruthless sea only highlights the compassion of humanity. \u201cThrough this search and rescue operation, we once again feel the fraternal friendship of the Government, the people, and the military of Sri Lanka towards China.

    "Sri Lanka Navy Commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera gave a detailed introduction of the ins and outs of the rescue operation.

    "Chief of Staff and Senior Adviser on National Security to the President Sagala Rathnayake said that Sri Lanka and China have enjoyed a relationship for a long time with cooperation in fields including economy and defence. More importantly, China has helped Sri Lanka through many tough times. When it came to the moment to make the decision to carry out the rescue operation, it was not a difficult one. It was not just the international obligations but also the historic relations and connections between the governments and peoples of Sri Lanka and China that let us make the decision.",

China, together with Sri Lanka, Australia, India, Maldives, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries had then carried out a joint search and rescue, which covered a total area of nearly 20,000 square nautical miles and the maximum possible drift region of people in distress. Sri Lankan immediately sent Navy ship Vijayabahu and a diving team to the accident site, which was more than 800 nautical miles away. The Sri Lankan divers were the first to dive into the water and enter the hull at the risk of their lives."
