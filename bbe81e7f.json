  "original_body_lines": [
    "Glaciers in Asia\u2019s Hindu Kush Himalaya could lose up to 75% of their volume by century\u2019s end due to global warming, causing both dangerous flooding and water shortages for the 240 million people who live in the mountainous region, according to a new report.",
    "A team of international scientists has found that ice loss in the region, home to the famous peaks of Everest and K2, is speeding up.",
    "During the 2010s, the glaciers shed ice as much as 65% faster than they had in the preceding decade, according to the assessment by the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental scientific authority on the region.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re losing the glaciers, and we\u2019re losing them in 100 years\u2019 time,\u201d said Philippus Wester, an environmental scientist and ICIMOD fellow who was the lead author of the report.",
    "The Hindu Kush Himalaya stretches 3,500 km (2,175 miles) across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.",
    "At 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2C of warming above preindustrial temperatures, glaciers across the entire region will lose 30% to 50% of their volume by 2100, the report said.",
    "But where glaciers will melt most depends on location. At 3C of warming \u2014 what the world is roughly on track for under current climate policies \u2014 glaciers in the Eastern Himalaya, which includes Nepal and Bhutan, will lose up to 75% of their ice. At 4C of warming, that ticks up to 80%.",
    "Scientists have struggled to assess how climate change is affecting the Hindu Kush Himalaya. Unlike the European Alps and North America\u2019s Rocky Mountains, the region lacks a long historical record of field measurements that reveal whether glaciers are growing or shrinking.",
    "\u201cThere was always some uncertainty in the Himalaya \u2014 are they really melting?\u201d said Wester.",
    "In 2019, the United States declassified spy satellite images of the region\u2019s glaciers dating back to 1970, providing a new scientific baseline.",
    "Further advances in satellite technology in the past five years, alongside bolstered field efforts, have buoyed scientists\u2019 understanding of the changes underway. The report draws on data running through December 2022.",
    "\u201cWhile the knowledge of the Himalayan glaciers is still not as good as the Alps, it\u2019s now comparable to other regions like the Andes,\u201d said Tobias Bolch, a glaciologist with Graz University of Technology in Austria unaffiliated with the report.",
    "Compared with a 2019 ICIMOD assessment of the region, \u201cthere\u2019s a much higher level of confidence now in these findings,\u201d said Wester. \u201cWe have a better sense of what the loss will be through to 2100 at different levels of global warming.\u201d",
    "With this newfound understanding comes grave concern for the people living in the Hindu Kush Himalaya.",
    "The report found water flows in the region\u2019s 12 river basins, including the Ganges, Indus, and Mekong, are likely to peak around mid-century, with consequences for the more than 1.6 billion people who depend on this supply.",
    "\u201cWhile it may sound like we\u2019ll have more water because glaciers are melting at an increased rate ... too frequently it will arise as floods instead of a steady flow,\u201d said Wester. Past peak water, supplies will eventually dwindle.",
    "Many high mountain communities use glacial water and snowmelt to irrigate crops. But the timing of when snow falls has become more erratic, and there\u2019s less than there used to be.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2026 huge numbers of yak deaths because during summer they go to higher pastures,\u201d said report co-author Amina Maharjan, a senior specialist in livelihoods and migration at ICIMOD. If the snow falls too soon, \u201cthe entire area is covered in snow and they don\u2019t have grass to graze\u201d.",
    "People are now moving away from mountain communities to earn income elsewhere, she said.",
    "Melting glaciers also pose a danger to downstream communities. Runoff pools in shallow lakes, held back by rocks and debris. The risk comes when a lake overfills, bursting through its natural barrier and sending a torrent of water rushing down mountain valleys.",
    "Governments are trying to prepare for these changes. China is working to shore up the country\u2019s water supplies. And Pakistan is installing early warning systems for glacial lake outburst floods."
