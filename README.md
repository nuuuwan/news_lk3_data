However, Minister Lalgantha proposed that people should take action against the animals that destroy crops.

The Minister should implement this by introducing the legal provisions for people to use guns to chase animals, тАЭhe added.

*2024-12-09 16:56:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ananda-coomaraswamy-his-contrbution-to-understanding-art/) ┬╖ `en`

Dr. Ananda Kentish Coomaaswamy was not an Indian by birth but in his writings he showed more than any scholar of his time that he had a wider understanding of the cultural heritage of India than most. He was the only child of Sir Muthu Coomaraswamy and English mother Elizabeth Clay Beeby, and he was born at Rhineland Place in Kollupitiya, on August 22, 1871.

His father Sir Muthu Coomaraswamy was the first non-Christian to be called to the English Bar and the first Asian Knighted by Queen Victoria, was a popular figure among the socialites in London and he also enjoyed the company of Lord Palmerston, Lord Tennyson and Benjamin Disraeli who portrayed him as Kusinara in one of his novels.

### The many faceted character of Sirimavo Bandaranaike

Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and External Affairs (July 1960 тАФ August 1965)

(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Working with S W R D Bandaranaike in the 1956-1959 period had given me the opportunity of appreciating the many-faceted character of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was a devoted mother to her three children, ran her very busy and sometimes even chaotic household with a firm hand and had developed an understanding with her husband which allowed him to engage in his political pursuits with minimum interference.

### America has two presidents as the world braces for another Trump term

The election of Donald Trump as US President for yet another term has sent many world leaders scurrying for cover. Especially in the West. But even China is concerned. In the US itself, the longstanding maxim that there can only be one president at a time is being put to the test every day. Joe Biden, the outgoing president, is scrambling to salvage his legacy after a disastrous last year that has diminished all his achievements over the first three years on the domestic front.

Externally, BidenтАЩs presidency has been a monumental failure, from the impulsive withdrawal from Afghanistan that kickstarted it, to the hopelessly painful stalemate in Ukraine and the relentless mass devastation in Gaza that are dragging out its end. With the pardoning of his son Hunter Biden, the outgoing president has ceded even the little moral hump that he had over Trump.

### TongaтАЩs prime minister quits moments ahead of no-confidence motion in parliament

TongaтАЩs Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned in parliament on Monday ahead of a planned no-confidence vote in his leadership, capping a period of fraught relations between his government and TongaтАЩs king.

Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.

His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between TongaтАЩs monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010.

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-09 13:18:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) ┬╖ `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.

The Center for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) announced that it will submit a report today (09) to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, proposing measures to address wildlife populations that damage crops in Sri Lanka.

National Coordinator of CENS, Environmentalist Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, emphasized the significance of the issue and outlined the reportтАЩs recommendations.

тАЬThe population of toque macaque has increased in Sri Lanka.
