    "Even before the \u2018indelible\u2019 ink marks placed on the left little fingernails of those who voted at the September 21 presidential election had faded or washed off, the concerned authorities last Friday began receiving nomination for the November 14 parliamentary election that follows. This process will continue till October 11 when the picture will become clearer. Questions already in the minds of voters, apart from the vital one of which party and what candidates they will choose, include whether figures prominent in the contemporary political picture will bow out. Former President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s son, Daham\u2019s entry into Dilith Jayaweera\u2019s party last week, is a clear indication that Sirisena Senior is retiring from politics at least for the moment. After defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa for the presidency in 2015, Sirisena opted to return to parliament under Rajapaksa colours, indicating his desire to remain in the game as a mere MP after being President of the Republic.",
    "Will figures like Sarath Fonseka and Wijayadasa Rajapakshe follow Sirisena\u2019s example and keep off the race? At present, many political figures of recent, and not so recent vintage, appear well and truly stranded. Given the manner in which several active figures in contemporary politics aligned with runners they favoured in the presidential contest, it was obvious that they were positioning themselves for the parliamentary election that has come earlier than some of them expected. While the NPP/JVP made clear that the first executive act of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake would be to dissolve parliament, neither Sajith Premadasa nor Ranil Wickremesinghe went public with what they planed to do had they emerged winners. As a result various arrangements would surely have been place in return for support in the presidential race.",
    "The way the game is played in this so-called democratic socialist republic of ours, all kinds of deals including candidates who will run (and from where), national list slots, diplomatic appointments, corporation chairmanships and much more are demanded, and granted, in return for support. Delivery ability, of course, depends on electoral outcomes. Diana Gamage, for example, was able to negotiate a national list seat for herself in the last parliament with Sajith Premadasa in return for the recognized political party she claimed she \u201cowned.\u201d Of course Premadasa lost the August 2020 general election but was able, thanks to proportional representation, to accommodate Gamage on the SJB national list. It was not long before she jumped ship in return for a state ministry in the ruling government. Despite the challenge of her right to sit and vote in the legislature on account of her purported British citizenship, she enjoyed more than one crowded hour of glorious fame.",
    "We wager it would be hard for the ordinary voter to keep track of who jumped from which party to the other in the run-up to the last presidential poll. Last week\u2019s news was that there was no possibility now of an SJB \u2013 UNP alliance for the upcoming parliamentary election, although the two parties were in talks. Simple arithmetic on the presidential election results would have made abundantly clear to both Premadasa and Wickremesinghe that such an arrangement would have been advantageous to both sides. But that was not to be. While RW, predictably, was ever willing to let Sajith Premadasa be the prime ministerial candidate of such an alliance, he was unwilling to concede the leadership of the UNP to his one time deputy. He apparently insisted on retaining the party leadership and would not be fobbed off with a ceremonial elder statesman role in the party. So once again there will be no elephant symbol on the ballot paper and the gas cylinder will prevail.",
    "As we have often said in this space, winning an election is a major advantage for the winner if another contest follows, especially as closely as this one. The pithy Sinhala idiom, vaasi paththata hoiya, (hurrah for the winning side) explains it all. With AKD\u2019s comfortable win, although he did not clear the 50 percent plus one vote hurdle to be declared winner at the first count, he was way ahead of both Premadasa and Wickremesinghe with Namal Rajapaksa trailing behind a poor fourth. So that advantage is clearly with the NPP/JVP. The favourable post-election noises already made by the victors are most likely to have won that party more support than they commanded at the presidential election. Only its three MPs in the last parliament and a few other leaders have been visible to the public in the past. The constituents of its powerful Politbureau and Central and Executive Committees is little known. As a result the party\u2019s candidates\u2019 list for the parliamentary election will be most revealing. Voters would eagerly await its publiction to get acquainted with the future movers and shakers of government.",
    "Other factors likely excite curiosity is the future of the Rajapaksa party. Will Basil Rajapaksa, long regarded not only as the  pohottuwa\u2019s founder, but also its eminence grise return to the country to organize the SLPP campaign as he had done at all recent elections? Or would he play safe? Would Mahinda Rajapaksa conclude his very long political innings and throw his hat into the ring one last time? From what appears on television screens, he appears getting frailer by the day.",
    "The NPP/JVP will surely make a pitch for a two thirds majority in the new parliament. A simple majority, widely considered desirable in the context of past history (CBK vs. RW), is one thing. But absolute majorities such as those the country knew in 1970 and 1977 can be tyrannies. Remember Mrs. B extended the 1970 parliament by two years and JRJ the 1977 legislature by one full parliamentary term. Proportional Representation (PR) makes such majorities very difficult unlike first-past-the-post presidential elections. Hopefully there will be no two thirds. The September figures suggest this is very unlikely.",
