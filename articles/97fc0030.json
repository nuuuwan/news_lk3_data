    "A sharp increase in fatal road accidents during the past few weeks has jolted the police into inspecting vehicles to check their roadworthiness. As many as 13 lives were lost in road mishaps on Saturday (21). It is believed that many such accidents occur due to the sheer number of unroadworthy vehicles on the road, posing safety risks to motorists, passengers and pedestrians alike. The police must step up inspections and prosecute the drivers and owners of unsafe vehicles.",
    "In 2023, about 2,500 lives were lost in 2,200 road accidents in Sri Lanka, according to the police. Pedestrians accounted for the highest number of road traffic fatalities\u2013\u2013more than 740.",
    "Legal action must be instituted against those who issue bogus fitness certificates for unroadworthy vehicles, especially buses and trucks. If the existing laws do not provide for deterrent punishment for them, new ones will have to be introduced as a national priority.",
    "A World Bank (WB) report, Delivering Road Safety in Sri Lanka Leadership Priorities and Initiatives to 2030, provides a number of valuable insights into the deterioration of road safety in Sri Lanka, and spells out what needs to be done to remedy the situation. The following, inter alia, have been identified as the causative factors: an increase in the number of vehicles, poor road maintenance, improper road expansion, less scrutiny in issuing driving licences, ineffectiveness of the authorities in penalising road traffic offences, and inefficiency of public transport system. Citing anecdotal evidence, the report points out that speeding, drunk driving, fatigue, tyre bursts, animal crossing and unprotected level crossings are some other causes of road accidents. The ever-increasing narcotic addiction among drivers of heavy vehicles has also become one of the main causes of road fatalities.",
    "The aforesaid WB report informs us that Sri Lanka will need an additional investment of USD 2 billion to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.6 target of a 50% reduction in national road crash fatalities. Given Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, such a huge investment is not within the realm of possibility, but it is a goal that the country must work towards. There are several practicable measures that can be adopted to save lives in the meantime, vehicle inspections being one of them.",
    "Thanks to stern police action, drunk driving menace is believed to have been brought down to a manageable level, but there has emerged another problem\u2014narcotic addiction among bus and truck drivers.",
    "Lanka Private Bus Owners\u2019 Association President Gemunu Wijeratne is on record as having said that 50% bus drivers and conductors are addicted to drugs countrywide. In 2021, then State Minister Dilum Amunugama revealed that 80% of the bus drivers in Colombo and its suburbs worked under the influence of narcotics. A pilot project conducted by the police last year helped nab about 100 drug addicts behind the wheel. Most of them were addicted to crystal methamphetamine popularly known as ICE. This points to the pressing need for random narcotic detection tests to be increased.",
    "The least that can be done to reduce road accidents and save precious lives is to have the police step up operations to nab drug/alcohol addicts behind the wheel, rein in reckless drivers, find unroadworthy vehicles and bust rackets related to the issuance of driving licences and vehicle fitness certificates. That may be the way to make the Grim Reaper, currently in overdrive, downshift and slow down until a comprehensive road safety programme is launched with the participation of all stakeholders to achieve the SDGs.",
