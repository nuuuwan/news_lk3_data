### The president who handles another important challenge

*2024-11-02 11:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197697) · `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Sri Lankan government faces challenges in economy, travel advisories, and reconciliation. National People's Power wins local election, increasing support. New government maintains economic committee, gaining IMF confidence. Travel restrictions implemented due to terror threats. Government addresses concerns about foreign tourists' illegal activities. President announces provincial council elections to promote diversity and decentralization. Critics argue high costs, but decentralization crucial for addressing ethnic and regional disparities.

🟩

The government is very intelligent in its actions, if it is a matter of dealing with the economy, travel instructions or reconciliation process.

Experiences its resulting benefit. The victory of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha in the South is a sign that the popular population continues to increase after a month of power.

The increase in the currency expands to the national people's power, not limited to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The difference in the success of the national people's power is much greater than the last time it faced such a local election.

Earlier in 2019, the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha had two seats.

Now it has captured 15 designs. The national people's power, which received only six percent of the vote, now received 48 percent of the votes.

The increase in the victory of the National People's Power in the Local Government election is the result of the polls of voters that they will benefit after the victory of the national People's Power in the presidential election.

The nexus between climate change and human mobility has increasingly become an area of focus for research and policymaking

The nexus between climate change and human mobility has increasingly become an area of focus for researchers and policymakers in countries across the world. Climate change is transforming how people live, work, and move, and its impacts shape and influence the patterns of migration, disaster displacement, and planned relocation. Heat, droughts, floods, storms, landslides, and long-term processes such as sea level rise and increasing agricultural pests and diseases affect human mobility either directly or indirectly, ranging from seasonal rural out-migration to disaster displacement and from foreign employment to relocation out of high-risk areas.

### Sri Lanka elections: Out with the old, in with the new – for Tamils too

The sheer volume of new candidates across the north-east is indicative of a highly politicised population and new blood will emerge from this

Tamils are fed up with the status quo. The prevailing anti-establishment sentiment is reflected in the fact that the 12 seats open in the Jaffna and Vanni electoral districts are contested by over 800 contestants, the vast majority of whom are independent candidates. Addressing the mere basics, such as day-to-day economic grievances, means a lot in a country like Sri Lanka, which has been wracked by instability for decades. The splintering of Tamil parties, all vying for votes with roughly the same nationalist (or pseudo-nationalist) platforms, may also lower each party’s vote share

We can only hope that voters would choose wisely and well again, as arguably they did a brace of months back – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

As the nation gears down for the second election in the short space of two months, it is incontrovertible that the winds of change continue to whistle through the corridors of power and influence.

A quick survey of the contenders in the parliamentary polls set for 14 November shows that a slew of newcomers to the fore focus on ‘national’, ‘developmental’ and ‘progressive’ fronts.

The decks are cleared for showdown between the old guard representing a rump in the house that until recently looked like it could not be ever moved, and that the people’s aspirations as reflected in the ultimately abortive Aragalaya of 2022 would not be reflected in the legislature of 2024-9.

The 5 November election, for all its drama, jabs, and entertainment, many feel very frustrated or uninspired. Neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris has inspired serious confidence, and the choices may seem lacklustre to voters. Yet, make no mistake: the 2024 election is significant. Whether or not it ushers in an era of “tub-thumping ideology,” it has the potential to reshape the global landscape, given what is happening outside the USA. A Trump or Harris presidency would present contrasting impacts and consequences for the rest of the world, especially given their divergent views on international relations, climate policy, trade, investment, and alliances. Here are five key areas with the potential for global impact:

### Live Not By Lies – History Of The Gender Ideology

*2024-11-02 01:01:48* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/live-not-by-lies-history-of-the-gender-ideology/) · `en`

Wikipedia states that ‘gender identity’ is an individual self-conception of perceiving oneself as man or woman, as fluctuating between man and woman or being something outside of man and woman. Gender identity, despite political, social and lexical prominence, given to it, especially it in the last years; is an imagined state of selfhood. It is not science. It is an ideology.

Empirically, there exists ONLY two biological sexes. Yet, gender ideology’s Denial of Reality is not only being pressed upon children, but been taught and proselytized through western institutions in our country. Since our economic crisis, this ideology has begun to inundate our vocabulary, the corporate climate and even our political leadership.
