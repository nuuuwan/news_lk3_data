As part of the foundational work, the ISTRM will obtain suggestions and recommendations from stakeholders to finalise the legislation for establishing the CTUR. In addition, the ISTRM will undertake selected country studies where Truth Mechanisms have been established, to compile a report of lessons learnt and suggestions on the way forward for the CTUR. Further, the ISTRM will draft Procedures and Guidelines for consideration by the CTUR in implementing its mandate,\u201d the site said. (Colombo/Jun25/2024)"
