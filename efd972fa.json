    "The Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies yesterday issued a clarification in reference to certain misleading media reports that have been published in several national newspapers and social media platforms relating to the procurement of human immunoglobulin drugs under the Indian Line of Credit by the Ministry of Health.",
    "It said that in terms of the court order made by the Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was asked to obtain statements from Treasury officials concerning the procurement guidelines applicable with regard to utilising funds from the Indian Line of Credit.",
    "The Department of Public Finance and the Department of Development Finance are the relevant Treasury departments responsible for the overall procurement guidelines and the administration of the Indian Line of Credit, it said.",
    "\u201cAccordingly, the CID officials who visited the Treasury on 27 and 28 November 2023 have obtained statements from the Director, Department of Development Finance and the Deputy Director, Department of Public Finance regarding the procurement guidelines and the process followed in utilising funds from the Indian Line of Credit,\u201d the Ministry mentioned.",
    "\u201cIt is to be noted that no Treasury officials visited the CID Headquarters as claimed in the false media reports, and have only assisted the CID in understanding the procedures that should have been followed in procurement and utilising funds received from the Indian Line of Credit,\u201d the Finance Ministry said, highlighting that Treasury officials provided documents relating to communications that occurred between the relevant Departments in the Treasury and the Ministry of Health.",
