    "Anverally and Sons (Pvt) Ltd., one of Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost exporters of Ceylon Tea, has strengthened its reputation for uncompromising quality and global trust by securing ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for its state-of-the-art in-house laboratory.",
    "This internationally recognised certification, which is valid until March 2029, confirms that Anverally\u2019s laboratory operates competently and produces valid, reliable test results in accordance with rigorous global standards.",
    "The audit process was conducted by the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) and is further endorsed by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), ensuring broad acceptance of the laboratory\u2019s results in international markets.",
    "The scope of the accreditation covers chemical testing of black and green tea as well as biological testing for teas, beverages, potable water and reverse osmosis water. These capabilities enable the laboratory to comprehensively verify the safety and quality of food and agricultural products. While the laboratory currently conducts testing exclusively for in-house requirements, plans are already underway to extend services to third-party clients in the future, the company said.",
