    "Raffles, founded by Tony Bohoran in 1999, marks its 24th anniversary as a leader in Sri Lanka\u2019s banquet and catering industry. Starting from one man\u2019s commitment to deliver unparalleled excellence, the brand has remained resilient against all adversities, including the recent economic crisis and pandemic. After a successful rebound in the 2023 financial year, Raffles now looks to expand its horizons to new avenues, marking a new chapter for the legacy Tony has created.",
    "\u201cWe started out with just me and one employee in a 500 square foot space, and we\u2019ve come a long way since then,\u201d Tony Bohoran reflected. Today, Raffles is among the leading player in the food and beverages sector, all thanks to his never-ending commitment to constantly innovate, delivering on Raffles\u2019 promise of dedication, professionalism, excellence, quality and great value. \u201cIt\u2019s the core of everything that we do, and the reason behind the long-lasting customer relationships we\u2019ve developed in the past.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn a word, \u2018Resilience\u2019 is the best word to describe last year, but 2024 will be a year of \u2018Exploration,\u2019\u201d shared Tan Bohoran from Raffles\u2019 Board of Directors, revealing Raffles\u2019 entry into hospitality management, focusing on hotels and restaurants as the brand prepares to celebrate 25 years in 2024. As part of this new beginning, the brand welcomes newly appointed CEO Upul Gamage.",
