    "Sri Lanka took a significant step forward in advancing the conversation on responsible business practices with the convening of the High-Level Roundtable on Living Wage, held on 24 September 2025 at Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.",
    "Organized by the UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka (Network Sri Lanka) in collaboration with the International Labour Organization (ILO Sri Lanka), the event was hosted as A. Baur & Co.\u2019s Nationally Significant Event in its role as Patron of the Business & Human Rights Working Group of Network Sri Lanka.",
    "Taking place against the backdrop of the ILO\u2019s High-Level Regional Dialogue on Shaping the Living Wage Agenda in Asia and the Pacific in Colombo, the roundtable brought together C-Suite executives and senior business leaders from across Sri Lanka for a closed-door dialogue on the future of Living Wage in the corporate landscape. The session created a space to exchange ideas, reflections, and perspectives on one of the most pressing challenges for sustainable business and social equity.",
    "The keynote address was delivered by Luis Rodrigo Morales-Velez, Director of Policy \u2013 Industrial Relations & ILO Coordination, International Organisation of Employers (IOE), who spotlighted the global significance of operationalizing living wage frameworks while highlighting the critical role of the private sector in advancing fair and equitable work conditions, while stressing that this effort must go hand in hand with government responsibility to provide an enabling environment through sound labour market policies, effective regulation, and support for enterprise development. His remarks set the tone for the discussions that followed, bridging global labour standards with the Sri Lankan corporate context.",
    "The roundtable was also joined by ILO specialists Anoop Satpathy, Wage Specialist, Nicolas Maitre, Economist and Ravi Peiris, Senior Employer Specialist who presented key elements of the ILO conclusions on Wage Policies including living wages and contributed to the discussion relating to its advancement of living wages in the context of Sri Lanka. It was mentioned that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach in aspiring towards this objective. Sri Lanka can take note of their current practices in collective bargaining and wage and benefit fixation and move towards promoting \u2018living incomes\u2019 which will also include wages along with other benefits that support workers\u2019 living standards.",
    "The roundtable was further framed within the context of the ILO\u2019s regional deliberations on decent work and labour standards, spotlighting the global importance of fair and equitable wage practices. At the same time, it was designed to capture the Sri Lankan perspective, reflecting on the country\u2019s evolving economic conditions, workforce realities, and the growing recognition that the private sector has a pivotal role to play in creating a more just and inclusive economy. For Network Sri Lanka, convening this dialogue marked a milestone in advancing the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, particularly those related to human rights, labour, and equality. It also aligned with the UN Global Compact\u2019s Forward Faster initiative, which calls on businesses worldwide to accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, including ensuring that all employees earn a living wage.",
    "A living wage goes beyond statutory minimum requirements, ensuring that workers and their families can afford a decent standard of living. This includes access to housing, food, healthcare, education, and the ability to participate meaningfully in society. With rising costs of living and increasing demands on workers across industries, the Living Wage conversation has become a central pillar of global sustainability and human rights frameworks.",
