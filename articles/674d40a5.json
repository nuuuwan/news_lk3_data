Ruwan Kumara alias Midigama Ruwan, a notorious underworld leader, through his attorney, seeking an order to remove the officers of the Police Special Task Force (STF) from activities such as internal inspections of the Boossa High-Security Prison.",

    "In announcing the decision, the Court of Appeal bench comprising President of the Court of Appeal Justice Rohantha Abeysuriya and Priyantha Fernando stated that the petitioner has failed to present adequate evidence to establish the cause of action stated in the petition.",
