    "\u201cWe acknowledge the contributions of the Government, Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and all relevant stakeholders who played an essential role in this achievement. The steadfast commitment to aligning with the Comparability of Treatment (CoT) principle has been crucial in advancing Sri Lanka\u2019s broader economic reform agenda. We are appreciative of the quick response of the OCC countries and the IMF in this regard,\u201d The Ceylon Chamber said in a statement.",
