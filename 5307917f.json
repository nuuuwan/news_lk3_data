    "Following the Daily Mirror report on the suspension of elective cesarean section surgeries at the Kalutara Teaching Hospital due to a shortage of the anaesthetic drug Marcaine Spinal Heavy, the Health Ministry has taken action to address the issue.",
    "In a report published on the 19th, the Daily Mirror highlighted that the hospital had only 17 vials of Heavy Marcaine in stock, which would only last for approximately two days and were reserved for emergencies.",
    "In response, the Health Ministry promptly intervened by providing an additional 50 vials of the drug to the Kalutara Hospital. This measure aims to ensure the smooth continuation of elective cesarean section surgeries at the facility.",
    "Consequently, the hospital's current inventory of Marcaine Spinal Heavy stands at 67 vials, which will help meet the demand and avoid any disruptions to the surgeries.(Sheian Fernandopulle)"
