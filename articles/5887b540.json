    "Ruwanwella, Jan 28 (Daily Mirror) -\u00a0The issuing of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) has not been interrupted or stopped, but necessary steps are being taken to prevent the obstacles and provide necessary facilities to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Finance State Minister Ranjith Siambalapitiya said.",
    "He made this comment while speaking to the media after a programme in the Ruwanwella area this morning, in response to questions regarding reports that the issuing of the TIN had been disrupted.",
    "The Minister said the government expects to reduce the amount of indirect taxes as much as possible and increase the amount of direct taxes.",
    "According to the number of citizens in the country, the number of existing tax files is insufficient, and steps were taken to open new tax files for 14 social groups that were identified as earning various incomes last year, the Minister said.",
    "Even though steps have been taken to provide a TIN to all 18-year-olds this year, the IRD has identified several problems, such as insufficient equipment, the Minister said.",
    "But during a long review meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat last week, as solutions to these problems, steps were taken to provide a range of solutions, including permitting the IRD to recruit personnel, hire graduates who leave the university as trainees under reasonable payments, and accordingly emphasised that no work related to the issue of TIN has been allowed to be disrupted."
