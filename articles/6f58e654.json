    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Amid increasing public grumbling over delays in delivering on Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake government\u2019s election promises on the economic front and political accountability, authorities have initiated a fresh series of arrests targeting prominent political figures, including former president Ranil Wickremesinghe, over various allegations.",
    "The crackdown underscores a commitment to addressing long-standing issues of governance and restoring public trust, analysts say.",
    "President Dissanayake\u2019s ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) in the run-up to last year\u2019s presidential election promised investigations into a raft of past alleged corrupt deals, murders, and the Easter Sunday attack, holding wrong doers accountable, and a prosperous economy.",

    "Former Sri Lanka president\u2019s arrest and subsequent bail out marked one of the most controversial moments in the island\u2019s recent political history and sparked heated debate over law, accountability, and the treatment of political leaders. Wickremesinghe, who had served six terms as prime minister before becoming president during the height of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2022 economic crisis, was taken into custody on allegations tied to spending government funds on an alleged private visit to the United Kingdom during his presidential tenure in 2023. His arrest drew sharp reactions both domestically and internationally, with supporters calling it a politically motivated move by his rivals, while critics argued it was a long-overdue step toward holding leaders accountable for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic collapse. The decision to release him on bail underscored the delicate balance between pursuing justice and maintaining political stability, as many feared that detaining a former head of state without due process could deepen polarization at a time when the country is still struggling to recover.",
