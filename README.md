The leader of the Tamil People's Alliance CV Wigneswaran has accused Sumanthiran of confusion over the ongoing initiatives of the Tamil general candidate in the presidential election.

When asked about the Tamil general candidate, MA Sumanthiran's arrangement was held in Jaffna.

I have no invitation to this meeting on the Tamil general candidate. But such concept meetings are aimed at distracting us.

The civil society has come to the conclusion that one of the Tamil people is to be a common candidate. They are continuing to talk to the people and many political parties about the next steps.

Thus, when the general position is taken and strengthened, it is a distraction to bring this issue out of the public and call it an exchange of opinion.

If someone wants to say something against this position, let us say anything. We will give the answers.

This means that if the general candidate comes up, the Tamil people will not vote, or we are ready to give the answers to any reason.

A census by Sri Lanka’s Rubber Development Department had found that the area cultivated had fallen from 138,000 hectares to 98,250 hectares.

### US billionaire plans submersible trip to Titanic wreck

BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

Ohio tycoon and adventurer Larry Connor and Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines, say they want to take a sub to a depth of around 3,800m (12,467ft) to see the shipwreck in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr Connor’s company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer – the “4000” refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.

ECONMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s retail sales are picking up and private credit is expected to follow in the second half of the year if businesses begin investing for expansion, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

Though private credit is positive it is still ‘sluggish’ , the central bank said.

Businesses are trying to de-leverage after a currency crisis, and also re-negotiate old loans with lower interest rates as complaints from the SME sector shows.

De-leveraging is part of a credit cycle that improves the balance sheets of business across the board and leaves them in a stronger position to expand in the future.

To expand however retail sales have to pick up. Capital investments then start as existing capacity or slack runs out and there is more confidence in the future.

“We have seen retail sales picking up in the recent past,” Governor Weerasinghe said. “I think that will push up some of the SME borrowings in the coming months.”

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is tightening governance of state banks to reduce state bank lending, especially to loss-making state enterprises, which have been used for off-budget spending in the past, a finance ministry statement said.

“The balance sheets of state-owned banks have been used to absorb losses of State-owned Enterprises and help finance large fiscal deficits, thereby delaying reforms and accumulating debts, which contribute to the economic crisis,” the statement said.

State banks in the future will finance SOEs on commercial terms, competing with private sector banks. Any dollar loans will be in line with their net open position exposures.

Loans to loss making SOEs beyond 5 percent of equity will require special board approval and risk management sign off.

Any loans against Treasury guarantees will be subject to a ceiling under an upcoming fiscal management law.
