    "Whilst it is inevitable that the interest accruing to EPF/ETF will be reduced on account of DDO (which is also a must), I am of the opinion that management of the above funds should be handled by another statutory body and therefore these have to be divested from the Central Bank as there is obviously a conflict of interest.",
    "How about merging both these funds so as to minimise the cost of administering and managing it and also making the operation more feasible?",
    "Over to the CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and President Ranil Wickremesinghe for their consideration of the above two proposals."
