    "Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan\u2019s eastern seaboard - devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - was ordered to evacuate.",
    "\u201cToday\u2019s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,\u201d Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.",
    "A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 feet) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.",
    "The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km (12 miles), and was centred 119 km (74 miles) east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000. It revised the magnitude up from 8.0 earlier, and reported a strong aftershock of magnitude 6.9 soon after.",
    "The Japan Weather Agency upgraded its warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10 feet) to reach large coastal areas starting around 0100 GMT. Public broadcaster NHK said evacuation orders had been issued by the government for some areas.",

    "Waves reaching more than 3 metres were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3 metres were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the U.S. West Coast.",
    "Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. \u201cTake Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,\u201d the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.",
    "The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.",
    "Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia\u2019s TASS state news agency.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,\u201d Melnikov said.",

    "\u201cHowever, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high ... as one might expect from such a magnitude,\u201d said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.",
    "\u201cAftershocks are currently ongoing ... Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.\u201d",
    "Kamchatka and Russia\u2019s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."
