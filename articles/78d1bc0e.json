    "Bangladesh will hold its first elections since protests toppled its former prime minister next February, the country\u2019s interim leader said on the anniversary of her overthrow.",
    "Muhammad Yunus made the announcement at the end of a day of celebrations for what some have called the country\u2019s \u201csecond liberation\u201d.",
    "Sheikh Hasina fled to India on 5 August last year, following weeks of student-led protests, bringing an end to 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule.",
    "Nobel laureate Yunus was brought in to head a caretaker government days later, promising reforms which some say he has struggled to deliver amid continuing political turmoil and a struggle to maintain law and order.",
    "Among the issues dividing the country\u2019s politicians has been the date of the election. Yunus initially suggested June 2026 as a potential date.",
    "However, representatives of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), as well as the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party and the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP), all joined Yunus on stage in the capital Dhaka on Tuesday.",
    "Later, Yunus said he would write to the Election Commission to request the vote be held \u201cbefore Ramadan in February 2026\u201d.",
    "\u201cFor many years, none of us have been able to vote,\u201d the 85-year-old said in a televised broadcast. \u201cThis time, we will all vote. No one will be left out. Let us all be able to say, \u2018I cast my vote to set the country on the path to building a new Bangladesh\u2019.\u201d",
    "Tuesday also saw Yunus reiterate promises on widespread reform, reading out the \u201cJuly Declaration\u201d, which seeks to recognise the student-led protests which toppled Hasina in the constitution.",
    "Hasina\u2019s time in office was marked by widespread allegations of human rights violations and the murder and jailing of political rivals. Members of the Awami League government ruthlessly cracked down on dissent. The BBC has spoken to numerous people who were \u201cdisappeared\u201d into a network of secret jails across the country.",
    "But it was the student-led protest against a civil service jobs quota system which escalated into calls for the government to stand aside in July and August 2024 that eventually prompted Hasina to flee.",
    "The government collapsed, and the Awami League has since been banned. Analysts note hundreds of Awami League supporters have been detained without trial over the last 12 months."
