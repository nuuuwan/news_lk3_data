    "The alleged brutal police attack on the young man resulted in the surgical removal of one of his testicles at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital on April 9.",
    "In a statement, the BASL observed that the perpetrators must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.",
    "The BASL vehemently condemns any use of brutality by police officers carrying out their official duties.",
    "\"We underscore the obligations enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which unequivocally prohibits torture or any form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Such actions also stand in stark violation of Article 11 of our Constitution, which guarantees freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\" the BASL statement added.",
    "The BASL further stated that it will be closely monitoring this case and urges the authorities to take all necessary legal measures to ensure such heinous acts are not repeated.",
