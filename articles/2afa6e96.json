    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says reforms have lead to positive incomes, including an increase in reserves.",
    "\u201cThe reforms have started to yield positive outcomes, reflecting significant progress in multiple areas. Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves have seen a significant increase, reaching USD 5.5 billion by the end of April 2024,\u201d Semasinghe said on social media platform X (twitter).",
    "\u201cAdditionally, the Sri Lankan rupee has appreciated by approximately 8 % against the US dollar so far in 2024. This will boosts investor confidence and enhances the country\u2019s ability to manage external shocks and meet international obligations and enhance confidence on the economy.",
    "\u201cThe appreciation of the rupee can help lower inflation and reduce the overall cost of living and make it easier for the government and businesses to service foreign debt, thereby improving our financial reputation globally. Further, will improve the trade balance by potentially reducing the trade deficit.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation was 1.5 percent in the 12-months to April 2024, measured by the widely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index, data from the state debt office showed.",
    "The CCPI Index fell 0.8 percent, to 195.2 points in the month of April after falling 1.9 percent in March.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has been operating largely deflationary policy, since September 2022, except perhaps in December 2023, and also allowed the rupee to appreciate in the balance of payments surplus it created.(Colombo/May28/2024)"
