  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.",
    "The campaign provided no specific evidence of Iran\u2019s involvement, but the claim comes a day after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign agents\u2019 attempts to interfere in the U.S. campaign in 2024.",
    "It cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d",
    "Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung blamed the hack on \u201cforeign sources hostile to the United States.\u201d A spokesperson for the National Security Council said in a statement that it takes any report of improper foreign interference \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and condemns any government or entity that attempts to undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions, but said it deferred to the Justice Department on this matter.",
    "Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. \u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d the mission told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\u201d",
    "However, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also long has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.",
    "The U.S. Justice Department this past week unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani national with ties to Iran alleged to have plotted assassination attempts against political figures in the United States, including potentially Trump, and to have sought to hire purported hitmen who were actually undercover law enforcement officials. Court documents in that case pointedly noted a desire by Iran to conduct operations against perceived enemies of the regime and to avenge the killing of Soleimani.",
    "Politico first reported Saturday on the hack. The outlet reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \u201cRobert\u201d \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.",
    "\u201cThese documents were obtained illegally\u201d and \u201cintended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\u201d Cheung said.",
    "He pointed to the Microsoft report issued Friday and its conclusions that \u201cIranian hackers broke into the account of a \u2018high ranking official\u2019 on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump\u2019s selection of a vice presidential nominee.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Cheung said, adding a warning that \u201cany media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America\u2019s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\u201d",
    "Cheung did not immediately respond to questions about the campaign\u2019s interactions with Microsoft on the matter. Microsoft said Saturday it had no comment beyond its blog post and Friday report.",
    "In that report, Microsoft stated that \u201cforeign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity.\u201d",
    "The analysis continued: \u201cIranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three U.S. election cycles. Iran\u2019s operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\u201d",
    "\u201cRecent activity suggests the Iranian regime \u2014 along with the Kremlin \u2014 may be equally engaged in election 2024,\u201d Microsoft concluded.",
    "Specifically, the report detailed that in June 2024, an Iranian military intelligence unit, Mint Sandstorm, sent a phishing email to an American presidential campaign via the compromised account of a former adviser.",
    "\u201cThe phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain,\u201d the report states.",
    "Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported hacking or on the Democratic nominee\u2019s cybersecurity protocols."
