  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday warned that the U.S. intends to hit Iran with new sanctions in coming days over its unprecedented attack on Israel, and these actions could seek to reduce Iran\u2019s capacity to export oil.",
    "\u201cWith respect to sanctions, I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days,\u201d Yellen said told a news conference on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t preview our sanctions tools. But in discussions I\u2019ve had, all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table,\u201d Yellen added.",
    "She said that the Treasury and State Department have taken previous action to contain Iran\u2019s \u201cdestabilizing\u201d behavior by diminishing its ability to export oil.",
    "\u201cClearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do. I don\u2019t want to preview our actual sanctions activities, but certainly that remains in focus as a possible area that we could address.\u201d",
    "Treasury was working to enlist the aid of China, G7 partners and other major global suppliers to erode Iran\u2019s ability to continue to export oil and to get the microelectronics needed for the drones it used to attack Israel and was selling to Russia, a senior Treasury official told reporters.",
    "The official said a jump in oil prices had been driven mainly by geopolitical uncertainty, not U.S. sanctions, and noted that past sanctions had not led to oil price increases.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have conversations with all major suppliers around the world. That includes countries in the G7; that includes China. All of these countries have to play a role in constraining Iran\u2019s ability to get access to the goods they are using to build weapons,\u201d the official said.",
    "In prepared remarks, Yellen said Iran\u2019s attack on Israel last weekend and its financing of militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq threatened stability in the Middle East and could cause economic spillovers.",
    "The United States is using financial sanctions to isolate Iran and disrupt its ability to fund proxy groups and support Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, Yellen said.",
    "Treasury has targeted more than 500 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies since the start of the Biden administration in January 2021, Yellen said.",
    "That has included targeting Iran\u2019s drone and missile programs and its financing of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iraqi militia groups, she said.",
    "\u201cFrom this weekend\u2019s attack to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, Iran\u2019s actions threaten the region\u2019s stability and could cause economic spillovers,\u201d Yellen said, without giving details.",
    "Iran on Saturday launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed elite military officers.",
    "Israel\u2019s military said that it shot down almost all the drones and missiles, and that the attack caused no deaths, but the situation has increased fears of open warfare between the longtime foes.",
    "In Gaza, more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive launched against Hamas after the group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",
    "Yellen said Washington was continuing to use economic tools to pressure Hamas, but said Treasury was emphasizing that its sanctions should not impede life-saving aid.",
    "She called for urgent action to end Palestinian suffering in the narrow enclave, noting that Gaza\u2019s entire population of more than 2 million people was facing acute food insecurity and that most of the population had been displaced.",
    "\u201cIt is incumbent on all of us here at these meetings to do everything in our power to end this suffering,\u201d she said.",
    "Yellen noted that Washington was also using sanctions to target extreme settler violence in the West Bank, while working to ensure a functioning banking system there and supporting IMF programs in Jordan and Egypt."
