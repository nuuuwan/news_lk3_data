    "Dambulla, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka's T20 captain lashed out at the umpiring during the third and final T20I against Afghanistan at Palekelle on Wednesday, claiming that a missed no ball call in the final over influenced his team's three-run defeat.",
    "With 11 runs needed in the final three balls for Sri Lanka to win, a full toss from Afghanistan's fast bowler Wafadar Mohammad soared above the waist of all-rounder Kamindu Mendis, as he stepped out of the crease and attempted to heave the ball onto the leg side.",
    "With the no ball not signaled, Kamindu Mendis pleaded with umpires Ravindra Wimalasiri and square leg umpire Lyndon Hannibal to review the call, but the umpires chose not to.",
    "\"To be honest, this is not something that can happen in an international cricket match. If it was just above the waist, then it's understandable, but had that gone a little higher, it would have hit the batsman on the head!\" a visibly annoyed Hasaranga told journalists after the match.",
    "\"If he can't see that, then he's not fit enough to be an international-level umpire. It will be bettter if he did another job.\"",
    "A wide off the next delivery reduced the equation to 10 runs off two balls, but Mendis managed just six runs to give Afghanistan a three-run win.",
    "\"Batsmen used to be able to review waist-high no balls, if I remember correctly, but the ICC have changed that rule. But if the third umpire can call front-foot no-balls, then there is no reason that he can't also call waist-high no balls. The umpire could have also checked with the third umpire if he wasn't sure, but he chose not to do that as well. I dont know what was going through his mind,\" Hasaranga added.",
    "Hasaranga was seen arguing with umpires after the match, as fast bowler Binura Fernando held the Sri Lankan captain back, with coach Chris Silverwood also seen animatedly speaking to the officials."
