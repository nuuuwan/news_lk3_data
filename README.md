Efforts to swiftly end the US government shutdown collapsed Wednesday (Oct 1) as Democrats in Congress went home without resolving a funding stand-off with President Donald Trump - and the White House threatened public sector jobs.

Federal funding expired at midnight after Trump and lawmakers failed to agree on a deal to keep the lights on, prompting agencies to wind down services, while the White House warned of “imminent” firings of public sector workers.

Senate Democrats - who are demanding extended health care subsidies for low-income families - refused to help the majority Republicans approve a House-passed Bill that would have reopened the government for several weeks while negotiations continue.

Voting in the Senate is now adjourned until Friday, meaning hopes for a quick resolution have been frustrated.

Around 750,000 federal employees are expected to be placed on furlough - a kind of enforced leave, with pay withheld until they return to work.

### Former Congolese president sentenced to death for war crimes

Former Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila has been sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes and treason.

The charges concern accusations that Kabila has been supporting the M23, a rebel group who have wreaked devastation across the country’s eastern region.

Kabila was convicted on Friday by a military court of treason, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, including murder, sexual assault, torture and insurrection. He denied the charges, but did not appear in court to defend himself.

The ex-president rejected the case as “arbitrary” and said the courts were being used as an “instrument of oppression”. His current whereabouts are unknown.

One of his allies and a former minister, Kikaya Bin Karubi, told the BBC’s Newsday programme that the whole trial had been “theatrical” and was an example of the dictatorship of President Félix Tshisekedi. He said the court had not seen any evidence linking Kabila to the M23 rebel group.
