### Minority groups’ representation in Sri Lanka’s Parliament splintering: Research

ECONOMYNEXT – Representation of minority groups in Sri Lanka’s Parliament is in danger of weakening in the upcoming November 14 elections, which could affect their rights, an European Commission funded study has revealed.

Research by Oxford Brookes University as part of the Minority empowerment for democracy and pluralism programme revealed that major national parties have successively reduced the space within their parties for minorities to participate and raise their issues.

Minority ethnic parties are also divided and their campaigning is shaped by the majority agenda rather than the needs and rights of their communities.

“The main national parties in Sri Lanka have had a history of nominating representatives from minority communities who have gone on to take leadership positions. This is changing now with minority politicians in these parties often feeling isolated and finding fewer opportunities to raise minority rights issues,” lead researcher Dr Farah Mihlar said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Mariam Riza, who is running for Lord Mayor of Melbourne as the Liberal Party candidate wants to make the city hum with life by driving policies to fill empty buildings, boost small businesses and bring people back to the central business district.

Riza, a long time resident of Melbourne, says the city hummed with life before Covid. But parts of the business district started to lose their bustle and vacancies are now growing in buildings.

“It was a thriving city,” Riza told EconomyNext during a visit to Colombo. “And during COVID, it was the start of the decline of the city. Shopfronts started getting empty.

“Office complexes had less people coming in. That created empty or hot spots and then safety became a significant issue in the city as well.”

“It was sad to see a city go downhill, basically. And Melbourne is such a successful city. If we don’t nip these things in the bud and make course-corrective actions, you then set a city on a path of decline.

### Sri Lanka’s CDB ‘BBB(lka)’ rating confirmed by Fitch; Outlook Stable

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed Citizens Development Business Finance PLC’s (CDB) National Long-Term Rating at ‘BBB(lka)’ with a Stable Outlook.

CDB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest finance and leasing companies with key exposure to vehicle financing and gold-backed lending, which accounted for 75% and 18% of gross loans, Fitch noted.

“We expect three-wheeler exposure to decline further while gold and four-wheeler loans continue to grow. This should be mildly positive for blended asset quality, if managed well.”

A gradual easing in vehicle import bans may further underpin growth, albeit with some collateral value risk, Fitch said.

Fitch Ratings – Colombo – 04 Oct 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citizens Development Business Finance PLC’s (CDB) National Long-Term Rating at ‘BBB(lka)’ with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed CDB’s subordinated debt rating at ‘BB+(lka)’.
