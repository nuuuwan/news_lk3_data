    "March 20 - The '1990 Suwa Seriya' ambulance service in Sri Lanka has garnered high praise from the World Bank, lauding it as one of the most advanced and efficient emergency medical services worldwide.",
    "According to Martin Raiser, Vice President of the World Bank Group's South Asia Region, the service has been instrumental in saving the lives of countless critically ill or injured individuals.",
    "Raiser commended the service for its exceptional response time, noting that patients receive urgent care within 12 minutes of placing a call, a benchmark unmatched by many other ambulance services globally. He particularly highlighted the service's pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing its role in transporting nearly 175,000 COVID-19 patients to hospitals.",
    "Despite its initial focus on urban areas, Raiser pointed out that a significant portion of Suwa Seriya's emergency calls now originate from rural regions, indicating its widespread impact across the country. He attributed the success of the service to local innovation and funding, with technology developed entirely within Sri Lanka's software development community.",
    "Established through a dedicated Act of Parliament in 2018, the '1990 Suwa Seriya' operates with the agility and efficiency of a private sector entity, owing to bipartisan support and effective governance structures. Raiser underscored the organization's commitment to ongoing improvement, driven by technology and supported by private sector volunteers on its governing board.",
    "Highlighting the pivotal role of digitization, Raiser emphasized the service's use of digital integration to enhance efficiency and speed. From deploying ambulances using algorithms to digitally tracking fuel levels, Suwa Seriya has leveraged digital innovation to transform emergency healthcare in Sri Lanka.",
    "By addressing gaps in pre-hospital care and enhancing connectivity between emergency services and primary care facilities, '1990 Suwa Seriya' is not only saving lives but also bolstering Sri Lanka's healthcare system as a whole. Raiser concluded by commending the service's significant contribution to providing a second chance at life for millions of critically injured individuals."
