    "As Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal juncture, striving to redefine its economic landscape and cement its position as a global competitor, a chorus of influential voices is calling for a fundamental revolution in leadership. At the 2025 International HR Conference, experts convened to argue that building a world-class workforce is not a matter of incremental adjustments but requires a profound cultural shift, a courageous commitment to gender inclusion, and a vision bold enough to disrupt the status quo.",
    "The panel discussion, aptly titled \u201cTransformative Leadership for a World-Class Workforce,\u201d served as the intellectual epicentre of the conference. Held at the Monarch Imperial in Kotte and impeccably organised by the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) Sri Lanka, the session brought together a formidable assembly of corporate titans. Moderated by the esteemed Senior Professor Ajantha Dharmasiri, former CIPM president and chair of the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), the panel featured Andrew Bryant, an Executive Leadership Coach and founder of Self Leadership International; Sashi Kandambi, the Chief Executive Officer of National Savings Bank; Pradip Pandey, Managing Director at Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka; and Ravi Jayawardena, Group CEO of Maliban Group. Together, they deconstructed the modern challenges of leadership and offered a compelling blueprint for the future.",
    "The dialogue opened with a foundational truth from Andrew Bryant, an internationally renowned leadership coach whose message was both simple and profound: effective leadership is an inside-out process. \u201cYou can\u2019t lead others unless you first lead yourself,\u201d he stated, cutting through the corporate jargon that often obscures this essential principle. He argued that leadership is not defined by mission statements etched on boardroom walls or titles on business cards, but by the consistent, observable behaviour of leaders\u2014especially in moments of pressure and when no one is watching.",
    "Adding a critical and powerful dimension to the conversation, Sashi Kandambi, the sole woman on the panel, spoke with candour about the systemic hurdles and unique strengths women bring to the leadership table. \u201cWomen bring diversity of thought, emotional intelligence, and higher risk awareness,\u201d she explained. \u201cThese qualities add real, tangible value to decision-making and de-risk the organisation.\u201d",
    "Representing the multinational perspective, Pradip Pandey of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka articulated how a global giant can foster transformative leadership by being deeply rooted in its local context. \u201cWe energise the world, but we act locally. We celebrate Avurudu, Vesak, and other cultural moments because we belong here,\u201d he stated, outlining a philosophy of genuine integration over superficial adaptation.",
    "Pandey distilled his leadership framework into three core pillars: Agility, Ownership, and Human-Centricity. \u201cDecisions must be made fast. We avoid endless PowerPoint meetings and instead focus on action,\u201d he said of agility. On ownership, he was clear: \u201cEach employee is expected to act like an owner, not just a worker. Empowerment is key to unlocking this mindset.\u201d",
    "Ravi Jayawardena, the marketing maestro behind Maliban Group\u2019s stunning brand transformation, offered a gripping narrative of reinvention born from crisis. \u201cCOVID and product issues forced us to change. We moved from a rigid, top-down structure to an idea-driven company,\u201d he revealed. This pivot was enabled by fostering radical transparency through \u2018Let\u2019s Talk\u2019 town halls, creating a space for open dialogue and collective energy.",
