President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has declared his candidacy in the upcoming Presidential election, has stated that he will not appoint an acting IGP as this may lead to election petitions being filed against him.

### “Ranil is the biggest mistake”

Basil Rajapakse criticizes President Ranil Wickremesinghe's decision to run as an independent candidate, calling it a mistake. The PA's executive committee, led by former President Mahinda Rajapakse, was set to decide the presidential candidate. There's disagreement within the party over whether Wickremesinghe or another member should be the candidate. The PA feels neglected by Wickremesinghe, who they claim prioritized strengthening the UNP over the PA, leading to internal dissatisfaction.

🟩

Basil Rajapakse, the founder of the PA, said that the announcement of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's contesting as an independent candidate was completely wrong.

The executive committee of the PA was chaired by former President Mahinda Rajapakse to take a final decision on the presidential candidate.

It has been paid attention to a member of the PA in the presidential election and the candidature of President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the candidate.

One party has stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be fielded as presidential candidate and another party should field a member of the party as the presidential candidate.

It is absolutely wrong to announce that he is contesting as an independent candidate as he is in talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the issue of the presidential candidate.

We supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022 without any conditions. But for the past 2 years, he has not given priority to the PA's party.

If ever Sri Lanka has produced the most fake democrat, it has to be our back-door President Ranil Wickramesinghe. While he altered our constitution and laws by 19th Amendment, claiming to strengthen what little left of our apparent democracy, he is denying the most fundamental component of any democracy; the right to vote! At least Trump did not pretend to be a great Democrat! But RW did! RW made SL one up over America!

He denied the local elections over a year ago bogusly claiming lack of funds all the while spending millions of borrowed monies on a non existing national pride on the Independence Day celebrations. Further he also got the bunch of Rajapaksa crooks and hooligans in the parliament to approve extra Rs. 200 million over and above the budget on his own foreign travel. Note that this is all borrowed money we don’t have !
