    "Former Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage announced his retirement from active politics during a press conference held at the Mahindananda Aluthgamage Foundation\u2019s office in Nawalapitiya this morning (16).",
    "Reflecting on his extensive political journey, Aluthgamage highlighted that his family had been politically active in the Nawalapitiya constituency for seven decades, with his own involvement spanning over 30 years.",
    "However, he stated that the outcome of the recent General Election indicated that the people of the Kandy District no longer required his services, leading to his decision to step away from politics.",
    "In the 2024 General Election held on Thursday (14), Aluthgamage contested from the New Democratic Front (NDF), under the symbol of the \u2018gas cylinder\u2019, and secured only 20,401 votes in the district. This was a stark contrast to his previous performances, where he garnered nearly 200,000 votes in previous elections.",
    "Acknowledging this significant shift in public sentiment, Aluthgamage remarked, \u201cThe voters have spoken, and it is clear that my politics is no longer needed. I have therefore decided to retire from active politics.\u201d"
