  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s next election will be a battle of ideologies and the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will hopefully appeal to voters as a party that did not scuttle ongoing reform efforts and put the national interest ahead of political considerations, MP Harsha de Silva said.",
    "In a wide-ranging telephone interview, de Silva spoke extensively to EconomyNext Tuesday June 27 evening about his and the his party\u2019s sometimes seemingly competing views on domestic debt restructuring, the president\u2019s reform agenda, Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and upcoming elections and possible future alliances.",
    "Bipartisan consensus on Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt restructuring (DDR) is no longer looking out of reach, with the main opposition which had initially opposed the exercise now seemingly more open to the idea as long as there is no haircut.",
    "MP de Silva told EconomyNext that, following internal discussions, the party is open to considering the government\u2019s and central bank\u2019s DDR proposals once they\u2019ve been made available.",
    "The MP said that though restructuring domestic debt should ideally have been avoided, if it is absolutely essential, it can be managed with a reprofiling exercise and regulatory forbearance.",
    "The restructuring plan, which has yet to be made public, will be presented to parliament on July 01 after the cabinet of ministers peruse it on Wednesday June 28.",
    "The MP said the SJB had a full-day discussion on Monday on the subject where he had explained to the party leadership the different ways of looking at the issue.",
    "So long as the authorities\u2019 DDR proposals don\u2019t include a haircut and would have no impact on deposit holders, he said, the SJB can \u201cfigure out the best way to deal with this\u201d.",
    "\u201cAs the main opposition, we have to be responsible in how we act during this period,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP, who also chairs the parliamentary Committee on Public Financing (COPF), said DDR must be looked at from a \u201csolution point of view rather than a scaremongering point of view\u201d.",
    "The COPF is set to discuss the proposals when it meets on Thursday June 29 and Friday June 30.",
    "\u201cWe need to get the country out of a difficult situation. In that context, there has to be some amount of DDR which we had said from the very beginning,\u201d said the MP.",
    "This is in marked contrast to the vehement opposition to domestic restructuring expressed by SJB and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who said in mid May that the opposition will fight to defeat the government\u2019s DDR plans. Premadasa said at a meeting with representatives of the Ceylon Bank Employees\u2019 Union on May 18 that the opposition is ready to tell the international community to \u201cnot touch\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt. At a separate discussion on June 20, he said Sri Lanka must inform the IMF that both the government and opposition are united against restructuring domestic debt.",
    "Sri Lanka govt, opposition must oppose DDR in one voice: SajithSee more",
    "However, the SJB leadership may have since changed its mind, particularly in light of Monday\u2019s internal discussions. This new reality also appears to have irked rival opposition group National People\u2019s Power (NPP), which said the government and main opposition will likely be in agreement over the restructuring exercise though its specifics are still only known to a handful.",
    "NPP member and former parliamentarian Sunil Handunneththi told reporters on Tuesday that SJB MP de Silva\u2019s comments at a press conference on Sunday reveal that the main opposition will eventually get on board, the same way it did during the IMF deal vote. The SJB, in fact, abstained from the vote taken on the IMF programme, which went on to be passed by the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) dominated parliament.",
    "MP de Silva said DDR can be managed as long as it is done in a way that won\u2019t upset financial markets and will not negatively impact deposit holders. He added that it is doubtful that the \u201cpeople talking about this\u201d understand the complexity of restructuring debt or aware of alternatives.",
    "DDR can be managed, he said, if \u201cdone properly without upsetting the apple cart\u201d and \u201cgiving the country quite a bit of leeway to bring down interest rates and reignite growth\u201d.",
    "Despite an apparent change in heart about DDR, the SJB will remain adamant that a haircut should not be proposed.",
    "\u201cOn a domestic restructure, you cannot have a haircut. It can only be pushed back. So no face value haircut, no principal haircut. That we will not agree with,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "Reprofiling with regulatory forbearance, as well as liquidity support from the central bank in addition to maturity extension, amortised relief, etc are things to consider, he said.",
    "Fiscal contribution, external debt relief contribution and domestic debt relief contribution will all help towards bringing down Sri Lanka\u2019s gross financing needs (GFN) from its current level, said the MP.",
    "\u201cAll three will have to kick in,\u201d he said. However, the economist-turned-politician is not overly optimistic about the fiscal component and believes instead that Sri Lanka must look toward external and domestic debt relief for reducing GFN, which was at a staggering 7.9 billion rupees in 2022, accounting for nearly 33 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).",
    "\u201cIn that context, it must be a fair and equitable burden sharing. You can\u2019t put all the burden on the person on the street and have certain people enjoy unjust profits,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at an event Tuesday evening said the DDR exercise will not affect the stability of any public or private bank or the member balance of any provident fund.",
    "Sri Lanka DDR will not affect stability of any public or private bank: PresidentSee more",
    "MP de Silva said though the authorities can make various assurances, what will matter in the end is what is eventually agreed upon.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said, noting that the main opposition has yet to see the final plan.",
    "\u201cAs long there is no principal haircut, as long as the depositors are safeguarded, as long as the EPF members are not unjustly impacted, then we can consider options. But we\u2019ll first have to see what the burden share is, how much the fiscal contribution is, how much the external debt relief is, and then what the domestic debt relief is expected to be,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said he has been speaking to the SJB and the SJB parliamentary group.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m speaking to the party and I have explained to the group as well that we don\u2019t need to be unduly worried, that we need to look at it beyond traditional politics, and that we have to find a way to get the country back into a growth phase. So we need to consider this from a more national angle rather than a purely political angle,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked to comment on his party leader\u2019s public declarations in vocal opposition to DDR, de Silva said he was unable to participate in some meetings at the time as he was indisposed for seven days due to the flu. However, at Monday\u2019s internal meeting, he had been able to show to the party and the parliamentary group that \u201cthere is more than one way to look at this\u201d.",
    "\u201cEven when the government lied to the people and said there would be no DDR, we said yes, ideally there shouldn\u2019t be one but, if there is one, this is how you should handle it. To that extent, we have been more responsible than some of these jokers in government,\u201d he said, referring to some SLPP members in the present avatar of the former government under which Sri Lanka went through its worst currency crisis in decades.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re open to consider the proposals to be brought forward by the government and the central bank on Thursday and Friday,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said the SJB has had similar conversations about reforming state-owned enterprises (SOE), a subject which has proved predictably controversial.",
    "While he acknowledged that there are multiple views within the party, de Silva defended the SJB\u2019s position with regard to the IMF programme, which he insisted the party never scuttled.",
    "\u201cI know for a fact that the opposition\u2019s support for the IMF programme went a long way in getting the staff level agreement and beyond that the executive board approval. We have always had positive conversations with the IMF.",
    "\u201cEven though we have to play a certain amount of politics, we have to look after the interests of the people. During this crisis, we have stood with the people. We haven\u2019t played politics,\u201d said the MP.",
    "Defending the SJB\u2019s decision to abstain from the IMF vote, de Silva said it was the best possible outcome, given that as the opposition, the SJB cannot be expected to support everything it might disagree with, such as the 36-percent personal income tax for example.",
    "\u201cThere are certain things we don\u2019t agree with. But we never went and put a spoke in the [government\u2019s] wheel. We didn\u2019t vote against the IMF programme. We explained to the president what our position is. He is grown up enough to understand it,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe have understood the complications the government has to face. Even in this DDR, I have clearly articulated there are ways in which this can be done,\u201d he added, reiterating that the party had not scuttled the reforms.",
    "\u201cIf they propose a way that falls within the parameters and the contours that we have drawn, we will certainly look at it positively,\u201d said the MP.",
    "\u201cWe have said we will not support a haircut. We will not on principle support anything that impacts the deposit holders. If the government agrees with us, then you have a positive movement, don\u2019t you?\u201d",
    "President Wickremesinghe\u2019s reform agenda in the wake of the IMF programme promises to be a painful one for many Sri Lankans, a fact that political analysts will say will figure prominently in the next election cycle, whenever that might be. Despite de Silva\u2019s claims that the SJB has not actively scuttled the reforms, the main opposition\u2019s critics have accused the party of increasingly embracing populism, which they say may inevitably serve to derail the government\u2019s ambitious reform plans.",
    "Responding to this criticism, MP de Silva said the SJB has spelt out in its revised policy document The BluePrint: Out of the Debt Trap & Towards Sustainable Inclusive Development the party\u2019s vision for a social market economy, with strategies highlighted for growth and reintegration with global production networks, increasing efficiencies in the labour market and other measures.",
    "\u201cOur position is very clear. We\u2019re not saying one thing and doing something else. We have carefully laid out our game plan,\u201d he said, claiming that neither the government nor the president has a roadmap of their own.",
    "However, analysts point out that there is no big gulf between the SJB, or at least the part of the SJB represented by the likes of MP de Silva, and the president when it comes to economic policy. Why then should Sri Lankans put their faith in the SJB to steer the country out of the crisis and towards development?",
    "\u201cThe SJB, whether you like it or not, is the largest political grouping outside of the SLPP from the last election. The SLPP has deteriorated. It is nothing, really. The SJB has a fair number of people that are with us.",
    "\u201cPresident Wickremesinghe may have gained some popularity in the last few months. I\u2019m not going to take that away from him. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the [United National Party] has gained anything significant,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "The MP said that Sri Lanka\u2019s next election will be a battle of ideologies.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that people will look at us as a party that is honest, that has always stood by the people, that didn\u2019t scuttle the IMF programme,\u201d he said, adding that an SJB government will continue to work with the IMF and will go ahead with the programme.",
    "\u201cThere will be certain changes that we do, but we\u2019re generally in agreement with the need for reforms and integration with the global economy. That is how we\u2019re going to take this country out and how we\u2019re going to create growth,\u201d he said.",
    "The leftist NPP, a loose alliance dominated by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which has been increasingly critical of the IMF programme, has gained ground in the aftermath of the 2022 crisis and, according to at least one poll, is still ahead of the SJB, the SLPP and the president\u2019s one-man UNP. Against this backdrop, if President Wickremesinghe were to invite the SJB to come back into the UNP fold \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s so called \u2018grand old party\u2019 which the SJB broke away from \u2013 or to form a grand alliance with like minded groups, would the SJB consider it?",
    "\u201cI think we should consider any alliance that is ideologically aligned,\u201d answered de Silva, adding, however, that the SJB is in complete disagreement with the president on the alleged partnership with and protection of those accused of corruption, as well as controversial pieces of legislation such as the proposed broadcast regulatory commission act, the anti-terrorism act ant the like.",
    "\u201cThese are completely wrong. This is not the Ranil Wickremesinghe that we knew,\u201d he said.",
    "The president\u2019s defenders, however, argue that Wickremesinghe has been forced to team up with the SLPP given the SJB\u2019s refusal to work with him, a notion that de Silva dismisses immediately and rather derisively.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing he is forced to do. He can call an election anytime, since March. If he is really sincere about working with us, then he can call an election. He is still the president. There can be a new government,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe, said de Silva, seems to have provided the SLPP an assurance that there will be no elections for some time.",
    "\u201cLook at what\u2019s happening. Where is law and order? Have they taken any action against the people who assaulted protestors on May 9?\u201d",
    "The SJB\u2019s repeated chastising of the president for working with the SLPP have been called out as hypocritical by supporters of the president who point to SJB leader Premadasa\u2019s own overtures to SLPP \u201cdissidents\u201d who now sit in the opposition. MPs who critics say enabled the presidency of Wickremesinghe\u2019s predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa during whose first and only term multiple crises erupted.",
    "Responding to this allegation, de Silva said: \u201cThey can come and speak to us as we are the main opposition. There are certain lines that we will draw, on what we will entertain or not and who we will talk to or not.\u201d",
    "Though senior members of the SJB will certainly have a voice in who the party aligns with, he said, Premadasa as the leader of the opposition has a mandate to speak to everyone in the opposition.",
    "\u201cIn that context, we may speak to them and we may agree with them on certain issues such as the anti-terrorism act or the broadcasting authority act. We didn\u2019t agree with them on the IMF matter. They voted against it and we abstained. Those were two different positions that we took.",
    "\u201cJust because we speak to them on a particular matter, doesn\u2019t mean that we can be lumped together with them or they can be lumped together with us,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jun28/2023)"
