    "Cabinet Spokesperson and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday dismissed claims that history and aesthetic subjects are being removed from the school curriculum under the proposed education reforms, calling such reports misleading and politically motivated.",
    "In response to questions posed at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, he claimed false information was being circulated by the Opposition groups alleging that history and arts have been eliminated from the national curriculum.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa asserted that the reforms are being misrepresented for political gain at the expense of children\u2019s futures.",
    "\u201cThe Education Ministry is currently accepting feedback and proposals from all stakeholders. The reforms are still in a consultative phase and will initially be implemented in Grades 1 and 6,\u201d he stressed.",
    "The Cabinet Spokesman further clarified that the Education Ministry will hold a series of discussions over the coming days with educators, parents and experts to gather constructive input.
