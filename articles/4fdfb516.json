    "Apple plans to boost investment in the US by another $100bn (\u00a375bn) as the tech giant comes under pressure from President Donald Trump.",
    "The White House said the money would be used to encourage firms to make more Apple parts in the US and would add to the company\u2019s previous pledge to spend $500bn in the US over four years.",

    "Trump lauded the company for shifting production to the US and said they would be avoiding a 100% tariff that he was planning on chips and semiconductors. He did not offer more details on the new tariff plan, but said other companies could similarly avoid the taxes if they invest in the US.",
