### The NPP: A Month in Power

It has been a month since Anura Kumara Dissanayake assumed the presidency, a month since the NPP claimed its place in history as the first party from outside of the political establishment to win a presidential election in Sri Lanka. Two weeks from now, the NPP will face another election, this time parliamentary. Depending on the results it gets, we will know whether the people approve of the NPP’s actions over the last four weeks and if they want it to continue. The NPP’s call for a powerful government is, in itself, not alarming: no government can survive without a majority in parliament. Yet it will need to convince Sri Lankans that it is the party they need – the party not of power, but of change.

### WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?

We are convinced (or conditioned to believe,) that we are an under-developed country and are destined to ever remain so. Should it really be such? Importantly, what should we do to erase this patronizing and degrading label? This mental complex has led us to be a cynical, despondent people. The past seven decades of Independence have driven us into the depths of despair. The worst part of this is that we have so driven our thoughts, to make this fear to become our reality.

We have failed to utilize our potential – be it in climate, human resources or other “development criteria”. This clearly needs to change. Perhaps, we are not the cat’s whiskers, nor certainly are we everybody’s chronic “dog’s body”.

Motion of No Confidence in Government (Hansard of 1st September 1, 1953)

(Speech made by Dr. NM Perera published in his birth centenary memorial volume)

Dr. Perera:Before I deal with the subject, I want to say a word about the Hon. Prime Minister and his references to my good friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Bandaranaike). My friend the Prime Minister is not here. I hope that he has not had a recurrence of his affliction. Today while he was on the first part of his speech, he reminded me of the father; it was the same technique, the same type of personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I remember the last motion of No Confidence that we debated. I think it was moved just before the dissolution of Parliament, and it was one of the last debates which was attended by my good friend, the late Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake. He spoke in that debate and it was a tirade against my good friend the Leader of the Opposition.

The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 1987 was signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and myself as President on July 29, 1987. It was a Peace Treaty and brought Peace, till one group of the LTTE broke it in October 1987. India then had to oppose them till March 1990, when the Sri Lanka Government took over and this led to a bloody war with the LTTE which still continues (when this was written).

### Ukraine soldiers waiting for US election results

*2024-11-04 15:08:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197866) · `ta`

Ukrainian soldiers anxiously await US election results, hoping Kamala Harris will continue military aid. Donald Trump's presidency may limit support, potentially impacting Ukraine's war efforts against Russia.

🟩

Ukraine's International, who is cleaning the broken mirror of the outlet, knows that the future of his country is in the hands of American voters who are 5000 miles away.

We hope that a woman named Kamalahariis will win and help us.

This is the usual event in Jaboria.

"We are worried about the election results," he says. "We want to defeat the enemy."

The victory for Ukraine, which has the smallest opportunity to win the war, depends on the US support.

In this area, the Ukraine responded in 2023, hoping to remove the Russian occupants.

However, the situation of Ukraine has now become impossible to focus on focusing.

Bombs and missiles are attacking Ukraine cities.

Democratic candidate Kamala Haris has said that if he wins the election, military aid to Ukraine will continue, while his powers may be limited by the US Congress in the hands of the Republican Party.

If Donald Trump is again president, it is difficult for Ukraine to continue the current $ 50 billion military assistance.

Democracy under threat, as Trump sows doubt on election integrity

President Ronald Reagan, “The Great Communicator” was famous for conceptualizing the American Dream, in a loose paraphrasing of the words enshrined in the Statue of Liberty.

Concluding his farewell speech in 1988, Reagan said, “I’ve spoken of the Shining City all my political life….But in my mind, it was a tall, proud city built on rocks, stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and heart to get here. That’s how I saw it, and see it still.

‘The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so free, that your very existence is an act of rebellion.’– Albert Camus

It is with great honor and profound admiration that I write this foreword for Interventions, the most recent publication of my mentor and friend, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka. As is often the case with Dr. Jayatilleka’s literacy works (one would even say ‘always’ the case), this anthology compels the reader to engage in an intellectual gymnastic that pushes the boundaries of conventional thinking -an exercise that he, himself, has excelled in since a very young age.
