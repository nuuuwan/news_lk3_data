    "The wheels of justice apparently turn slowly across the globe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, 70, was yesterday found guilty of criminal conspiracy in a high-profile trial wherein he and his top aides were accused of having struck a corrupt deal with the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi to secure funding for the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy was acquitted of three charges. Sentencing had not been announced at the time of going to press, and Sarkozy was expected to appeal immediately.",
    "A criminal probe got underway against Sarkozy in 2013 following a much-publicised claim by Gaddafi\u2019s son, Saif al-Islam that Sarkozy had benefited from the Libyan dictator\u2019s largesse in the 2007 presidential election. The French prosecutors argued that Sarkozy had received funds from Gaddafi to help repair the latter\u2019s image internationally, especially in the West, which had conferred pariah status on Libya.",
    "Inducements for powerful foreign leaders can be financial or political. Campaign funding and block votes can sway them to the point where they make foreign policy shifts. One may recall that it was under Sarkozy\u2019s watch that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner rushed here in a desperate bid to stop the war against the LTTE, in 2009. He was accompanied by his British counterpart David Miliband, who represented the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Interestingly, Brown\u2019s successor, PM David Cameron, and Sarkozy flew to Libya in September 2011, a few weeks after the ouster of Gaddafi, amidst heavy fighting between the western-backed rebels and the pro-Gaddafi forces. It was claimed in some quarters that the duo had gone there as part of a strategy to secure post-conflict reconstruction contracts for their countries. But Libya has been plagued by anarchical violence since the NATO-backed uprising in 2011. It has been ruled by rival groups in the eastern and western parts of the country, with the help of armed gangs and foreign governments with sinister agendas.",
    "Sarkozy\u2019s current predicament related to secret deals with a foreign dictator and clandestine campaign finance reminds us of a scandal that cost French President Valery Giscard D\u2019Estaing the chances of his re-election in 1981. It came to light that D\u2019Estaing had received diamonds from Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the self-proclaimed Emperor of the Central African Republic, to the tune of a quarter of a million US dollars. Bokassa was known for his selective generosity to curry favour with foreign dignitaries, including heads of state; he would shower fistfuls of diamonds on them. He killed tens of thousands of people to retain his hold on power and was accused of feeding his pet crocodiles with his victims including children. But some foreign leaders had no qualms about visiting him. D\u2019Estaing got away by claiming that he had donated the diamonds at issue to charities in the Central African Republic and some international humanitarian organisations.",
    "Sarkozy\u2019s conviction has reminded the world of shady deals some western leaders and their parties/governments have cut with foreign dictators and other such evil characters. President Sarkozy visited Libya in 2007, met Gaddafi and inked several agreements on immigration, healthcare and security. In the same year, the then British prime minister Tony Blair made a trip to Tripoli, a couple of weeks before stepping down and announced a complete transformation of relations between the UK and Libya! Having secured a deal for British Petroleum to set up gas exploration plants in Libya, he declared that the two countries had agreed to cooperate on defence and counter-terrorism, of all things. Such is the hypocrisy of some western leaders who claim to cherish democracy.",
    "Sarkozy, Cameron and other western leaders who backed the anti-Gaddafi uprising should have been brought to justice for plunging Libya into chaos. Gaddafi was no doubt a dictator, but the situation took a turn for the worse after his ouster and extrajudicial execution. Libyans have been left without impressive social welfare benefits they enjoyed during the Gaddafi\u2019s rule. Gaddafi had begun to change course under western pressure, which could have been cranked up to rekindle democracy in Libya, but the US and its allies were in a mighty hurry to get rid of Gaddafi. In 2012, the chickens came home to roost for the US. Four Americans including US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens were killed in a mob attack in Benghazi, which came to be dubbed the Cradle of Libya\u2019s Freedom Struggle! That was a wake-up call for then US President Barack Obama and the hawks in Washington, but it was too late.",
