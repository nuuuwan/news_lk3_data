    "The fingerprint system uses biometric fingerprints. In simple terms, it\u2019s a biometric time-tracking system designed for fairness and accountability in various professions. Canners can record their attendance at workplaces or institutions. Instead of just signing a register or calling out names, employees need to scan their fingerprints to verify their presence. The goal is to prevent proxy attendance (someone else signing in for you). This ensures accurate records of who is there and for how long. It also boosts accountability, especially in public institutions where taxpayer money is involved. Additionally, it can help (i) reduce absenteeism, (ii) reduce false overtime claims, and (iii) reduce misuse of public funds. In short, it\u2019s a biometric time-tracking system created for fairness and accountability across professions. This system is used in other countries, such as India, Malaysia, and New Zealand.",
    "The postal workers are protesting the implementation of a new mandatory fingerprint attendance system, especially for administrative and accounting staff. The unions argue that this system is unfairly penalizing staff, especially when operational realities aren\u2019t considered. Their demand for withdrawal comes alongside other grievances like inadequate overtime pay, staff vacancies, transportation issues, and salary increments.",
    "According to the Postmaster General, the fingerprint system was introduced to curb abuses, such as overtime claims without proper attendance logs. Audits revealed many employees drawing salaries and overtime without using fingerprint scanners. Instead, they were signing attendance books, which allowed manipulation. Given the above, the system aims to enforce accountability and prevent irregularities at locations like the Central Mail Exchange, which had significant misuse of attendance recordings.",
    "However, from the Union Perspective, it is not a new opposition, but a broader frustration. Interestingly, unions clarify that they do not fundamentally oppose biometric systems\u2014noting that fingerprint machines have been in use for years across many administrative offices. Their opposition seems triggered explicitly by issues such as (i) how the system is implemented or enforced (perhaps without sufficient training or infrastructure). Also (ii) perceptions that it\u2019s being used punitively without addressing broader concerns, such as low take-home allowances and insufficient staffing.",
    "The postal strike started around August 17, prompted by 19 demands, including the fingerprint issue. Over 18,000 workers are involved, with more than 1.5 million letters and parcels delayed across the system. Other key demands include reforming overtime pay, filling vacant positions, multiple pay increases for frontline workers, and fixing transport-related problems.",
    "Indeed, the concerns mentioned above are worth discussing to find a constructive solution. However, launching a strike is not the answer either. It will likely disrupt the country\u2019s economic growth momentum. The government\u2019s costs could eventually reach billions.",
    "System: India introduced the Aadhaar-based Biometric Attendance System (BAS) for central government employees in 2014. Employees log in and out using fingerprint or iris scans linked to their Aadhaar ID.",
    "Cost: Initial rollout was relatively low-cost \u2014 fingerprint devices are about USD 100\u2013300 each, plus server and software costs. India scaled it massively because Aadhaar (national ID) already existed.",
    "Benefits: Sharp drop in absenteeism in ministries and public offices.",
    "Real-time online dashboards show attendance data to the public (transparency).",
    "Technical issues in rural areas (connectivity, fingerprint mismatches for manual workers).",
    "System: Many government offices and hospitals use fingerprint or facial recognition systems for civil servants. Some universities also use biometrics for staff and student attendance.",
    "Cost: Medium \u2014 Malaysia spent around USD 20\u201330 million for nationwide public sector biometric upgrades in the 2010s.",
    "Issues: Trade unions argue that over-monitoring reduces trust and morale.",
    "Some say it treats professionals (like doctors and professors) the same as clerical staff, which may not be fair.",
    "System: New Zealand does not have biometric attendance in Parliament or across the public service. Instead:",
    "In government departments, flexible work arrangements are standard, and supervisors, not biometrics monitor attendance.",
    "Some private companies use fingerprint or facial scanners for payroll integrity.",
    "Cost/Philosophy: NZ prefers a trust-based accountability model rather than heavy surveillance.",
    "Public accountability comes through transparency (MP expenses are published, ministers\u2019 schedules are public).",
    "Issues: Critics say MPs still sometimes skip sessions without sufficient penalties.",
    "Ensures fairness \u2014 everyone from MPs to minor staff follows the same rules.",
    "India demonstrates that biometric systems can significantly boost attendance, provided a robust IT infrastructure supports them. Malaysia illustrates both the advantages and the dangers of discouraging professionals. New Zealand offers an alternative: transparency and trust instead of biometric surveillance.",
    "If Sri Lanka adopts this, it will improve accountability without fostering distrust and will build public trust by showing that accountability is essential. It\u2019s a biometric time-tracking system aimed at fairness and accountability across different professions. This is important, so if someone opposes it, there is no factual basis for their objection.",
