    "Looking at foreign policy questions from a feminist viewpoint may strike many in even the world of democracy as quite a new approach to studying external policy issues but this perspective has been around for quite some time and it would be in the interest of states and publics to take profound cognizance of it. This is in view of the implications of the perspective for international peace and stability.",
    "Given this backdrop, it was in the fitness of things for the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) Colombo, a major pioneer in the teaching and researching of International Relations in Sri Lanka, to set off special time to introduce and discuss Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) recently. The relevant symposium was the final one in a series of forums of importance to foreign and domestic policy issues the BCIS conducted in the course of November this year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding.",
    "Titled \u2018Leadership for Peace and Feminist Foreign Policy\u2019, the forum was held on December 9th at the BMICH\u2019s \u2018Mihilaka Madura\u2019 under the aegis of the BCIS, headed by the latter\u2019s Executive Director Priyanthi Fernando. Prominent among the members of the audience at the symposium was the Chairperson of the BCIS, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.",
    "The panelists at the forum were Prof. Rangita de Silva de Alwis, Associate Dean of International Affairs, University of Pennsylvania Law School, USA and an Expert Member on the CEDAW and Eva Abdullah, Chairperson, Maldives Policy Think Tank and a former Deputy Speaker of the People\u2019s Majlis of the Maldives. The symposium was moderated by Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy, former UN Under-Secretary General and Special Representative of the Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict (2006-2012).",
    "Prof. Rangita de Silva, among other things, pointed to the importance of re-imagining FFP and making it increasingly relevant in the formulation of a country\u2019s foreign policy. She said that going forward, foreign policy will need to be increasingly based on a feminist perspective and there are some major countries of the South and North that have already given their external policies this orientation. It was pointed out that by 2025, France, for example, would be taking this policy direction; that is, the best interests of France\u2019s women would be taken into consideration in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy.",
    "Chile, the same speaker pointed out, a major country of the South, is in the forefront of integrating or merging its domestic and foreign policies with a view to prioritizing the legitimate interests of women in the crafting of its external policy.",
    "Eva Abdullah pointed to the crucial contribution women make to a country\u2019s economy. Women in the Maldives, she said, work 19 hours a day. She cogently elaborated that economic instability is a chief causative factor in the disruption of peace and stability in a country, in view of its subtle capability to undermine a country\u2019s material wellbeing. The latter, in turn, causes social disaffection and unrest. But, generally, the factors seen as undermining a country\u2019s peace are physical conflict and war; that is, overt violence.",
    "However, it is important to come to grips with the less visible or more subtle destroyer of peace, which is economic instability. This form of instability, it was pointed out, has grave long term consequences. For instance, a country\u2019s economic ruin is virtually inherited by every new born infant, since a country in debt is obliged to repay such loans and it falls to future generations to do so.",
    "Abdullah went on to elaborate that economic austerity measures undertaken by a country in debt, for example, while disruptive of peace, exert a deleterious impact on particularly women and other vulnerable groups. After all, the contribution of women to the GDP of a country is inestimable. This is all the reason why women\u2019s issues need to be brought to the forefront of foreign policymaking.",
    "In other words, foreign policy, Abdullah pointed out, is essentially all about the promotion of human rights. Since such rights are insidiously undermined during times of economic austerity; debt issues, which come to the fore during economic crises in particularly the South, cannot be viewed in isolation from women\u2019s issues and external policy.",
    "Thus, the forum raised issues of crucial importance to foreign policy formulation which countries of the South in particular need to take into account very seriously, going forward. At the end of the symposium a Q&A followed where many an issue of relevance was taken up for discussion.",
    "It ought to be clear to the unbiased observer and commentator that a feminist perspective in foreign policy is of crucial significance to the process referred to as democratic development. The latter signifies growth in tandem with redistributive justice. It goes without saying that foreign and domestic policies that do not help in furthering these aims serve no useful purpose. Thus, a feminist foreign policy and its underlying principles cannot be glossed over or ignored in the process of external policy formulation and implementation.",
    "Generally, a woman\u2019s contribution to a country\u2019s GNP and overall wellbeing goes largely undocumented and unappreciated. For example, women work selflessly and silently in their homestead, but no official price tag is attached to such labour which is instrumental in \u2018keeping the home fires burning\u2019. Accordingly, the panelists\u2019 observation that foreign policy in the real and feminist sense is essentially all about the promotion of human rights amounts to an insight of great worth.",
