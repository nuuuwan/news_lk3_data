    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 With five weeks to go to Sri Lanka\u2019s parliamentary election, the island nation\u2019s opposition parties are still in talks on what party symbols to contest under.",
    "The United National Party (UNP) and the faction of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) that backed former president Ranil Wickremesinghe at the presidential election have yet to decide whether to contest under the UNP\u2019s elephant or the gas cylinder under which Wickremesinghe had to contest the presidential poll as an independent candidate.",
    "The UNP\u2019 Vajira Abeyardana told reporters that discussions are under way for a common alliance to contest all districts under the gas cylinder with the exception of two.",
    "\u201cIt is very clear that the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) government is following Wickremesinghe\u2019s path. We must support that,\u201d said Abeywardana.",
    "\u201cThere are discussions around everyone contesting under the gas cylinder while contestants in the Wanni and Nuwara Eliya districts run with the elephant symbol. These talks are set to conclude,\u201d he added.",
    "Former MP P Radhakrishnan said the elephant now may be a forgotten symbol.",
    "\u201cWe have heard that it will be the elephant. But people have now forgotten the elephant. It\u2019s more competitive this time,\u201d he said.",
    "The UNP\u2019s Ashu Marasinghe, meanwhile, has refused to contest under a symbol that isn\u2019t the UNP\u2019s traditional elephant.",
    "\u201cWe call for unification. If the entire opposition gets together, it will be difficult for the NPP to win a majority. But if you contest separately, not just a majority, they may even get a two-thirds,\u201d he said.",
    "Saman Rathanapriya of the UNP has ruled out any possibility of the elephant returning, however.",
    "\u201cThere are private proposals like that. There are those asking for the elephant. If you have to give symbols that way, a common agreement will be impossible. So what is essential right now is to contest together under the gas cylinder. There\u2019s no other solution,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo, it won\u2019t be the elephant,\u201d he added in response to a question.",
    "Meanwhile, former minister Bandula Gunawardena has decided to sit out this parliamentary election.",
    "\u201cWe have now become a nation of people frying sausages in a pan on the mouth of a volcano. There is opposition from the people to what we did. I have made a clear decision to not contest this time as I do not wish to be part of that,\u201d he said.",
    "Palani Digambaram of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) said: \u201cThe people have given a mandate to AKD. But it\u2019s the opposition groups that got more votes. So it won\u2019t be a big issue this election.\u201d",
    "Former MP M A Sumanthiran said the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) has decided to go it alone this election except in one district.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like. In Trincomalee, we will contest under our own symbol but our list will include candidates from other parties,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Oct07/2024)"
