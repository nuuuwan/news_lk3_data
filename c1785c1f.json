  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve never had an accident like this,\u201d James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of \u201cTitanic,\u201d said on Thursday.",
    "Mr. Cameron, an expert in submersibles, has dived dozens of times to the ship\u2019s deteriorating hulk and once plunged in a tiny craft of his own design to the bottom of the planet\u2019s deepest recess.",
    "In an interview, Mr. Cameron called the presumed loss of five lives aboard the Titan submersible from the company OceanGate like nothing anyone involved in private ocean exploration had ever seen.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019ve never been fatalities at this kind of depth and certainly no implosions,\u201d he said.",
    "An implosion in the deep sea happens when the crushing pressures of the abyss cause a hollow object to collapse violently inward. If the object is big enough to hold five people, Mr. Cameron said in an interview, \u201cit\u2019s going to be an extremely violent event \u2014 like 10 cases of dynamite going off.\u201d",
    "In 2012, Mr. Cameron designed and piloted an experimental submersible into a region in the Pacific Ocean called the Challenger Deep. Mr. Cameron had not sought certification of the vessel\u2019s safety by organizations in the maritime industry that provide such services to numerous companies.",
    "\u201cWe did that knowingly\u201d because the craft was experimental and its mission scientific, Mr. Cameron said. \u201cI would never design a vehicle to take passengers and not have it certified.\u201d",
    "Mr. Cameron strongly criticized Stockton Rush, the OceanGate chief executive who piloted the submersible when it disappeared Sunday, for never getting his tourist submersible certified as safe. He noted that Mr. Rush called certification an impediment to innovation.",
    "\u201cI agree in principle,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t take that stance when you\u2019re putting paying customers into your submersible \u2014 when you have innocent guests who trust you and your statements\u201d about vehicle safety.",
    "As a design weakness in the Titan submersible and a possible cautionary sign to its passengers, Mr. Cameron cited its construction with carbon-fiber composites. The materials are used widely in the aerospace industry because they weigh much less than steel or aluminum, yet pound for pound are stronger and stiffer.",
    "The problem, Mr. Cameron said, is that a carbon-fiber composite has \u201cno strength in compression\u201d\u2014 which happens as an undersea vehicle plunges ever deeper into the abyss and faces soaring increases in water pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s not what it\u2019s designed for.\u201d",
    "The company, he added, used sensors in the hull of the Titan to assess the status of the carbon-fiber composite hull. In its promotional material, OceanGate pointed to the sensors as an innovative feature for \u201chull health monitoring.\u201d Early this year, an academic expert described the system as providing the pilot \u201cwith enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface.\u201d",
    "In contrast to the company, Mr. Cameron called it \u201ca warning system\u201d to let the submersible\u2019s pilot know if \u201cthe hull is getting ready to implode.\u201d",
    "Mr. Cameron said the sensor network on the sub\u2019s hull was an inadequate solution to a design he saw as intrinsically flawed.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not like a light coming on when the oil in your car is low,\u201d he said of the network of hull sensors. \u201cThis is different.\u201d"
