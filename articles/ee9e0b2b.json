    "Fitch Ratings has affirmed the \u2018A-(lka)\u2019 National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings of Sri Lanka-based life insurer HNB Assurance PLC (HNBA) and its fully owned non-life subsidiary HNB General Insurance Limited (HNBGI).",
    "The affirmation reflects the group\u2019s \u2018Favourable\u2019 company profile and satisfactory regulatory capital position, offset by weaker non-life underwriting performance in recent periods. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Premium Growth: HNBA and HNBGI both achieved strong gross written premium (GWP) growth in 2023 and 1H24, outpacing industry benchmarks. Life GWP grew by 24% in 1H24 (2023: 23%), exceeding the industry\u2019s growth rate of 17% (2023: 13%) in the same period. Meanwhile, non-life GWP rose by 14% in 1H24 (2023: 18%), while the industry\u2019s grew at 6% in 1H24 (2023: 5%). An expanded agency network and stronger bancassurance partnerships drove the growth of the life segment.",
    "Non-life GWP growth was largely supported by a 22% rise in the non-motor segment in 1H24 (2023: 35%), with strong contributions from the medical and fire lines. HNBGI\u2019s portfolio rebalancing reduced the dominance of the motor segment and allowed it to achieve a 50-50 mix between motor and non-motor premiums in 1H24, from 56-44, respectively, in 2023. Non-Life Profitability to Improve: We expect underwriting profitability to gradually improve from current levels. Enhanced claims management and underwriting in motor and medical segments, along with a shift beyond these segments, will support the increase.",
    "HNBGI\u2019s underwriting profitability improved in 1H24, with its Fitch-calculated combined ratio rising to 108% (2023: 111%) against a three-year average of 107% in 2021-2023. This was driven by a reduced claims ratio of 68% (2023: 73%), with better ratios in the medical and motor segments. Near-term pressure on underwriting profitability will persist due to increased exposure to the higher-claim health segment and the impact of a new directive to remit 100% of motor insurance strike, riot, civil commotion and terrorism (SRCCT) premiums to state-owned insurer National Insurance Trust Fund Board (BBB(lka)/Stable).",
