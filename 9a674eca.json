    "Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) has once again jeopardized the country\u2019s medal hopes in the Asian Games 2023 in Hangzhou, China later this year, recalling all seven wushuites from the national high performance camp, back to the Navy Base in Welisara.",
    "As previously reported by Daily Mirror, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Wushu Federation have held formal discussion over sending Pathum Balawardana (Navy) and T.P Kumara (Navy) to Iran as part of a world class training scholarship ahead of the Asian Games.",
    "Although the Wushu Federation made the request to have the wushuites released by June 9, Navy swiftly rejected this and informed them that the players won\u2019t be released until July 9.",
    "The Wushu Federation felt this decision was made in order to have these athletes take part in a low level inter-force athletic event going by the name of Defense Services Games.",
    "However, Navy\u2019s arrogance came crashing down to the floor when they then had to request the Wushu Federation to provide match officials and equipment for the Defense Services Games. This time the President of Wushu Federation Manel Dharmakeerthi opted to play hardball with Navy and told them to release the players in order to get the match officials for the said tournament, to which Navy said no and retuned to the Base with their tails firmly between their legs.",
    "Nonetheless, Navy then found another way to salvage their pride by recalling all their Navy wushuites back to the Navy Base sending a message that the preparation for the Asian Games is not as important as participating in this inter-house sports meet-like Defense Services Games.",
    "Wushu Federation\u2019s President Dharmakeerthi is disappointed with the way Navy have handled this situation from the beginning.",
    "\u201cObviously we are utterly disappointed with this. We have not won an Asian Medal in ages, but this time we have Wushuites who have got a real chance to do that, but with Navy holding them hostage at the base, Sri Lanka\u2019s chances are hampered. Navy without any approval from Director General Sports or WFSL (Wushu Federation of Sri Lanka) recalled all Taolu & Sanda players back to their base. They can\u2019t do that. This Country is not run by Military Regime,\u201d Dharmakeerthi said.",
    "\u201cWe have now written to His Excellency the President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Sports Roshan Ranasinghe. We hope the authorities will quickly sort this issue,\u201d Dharmakeerthi told the Daily Mirror.",
    "When contacted by Daily Mirror, a senior Navy officer stated he was not in a position to make a comment and asked to contact the Director of Media - Navy. However, despite making several attempts Daily Mirror could not contact the said officer. (Harsha Amarasinghe)"
