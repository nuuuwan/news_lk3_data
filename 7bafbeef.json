    "Former Indian batting sensation Sunil Gavaskar has blasted the Indian selectors after star batsman Cheteswar Pujara was dropped from the Indian Test team for West Indies series.",
    "\"Why has he been dropped? Why has he been made the scapegoat for our batting failures. He has been a loyal servant of India cricket. A loyal and quiet servant. A loyal and quiet achiever. But because he does not have millions of followers on platforms who will make a noise in case he gets dropped, you drop him. That is something beyond understanding. What is the criteria of dropping him and keeping the others who failed? I do not know because nowadays, there is no media interaction with the selection committee chairman,\" Gavaskar said."
