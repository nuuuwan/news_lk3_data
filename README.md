### CBSL salary hike: Is it the Governor who is responsible?

*2024-04-01 02:22:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/CBSL-salary-hike-Is-it-the-Governor-who-is-responsible/14-760146) · `en`

CBSL governing board (from left): Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Nihal Fonseka, Dr. Ravi Rathnayake, Anushka Wijesinha, Vish Govindasamy, Rajeev Amarasuriya, Manil Jayesinghe

Not only the rule of law but the spirit of the law is vital during a crisis

The last few weeks have seen a massive media interest and public attention on the salary hikes amounting up to 70% at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) at a time of an economic downfall in the country. I welcome the recommendations made by the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) at the Parliament and the acceptance of the recommendations by the CBSL governor and the staff to re-visit and reverse the proposed increase in the national interest.

There is a clear attempt to target the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, and make him the scapegoat for the proposed increases. This in my view is politically motivated by many who were responsible for the economic downfall of the country.

### DDR for Sri Lanka and SLR for CBSL:  CB Governor’s rationale is puerile

*2024-04-01 02:19:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/DDR-for-Sri-Lanka-and-SLR-for-CBSL-CB-Governor-s-rationale-is-puerile/14-760145) · `en`

Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe having made the blunder of unilaterally deciding to grant a phenomenal and unprecedented increase in the emoluments for the Central Bank (CB) staffers has further aggravated the issue by citing that for some employees the take home salary will be negative if the revised salary is not granted.

I would like the CB Governor to elaborate as to how the take home salary will be negative because of the loan given to the staff? It is normal that when an employer grants a loan to an employee, the loan amount is such that it is recovered in instalments over a period of time whilst the employee at the same time gets a reduced amount of take home pay (because of the deduction of the loan).

For the take home pay to be negative, I think that the Governor has made an additional blunder having given a colossal sum as loan which if it is to be recovered, within a short period of time, from the salary will make the take home salary negative!

### Why elections for Presidency all political parties have promised to abolish?

*2024-04-01 02:07:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-elections-for-Presidency-all-political-parties-have-promised-to-abolish/4-760144) · `en`

None in mainstream politics would lead this country on a right path to freedom, democracy and an inclusive society with socio-economic and cultural development. These political leaderships simply have no valid “development program” to back their criticism of the past and the present and their request for political power at the next “presidential” election. A larger crisis therefore is the timidity of the educated urban polity that has access to new information, new knowledge and new social discourses beyond geographical boundaries

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have told the cabinet of ministers, priority has to be given to the IMF program to ensure economic stability and elections will have to be postponed till the IMF program is concluded. One newspaper report had it, the President had in fact informed the Election Commission too about postponing elections.

### What is wrong with Sri Lanka?

*2024-04-01 01:56:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-is-wrong-with-Sri-Lanka/4-760143) · `en`

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70% responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30%. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.

### I am not responsible for the rejection of Maithri - He must take responsibility for the fall of the SK - State Minister Lasantha Alagavanna

*2024-04-01 01:37:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180099) · `ta`

🟩

Parties that are members of the PA refusing to accept Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Maithripala Sirisena. Minister of State Lasantha Alagiyavanna said that it cannot be accepted by me.

He further stated at a press conference held in Colombo on Saturday (30).

I have removed me from the position of treasure. The allegation against me is that it is not properly taken up to establish the PA. But this alliance has already been established.

However, all parties that are members of this coalition indicate that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Maithripala Sirisena cannot be joined by the leadership council.. I can't do anything for this.

I am trying to unite the party, leadership and other parties. In our party, the Political Council Central Executive Committee and the Executive Committee. A special meeting was called. Such a decision cannot be made in any way at a special meeting.

### Maithripala Sirisena's recent behavior reveals that his mood is not correct - Mahinda Amaraweera regarding the dismissal

*2024-04-01 01:25:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180097) · `ta`

He accuses the coalition of legal action and describes the situation as imperialistic, vowing to fight it in court.

🟩

Former President Maithripala Sirisena's recent behavior reveals that his mood is not correct. We have been sacked from positions without any formal factors presented. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that we can never be separated from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

He further stated at a press conference held in Colombo on Saturday (30).

We have been removed from the positions. He called for a special discussion and would not allow us to present his comments and make any comments to us.. But even the correct allegations are not put forward on us.

Indicate that the coalition has been sued. He is well aware of why the case was filed. However, in his behaviors these days there is a stumbling block. From his comments, it is clear that his mood is not correct.

However, we will definitely go to court against this illegal action. We are not aware that we are so unjust. Party membership is not removed. We have only been removed from the posts. We see this as imperialism.

### Is the Chinese economy doomed as some forecasts say?

*2024-04-01 00:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Is-the-Chinese-economy-doomed-as-some-forecasts-say/172-279898) · `en`

One should be cautious about making doomsday predictions, and should not  forget the resilience, determination and energy which made it possible  to lift millions of Chinese out of poverty in two decades

While social media is packed with doomsday predictions of the American economy (Europe isn’t doing any better, either), there is an equal or greater number of videos forecasting the decline of China, an economic juggernaut that looked set to overtake the US before the pandemic.

When navigating across this sea of negative analyses of China, from American, European or Indian sources, one must bear in mind that there are those who either dislike or fear China enough to wish it economic doom.

### Lanka’s foreign debt and Chinese puzzle - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-01 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Lankas-foreign-debt-and-Chinese-puzzle-EDITORIAL/172-279897) · `en`

In March this year, President Wickremesinghe in an interview said Lanka was committed to repaying its debt within the period 2027-2042. The president said he expected the ongoing debt restructuring negotiations would bring the annual external debt payments down to 4% of GDP.

The country’s foreign reserves, which stood at less than $20 million in April 2022 at the height of the economic crisis, now stand at over $3 billion, Wickremesinghe said.

For long, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Western nations have claimed the delay in rescheduling Lanka’s international debt was China-which holds the largest share of our foreign debt. It was also claimed Sri Lanka was caught in a Chinese debt trap caused by taking loans to an extent they cannot be repaid.

They warned Lanka would ultimately end up with China taking over assets of the country to meet the bill.

### Anti-privatization statements will depress bid prices: Will JVP be held accountable?

*2024-04-01 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Anti-privatization-statements-will-depress-bid-prices-Will-JVP-be-held-accountable/172-279896) · `en`

Sunil Handunetti, a senior and respected leader of the JVP, has urged the government not to sell (and potential buyers not to buy) state-owned enterprises such as the SriLankan Airlines, SLT and Litro, for which requests for proposals have been called.

He implicitly threatens to expropriate the sold entities. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is also mentioned, but there is no such process underway for it.

This coincided with the government taking USD 210 million in dollar loans and LKR 41.4 billion in rupee loans off the Airline’s books. This has, understandably, angered many members of the public. They argue that wrong decisions led an airline that once paid dividends to the Treasury to come to this sorry state. They argue that those who made these decisions should be held to account.

Pope Francis called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all Israeli hostages in an Easter Sunday address that marked the most important day on the Christian calendar by deploring the suffering caused by wars.

The pontiff presided over Mass in a packed and flower-bedecked St Peter’s Square, and then delivered his “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.

Francis, 87, has been in poor health in recent weeks, forcing him on repeated occasions to limit his public speaking and cancel engagements as he did on Good Friday, skipping at short notice a procession at Rome’s Colosseum.

However, he took part in other Holy Week events leading up to Easter, and appeared in relatively good spirits on Sunday. Easter celebrates the day in which the faithful believe Jesus rose from the dead.

Since India is also planning to become a developed country just one year before Sri Lanka’s target year, it is important that Sri Lanka should ride the bandwagon of India

Sri Lanka should reduce the size of its Government progressively and reallocate its scanty resources for the promotion of the technological base in the economy. For this purpose, it should engage its universities and research institutes to conduct new research and come up with inventions which could be successfully converted to commercial products for sale in the global markets. For this, it is necessary for the country to establish a learning society at all levels, family, schools, universities, and workplaces. It is only a learning society that could create new things that will enable the country to generate wealth and prosperity

President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing Parliament in August 2022 pronounced that the target of his Government was to make Sri Lanka a fully developed country by 2048. The choice of the target year had some sentimental reason. It is that Sri Lanka will celebrate the centenary of independence from Britain in 2048.

Since Sri Lanka was a promising rich country in South Asia by the time it gained independence in 1948 prompting some analysts to brand it as Switzerland of Asia, it is ironical to target for prosperity after 100 years of independence. However, without any apparent connection, two weeks before Sri Lanka made this pronouncement, India’s Premier Narendra Modi too announced that India’s goal would be to make it a developed country by 2047 when it would celebrate centenary of independence from Britain. It seems that Sri Lanka is closely following the development path of its neighbour to the North.
