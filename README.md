Dear Mr. President, I write to you not only as a concerned citizen but as someone who is deeply invested in the international standing and reputation of Sri Lanka. Just a few months ago, I was among those who voiced their skepticism about your ascent to the presidency, questioning whether your promises of eradicating corruption and prioritizing the welfare of the people would blossom into genuine change.

Yet, today, I reach across the chasm of our political differences to appeal to a shared hope: a united and harmonious Sri Lanka тАУ ensuring religious freedom or belief to all. As you have articulated in your speeches, Sri Lanka stands at a crossroadsтАФwe either repeat divisive politics or create an opportunity to build a nation that values the rich diversity of its people.

### The Downplaying of Our National Languages: the Advantages of English

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical stories by LC Arulpragasam)

I recognized the advantages that we had inherited from the British through our knowledge of the English language. But I also began to realize that we had so exalted our knowledge of English that it had been at the expense of the neglect of our national languages. For example in India, although the members of its upper/middle classes spoke impeccable English, they conversed at home in Hindi or in their regional languages, whereas in Ceylon the middle class usually spoke English at home, with the local languages being reserved only for the servants.

He directed that this be declared forthwith so that the department could assess the tax and any penalties to be paid. This was a bit too much. I was extremely busy and had no time for tomfoolery.
