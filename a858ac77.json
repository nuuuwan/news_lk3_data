  "original_body_lines": [
    "The International Monetary Fund\u2019s board has approved a roughly $700 million loan for Pakistan under a $3 billion bailout, the fund and the finance ministry said on Thursday.",
    "The IMF\u2019s completion of its first review of the programme and the board\u2019s decision brings the total disbursements under the Standby Arrangement (SBA) to about $1.9 billion, the fund said.",
    "\u201cThere are now tentative signs of activity picking-up and external pressures easing,\u201d said in a statement Antoinette Sayeh, a deputy managing director at the fund.",
    "\u201cContinued strong ownership (of the program) remains critical to ensure the current momentum continues and stabilization of Pakistan\u2019s economy becomes entrenched.\u201d",
    "The South Asian country is operating under a caretaker government and the IMF loan programme, approved in July, helped avert a sovereign debt default.",
    "Ahead of the bailout, Pakistan had to undertake a slew of measures demanded by the IMF, including revising its budget, a hike in its benchmark interest rate, and increases in electricity and natural gas prices.",
    "\u201cContinuing with regularly-scheduled adjustments and pushing cost-side power sector reforms are vital to improving the sector\u2019s viability and protecting fiscal sustainability,\u201d Sayeh said.",
    "An IMF mission led by Pakistan mission chief Nathan Porter concluded its visit in November. It reviewed whether Pakistan was on track to meet benchmarks set under the SBA agreed in July and signed a staff level agreement.",
    "Under the bailout deal, the IMF also got Pakistan to raise $1.34 billion in new taxation to meet fiscal adjustments. The measures fuelled all-time high inflation of 38% year-on-year in May, which is still hovering above 30%.",
    "The fund said that despite elevated inflation, \u201cwith appropriately tight policy\u201d it could fall to 18.5% by end-June. It added the exchange rate has been \u201cbroadly stable.\u201d",
    "\u201cIMF funding along with recent inflows from multilateral lenders will further help the Pakistani rupee, that is fairly stable (over the) last few months,\u201d said Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities.",
    "He added that this new tranche would help Pakistan in getting rollovers from friendly countries like the United Arab Emirates, China and Saudi Arabia and ease external debt repayment pressure.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s international bonds, which had already clocked healthy gains earlier on Thursday, soared after the announcement. The 2036 issue enjoyed the biggest gains, jumping 3.5 cents to trade at 62.59 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s caretaker government, under interim Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, is meant to oversee a general election.",
    "Caretaker governments are usually limited to overseeing elections, but Kakar\u2019s set-up is the most empowered in Pakistan\u2019s history thanks to recent legislation that allows it to make policy decisions on economic matters.",
    "The legislation is aimed at keeping on track the conditions for the bailout secured in June.",
    "\u201cAt a time where there are uncertainties on Pakistan\u2019s upcoming elections, this IMF board decision will provide some confidence to other lenders and markets,\u201d said Sohail.",
    "Elections in the politically and economically troubled country have been scheduled for Feb. 8 after several delays. Last week the senate passed a non-binding resolution to further delay the elections, citing security concerns and a harsh winter in northern areas."
