The Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF), MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, has raised concerns regarding the financial management of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), questioning whether the institution can be considered truly independent under its current framework.

He made these remarks when CIABOC officials appeared before the Committee to discuss the Commission’s budget estimates.

“As far as I know, there is a macro-level issue here. The fundamental question is what we mean by independence. If an institution does not have financial independence, how can it claim to be independent? The issue then arises as to how the powers granted are exercised, and who has the authority to appoint the necessary staff.”

Addressing the Committee, CIABOC Director General Ranga Dissanayake stated that although provisions had been made to establish a dedicated staff for the Commission, this had not been implemented even after nearly two years.

### World Bank report slams Sri Lanka VAT amid poverty from monetary meltdown: analysis

ECONOMYNEXT – A World Bank report on Sri Lanka’s tax has slammed value added tax hike, though rate cuts and money printing for potential output targeting by macro-economists led to a collapse of the rupee and inflation that was the core reason for a dramatic rise in poverty.

The rhetoric against VAT may have negative consequences for Sri Lanka for which the poor will eventually pay a higher price if it leads to a repeat of tax cuts like in 2019, observers say.

The recent steep rise in Sri Lanka VAT was also a result of having to pay the salaries of a bloated public sector, including 100,000 development officers and other unemployed graduates hired into public service, who apparently do not have offices to sit and work according to statements made in parliament as well as a legacy large military from a civil war.

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced on Thursday to 27 years and three months in prison hours after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, dealing a powerful rebuke to one of the world’s most prominent far-right populist leaders.

The conviction ruling by a panel of five justices on Brazil’s Supreme Court, who also agreed on the sentence, made the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in the country’s history to be convicted for attacking democracy, and drew disapproval from the Trump administration.

“This criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present and its future,” Justice Carmen Lucia said before her vote to convict Bolsonaro, referring to a history checkered with military coups and attempts to overthrow democracy.

There was ample evidence that Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, acted “with the purpose of eroding democracy and institutions,” she added.

Opposition MP Prasad Siriwardena has commented on insulting Lakmali Hemachandra, a woman from the ruling party.. This is an act of insulting the entire women.. Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya urged the Speaker to severely warn the concerned MP.

During the session held in Parliament on Wednesday (10), Lakmali Hemachandra commented on the MP to insult the MP.

In South Asian countries, the female representation was low in Sri Lanka. This time 22 female representatives were elected to parliament.   Opposition parties speak insulting women as they are taking action to increase the representation of female representation.

We are trying to defeat this improper culture. The entire women should be considered insulting Lakmali Hemachandra.. The talents of female representatives are challenged by male representatives. Therefore, the Opposition MPs are strongly warned of improper opinion.

Feedback is the Breakfast of Champions is a popular phrase attributed to the author Ken Blanchard. His succinct writings using One Minute themes have a global following. The Deming cycle PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) has embedded the feedback loop into the top management governance cycle and is a gold standard in management practices. Our PDCA is more akin to Politics-Diatribe-Constituency-Attrition in practice. However, in our nation’s planning, feedback is not exactly visible. Our breakfast of short eats or loads of carbs with some sambol and curry has led to more NCD prevalence than progress.

### Responsibility of universities in getting graduates job-ready

Universities must be both sanctuaries for knowledge and launchpads for careers

For centuries, universities were sanctuaries of scholarship, tasked with preserving and transmitting knowledge. While this foundation remains vital, today’s rapidly changing world has added a new responsibility: ensuring that graduates are not only knowledgeable but also job-ready.

This shift is driven by multiple stakeholders. Families invest heavily in education with the expectation of employment, while governments and industries support universities to generate a skilled workforce. When graduates lack the skills employers need, universities risk losing credibility and relevance.

### Over tourism or over visitation?

*2025-09-12 06:11:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Over-tourism-or-over-visitation/4-781559) · `en`

In the wake of the post-pandemic tourism boom, there is also mounting backlash against an excess of tourism in many countries. When too many tourists flock to a destination, exceeding its ability to manage it sustainably, it leads to negative impacts such as overcrowding, environmental degradation, strained infrastructure, reduced quality of life for residents, and a diminished visitor experience.

This is referred to as ‘over tourism’ or sometimes as ‘over visitation’.

Although the two terms sound similar, they are not quite the same. They differ in scope, impact, and interpretation.

United People's Power Parliamentarian Saminda Wijesiri said that those who have called for the burning of parliament during the Arakalai period are now shamelessly claiming that they should protect the dignity and law of Parliament and that they are now wearing tie and court.

He said this while addressing a debate on the National Audit Amendment Bill held in Parliament on Thursday (11).

Bimal Ratnayake, who is wearing a court, said in the morning of the House of Parliament and the law of Parliament. But they said that the Parliament should be completed in the Arakala period and the protesters should come.

Now we are wearing a court and talking about the law of Parliament. Not ashamed? Those who are said to be burned now say that the prestige of Parliament should be preserved. They talk like they are dead. But they are the tigers wearing the tie and the court.

### Strategic audits: Health check every strategy needs

When we fall ill, symptoms like fever or fatigue warn us that something is wrong. Organisations too face symptoms when their strategy is not working – declining performance, disengaged employees, or dissatisfied customers. But unlike the human body, strategy rarely sends obvious signals until it is too late. Traditionally, businesses rely on annual or mid-year reviews. The question is: are these enough?

In today’s volatile environment, the answer is a clear no. A far more powerful tool exists: the strategic audit. Just as medical check-ups prevent illnesses from becoming critical, strategic audits diagnose weaknesses, test assumptions, and keep strategies relevant.

Before diving into strategic audits, we must first revisit strategy itself. Strategy has been defined in many ways:

A former minister accuses our Justice Minister over the murder of the priests. But the Minister of Justice has taken steps to investigate the case of the priests.

For generations, Kinross Beach was more than just a stretch of sand; it was the vibrant heart of a community. It was the training ground for national athletes, the backdrop for countless family picnics, and the stage for sporting legends. It represented a shared public space where memory and community were forged, a testament to the simple, enduring joy of our coastal heritage. Yet, today, the ghosts of this arcadian past are swallowed by a desolate present, a mere rusting skeleton of what it once was. The once-vibrant shoreline is now a casualty of an unnatural disaster, a man-made waterloo that serves as a chilling indictment of civic neglect and corporate greed.

The law repeals the Presidents’ Entitlement Act, No. 4 of 1986, which provided former Presidents and their widows with official residences, staff, vehicles, and other privileges.

As he departed his Colombo residence, Rajapaksa made a brief statement to the media: “We were asked to leave, so we’re leaving.” When asked if he would exit politics, the former President replied that he had no intention of stepping away.

Speaking at a media briefing, Rajakaruna explained that preliminary investigations point to sparks from maintenance work as the likely cause of the blaze. The affected tank, with a capacity of 40,000 tons, had not been in operation since 2017.

“It was a crude oil tank which we had stopped using since 2017. From 2018 onwards it underwent maintenance work. At the time of the fire, it didn’t have any crude oil, but there was some residue at the bottom,” he said.

The Court was also told that as an island with limited land, Sri Lanka urgently needs a framework to maximise land use, stressing that the lack of a national plan undermines both productivity and sustainability targets.
