Pakistan scored 178 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in 20 overs.

### US research ship granted entry to SL waters for replenishment

The Sri Lankan Government has granted entry to a US research ship for replenishment purposes alone.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that while the ship was denied permission to conduct research activities, it was allowed entry for replenishment purposes.

Earlier reports indicated that the Sri Lankan Government declined a request for a research vessel to access Sri Lankan waters, consistent with its policy against permitting research ships in its maritime territory. The vessel, which included students from a US university, specifically sought permission to enter Sri Lankan waters solely for logistical support, including fuel, water purification, and food.

In December of last year, Sri Lanka suspended the entry of foreign research vessels due to significant security concerns raised by neighbouring India and the United States, particularly following the visits of two Chinese research ships within 14 months.

### If you don’t like to say genocide, think of it as mass murder

*2024-04-29 00:04:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/If-you-dont-like-to-say-genocide-think-of-it-as-mass-murder/172-281514) · `en`

In November, the UN Secretary- General called Israel’s retaliation  (including cutting off food, aid and water supply to Gaza) a genocidal  action, and  was heavily condemned by Israel and pro-Israeli lobbies  across Europe and the US.

When Israel launched a massive bombardment of the Gaza Strip in retaliation to the Hamas cross-border attack on Oct 7, 2023, I had divided sympathies, especially in view of the atrocities committed by Hamas fighters inside Israel that day.

These divided sympathies stemmed from the fact that I began my journalism career in Amman, Jordan, a step away from Jerusalem, the West Bank and Israel. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon to drive out Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) began when I was a young reporter and sub-editor at the Jordan Times. I quite understand what the Palestinians have been going through ever since the formation of Israel as a Jewish State in 1948.

### May Day and the plight of Lankan workers - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-29 00:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/May-Day-and-the-plight-of-Lankan-workers-EDITORIAL/172-281513) · `en`

This Wednesday is May Day, a day set apart to commemorate the struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements the world over. Very sadly, in our country, workers’ day has been usurped by political parties and gains lost to economic woes.

Today, workers dance and parade the streets, not to regain their lost rights of the past four to five years. They will carry forward campaigns of diverse political parties hoping to grab power at the yet undeclared elections expected to be held later this year.

The average monthly household income of the poorest 20% of our population is Rs. 17,572, raised from a meager Rs. 12,500 in March this year. But multiple energy price increases and sales tax hikes in January raised the cost of living and hit wage earners hard.

### Sri Lanka: A preferred haven for European senior citizens seeking serenity

With the baby boomer generation poised to reshape the landscape of  retirement, Sri Lanka stands at the cusp of a transformative journey—one  that promises adventure, serenity, and boundless exploration

While the concept of permanent tourism may seem novel, its implications for countries like Sri Lanka are profound. Unlike traditional short-term visitors, permanent tourists often seek extended stays, immersing themselves deeply in the cultural tapestry of their chosen destination. For many European seniors, this shift signifies a departure from mundane routines, embracing newfound freedom in the twilight years of their lives.

Exterior of the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury. Time is running out for Sri Lanka, and it should fast track the restructuring program though it is not adequate to get the country out of the present debt trap

What is being bargained is much less than the relief of $ 14 billion expected through debt restructuring. While noting that it is not a relief for Sri Lanka, the Government’s initiative to reach some agreement with them should be commended. Hence, any delay in reaching an agreement will be a killer for Sri Lanka which will have to sacrifice all the hard-earned gains so far relating to pushing the country back to normalcy
