    "Claims SLPP has\u00a0 effectively ruled out any chance for Wickremesinghe to run on its ticket",
    "Says Wickremesinghe could try to run under UNP banner but will face humiliating defeat",
    "Stresses youth will not vote for an aged politician such as Wickremesinghe given current situation of SL",
    "Warns people will soon begin protests due to sharp rise in living costs",
    "Requests Police and military to not carry out illegal orders of rulers to quash these protests",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday claimed President Ranil Wickremesinghe will not contest at the upcoming Presidential election.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo, the MP said the Presidential election will be held between 16 September and 16 October, but Wickremesinghe will not be one of the candidates.",
    "\u201cIt is evident the current President\u2019s decision will not run for the Presidency, having faced defeat in two previous Presidential elections. In 2016, anticipating another loss, he strategically nominated another instead. Subsequently, despite apparent signs of a potential victory, recognising his limitations, he presented another candidate and rode to power on their success,\u201d the MP maintained. \u201cThis time around he was appointed President due to pure luck,\u201d he added.",
    "Marikkar said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) it appears has effectively ruled out any chance for Wickremesinghe to run on its ticket. He indicated that businessman Dhammika Perera appears to have been selected as the SLPP candidate, given the prominence accorded to him during the recent SLPP National Convention.",
    "\u201cWith Dhammika Perera being selected by the SLPP as its candidate, Wickremesinghe has been left with no party to contest under. He could try contesting under the UNP banner but will face sure defeat. Given the current situation in the country the youth will not vote for an aged politician such as Wickremesinghe,\u201d Marikkar claimed.",
    "The MP predicted the country will elect a new President who will be under the age of 65. He therefore called on all state sector employees including police and military to not carry out any illegal orders by the current regime as they will have to face dire consequences following a regime change.",
    "Marikkar said the public is grappling with the significant surge in living expenses, and he anticipates that they will take to the streets at the commencement of the upcoming year. \u201cThose in power will give illegal orders when the people do this but do not carry them out. The current President on his retirement will remain safe while those who carried out the orders will have to face legal ramifications,\u201d he noted."
