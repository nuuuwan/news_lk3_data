This submission marks a historic moment, not only for Yohani but also for Sri Lankan music, as \u201cKella\u201d becomes the first album from Sri Lanka to be considered for this prestigious global accolade.",
    "Released on December 8, 2023, \u201cKella\u201d features 14 tracks that seamlessly blend traditional Sri Lankan sounds with contemporary global music. With 11 songs in Sinhalese and 3 in English, the album incorporates native Sri Lankan percussion, folk stories, and cultural motifs. Yohani, who first captivated international audiences in 2021 with her viral hit Manike Mage Hithe, views \u201cKella\u201d as a deeply personal expression of her roots and her musical vision.",
