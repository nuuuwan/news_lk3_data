### Tri-Forces security for ex-presidents to be withdrawn from today

It has been decided to officially withdraw the tri-forces personnel assigned to the security of former presidents, effective from today (23).

Speaking during a parliamentary session last week, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala explained the decision to withdraw the tri-forces personnel deployed to secure former presidents.

Accordingly, from today onwards, only police officers will provide security for former presidents.

The number of police officers assigned to provide security for former presidents has also been reduced. However, the government has stated that an adequate number of officers will remain in place to ensure the safety of former presidents.

Furthermore, the government emphasized that the security arrangements for former presidents will be reviewed every six months, and additional measures will be implemented as necessary.

Despite the withdrawal of tri-forces personnel, the Ministry of Defense assured that the safety and security of former presidents will be assured.

### SLPP considers contesting LG elections separately

*2024-12-23 09:02:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104431/slpp-considers-contesting-lg-elections-separately-) ┬╖ `en`

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is reportedly leaning towards contesting the upcoming local government elections independently, according to party sources.

The party is said to be exploring collaboration only with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), a key partner in their alliance.

During a recent meeting of the SLPPтАЩs political board and executive council, extensive discussions were held on these matters.

A significant number of members supported the idea of the SLPP contesting the elections without forming alliances. However, some members expressed that this stance could change depending on future developments.

The meeting also addressed the potential re-incorporation of individuals who left the party during the general election. While many council members advocated for welcoming back former members, a faction within the party opposed this move.

Sri Lanka Customs has announced that rice imports into the country will not be permitted under any circumstances until the relevant Gazette notification is issued.

Despite this announcement, Sri Lanka Customs clarified that, without the publication of the Gazette notification, rice imports cannot be processed or released to the local market, even with government intervention.

Meanwhile, a government-imported stock of 52,000 metric tons of rice is expected to arrive in the country within the next few days.

Government sources have indicated that the Gazette notification allowing rice imports will likely be issued following todayтАЩs (23) Cabinet meeting.

### Birth Centenary Of Comrade Prins Gunasekera & The Relaunch Of тАЬA Lost Generation: Sri Lanka In Crisis: The Untold StoryтАЭ

I would like to extend my gratitude to Comrade Prins GunasekeraтАШs daughter, Mrs. Geshni Gunasekera, for inviting me to deliver a message on this special occasion of the birth centenary of the late Comrade Prins Gunasekera and the re-publication of his valuable work.

Born in Kataluwa, Galle District, Comrade Prins was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Habaraduwa electorate in March 1960 and re-elected under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ticket in 1970. However, due to conflicts with the leaders of the ruling coalition government over the Criminal Justice Commission Act and the trials to be conducted under it, he became an independent.

### Supreme Court case, eradication of corruption, Attorney General's Department: Reform these three to strengthen the rule of law

*2024-12-23 01:51:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201915) ┬╖ `ta`

Asian Human Rights Commission urges reforming Supreme Court, combating corruption, restructuring Attorney General's Department to strengthen rule of law in Sri Lanka.

ЁЯЯй

The Asian Human Rights Commission has urged the President of the Human Rights Commission to focus on the three main issues, such as rehabilitation of the Supreme Court trial, controlling corruption, and rehabilitation of the Attorney General's Department.

In a letter sent to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake by Bernando, the Director of the Asian Human Rights Commission, Basil Fernando, said:

I will bring to your notice of three reorganizations to be maintained in the reorganization of the law in Sri Lanka and the value of human rights.

We have continuously pointed out about the rule of law that has been disrupted in Sri Lanka for the past several years. This has been embodied in the speeches you have made in Parliament for a long time and in the last election by the National People's Power, and many have come together on the basis of the general purpose of establishing the best governance administration.

### Sri LankaтАЩs IMF deal: Turning point, but caution is key

The IMF deal marks the beginning, not the end, of its journey

While Sri LankaтАЩs IMF deal offers hope, the risks are real. Political instability could derail reforms, as vested interests resist change. Reform fatigue, too, is a genuine concernтАФif the public does not see tangible benefits soon, support for the program could waver. Globally, external shocksтАФrising interest rates, slowing trade, or geopolitical tensionsтАФcould further complicate the recovery. The Government must proceed with caution. An IMF deal is not a panacea; it is a foundation on which Sri Lanka must build its recovery. Strong institutions, consistent policies, and effective communication will be critical in navigating these risks

### During school holidays and festive season, many diseases are caused by food

*2024-12-23 01:44:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201914) ┬╖ `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



School holidays & festivals increase child illness from unsafe food. Parents: Provide healthy meals, avoid oily foods. Diarrhea treatment: Lemon juice, rice porridge, juices, bananas. Dehydration control crucial. Seek doctor if diarrhea persists. Be cautious in water activities. Fire safety during celebrations.

ЁЯЯй

Deepal Perera, a specialist on the Children's Hospital of the Colombo Child Hospital, said that children who go to tourism and to the outputs during the school holidays and festive season can cause food and snacks at other restaurants.

He said this in response to Kesari on Sunday (23) regarding the protection of the disease during the festive season.

Currently, school holidays have been increased and the boys are traveling for tourism for the festive season.. It is customary for tourists to buy food and snacks in restaurants and shops that see in the eyes.

Thus, when buying food items and drinks in publications, you should act with care. Consuming contaminated foods can lead to diseases such as diarrhea and typhide fever. Therefore, parents should provide healthy food and drinks affected by the children.

DMK urges release of Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankans. Meeting calls for action to free captives and return boats, citing impact on bilateral ties and fishermen's livelihoods.

ЁЯЯй

It has been urged to release the Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankan fishermen.

The issue was investigated at a meeting of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Executive Committee at the Chennai -Artist Stadium yesterday (22) chaired by party leader MK Stalin.

Meanwhile, members of the party at the Executive Committee said that the arrest of Indian fishermen and confiscating their boats would question their livelihood.

The prison sentence imposed on Indian fishermen in the Sri Lankan courts has been pointed out to disrupt the friendship between the two countries.

The DMK Executive Committee meeting has asked the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to take steps to release the Indian fishermen who are currently captured in Sri Lanka and the release of their boats.. (A)

### Rumpus about campus qualifications

*2024-12-22 23:52:57* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rumpus-about-campus-qualifications/4-770884) ┬╖ `en`

A highly qualified politician without integrity or empathy can cause more harm than an unqualified but ethical leader

Sri LankaтАЩs Parliament is ablaze with a fiery debate over questionable campus qualifications, with the spotlight now on the JVP/NPP. Since voters placed their trust in the party as champions of honesty, integrity, and anti-corruption, the party now finds itself entangled in a web of controversy. Their rise to power on a platform of transparency has hit a stumbling block, as allegations of fabricated academic credentials leave them scrambling for cover, raising eyebrows and questions about their credibility.

It is important to emphasise that in past governments, such questions and investigations were often curtailed immediately, sometimes with verbal and physical threats. Therefore, citizens must welcome this change. However, the ability to question alone should not be considered a success.

Fear not, Mr. President, you may not speak the language of the King but you speak the language of the heart

Firstly, a very Merry Christmas to you and yours. This year it must be a very different Christmas for you. You seem to have been a good boy and Santa came early for you. All your Christmases came at once. It is good to see that now you are playing Santa Claus and distributing goodies all around. Some are gleefully dreaming of their bright and shiny new cars in the near future! Hopefully you are making sure that all those naughty little boys and girls who brought our country down to the lowest ebb will also receive their just desserts in due course.

### Central Bank, NGO Secretariat and weaponisation of Financial Action Task Force

As FATF has pointed out, blanket and arbitrary measures can drive financial flows underground, thereby undermining the entire purpose of the FATF standards and instead increase terror financing risks

Two entities play a visible and critical role in State attempts to place repressive controls on CSOs; the NGO Secretariat and the CBSL. The third entity that is the driver of these attempts but has largely operated in the shadows is the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The issuance of the 12 December instructions by the NGO Secretariat, indicates the MOD is slowly becoming visible and its role in State attempts to control CSOs/NGOs is being legitimised

### Removing ban on vehicle imports: Is it a prudent plan?

*2024-12-22 23:41:45* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Removing-ban-on-vehicle-imports-Is-it-a-prudent-plan/4-770881) ┬╖ `en`

The highest risk is not the decision to import vehicles but linking the tariff income as a source of funding to pay the proposed salary increases, because if dollar outflow is going to be significant destabilising the existing macroeconomic stability, there is no way to contain vehicle imports as such restriction will reduce the targeted tariff income jeopardising the Government plan to provide money for salary increases without increasing taxes

The GovernmentтАЩs plan to lift the ban on vehicle imports is out. But it is not a prudent plan, perhaps it cannot prevail. Sometimes it might create macroeconomic chaos and uncertainty among the vehicle importing entrepreneurs. Any policy that cannot be sustained or justified in view of┬а strengthening the macroeconomic environment of the country is usually treated as a bad policy.

### Deleted CCTV footage recovered in Hatton bus accident

Police have recovered the CCTV footage alleged to have been deleted from the private bus involved in a tragic accident in the Malliappuwa area on Saturday (21), which claimed the lives of three people including a school student.

The accident occurred at around 10.00 a.m. when a private passenger bus travelling from Hatton to Kandy veered off the road and plunged 20 feet down a concrete embankment. Initial investigations suggest that the driver lost control of the vehicle.

During police interrogations, the bus driver claimed that the bus door had opened, causing him to lose balance and nearly fall out. In an attempt to hold on to the steering wheel, he was unable to regain control, leading to the crash.

Police have discovered that someone had later deleted the CCTV footage recorded during the accident. However, using advanced technology methods, the police successfully recovered the footage, which they say provides critical evidence regarding the incident.
