    "Claiming that people have not prospered economically as claimed by the government, National Peoples\u2019 Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today that only the UNP politicians who were sent home by the people have prospered right now.",
    "Speaking at a protest rally organized by the NPP in Tangalle, he said the economy was not being restored as claimed repeatedly by the government and said the value of the rupee is appreciating against the US Dollar due to the import bans and the defaulting of foreign loans.",
    "\u201cIf the economy is improving, people must feel the difference in their standards of living. They must have sufficient medicines, food and other necessities. People have lost their jobs, the apparel sector has collapsed by 20 percent,\u201d he said and added that only the UNPers such as Navin Dissasnayake, Rosy Senanayake, Ashu Marasinghe and Saman Rathnapriya who were defeated at the elections have prospered now,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake said the government was evading elections and added that the NPP would take to the streets to obtain the elections as neither the government is prepared to hold the elections nor is there a court ruling regarding the matter.",
    "He said President Ranil Wickremesinghe has no plans to develop the economy other than to sell state assets. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
