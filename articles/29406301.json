    "The Department of Meteorology has issued an advisory for strong winds for the Northern, North-central, Western, Southern, North-western and Central provinces and in Trincomalee and Monaragala districts.",
    "It states that strong winds of about 50-60kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in Northern, North-central, Western, Southern and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee and Monaragala districts, due to the increase of south-west monsoonal wind flow over the island.",
    "Fairly strong winds of about 30-40kmph can be expected at times elsewhere of the island, says the Met. Department.",
    "Meanwhile, in a separate advisory for heavy rain, the department said the prevailing rain and wind conditions are expected to continue further due to the south-west monsoon that has established over the island.",
    "Heavy showers above 100 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Nuwara-Eliya district.",
    "Fairly heavy showers about 75 mm are likely at some places in North-western and Southern provinces and in Kandy district, it said."
