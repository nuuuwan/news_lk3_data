    "NPP MP Vijitha Herath has resigned from the Parliamentary Committee appointed by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane to look into the insolvency of Sri Lanka, claiming that the committee would not fulfill the expected outcome.",
    "In a letter to the Speaker, the MP said controversy has emerged regarding the MPs who were appointed to the committee from the ruling party.",
    "He said it is absurd to expect that a committee comprising of majority MPs who were instrumental in putting the country into bankruptcy would look into the actual reasons for the situation or come up with proposals or recommendations regarding the matter.",
    "The MP said he was resigning as a member of the said committee as it is no use in representing such a committee.",
    "The Committee comprises MPs Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Ranjith Bandara, Eran Wickramaratne, Vijitha Herath, Pradeep Undugoda, S. Rasamanikam, D.V. Chanaka, Mahindananda Aluthgmage, Jayantha Ketagoda, Harshana Rajakaruna, Sanjeewa Edirimanne and Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
