Dear Mr. President, I write to you not only as a concerned citizen but as someone who is deeply invested in the international standing and reputation of Sri Lanka. Just a few months ago, I was among those who voiced their skepticism about your ascent to the presidency, questioning whether your promises of eradicating corruption and prioritizing the welfare of the people would blossom into genuine change.

Yet, today, I reach across the chasm of our political differences to appeal to a shared hope: a united and harmonious Sri Lanka – ensuring religious freedom or belief to all. As you have articulated in your speeches, Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads—we either repeat divisive politics or create an opportunity to build a nation that values the rich diversity of its people.

### The Downplaying of Our National Languages: the Advantages of English

*2024-11-16 23:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-downplaying-of-our-national-languages-the-advantages-of-english/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical stories by LC Arulpragasam)

I recognized the advantages that we had inherited from the British through our knowledge of the English language. But I also began to realize that we had so exalted our knowledge of English that it had been at the expense of the neglect of our national languages. For example in India, although the members of its upper/middle classes spoke impeccable English, they conversed at home in Hindi or in their regional languages, whereas in Ceylon the middle class usually spoke English at home, with the local languages being reserved only for the servants.

### Inquiries about a Legacy and learning law for fun

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

It was also during this period that I received a rather curt letter from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue stating that his department had received information that I had come in for a legacy of a house and several acres of land. He directed that this be declared forthwith so that the department could assess the tax and any penalties to be paid. This was a bit too much. I was extremely busy and had no time for tomfoolery. I called the stenographer and dictated the following reply:-

I was delighted to receive your letter dated …. I shall be most grateful if you could please provide me very early, all particulars regarding this legacy, with addresses, etc., so that I may be enabled to enter upon it without any delay. I am anxiously looking forward to this. Please rest assured that I would be prepared to gladly pay any tax you may levy on it and any penalties you may decide on.

Last week’s presidential election was doubtless one of the most consequential in US history. Though the outcome was not predictable – most polls showed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump – with the benefit of hindsight one can say that the Democrats should have seen it coming. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be a slew of analyses and diagnoses claiming to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. Yet as Sri Lankan political analyst Rajni Gamage rightly put it in a recent tweet, such diagnoses are themselves problematic, and point to the biases of those making them.

He said Maashooga means ‘darling’ or ‘beloved.’ He was a charming young man, about six feet two inches tall, with a light moustache and penetrating eyes. His long hair partially covered his face, which had a few pimples. I thought he was in his early twenties. He wore a salwar kameez and a colourful Sindhi cap decorated with beads and threads. He looked like a polio victim as his right leg was about two inches shorter than his left leg.
