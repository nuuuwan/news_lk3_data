    "Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka's Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'C' from 'CC'. The issue ratings on local-currency bonds have also been downgraded to 'C' from 'CC'.",
    "The Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR has been affirmed at 'RD' (Restricted Default) and the Country Ceiling at 'B.",
    "Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019. The issue ratings on local-currency bonds have also been downgraded to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019. The Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR has been affirmed at \u2018RD\u2019 (Restricted Default) and the Country Ceiling at \u2018B-\u2018.",
    "Fitch typically does not assign Outlooks to ratings of \u2018CCC+\u2019 or below.",
    "Domestic Debt Restructuring Proposal Announced: The downgrade of Sri Lanka\u2019s LTLC IDR reflects Fitch\u2019s view that a sovereign local-currency debt restructuring process has begun, as parliament approved the government\u2019s domestic debt restructuring plan on 1 July. On 4 July, the authorities launched a formal exchange offer to bondholders for those bonds that are eligible for the restructuring.",
    "Restructuring Plan Outlined: The debt restructuring announcement outlines a domestic debt optimisation (DDO) strategy, which includes treatment of Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic debt as well as domestically issued foreign-currency debt. The key elements of the DDO includ: conversion of CBSL\u2019s T-bills and provisional advances to the government into treasury bonds (T-bonds); exchange of superannuation funds\u2019 T-bonds into longer maturity T-bonds; exchange of outstanding Sri Lanka development bonds (SLDBs), which are US-dollar denominated but governed by local law, into new US dollar or Sri Lankan rupee instruments; and, restructuring of local-law foreign-currency denominated bank loans of the government.",
    "The debt restructuring excludes banks\u2019 holdings of Sri Lankan rupee-denominated treasury securities, but bank holdings of SLDBs will be affected.",
    "DDO Qualifies as DDE: In Fitch\u2019s view, the proposed DDO will qualify as a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under our criteria, as it entails a material reduction in terms and is needed to avoid a traditional payment default. We will downgrade the LTLC IDR to \u2018RD\u2019 upon closing of the exchange offer and following confirmation that the exchange will be executed. The government plans to complete the exchange within July.",
    "Foreign Currency IDR in Default: The sovereign remains in default on foreign-currency obligations and has initiated a debt restructuring arrangement with official and private external creditors. The Ministry of Finance had issued a statement on 12 April 2022 that it had suspended normal debt servicing of several categories of external debt, including bonds issued in international capital markets, foreign currency-denominated loan agreements and credit facilities with commercial banks and institutional lenders.",
    "ESG \u2013 Governance: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of \u20185\u2019 for Political Stability and Rights as well as for the Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption. These scores reflect the high weight that the World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model (SRM). Sri Lanka has a medium WBGI ranking in the 45th percentile, reflecting a recent record of peaceful political transitions, a moderate level of rights for participation in the political process, moderate institutional capacity, established rule of law and a moderate level of corruption.",
    "ESG \u2013 Creditor Rights: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of \u20185\u2019 for Creditor Rights, as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight. The affirmation of Sri Lanka\u2019s LTFC IDR at \u2018RD\u2019 reflects a default event.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The LTLC IDR will be further downgraded once the government executes its domestic debt restructuring.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "Following completion of the DDE, the sovereign LTLC IDR will likely be lifted out of \u2018RD\u2019 to a rating that appropriately reflects its prospects.",
    "For the LTFC IDR, completion of the foreign-currency commercial debt restructuring that Fitch judges to have normalised relationship with private-sector creditors may result in an upgrade.",
    "In accordance with the rating criteria for ratings in the \u2018CCC\u2019 range and below, Fitch\u2019s sovereign rating committee has not used the SRM and QO to explain the ratings, which are instead guided by the rating definitions.",
    "Fitch\u2019s SRM is the agency\u2019s proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LTFC IDR. Fitch\u2019s QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the LTFC IDR, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM.",
    "International scale credit ratings of Sovereigns, Public Finance and Infrastructure issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of three notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from \u2018AAA\u2019 to \u2018D\u2019. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance."
