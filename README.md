### Sri Lanka risks foreign retaliation over VFS visa deal

ECONOMYNEXT – The Maldives could take reciprocal action after Sri Lanka’s new system of outsourcing its visas, which requires the payment of “processing” and “convenience” charges of 26 dollars, even though the government does not collect any fees.

Maldivian authorities have reminded Sri Lanka of the long-standing bilateral agreement under which their citizens could travel freely between the two neighbours without any charges or bureaucratic barriers.

Maldivians, who consider Sri Lanka their second home, often spend more than a month in the larger country, but are now required to pay 26 dollars to VFS Global, which has controversially been contracted to handle Sri Lankan visas.

“The Sri Lankan government will not charge a fee, but Maldivians still have to pay VFS after applying online for a visa,” a Maldivian government official said in the capital, Male. “This violates the spirit of our agreement.”

For the first time in its history, not a single member was elected to Parliament. The UNP received a national list in compassion for 249, 435 (2.15 %). The party had only one member in the 225 -member parliament.

UNP leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a Member of Parliament for 43 years since 1977. In the 2015 general election, the Colombo district candidates came to the peak of over five lakhs of votes in the list of candidates..

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will welcome Elon Musk later this year, Senior Adviser to the President on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardene said.

“When we introduce Starlink and welcome Elon Musk to Sri Lanka, this would open the door to more billionaires coming into the country,” Wijewardene told reporters on Monday.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe met Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, at the recently concluded 10th World Water Forum in Bali, Indonesia.

“Elon Musk stated that the project would require the President’s support. In response, President Wickremesinghe assured him of full support to initiate the project in Sri Lanka. Musk also mentioned that he plans to visit Sri Lanka at the end of this year to start the project,” Wijewardene said.

“We have to show that we are confident in getting Starlink,” Wijewardene said. “And that Sri Lanka is a place for global projects and more investments. Once that is finished, we can introduce SpaceX.”

Veteran politician and former Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Anuradhapura district MP Tissa Karaliyadda officially joined the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) over the weekend.

Karaliyadda joined the SJB after meeting with party leader Sajith Premadasa in Polonnaruwa on Saturday. Premadasa was in town for a party rally when he welcomed Karaliyadda into the SJB. The event was also attended by SJB MP Rohana Bandara.

Karaliyadda entered Parliament representing the Anuradhapura district and has served as the Cabinet Minister for Child Development and Women’s Affairs, as well as the Minister of Indigenous Medicine.

The veteran politician found himself embroiled in controversy in 2015 when a photograph of him alongside underworld figure Iron Ranasinghe, alias SF Loku Malli, a prime suspect in the murder of nightclub owner Wasantha de Zoysa, went viral. At the time Karaliyadda denied any connection to Ranasinghe and the murder of de Zoysa in Anuradhapura.
