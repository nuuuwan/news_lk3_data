The Paradise Member of Parliament, Rishad Badidin, has said that it is the ignorance of the party that has said that Al -Alim's examination is the only one who is the author of the Moulavimar as teachers.

Al -Alim said in a press release sent to the media regarding the exam.

The reason for the creation of the Almighty It does not mean that the smaller is better than the rim.

But then Rishad Badiudeen and Rauf Hakim were the ministers who were ministers, and the Moulavi editor of the Moulavi Editor to the Editor. Since then, the Ulama Party has been in the process.

If a person who has been held at the GCE high -rise, the teacher's appointment is available for three years at Kalvikkaluri.

But if a Moulavi is available for a Moulavi, it is the great injustice it is to Moulavi to pass the Moulavi and end the GCE high -level and to pass the Al -Alim exam.

"Two former MPs agreed to recommend liquor store licenses without contesting recent elections. 361 licenses issued, sparking political bribery allegations. High Court case pending on district liquor store limits."

🟩

Two of our MPs agreed that they were allowed to set up liquor stores. Jaffna has not contested the election. Former parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran said.

He said this while participating in a press conference held at the Jaffna Vadamarachchi Media House in VM Road in Point Pedro on Thursday (19).

Each district has a definition of liquor schools permits.. But they did not contest the election this time.

361 liquor schools have been granted permission in the past. This is a political bribery. These have been made on the recommendation of MPs. It was announced during the election campaign that we would reveal this. But even though all the liquor schools were allowed, they were given in the recommendation of any MPs.

This is a type of political bribery. The High Court has a case regarding how many schools a district should be located. I hope that its verdict will be released in January.

### Social media is also a reason for my failure - Douglas Devananda

*2024-12-20 11:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201713) · `ta`

Douglas Devananda attributes election loss to social media misinformation. He claims false propaganda spread via social platforms contributed to his defeat. The former fisheries minister accuses a Jaffna businessman of spreading slander, citing unresolved trade issues as motivation.

🟩

Former Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said social media was also the reason for my failure.

We have a setback in this election. It can also be called a temporary rest in politics. When was the minister, there was work on the head. At present it is not.

Thus we examine the reduction within the party. We have taken steps to address the grievances and take steps to bring the people to the policy of the party. We will also hold the party's national conference very soon.

Social websites are responsible for the fall of Douglas and the rise of Anura. They carried out false propaganda against me through social websites.

They do not exacerbate their videos because they do not want to prevent their income because they are using my name.

News can be seen through newspapers, televisions and radio in the past. Currently, with a hand phone, from the sewage to the bedroom to the bedroom, it is easy to watch the videos, so it reaches people.

### Sri Lanka extends exchange controls devised by central bank till June

*2024-12-20 07:12:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-extends-exchange-controls-devised-by-central-bank-till-june-195357/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers have approved and extension of exchange controls in a proposed by the central bank to extend for six months exchange controls which expired on December 19.

The cabinet has approved extending the exchange control regulation for another six months.

The exchange controls have been revised, a post-cabinet statement said without specifying the changes.

The June 2024 regulations were also less tighter than the earlier ones.

Sri Lanka and other central banks which go to the International Monetary Fund regularly impose exchange control on the people due to deep flaws in their operating framework where monetary policy is in fundamental conflict with exchange rate policy.

When the policy conflicts intensify due to open market operations to narrowly target a policy rate, exchange controls are intensified instead of correcting monetary policy.

### Waqf or Habs? Urgent need for strong and independent Waqf Board

*2024-12-20 06:26:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Waqf-or-Habs-Urgent-need-for-strong-and-independent-Waqf-Board/4-770758) · `en`

The Waqf Board’s role is not just to preserve property but to ensure that these assets are used effectively to benefit the community

In recent times, the removal and appointment of Waqf Board members have become a subject of intense controversy, driven by political pressures that undermine the very essence of the Waqf system. This interference not only dilutes the authority of the Waqf Board but also threatens its role as a pillar of Islamic social welfare. The Waqf, as an institution founded on the principles of Sharia law, is meant to be a self-sustaining force for good, benefiting generations to come. Yet, when political motives enter the picture, the sanctity and independence of the Waqf are compromised, turning it into a mere shadow of its potential.

### Politics of MMDA reform and system change

The time is ripe for the new Government that is committed for system change to take up the issue of implementing those MMDA reforms

“System change” was the magical slogan coined by the Aragalaya youth, and that slogan turned out to be the magnetic vote puller for Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and his National People’s Power (NPP) at the Presidential and General Elections respectively. Although in their public campaigns AKD and NPP identified the post-independence political culture of ethnonationalism and its corrupt system of governance as the two crucial areas to be ended or radically reformed through a social revolution there are also other elements under the old system that requires reforms. In respect of the Muslim community, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) of 1951 is one such area that requires urgent reforms.
