    "Cardinal was referring to the statement of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa where he denies telling the former that recormendations made by the Presidential Commission cannot be implemented as he will have to take action against people and associations which were close to him.",
    "\"Both I and my secretary can confirm and prove that the fomer President talked to me over the phone on Febuary 2 2021. Rajapaksa has said recently that the Presidential Commission which probed the Easter Sunday bomb attacks has only recormended banning Islamic extrmist organizations. However, the report has clearly recommended banning a non-Islamic organization as well. The former President cannot deny these facts,\" the Cardinal said in a statement.",

Also, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has accused the present government for failing to implement recormendations made by the Presidential Commission.
