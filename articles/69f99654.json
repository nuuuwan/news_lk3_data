    "Kamindu Mendis beat out tough competition from Sri Lanka teammate Prabath Jayasuriya and Australia\u2019s Travis Head to claim the monthly award, with the stylish left-hander adding to the honour he claimed in March earlier this year.",
    "Mendis played in four Tests during the month, scoring 451 runs at an average of 90.20, helping his side to a consolation win at The Oval in England before playing his part in a superb series triumph against New Zealand back in Sri Lanka.",
    "Mendis was thrilled to win the award for the second time this year and is already working hard on achieving even greater things within his cricketing career.",
    "\u201cI am honoured to be once again chosen as the ICC Men\u2019s Player of the Month, and this accolade brings me immense happiness and pride, as I believe all the hard work that was put into becoming the player that I am today is starting to pay off and being recognised consistently in the global stage,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis recognition gives me further strength to continue my good work on the cricketing field and aspire for bigger achievements, thus helping my team win games and bring glory to our country and happiness to our fans.\u201d",
    "During September, Mendis became the first men\u2019s player in history to pass fifty in each of the first eight matches of his Test career.",
    "And during the month he became the fastest batter in 75 years to bring up 1000 Test runs \u2013 doing so in just eight Tests and matching Don Bradman\u2019s effort of reaching the landmark in 13 innings.",
    "His biggest score of the month was a dominant 182* in Sri Lanka\u2019s mammoth first-innings total of 602/5 declared in the second Test against New Zealand, a knock that helped set up a convincing win.",
    "But arguably more impressive was his 114 in the first innings of the first Test of that series.",
    "His side had been in trouble at 88/3 when Mendis came in to bat, with Angelo Mathews also having retired hurt. No other batter on either side reached triple figures in the match, which Sri Lankan went on to win by just 63 runs."
