    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lankan legal fraternity\u2019s mind-set, slow process, lack of emergency arbitrators, and decades-old legislation have prevented the island nation becoming a real international arbitration hub in the region, experts say.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Cabinet had granted approval to establish a Sri Lanka International Arbitration Centre as a regional hub in the year 2012, for resolving disputes arising out of International Commercial Agreements and other International affairs.",
    "Though it was established in 2020, the local arbitration center is yet to prove as an international arbitration center, on par with Singapore, analysts say.",
    "Some countries engage in generating a colossal sum of income by way of involving in international arbitration through the establishment of an International Arbitration Centre.",
    "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges was the mind-set,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Janak De Silva told Colombo Arbitration Week conference in Colombo on Sunday (06).",
    "\u201cArbitration was thought of as an after hours work where you finish your court work and then come and continue with arbitration in the evening. That meant about two to three hours of work,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAnd the so-called positives of arbitration; speedy, litigation, cost-effective, is questioned. At the end of the day you lose sight of the objectives of arbitration. This is not after hours work. It is something bigger,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere is a problem with the mind-set of the arbitrators as well who question whether this is an extension of the adversarial system. In order to recognize and give effect to arbitration the courts should only interfere with what is mandated under law.\u201d",
    "The Arbitration Act was enacted in 1995 in Sri Lanka, giving recognition to party autonomy with the appointment of arbitrators as well as provisions for the recognition and enforcement of arbitration laws.",
    "\u201cMany institutional rules now enable the appointment of an emergency arbitrator. The Sri Lankan act contains no reference to emergency arbitrators,\u201d Romesh Weeramanthri, a special Consultant in the International Arbitration and Dispute Resolutions at Clifford Chance, said.",
    "Countries like Dubai and Switzerland have made efforts in becoming global arbitration hubs.",
    "In 2021, Dubai abolished several arbitration institutions and merged them with the Dubai International Arbitration Centre.",
    "In Switzerland, the Chambers of Commerce and Industry in several Swiss towns had their own arbitration centres agreed to one set of unified rules called the Swiss Arbitration Rules.",
    "\u201cTo get Sri Lanka on the map, this type of consolidation and centralization might be necessary,\u201d Anselmo Reyes, a former judge of the High Court of Hong Kong, said.",
    "\u201cThis can be used to draw the market in South Africa to Sri Lanka; a market that might go elsewhere if one does not develop the special advantages.\u201d (Colombo/August 08/2023)"
