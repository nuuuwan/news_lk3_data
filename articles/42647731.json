    "Colombo, May 13 (Daily Mirror) - Responding to allegations of police officers misusing the Yukthiya Operation and being involved with criminals in exchange for bribes, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said that stringent action will be taken against any officers found abusing their authority.",
    "The minister told Daily Mirror that he would not tolerate any such incidents and asserted that he had already taken action against certain police officers implicated in such allegations and their association with criminals. \"When we look at recent incidents, everyone knows the about the action I have taken against those found misusing their uniforms,\" he said.",
    "Recently, several MPs alleged that innocent people including school children are arrested under the Yukthiya Operation for minor offences in some police stations and they are unreasonably charged under Act 54 of the Criminal Procedure.",
    "SLPP MP Samanpriya Herath told Parliament that people have faced serious issues in the Kurunegala district as youth found loitering at junctions and roads are also taken into custody and charged under Act 54 of the Criminal Procedure.",
    "In response to allegations, Minister Alles refuted claims of innocent people being wrongfully detained under the operation and asserted that such incidents may have occurred during routine police raids, not under Yukthiya operations.",
    "Explaining the nature of the Yukthiya Operation, Minister Alles clarified its focus on arresting identified drug traffickers rather than individuals solely involved in drug consumption.",
    "Addressing concerns raised against police, Minister Alles acknowledged that there are issues within certain police stations and pledged to take action against any officers found engaging in misconduct.",
    "\"I'm aware that there are concerns within certain police stations. Some individuals have issues against specific Police OICs and wanted to remove them. However, it's important to note that I can't simply remove OICs, SSPs, or DIGs at will. There is a procedure for such actions. I have never succumbed to political pressure in these matters,\" the minister said.",
    "The minister said that he is not concerned about the opinions of a few individuals regarding the Yukthiya operation.",
    "\"The majority of the public understand what we are actually doing. They can gauge whether there is a reduction in drug-related incidents. My focus lies solely on these people. I am committed to creating a drug-free country. However, if any police officers are involved in any misuse incidents, I will take swift and decisive action against them,\" he said."
