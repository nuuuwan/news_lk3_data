    "In a significant boost to Sri Lanka\u2019s green economic revival, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have certified 100 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) under the National Sustainable Tourism Certification (NSTC) scheme, reinforcing the island\u2019s commitment to eco-friendly and inclusive tourism growth.",
    "The certification, aligned with Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) standards, highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s push to position itself as a global leader in sustainable tourism \u2013 a sector that employs thousands and contributes over 50% of the nation\u2019s GDP. The awards ceremony, graced by Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath, UNDP Resident Representative Azusa Kubota, and British Deputy High Commissioner Lisa Whanstall, underscored the critical role of public-private partnerships in driving nature-positive investments.",
    "A standout achievement of this year\u2019s awards is the marked increase in women-led tourism businesses, with 27 of the 100 certified SMEs being female-owned \u2013 five times higher than the industry average. This milestone aligns with Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Paris Agreement.",
    "\u201cBy embedding sustainability into tourism, we\u2019re not just protecting our environment but also creating livelihoods and empowering underrepresented groups,\u201d said SLTDA Chairman Buddika Hewawasam.",
    "Since 2018, UNDP\u2019s Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN), backed by Germany, France, the UK, Switzerland, and the EU, has supported Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable tourism roadmap. The 2023 expansion to SMEs, particularly women entrepreneurs, aims to unlock new market opportunities as global demand for eco-conscious travel surges.",
    "Azusa Kubota of UNDP stressed, \u201cFor Sri Lanka to emerge as a resilient, sustainable destination, all stakeholders must unite to promote responsible tourism and inclusive growth.\u201d",
    "With the global wellness tourism market projected to hit $1 trillion by 2025, Sri Lanka\u2019s rich biodiversity, Ayurveda heritage, and cultural assets offer a competitive edge. The NSTC scheme equips local businesses to capitalize on this trend while preserving the island\u2019s ecological and cultural legacy.",
    "As Sri Lanka charts its post-pandemic recovery, these certifications signal a transformative shift, proving that tourism can thrive in harmony with both people and the planet.",
