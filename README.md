### பாராளுமன்ற உத்தியோகத்தர்களிடம் விளக்கம் கேட்க முடிவு

*2024-12-15 12:02:24* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/பாராளுமன்ற-உத்தியோகத்தர்களிடம்-விளக்கம்-கேட்க-முடிவு/175-348744) · `ta`

சில பட்டங்கள் போலியானவை என்று கண்டுபிடிக்கப்பட்டதைத் தொடர்ந்து, பாராளுமன்ற இணையதளத்தில் உள்ள அனைத்து எம்.பி.க்களின் தகவல்களையும் மீண்டும் சரிபார்த்து புதுப்பிக்கும் செயல்முறை நடந்து வருகிறது.

இணையத்தில் தகவல்களைப் புதுப்பிக்கும் பொறுப்பில் உள்ளவர்களிடம் விளக்கம் கேட்கவும் பாராளுமன்ற அதிகாரிகள் முடிவு செய்துள்ளனர்.

இதேவேளை, பாராளுமன்ற இணையத்தளத்தில் உள்ள பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர்களின் கோப்பகத்தில் நீதி மற்றும் தேசிய ஒருமைப்பாட்டு அமைச்சர் ஹர்ஷன நாணயக்காரவின் பெயருக்கு முன்பாக கலாநிதி என்ற தலைப்பு குறிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளதாக பாராளுமன்றத்தின் தொடர்பாடல் திணைக்களம் தெரிவித்துள்ளது.

பாராளுமன்றத்திற்கு வழங்கிய தகவல்களில் ஹர்ஷன நாணயக்கார கலாநிதி பட்டம் பெற்றுள்ளதாக குறிப்பிடவில்லை என்பது குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.

அமைச்சரின் பெயருக்கு முன்னால் குறித்த பட்டம் காட்சிப்படுத்தப்பட்டமையானது, தொடர்புடைய தரவை உள்ளிடுவதில் ஏற்பட்ட தவறுதலின் விளைவாகும். அதன்படி, இந்த தவறை சரி செய்ய நடவடிக்கை எடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

தமிழகத்தில் தஞ்சமடைந்த ஈழத் தமிழர்களை தாயகத்தில் மீள குடியேற்றுவதற்கான சில செயற்பாடுகள் கடந்த காலங்களிலும் முன்னெடுக்கப்பட்டன. சில ஆயிரம் ஈழத் தமிழர்கள் இதன்போது தாயகம் திரும்பியிருக்கிறார்கள். ஆனால், எதிா்பாா்த்த அளவுக்கு அது இருக்கவில்லை.

### சபாநாயகர் தொடர்பான சர்ச்சை : அரசாங்கத்தின் செயற்பாடு வரவேற்கத்தக்கது - ஜீவன்

*2024-12-15 11:46:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201281) · `ta`

சபாநாயகர் அசோக ரன்வலவின் பதவி இராஜினாமா அவசியமான ஒன்றாக இருந்தாலும், முக்கியமான பதவிகளுக்கான பிரமுகர்களை தேர்ந்தெடுக்கும்போது அரசாங்கம் தீர்மானம் எடுப்பதில் ஏற்பட்டுள்ள அசமந்தமான குறைபாட்டை பிரதிபலிப்பதாகத் தெரிவித்துள்ள ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சியின் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் ஜீவன் தொண்டமான், இந்த நிலைமையை சரி செய்வதற்கான அரசாங்கத்தின் முயற்சி வரவேற்கத்தக்கது என்றும் குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.

கலாநிதி பட்டம் தொடர்பில் எழுந்த கடும் சர்ச்சைக்கு மத்தியில் உரிய ஆவணங்களை சமர்பிக்க தவறிய சபாநாயகர் தனது சபாநாயகர் பதவியை இராஜினாமா செய்தார். இலங்கை பாராளுமன்ற வரலாற்றில் சபாநாயகர் ஒருவர் சுயமாக பதவி விலகுவது இதுவே முதன்முறையாகும்.

இந்நிலையில் ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சியின் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் ஜீவன் தொண்டமான் தனது உத்தியோகபூர்வ எக்ஸ் தளத்தில் இது தொடர்பில் பதிவொன்றையிட்டு மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.

🟩

Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara says that the Opposition is named for a name for the post of Speaker.

He was speaking at a media briefing in Colombo today (15).

The name is proposed at the 17th meeting of the 17th meeting, MP Nalin Bandara.

"The JVP must act as a responsible party. Clearly, the Speaker is not enough to resign. The people of the country have been mislead. You have to leave his own MP. We have a serious criticism in this regard. We hope to suggest a speech on Tuesday. Because we have no faith in the qualifications or confidence of the person who despises Speaker. There is serious doubt about this. The next time we can't be deceived. We too were deceived. So we will definitely suggest the next parliamentary opposition. But it does not guarantee the false educational guy. "

Meanwhile, there was an intense controversy in the country recently regarding the doctorate in the country recently.

In such a backdrop, he said that he had decided to resign from the post of Speaker.

### அசாத் அரசினால் கொல்லப்பட்ட பின்னர் சிரிய எழுச்சியின் முகமாக மாறிய 13 வயது சிறுவன் - 'நாங்கள் அனுபவித்ததை அசாத்தும் அனுபவிக்கவேண்டும் " தாயின் மனக்குமுறல்

*2024-12-15 10:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201310) · `ta`

பசார் அல் அசாத்த பதவிகவிழ்ப்பதற்கான முயற்சிகள் சிரியாவின் வேறு எந்த பகுதியையும் விட டெரா என்ற சிரிய நகரத்திலேயே ஆரம்பமானது. இந்த நகரம் ஜோர்தான் சிரிய எல்லையில் காணப்படுகின்றது.

இந்த நகரத்தில் 2011 மே 21ம் திகதி சித்திரவதை செய்து சிதைக்கப்பட்ட 13 வயது ஹம்சா அல் ஹட்டிப்பின் உடலை  அசாத்தின் அதிகாரிகள் குடும்பத்தவர்களிடம் ஒப்படைத்தனர்.

அவர் சித்திரவதை செய்து கொல்லப்பட்டதால் சீற்றமடைந்த பதின்மவயதினர் சுவர்களில் அசாத்திற்கு எதிரான வாசகங்களை எழுததொடங்கினார்கள். அரசாங்கத்திற்கு எதிரான ஆர்ப்பாட்டங்கள் தீவிரமடைந்தன,அதனை தொடர்ந்து அரசபடையினர் மிக மோசமான ஒடுக்குமுறைகளில் ஈடுபட்டனர்.

ஆனால் நாங்கள் அந்த வீட்டிற்கு சென்றவேளை யாரும் அசாத் அரசாங்கத்தின் வீழ்ச்சியை எவரும் கொண்டாடுவதை காணமுடியவில்லை.

சில நிமிடங்களிற்கு முன்னர் அசாத்தின் கொடுரமான சைட்னயா  சிறைச்சாலையிலிருந்து  எடுக்கப்பட்ட ஆவணஙய்களை அந்த குடும்பத்தினருக்கு சிலர் அனுப்பிவைத்திருந்தனர். அந்த ஆவணத்தில் ஹம்சாவின் மூத்த சகோதரர் ஒமாரும் சிரிய பாதுகாப்பு படையினரால் கைதுசெய்யப்பட்டார் என்ற விடயம் காணப்படுகின்றது.

### The Use Of Dr. Or ‘Acharya’ Title By Elected Representatives: What Is The problem?

*2024-12-14 18:43:14* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-use-of-dr-or-acharya-title-by-elected-representatives-what-is-the-problem/) · `en`

The debate about the use of Dr. title by the present Speaker in Sri Lanka’s parliament presumably without obtaining a PhD from a reputed university raises an important issue in the way such academic titles have been used in the political sphere in recent decades. It is well known that the higher education sector in the country was also politicised along with other government institutions where there should have been a high degree of autonomy. The issue is whether the matter relating to the speaker’s use of Dr. title in front of his name supposedly without obtaining a PhD is an isolated incident?  In other words, was this a common practice among political sphere?  Another issue is whether the use of these titles in English vs Sinhala vernacular had anything to do with the confusion? Before addressing these questions, let me explain the accepted way of using Dr. title or even Professor title by those who acquire them after years of research and study in universities.

### St. Anthony Stole Fire from Hell: A Festival at a Sardinian Village

Shyamala (my wife) and I arrived at Cagliari Airport in Sardinia with several friends from Rome to participate in a writers’ workshop in Galteli, a remote Sardinian village. It was mid-January, and It was a sunny and warm afternoon. The sky was blue, and sun rays penetrated the airport’s thick, tall glass panes, warming us. The distant craggy mountains displayed their naked limestone spikes, occasionally releasing a glint. The dusty horizon looked distant, blurring the contours between the dry, flat land and disappearing grey mountains. Large concrete structures dominated the immediate landscape of the airport. They were engulfed in a mess of tentacles of the ring road. Still, a disciplined traffic movement emerged from the chaos. The landscape of Sardinia, with its rugged mountains, flat lands, and distant horizons, was a sight to behold.

### Georgian former footballer Kavelashvili elected as President by lawmakers

Georgia’s ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as the country’s president in a controversial election process amid a constitutional crisis and after weeks of mass pro-EU protests.

An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country’s next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said.

The sitting president Salome Zurabishvili has declared the vote “illegitimate” and refused to step down.

The Black Sea nation has been in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in contested October parliamentary elections.

Its decision last month to delay European Union membership talks ignited a fresh wave of mass rallies.

The opposition has denounced Saturday’s election as “illegitimate” and said sitting President Salome Zurabishvili remains the country’s sole legitimate leader.

### Who Broke Syria?

*2024-12-14 17:26:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/who-broke-syria/) · `en`

By end of November, the situation in Syria was dire. Government forces were on the brink of exhaustion, stretched thin by an economic crisis that spiraled out of control. Soldiers earned a paltry $7 a month, with even high-ranking officers receiving only $40. This was in sharp contrast to militia fighters funded by external powers, who earned up to $2,000 monthly. This glaring disparity revealed not just economic fault lines but the extent of foreign intervention sustaining these militias. Meanwhile, protests erupted across Suwayda province, historically a stronghold of Assad support, highlighting widespread famine, collapsing services, and the devaluation of the Syrian pound. Discontent was palpable, threatening to upend the regime’s fragile grasp on power.

Writing obituaries becomes a poignant burden when those near and dear to us keep taking their turn while we wait for ours in life’s departure lounge. I have had my share of writing obituaries in the last two years, but this one gets preciously close because Sivandran, who passed away suddenly in Semarang, Indonesia, was my roommate throughout our Peradeniya years and later after graduation. We were best friends.

We were emailing on November 28 and his last email said that his health was a hassle; so, he was winding down in Indonesia and was heading home to Perth. Next day I received the sad news of his demise. “Death, be not proud,” John Donne’s Holy Sonnet came to mind, but more in anger than as assurance of what comes “one short sleep past.”

The Republicans, not satisfied with their recent electoral triumph, continue to vilify President Biden for the pardon of his son, Hunter. Wresting power from the Democrats has not satisfied their blood-lust; they now seek to disgrace Biden, dishonor him and destroy the legacy of one of the most decent and selfless presidents in history, with a first-term record second to none.

A legacy of achievements, the results of which have only now begun to show in what is today the strongest economy in the world. An economy created of bipartisan legislative miracles which will endure for decades to come. Which the contemptible Trump will claim he personally built, on the first day of his office, in January 2025. Just as he claimed he built the booming economy he inherited from President Obama in 2017, only to criminally mismanage it to recession by the end of his first term.
