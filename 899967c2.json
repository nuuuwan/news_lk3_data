    "\u201cIt is a duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary \u2026 The Judiciary shall decide matters before them, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any \u2026threats or interference.\u201d",
    "On 5th March 2023, the Commonwealth Bar Leaders unanimously passed the Goa Declaration on \u201cPreserving and Strengthening the Independence of the Judiciary and on ensuring The Independence of the Legal Profession\u201c that declares:",

    "The Associations urge the Government of Sri Lanka to respect the independence of the judiciary by abiding by the said Order of the Supreme Court. The Associations further urge the Speaker of the Parliament to do likewise and to withdraw the reference to the said Committee and requests Parliament to cease all proceedings before the said Committee."
