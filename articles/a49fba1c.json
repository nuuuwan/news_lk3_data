    "Israeli gunfire killed at least 25 people seeking aid in Gaza on Wednesday, health officials and witnesses said, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will \u201callow\u201d Palestinians to leave during an upcoming military offensive in some of the territory\u2019s most populated areas.",
    "Netanyahu wants to realize U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s vision of relocating much of Gaza\u2019s population of over 2 million people through what he refers to as \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d \u2014 and what critics have warned could be ethnic cleansing.",
    "\u201cGive them the opportunity to leave! First, from combat zones, and also from the Strip if they want,\u201d Netanyahu said in an interview aired Tuesday with Israeli TV station i24 to discuss the planned offensive in areas including Gaza City, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people shelter. \u201cWe are not pushing them out but allowing them to leave.\u201d",
    "Witnesses and staff at Nasser and Awda hospitals, which received the bodies, said people were shot dead on their way to aid distribution sites or while awaiting convoys entering Gaza. Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "Efforts to revive ceasefire talks have resumed after apparently breaking down last month. Hamas and Egyptian officials met Wednesday in Cairo, according to Hamas official Taher al-Nounou.",
    "Israel has no plans to send its negotiating team to talks in Cairo, the prime minister\u2019s office said.",
    "Israel\u2019s plans to widen its military offensive against Hamas to parts of Gaza it does not yet control have sparked condemnation at home and abroad, and could be intended to raise pressure on Hamas to reach a ceasefire.",
    "The militants still hold 50 hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war. Israel believes around 20 are alive. Families fear a new offensive endangers them.",
    "Netanyahu was asked by i24 News if the window had closed on a partial ceasefire deal and he responded that he wanted all hostages back, alive and dead.",
    "Egyptian Foreign Ministry Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce.",
    "Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The militant group has refused to disarm.",
    "Israel and South Sudan are in talks about relocating Palestinians to the war-torn East African nation, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.",
    "The office of Israel\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister, Sharren Haskel, said she was arriving in South Sudan for meetings in the first visit there by a senior government official, but she did not plan to broach the subject of moving Palestinians.",
    "South Sudan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs in a statement called reports that it was engaging in discussions with Israel about resettling Palestinians baseless.",
    "The AP previously reported that U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for Palestinians uprooted from Gaza.",
    "Among those killed while seeking aid were 14 Palestinians in the Teina area approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from a food distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to staff at Nasser hospital.",
    "Hashim Shamalah said Israeli troops fired toward them as people tried to get through. Many were shot and fell while fleeing, he said.",
    "Israeli gunfire killed five other Palestinians while trying to reach another GHF distribution site in the Netzarim corridor area, according to Awda hospital and witnesses.",
    "GHF said there were no incidents at or near its sites Wednesday.",
    "The U.S. and Israel support GHF, an American contractor, as an alternative to the United Nations, which they claim allows Hamas to siphon off aid. The U.N., which has delivered aid throughout Gaza for decades when conditions allow, denies the allegations.",
    "Aid convoys from other groups travel within 100 meters (328 feet) of GHF sites and draw crowds. An overwhelming majority of violent incidents over the past few weeks have been related to those convoys, the GHF said.",
    "Israeli fire killed at least six other people waiting for aid trucks close to the Morag corridor, which separates parts of southern Gaza, Nasser hospital said.",
    "An Israeli settler shot dead a Palestinian on Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
    "The Israeli military said dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks toward an off-duty soldier and another person carrying out \u201cengineering works\u201d near the village of Duma, lightly wounding them. It said the soldier initially fired warning shots, then opened fire in self-defense.",
    "The Health Ministry identified the deceased as Thamin Dawabshe, 35, a distant relative of a family targeted in a 2015 firebombing in the village by a settler. That attack killed a toddler and his parents. The attacker was convicted and handed three life sentences.",
    "The West Bank has seen a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks since the start of the war in Gaza, and the Israeli military has carried out major military operations there. Rights groups and Palestinians say the military often turns a blind eye to violent settlers or intervenes to protect them.",
    "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says 106 children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war and 129 adults have died since late June.",
    "The U.N. says it and humanitarian partners still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities who prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed.",
    "The 2023 Hamas-led attack abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive has since displaced most of Gaza\u2019s population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. The offensive has killed more than 61,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.",
    "The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own."
