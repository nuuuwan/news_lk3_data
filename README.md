### A business case for ESG in a stabilising economy

*2024-10-08 06:01:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-business-case-for-ESG-in-a-stabilising-economy/4-767680) · `en`

As Sri Lanka navigates its current state of economic recovery—while anticipating parliamentary elections and looming political change — the corporate sector has a significant opportunity to strengthen their businesses and further contribute towards a stabilising economy.

There is increasing recognition that sustainability can lead to long-term economic benefits. For years, many companies have grappled with integrating sustainable practices into their operations, driven by increasing consumer and investor demand for responsible corporate behaviour. Sustainable practices not only enhance brand reputation and customer loyalty but also create operational efficiencies that reduce costs and mitigate risks. In an unpredictable economic landscape, companies that prioritise sustainability are generally better equipped to adapt to regulatory changes, resource scarcity, and market volatility.

To restore or to maintain in the long run, Ceylon tea’s pre-eminence in terms of quality and reputation, a complete overhaul of Sri Lanka’s extension approach is crucial, driven by digitalisation, socioeconomic strategies, and scientific innovations to produce tea to its highest quality at the highest productivity (optimum yield). The current methods must evolve to meet the demands of modern tea production and global market standards.

A new framework is needed that integrates cutting-edge tools with advanced agronomic practices and considers the socioeconomic realities of smallholders, estate managers, and processors. By leveraging mobile platforms, precision agriculture, data analytics, and real-time feedback systems, tea producers can access essential knowledge and resources more efficiently, making informed decisions on replanting, mechanisation, and sustainable farming techniques.

If Sri Lankans rally behind Dissanayake and the NPP at the forthcoming general elections, then the IMF may need to listen – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

21 September was a day of many firsts in Sri Lanka. Millions of people went to the polls to vote in the first Presidential elections since mass protests forced the country’s last elected president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, from office in 2022. 1, 2

It also marked the first time in Sri Lanka’s history that a second round of counting had to take place after none of the candidates secured the 50% margin required for victory.

A count of the second-choice votes revealed the biggest shock in decades. In Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lankans for the first time elected a candidate who does not belong to the two major parties that have dominated the country’s politics since independence in 1948.3

Dissanayake leads the National People’s Power alliance (NPP), which includes his Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) – a party known for its leftwing policies.

Will she be voted back as the first non-dynastic woman PM of South Asia?

South Asia is no stranger to women holding top positions of political power. Sri Lanka led the way with Sirimavo Bandaranaike being the world’s first ever woman Prime Minister. She took on the mantle (party leader SLFP) vacated by her husband S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who was assassinated in 1959. She ran for elections in 1960 and won and later on again in 1970 she took on the role of PM. Her daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga too became PM from August to November 1994 and was later on President of Sri Lanka from 1994-2005.

### Corruption is not the cause

*2024-10-08 05:40:39* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Corruption-is-not-the-cause/4-767675) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s economic woes are overwhelmingly a result of stupidity, not corruption

Jail the corrupt and bring our money back! This is the cry of our times. It rings from the four corners of the island and echoes across the usual divisions of race, religion, language and class. For our woes were caused by corruption, and redemption will be found when the thieves are caught and their loot returns to the public purse.

Alas this solution is no salvation. Much that was stolen never left us. Instead it was recycled at home for patronage and campaigns. Even if a few billion dollars were siphoned away, prospects of retrieval are slim. The World Bank’s report on stolen assets is called “Few and Far Between” for a reason. It laments that between 2006 and 2012 all developed countries only returned $ 423 million in stolen assets.1 Nor will jailing the chief miscreants prevent the same mistakes from happening again.

### Indian financial aid opens ‘new chapter’ with Maldives

BBC: India has agreed to extend hundreds of millions of dollars in financial support to the Maldives to help strengthen its struggling economy.

The deal was announced after Maldives President Mohammed Muizzu held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his five-day visit to India.

The support includes a $ 400 million currency swap deal and an additional Rs. 30 billion ($ 357 million; £ 273 million) in another swap agreement which will allow companies to do business in local currencies rather than in US dollars.

The Maldivian President was given red carpet treatment after relations soured in recent months. Modi called his visit a ‘new chapter’ in ties.

“India will always be there for the progress and prosperity of the people of Maldives,” he said.

The statements – and the Indian financial package – signal a significant improvement in relations between Male and Delhi, which have been strained since Muizzu came to power in November 2023.

“I wasn’t 100 percent fit when I last performed in Australia, and that was in October 2023.

### Back on stage…

*2024-10-07 23:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/back-on-stage/) · `en`

The very first time music lovers here had the opportunity of experiencing the singing capabilities of Kay Jay was when she teamed up with her father, the late Ivan Jayaratne, and operated as a duo.

The father and daughter combination turned out to be quite popular, and, before long, Kay Jay found herself doing vocals for some of the leading bands, in the local scene, during that era, including Dream Team, 20th Century and Cardinal Outburst.

Later, Kay Jay operated as a solo artiste before deciding to seek new pastures abroad.

Kay Jay had to curtail her musical career, when she got to Germany, as she got involved in the beauty industry…having her own beauty salon in Germany and now in Switzerland, as well.

### The Role Of Buddhist Monks In Reforming Sri Lanka

*2024-10-07 21:13:08* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-role-of-buddhist-monks-in-reforming-sri-lanka/) · `en`

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, following tradition, undertook a round-trip meeting with leading monks, visiting temples and places of worship after his election. This was also a necessary move to counter rivals’ claims that the NPP would not prioritize Buddhism.

We are writing at a time when the yellow robe, which commands respect and reverence, seems to empower many monks to appear as custodians of the nation’s spiritual well-being. However, this role has come under increasing scrutiny. Over recent decades, some monks have diverged from their spiritual calling by becoming involved in politics, raising concerns about their role in society.

The veneration for the yellow robe has, in many instances, been exploited. The respect associated with the robe has sometimes been leveraged to assert authority beyond spiritual matters, with monks engaging in activities unrelated to either mundane development or spiritual progress.

Thousands of youths were incarcerated for years. Hundreds of youths fled Sri Lanka for safety. Hundreds of youths avoided arrest  and possible execution while in Sri Lanka by changing identities and relocating elsewhere.

### On what legal basis did President Dissanayake call out the armed forces to maintain ‘public order?

*2024-10-07 20:35:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84874) · `en`

Is the Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) Presidency which came into power on a ‘reformist’ election platform able to legally justify the invocation of Section 12 of the Public Security Ordinance (PSO) using ‘special powers’ to call out the armed forces for the maintenance of public order?

Speaking to me soon after, a colleague ruminated as to whether this was a routine act, the signing of a gazette placed before the President by a staffer, the issuing of which was not so much a deliberate notification but a misstep. That is however hard to believe. But the fact that, such a preposterous possibility is even talked about, indicates the deeply chaotic extent to which official processes have been reduced to.
