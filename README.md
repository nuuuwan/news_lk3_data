A defiant South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a second impeachment vote on Saturday over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, a move that shocked the country, split his party and imperilled his presidency half way through his term.

Yoon rescinded his Dec. 3 move to impose military rule barely six hours later, after the opposition-controlled parliament defied troops and police to vote against the decree. But it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down on the grounds that he had broken the law.

Opposition parties plan to hold an impeachment vote at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), with large demonstrations planned ahead of the vote.

Yoon‚Äôs conservative People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote a week earlier, preventing a quorum.

Since then, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon has urged party members to vote for impeachment this time, and at least seven PPP members have said they would vote to impeach.

These two places are obviously ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the human imagination, by human standards and outlook, the ecstasies promised and the tortures threatened are not only of human concept but are also distinctly period defined (are there personal computers in either place?). There cannot be two more dissimilar destinations in the after-life, heaven is a joyous place of endless pleasures and creature comforts, while hell is all agony, suffering and torture.

In this piece I read, the definition of heaven and hell was determined by racial differences, stereotyping the occupants in the two places.

### Rediscovering The Good In Religion This Holiday Season

Every day, headlines are filled with words like deposed, disgraced, defrocked, or displaced‚Äîoften tied to controversies involving religious authorities or the struggles of various religious groups. Even for someone like me, skeptical of religion in general, this overwhelming negativity seems suspiciously one-sided. How could something that so much of humanity believes in be reduced to nothing but conflict and failure?

Before seeking the good in religions, perhaps we must first confront where we‚Äôve gone wrong. It seems evident that many religions have been transformed into tribal factions vying for power and dominance, losing sight of their core purpose: self-improvement, introspection, salvation, and the pursuit of higher ideals. Instead of fostering unity or moral growth, religion has often become a weapon‚Äîused to rally against perceived enemies, threaten with damnation, and fortify an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality.
