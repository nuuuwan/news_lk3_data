    "The recently announced Parental Intelligence (PI), Sri Lanka\u2019s first culturally relevant AI parenting companion, was developed to support parents and caregivers in manoeuvring the daily challenges of family life.",
    "Compared to global AI platforms, PI was created locally for Sri Lankan parents and offers a safe, useful, and judgment-free environment where families can get advice on how to raise kids of all ages. Instantly accessible at www.chatpi.lk, PI creates a distinctly comforting parenting experience by fusing age-specific guidance, bilingual support (in both Sinhala and English), and a privacy-first design. Knowing that conversations are never saved gives parents the confidence to voice concerns.",
    "Bitrock, the team behind Parental Intelligence (PI), created this AI companion with empathy and innovation at its core. Sharing their vision, the team noted: \u201cParenting is beautiful, but it can also feel overwhelming and isolating. That\u2019s why we built PI, not just as a tool, but as a trusted companion for every parent, day or night. It\u2019s truly built for the parent in all of us.\u201d",
    "In a friendly, conversational style that feels more like advice from a trusted friend than software, PI provides sympathetic, practical solutions for everything from fussy feeding to sleep conflicts, from managing school schedules to helping teens deal with stress.",
    "PI was designed with the everyday reality of parents in mind. To make it genuinely approachable, it provides bilingual help in Sinhala and English along with culturally appropriate advice tailored for Sri Lankan families, schools, and routines. Chats are never saved according to a privacy-first strategy, which gives parents the comfort to discuss even the most delicate issues. Every stage of life is covered by its age-specific, useful advice, from newborns to teenagers, and its 24/7 accessibility guarantees that help is always available, whether it is 2 PM or 2 AM.",
    "Since PI is the first platform of its kind created especially for Sri Lanka, its launch therefore marks a significant milestone for the country. In addition to helping families, PI\u2019s culturally sensitive design demonstrates the dedication to fusing technological innovation with empathy and community values.",
