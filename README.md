### Italy makes it illegal to seek surrogacy abroad

*2024-10-17 12:42:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102755/italy-makes-it-illegal-to-seek-surrogacy-abroad) ┬╖ `en`

ItalyтАЩs parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime MinisterтАЩs Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners.

Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents.

The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by MeloniтАЩs Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year.

The legislation extends a surrogacy ban already in place in Italy since 2004 to those who go to countries such as the United States or Canada, where it is legal, imposing jail terms of up to two years and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.09 million).

Speaking during the event, former President Maithripala Sirisena reflected on the political state of the country, emphasizing the need for integrity at all levels of government.

He remarked: тАЬA country cannot progress simply because its ruler is good. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet must also be clean. There must be no room for corruption and fraud.

These were roles customised for Sajith and the SJB to play: SWRD 1956, Ranasinghe Premadasa 1988 or both. The SJB abjured these roles, abdicating them to their rival Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP. AKD kicked the goal in

The objective of lowering generation costs and, consequently, consumer tariffs will certainly not be achieved by the recent cabinet decision to reduce the Feed-In Tariff for Solar Rooftop PV, which, fortunately, has not been approved by the PUCSL

It is everyoneтАЩs hope that we may at last be moving towards a new dawn of prosperity and a future of sustainable growth in all aspects of economy and social well-being, with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake leading the way.

This hope is most prevalent in the Energy Sector, which has remained in the clutches of the fossil fuel lobby. While the transport fuels still remain nearly 100% dependent on imported fossil fuels, energy sources used for generation electricity generation have shown some progress in reducing dependence on such imports through the use of indigenous renewable energy sources.
