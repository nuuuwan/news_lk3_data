    "This petition was taken up before the three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Samayawardhena today (10).",
    "At the time, President\u2019s Counsel Faiszer Musthapha who appeared for the petitioner Diana Gamage, requested for a date to inform the court of the decision to be taken regarding this petition.",
    "Accordingly, the judge bench ordered that the relevant petition be called on May 28 and that the decision regarding the maintaining of this petition be announced on the relevant date.",
    "Leader of the\u00a0 Opposition Sajith Premadasa, General Secretary of the SJB Ranjith Madduma Bandara and several others have been named as respondents in this petition.",
    "The SJB had earlier decided to expel Diana Gamage from the party citing that she had failed to comply with the unanimous decision taken by the party to vote against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, by voting in favour. The SJB had also highlighted that this was a serious violation of party discipline, and that the Opposition Leader and the SJB\u2019s leader Sajith Premadasa decided to suspend her party membership for the reputation or well-being and prosperity of the party."
