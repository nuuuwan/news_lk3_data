### Congratulations and cautionary notes

*2024-09-23 04:35:03* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Congratulations-and-cautionary-notes/4-767003) · `en`

Here’s wishing Anura Kumara Dissanayake heartiest congratulations on behalf of all those bleeding hearts that yearned for systemic change

The ‘too close to call’ Presidential poll has been called and lo, the name of Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) heads all the rest. Case closed, with the pundits who predicted the necessity to appeal to the preferential voting silenced? Perhaps not, for there is cause for proceeding with caution:

In the first flush of a famous victory, AKD and his colleagues may be inclined to interpret their fearless leader’s electoral landslide as incontrovertible proof of his popularity, as much as a mandate to implement the National People’s Power (NPP) manifesto with aplomb and despatch.

But it is best for ‘business as unusual’ to sound a warning note in the bell-like ear of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) stalwart who is now unequivocally Sri Lanka’s tenth Executive President.
