    "Even though the overall electricity tariff reduction is 14.2 percent, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners\u2019 Association (ACBOA) said it is not a reason for them to reduce the prices of bakery items including bread.",
    "ACBOA president N.K. Jayawardena told the Daily Mirror that their request is to reduce the electricity tariff by at least 75 percent of the increased tariff.",
    "\"Even though the electricity tariff increased, we did not increase the price of bakery items. So we do not need to reduce the prices if the electricity tariff is reduced,\" he said.",
    "\"We are in the process of settling our bills. Currently, we too are getting a higher electricity bill,\" he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
