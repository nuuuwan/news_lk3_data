    "In the latter part of 1970, a group of us left for Moscow on scholarships\u2014young, eager, and filled with dreams. Five years later, in 1975, we returned home with flying colours. Today, more than half a century later, some of us remain active in our professions, many have retired, while a few have drifted away from contact\u2014and sadly, some are no longer with us.",
    "From the very first day we set foot in Moscow, our lives changed forever. That moment marked the beginning of a new chapter and a turning point in our personal journeys. The initial days were challenging\u2014adjusting to the harsh Russian winter, adapting to a new culture, and finding our footing in an unfamiliar land. Yet, the years we spent at the prestigious Peoples\u2019 Friendship University (then Lumumba University) with students from across the globe in the Soviet Union were nothing short of transformative.",
    "Life at the university was a mix of rigorous academics and vibrant experiences. Many sleepless nights had to be spent, burning midnight oil, during examinations. But we were balanced with opportunities to learn from illustrious professors, dedicated lecturers, and supportive staff. Beyond academics, we were introduced to winter sports, cultural activities, excursions, and visits to museums and historical landmarks. These moments not only enriched our education but also helped forge friendships that transcended borders.",
    "What struck us most was the warmth with which we were received. Unlike the culture of ragging in Sri Lanka at the time, our seniors and the university staff welcomed us with open arms. Their generosity and empathy eased our homesickness and gave us the confidence to face challenges ahead. The university\u2019s environment truly embodied its mission: fostering friendship and cooperation among nations.",
    "Alongside academic learning, we acquired invaluable life skills\u2014cooking, shopping, managing daily chores\u2014while sharing experiences with fellow international students. Looking back, those bonds remain some of our fondest memories, shaping not only our careers but also our worldview.",
    "On September 27. 2025, we gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our return from Moscow. The reunion was held at the ASLGSC Club (Association of Sri Lankan Graduates from Socialist Countries) in Battaramulla. Alumni from Sri Lanka and abroad came together in a joyful evening filled with reflection, laughter, and nostalgia. Though time had changed us in many ways, the old camaraderie returned instantly. We rejoiced, reminisced, and honoured our colleagues who had passed away, remembering them with heartfelt tributes on a sombre note.",
    "It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the immense generosity of the Soviet government and people. The scholarships, stipends, accommodation, and support we received were funded by Soviet taxpayers\u2014an enduring gesture of goodwill. As the saying goes, \u201cit is not ethical to bite the hand that fed us.\u201d For this, we remain deeply grateful.",
    "Today, our alumni stand proud. Among us are doctors, engineers, agriculturists, geologists, economists, and professionals in many other fields. We have contributed to our motherland and beyond, reaching the pinnacles of our careers, weathering turbulent times, and proving our resilience. The knowledge and experiences we gained in Moscow continue to serve as a foundation for our successes.",
    "The journey of 1970\u201375 remains etched in our memories. It was not just an academic pursuit, but a life-shaping adventure. As alumni, we are indebted to our professors, mentors, the university staff, and above all, the people and government of Russia for their generosity and vision.",
    "On behalf of the 1970\u201375 batch, I extend heartfelt thanks to all who attended the reunion and to those who worked tirelessly to make it a success. With gratitude, respect, and affection, we salute our alma mater and bow in homage to the heroic people of Russia.",
