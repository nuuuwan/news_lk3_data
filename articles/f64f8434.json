  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved signing agreement with the Indian Railways for the grant of 22 engines and the grant by its Government.",
    "The Indian Railways have agreed to provide 22 improved engines, including slightly used M10 locomotive models to the Sri Lanka Railway Department as part of a bilateral support initiative. The package also includes two additional engines and spare parts required for their maintenance, offered as a grant to enhance the country\u2019s railway operations.",
    "In addition to the grant, RITES, an Indian engineering consultancy and infrastructure development firm has submitted an unsolicited proposal to provide locomotive maintenance service for a period of five years.",
    "The proposal to this effect was reviewed following Cabinet approval on 11 June 2024, which appointed a negotiation consensus committee and a project committee to evaluate the offer.",
    "\u201cAfter an in-depth appraisal, the project committee highlighted that the Sri Lanka Railways Department already possesses the necessary expertise to maintain the M10 engines. It was recommended that maintenance should be handled by the Department\u2019s existing staff, ensuring cost-effectiveness and local capacity building,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday."
