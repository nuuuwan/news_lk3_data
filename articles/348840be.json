    "United Nations Global Compact Network Sri Lanka in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka hosted a progressive preliminary workshop, on the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) recently with the exclusive attendance of 48 participating companies from Network Sri Lanka.",
    "Senior representatives from UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka\u2019s participant companies, specializing in corporate sustainability and environmental engineering, attended the workshop. Dr. Buddika Hapuarachchi, Team Lead of the Climate and Environment Team at UNDP Sri Lanka, opened the session.",
    "The private sector in Sri Lanka actively supports the country\u2019s 2030 Agenda by helping achieve updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Despite being a low carbon emitter, Sri Lanka will benefit from its decarbonisation efforts, particularly by reducing its dependence on imported fossil fuels. This shift strengthens energy security and sustainability while making local industries more resilient. SBTi offers a scientifically grounded pathway for decarbonisation.",
    "The timing of the SBTi workshop aligns with the approaching UNFCCC Conference of Parties 29 (COP 29). As the EU has adopted two new sustainability directives requiring companies to strengthen their climate action, setting validated science-based targets will support companies to comply with these policies.",
    "The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the first directive, requires companies to disclose how they set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets and other climate-related targets to address significant climate impacts, risks, and opportunities. Companies can include targets for renewable energy deployment, energy efficiency, climate adaptation, and risk mitigation.",
    "Companies must develop these targets using either a sector-specific (sectoral decarbonisation) or cross-sector (contraction) methodology that aligns with emissions reduction pathways limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. SBTi actively supports companies by providing sector-specific and cross-sector methodologies that comply with 1.5\u00b0C pathways.",
