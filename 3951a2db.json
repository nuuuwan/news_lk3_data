  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court ordered today that a request will be forwarded to the President of the Court of Appeal to take action against State Minister Diana Gamage, over contempt of court.",
    "The order was issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis today, upon consideration of the facts presented by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the lawyers of social activist Oshala Herath, the petitioner in the relevant case.",
    "Herath filed a petition seeking a writ order disqualifying the state minister from holding a parliamentary seat alleging that issuing a diplomatic passport to the State Minister is against the Immigration and Emigration Act since she also holds British citizenship.",
    "On 24 April, the court set aside the petition seeking Gamage\u2019s arrest.",
    "Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis\u00a0 declared that the court will not issue an order related to the arrest of the State Minister on the offences under the Immigration and Immigration Act, citing that the decision was arrived at since the CID is empowered by law to take the necessary steps regarding the arrest of the State Minister over the relevant offences.",
    "Presenting facts in this regard before the court today, the CID claimed that during an interview with TV Derana\u2019s\u00a0 360\u00b0 programme on 29 May, the State Minister had alleged that she had received the decision of the court in advance.",
    "Speaking in court, Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis noted that upon the examination of the facts presented by the relevant parties, it appears that the factors required to build a case of contempt of court are present within the said matter.",
    "Thus, the Magistrate noted that he will request the President of the Court of Appeal to initiate legal action against the State Minister under charges of contempt court.",
    "Magistrate Alwis also ordered the footage of the relevant interview to be submitted to the court, with other related documents."
