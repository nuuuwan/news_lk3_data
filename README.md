### It is wrong to think that the presidential election victory can be won in other elections - Eran Wickremaratne

*2024-10-12 02:12:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/196076) · `ta`

Eran Wickremaratne: Presidential election victory doesn't guarantee future election wins. Party control of Parliament determines governance. Candidates must be chosen democratically, not imposed. Cooperation with proper government decisions is crucial.

🟩

It is wrong to think that if he wins the presidential election, you can win every election in the next election. Former parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne said that this is not to choose the leadership faculty of whom to send parliament after the election results were released.

He further stated at a press conference held at the United People's Power Office in Colombo on Friday (11).

Most of the people are in the position that if they win the presidential election, the general election and the provincial council election can be won. This is a completely wrong position. The party that seizes the most seats in Parliament will rule. The majority of the parliament should be implemented to implement the budget.

We hope that such a government can be formed by the United People's Alliance. In democratic countries, the president is elected from a party and a prime minister's party. This is often taken in the United States. Some parties tell the party to vote. Not talking about optional.

Dr. S. Karunakaran, Director and Senior Consultant at Advanced Spine Specialty Centre MGM Healthcare Private Limited, Chennai, sheds light on cutting-edge advancements in spine surgery, emphasizing a monumental shift in surgical tools.

Speaking to The Island Financial Review, Dr. Karunakaran explained how traditional methods are being replaced by innovative technology to increase precision and safety in spinal operations, especially for conditions like scoliosis.
