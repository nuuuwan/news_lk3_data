  "original_body_lines": [
    "For decades, Sri Lanka has struggled to balance governance between the centre and the regions. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution, introduced in 1987, created provincial councils with a clear mandate to decentralise power. Yet, more than three decades on, its full potential remains largely unrealised. Provincial elections have been repeatedly delayed, and critical powers\u2014particularly land and policing\u2014have been contested or retained at the centre.",
    "Today, with the nation navigating economic recovery and a public hungry for meaningful reform, the question arises: if Sri Lanka were to hold provincial elections regularly and implement the 13th Amendment across all nine provinces as originally intended, would it make a difference to governance, stability, and growth? The answer is a resounding yes.",
    "Under the 13th Amendment, provinces hold significant responsibilities for education, health, and infrastructure. When decisions are made closer to communities, problems can be addressed faster and with better local knowledge. Countries that have embraced meaningful devolution consistently show better outcomes in school performance, healthcare access, and local infrastructure delivery.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s regional disparities are well documented. Growth has historically clustered around Colombo, leaving many rural and provincial communities behind. Empowering provinces to plan and execute their own strategies\u2014be it in agriculture, fisheries, renewable energy, or tourism\u2014offers a chance to close these gaps and deliver growth where it is most needed.",
    "Businesses seeking to invest in the provinces often face long delays in permits, land approvals, and utility connections. With functioning provincial councils, investors can engage with elected leadership that has both the mandate and responsibility to act. A streamlined, province-based approval process would stimulate small and medium enterprises, attract investors, and strengthen regional economies.",
    "Sri Lanka has built an impressive primary healthcare system, contributing to low maternal and infant mortality. Extending that same accountability to provincial health and education sectors\u2014through properly resourced and empowered councils\u2014would lock in these gains and scale them nationwide.",
    "Regular provincial elections restore confidence in democracy. For years, citizens have been denied the chance to elect provincial representatives, eroding trust in government. Holding elections on schedule and implementing 13A fully would demonstrate a genuine commitment to inclusive governance. Trust, in turn, underpins social stability, tax compliance, and investor sentiment.",
    "\u2022 Restore regular elections. Provincial councils must be elected and renewed on schedule under the Provincial Councils Elections Act of 1988. Democracy begins with the ballot.",
    "\u2022 Clarify contentious powers. Land and policing powers should be operationalised within the framework of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedents, with clear centre\u2013province protocols.",
    "\u2022 Align finances with responsibilities. Provincial councils cannot function effectively without predictable transfers, modest revenue authority, and performance-based grants tied to results.",
    "\u2022 Strengthen institutions. Provincial administrations must be professionalised, audited regularly, and made accountable to citizens through digital platforms, Right-to-Information compliance, and transparent procurement.",
    "Each province can deliver early, visible results within two years:",
    "\u2022 Establish one-stop service centres for permits and small business registration.",
    "\u2022 Develop sectoral strengths: renewable energy in the North and East; tea, fruits, and agri-tourism in Uva and Central; light industry and logistics in Western and Southern provinces.",
    "\u2022 Expand public\u2013private partnerships in waste management, transport hubs, and local utilities.",
    "These are not abstract ideas; they are achievable, low-cost measures that signal seriousness and build momentum.",
    "The effectiveness of devolved governance should be judged by clear, transparent indicators:",
    "\u2022 Service delivery: education quality, health coverage, and public service response times.",
    "\u2022 Economic activity: SME registrations, agricultural yields, tourism arrivals, and exports.",
    "\u2022 Inclusion and accountability: provincial budgets published on time, citizen grievances resolved quickly, and audited accounts accessible to the public.",
    "The 13th Amendment is not new\u2014it has been part of Sri Lanka\u2019s constitutional framework since 1987. What is new is the urgency of restoring democratic legitimacy and economic stability. By implementing 13A consistently across all nine provinces, holding timely elections, and empowering local institutions with resources and accountability, Sri Lanka can take a decisive step towards shared prosperity.",
    "Devolution is not about weakening the centre; it is about strengthening the nation as a whole. A Sri Lanka where every province has a voice, where services are efficient, and where development is broad-based, is a Sri Lanka positioned for durable growth and long-term stability.",
    "The opportunity is within reach. What remains is the political will to grasp it."
