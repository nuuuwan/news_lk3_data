    "COLOMBO (News 1st); U.S.-based cycling component manufacturer SRAM has initiated legal proceedings against the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), challenging the governing body\u2019s proposed gear restrictions set to be trialed at the upcoming Tour of Guangxi.",
    "SRAM filed a formal complaint with the Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) on September 12, arguing that the UCI\u2019s \u201cMaximum Gearing\u201d protocol unfairly targets SRAM-equipped riders and has already caused tangible harm to its business.",
    "The BCA has since launched anti-trust proceedings under EU and Belgian competition law.",
    "The protocol, introduced by the UCI\u2019s SafeR commission, aims to improve rider safety by capping gear ratios to a rollout limit of 10.46 meters\u2014equivalent to a 54x11 setup.",
    "However, SRAM riders typically use 54x10 gearing, which would be rendered non-compliant under the new rules.",
    "Unlike competitors Shimano and Campagnolo, SRAM would be forced to mechanically disable its 10-tooth cog, reducing gear options and placing its sponsored teams at a competitive disadvantage.",
    "SRAM currently supplies equipment to four major men\u2019s WorldTour teams: Visma-Lease a Bike, Movistar, Lidl-Trek, and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.",
    "In a strongly worded statement, SRAM CEO Ken Lousberg criticized the UCI\u2019s decision-making process, saying the protocol penalizes innovation and undermines fair competition. He also expressed concern over the lack of transparency and scientific basis behind the rule, adding that the company had attempted to engage in dialogue with the UCI but was met with silence.",
    "The company claims the rule has already caused reputational damage, market confusion, and anxiety among teams and athletes.",
    "Lousberg emphasized that while SRAM supports safety-driven reforms, arbitrary restrictions on gearing\u2014especially those affecting only one manufacturer\u2014are fundamentally unfair.",
    "The UCI responded by expressing surprise at the BCA\u2019s press release, stating it had not yet been served with the complaint. It defended the gear restriction trial as a safety initiative and maintained that any future regulatory changes would be based on the outcome of the test and further stakeholder consultation."
