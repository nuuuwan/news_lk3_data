### Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba decides to step down

*2025-09-07 13:14:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112251/japan-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba-decides-to-step-down) · `en`

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to resign to avoid a split within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the broadcaster NHK is reporting.

The announcement on Sunday comes weeks after Ishiba denied reports he planned to step down over a historic defeat his LDP-led coalition suffered in a July election, saying he wanted to make sure the tariff deal struck with the United States was appropriately implemented.

Since assuming his role last October, Ishiba has seen electoral losses wipe out his party’s majority in both houses of parliament, with a bruising electoral defeat in October leaving it with a minority in the more powerful lower house.

The defeats have made it more difficult for Ishiba’s coalition to implement its policy objectives.

Amid the country’s growing political instability, the prime minister has faced calls to resign from mostly right-wing opponents within his party, who urged him to take responsibility for the results of July’s vote.

A customs officials told a hearing of the Committee on Public Finance that online retailers had now adapted to the system, and they were no longer sending shipments daily to reduce shipping costs.

“Even though you say that, Sri Lanka is a good consolidation centre,” Opposition legislator Ravi Karunayake, who has knowledge of logistics told the committee.

இந்தியா - அமெரிக்கா இடையே வர்த்தகரீதியாக மோதல் போக்கு நிலவி வரும் நிலையில், பிரதமர் நரேந்திர மோடியை டொனால்டு டிரம்ப் திடீரென 'நண்பன்' என அழைத்து அனைவரையும் ஆச்சரியத்தில் ஆழ்த்தியுள்ளார்.

உலக அளவில் நெருங்கிய கூட்டாளிகளாக இருந்து வந்த அமெரிக்காவும், இந்தியாவும் கடந்த சில மாதங்களாக எதிரெதிர் துருவங்களாக மாறின. தனது எச்சரிக்கையையும் மீறி, ரஷ்யாவிடம் இருந்து கச்சா எண்ணெய்யை இந்தியா வாங்குவதை அமெரிக்காவால் ஏற்றுக் கொள்ள முடியவில்லை. மேலும், ரஷ்யாவுடன் இந்தியா நெருங்கி செல்வதையும் அந்நாடு விரும்பவில்லை.

இதனால் இந்தியா மீது தொடர்ந்து அதிருப்தியில் இருந்து வந்த அமெரிக்க ஜனாதிபதி டொனால்டு டிரம்ப், அண்மையில் இந்தியாவின் ஏற்றுமதி பொருட்கள் மீது 50 சதவீத வரியை விதித்து மிகப் பெரிய அதிர்ச்சியை கொடுத்தார். இந்த அதிகபட்ச வரி விதிப்பால் இந்தியாவின் தொழில்துறை ஆட்டம் காண தொடங்கியது.

### Popular Sydney beach deploys drones, helicopter after fatal shark attack

Australian authorities on Sunday (Sep 7) deployed drones and a helicopter to monitor the waters around a popular Sydney beach after a surfer was killed by a great white shark on Saturday, officials said.

Two beaches in Australia’s most populous city remained closed on Sunday after the attack on Saturday morning that took place about 100m from shore while the man was surfing with friends at Long Reef Beach, in the north of the New South Wales state capital.

The experienced surfer was pulled from the water by other surfers, but had lost too much blood and died at the scene, police said. It was the first shark-attack death in Sydney since a swimmer was killed off a beach in February 2022, which was the city’s first since 1963.

On Sunday, the state’s main water rescue organisation, Surf Life Saving NSW, deployed drones and a helicopter to surveil the area for the shark, New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) said.

இதற்கு பதிலளிக்கும் விதமாக நடிகை அம்பிகா தனது சமூக வலைத்தளப் பக்கத்தில், "அனுமதியின்றி உடலுறவு கொள்ள முயலும் பாலியல் குற்றங்கள், அது உடல் ரீதியாக இருந்தாலும் சரி, மன ரீதியாக இருந்தாலும் சரி, குற்றவாளிகள் எந்த வயசாக இருந்தாலும் உடனடியாக தண்டிக்கப்பட வேண்டும்.

சிறாராக இருந்தாலும் சரி, 100 வயது உடையவராக இருந்தாலும் சரி, குற்றம் குற்றமே," என்று கருத்து தெரிவித்திருந்தார்.

தமிழ், தெலுங்கு, கன்னடம், மலையாளம் உள்ளிட்ட தென்னிந்திய மொழிகளில் 200-க்கும் மேற்பட்ட படங்களில் நடித்து, தற்போது குணசித்திர வேடங்களில் கவனம் செலுத்தி வரும் அம்பிகாவின் இந்தக் கருத்து, பாலியல் குற்றங்களுக்கு எதிரான கடுமையான நிலைப்பாட்டை வெளிப்படுத்தியுள்ளது.

### இன்றுசந்திர கிரகணம் :  நிகழவுள்ள அதிசயத்தை பாருங்கள்

2022ஆம் ஆண்டுக்குப் பிறகு நிகழும் மிக நீண்ட முழுச் சந்திர கிரகணம் (Lunar Eclipse 2025) இன்றிரவு நிகழ்கிறது.

இந்தப் பிரபஞ்சம் பல வானியல் அதிசயங்களைக் கொண்டதாகும். இங்கு நிகழும் பல விஷயங்கள் நம்மை வியப்பின் உச்சத்திற்கே போய்விடும். இப்படிக் கூட நடக்குமா என நாம் யோசிக்கும் பல வினோத நிகழ்வுகள் கூட நடக்கும்.

அப்படித் தான் இன்றைய தினம் மிக நீண்ட முழுச் சந்திர கிரகணம் நிகழ்கிறது. கடந்த 2022க்கு பிறகு மிக நீண்ட ஒரு சந்திர கிரகணமாக இது இருக்கும்.

இதுபோல அடுத்த முழு சந்திர கிரகணத்தைப் பார்க்க, நாம் 2028 டிசம்பர் 31 வரை காத்திருக்க வேண்டும் என்கிறார் புனேவில் உள்ள தேசிய வானொலி வானியற்பியல் மையத்தின் (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics) இணைப் பேராசிரியருமான திவ்யா ஓபரோய்.

கிரகணங்கள் அரிதானவை என்றும், ஒவ்வொரு பௌர்ணமி அல்லது அமாவாசையிலும் நிகழாது என்றும் ஓபரோய் விளக்கினார். சந்திரன் பூமியைச் சுற்றிவரும் பாதை, சூரியனைப் பூமி சுற்றி வரும் பாதையிலிருந்து சுமார் 5 டிகிரி சாய்ந்துள்ளது என்பதே இதற்குக் காரணமாகும்.

### 88 postal operators suspend services to US over tariffs: UN

Postal traffic to the United States plunged more than 80 per cent following Washington’s imposition of new tariffs, with 88 operators worldwide fully or partially suspending services, the Universal Postal Union said on Saturday (Sep 6).

The UPU, the United Nations’ postal cooperation agency, is working on “the rapid development of a new technical solution that will help get mail moving to the United States again”, its director general Masahiko Metoki said in a statement.

US President Donald Trump’s administration announced in late July that it was abolishing a tax exemption on small packages entering the United States from Aug 29.

The move sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in Australia, Britain, France, Germany, India, Italy and Japan, that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.

The UPU said data exchanged between postal operators via its systems showed that traffic to the United States was down 81 per cent on Aug 29, compared to a week earlier.

### Rare total lunar eclipse ‘blood moon’ to be visible from Sri Lanka tonight

*2025-09-07 06:11:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112237/rare-total-lunar-eclipse-blood-moon-to-be-visible-from-sri-lanka-tonight) · `en`

Sri Lankans will have a rare opportunity to witness the phenomenon known as “blood moon” later today (07), said Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, the Head of the Department of Physics and Director, Astronomy and Space Science Unit of the University of Colombo and the Chairman of the Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies.

The spectacular celestial event is set to light up the skies tonight, as the Moon undergoes a total lunar eclipse, turning an eerie, deep red for 82 minutes.

Known as a Blood Moon, this will be the last total lunar eclipse of the year and is expected to be visible to nearly 85% of the global population. Unlike many eclipses confined to specific regions, this phenomenon will be observable across much of Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa, with Sri Lanka offering some of the clearest views.

### UK police arrest about 425 at protest for banned Palestine Action

*2025-09-07 05:45:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112236/uk-police-arrest-about-425-at-protest-for-banned-palestine-action) · `en`

British police arrested around 425 people on Saturday (Sep 6) at a demonstration backing Palestine Action, the pro-Palestinian group banned by the government as a terrorist organisation.

Britain outlawed Palestine Action in July after some of its members broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged military planes. The group has also targeted defence firms with links to Israel, accusing the government of complicity in alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near parliament in London to oppose the ban, holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”

Police said those detained were arrested for offences including assaulting officers and supporting a proscribed organisation. “Officers ... have been subjected to an exceptional level of abuse including punches, kicks, spitting and objects being thrown, in addition to verbal abuse,” London’s Metropolitan Police wrote on X.

### A Passage North

*2025-09-07 01:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-passage-north/) · `en`

Soon after I read Brotherless Night, I found another book about the conflict, which was also a sort of pendent to the Booker Prize winning Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, and had indeed been shortlisted for the book the year before Shehan Karunatilleka won it.

Unlike those two, which were a retelling of history, this was an introspective novel that explores something of the suffering caused by the war – though it did have set pieces within that were in fact retellings of actual episodes during the war.

### The guardians of the world

*2025-09-07 00:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-guardians-of-the-world/) · `en`

By cultivating within ourselves the qualities of moral shame and fear of wrongdoing we not only accelerate our own progress along the path to deliverance, but also contribute our share towards the protection of the world. Given the intricate interconnections that hold between all living forms, to make the sense of shame and fear of wrong the guardians of our own minds is to make ourselves guardians of the world. As the roots of morality, these two qualities sustain the entire efficacy of the Buddha’s liberating path; as the safeguards of personal decency, they at the same time preserve the dignity of the human race.
