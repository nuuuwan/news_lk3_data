    "Claiming that financial issues and a court decision have been obstacles to resolving medicinal drug shortage, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said today he would no longer function as the Health Minister if he fails to address the drug shortage in the country.",
    "The Minister told Parliament that he was meeting officials of the Finance Ministry today to discuss the issues over the procurement of the medicinal drugs.",
    "\u201cThe Court decisions have been obstacles to resolving the drug shortage. The second reason is the financial issue. I am meeting the Acting Finance Minister and Ministry officials this evening to discuss the matter. I have taken a decision not to remain in the position anymore if I am unable to find ways to address the drug shortage as it is an injustice to society and this service. Whatever reasons that I cite, I have to take the responsibility for the shortcoming,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister said this in response to a question by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa on the drug shortage.\u00a0(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
