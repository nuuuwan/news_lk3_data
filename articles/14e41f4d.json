    "Says there is no one left to strike over public sector employee salaries as all are contesting under NPP ticket",
    "Commends NPP voters for carrying out national duty by revealing party\u2019s weaknesses to country",
    "Claims past protests had cost country its potential as hub for global fuel trade",
    "Former Minister Manusha Nanayakkara has criticised the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party for fielding candidates who had previously gone on strike and halted national progress. Nanayakkara noted that those who once obstructed the development of Sri Lanka are now vying for power under the NPP banner, questioning their role in the nation\u2019s current challenges.",
    "\u201cThose who disrupted the country by opposing infrastructure projects and development initiatives are now contesting from the NPP. There\u2019s no one left to strike over public sector employee salary increases now,\u201d Nanayakkara said.",
    "He further commended the public, particularly the recent 39% of voters who supported the NPP in the presidential election, saying they had done a \u201cnational duty\u201d by revealing the NPP\u2019s weaknesses.",
    "Nanayakkara highlighted missed opportunities in Sri Lanka, emphasising how past protests had cost the country its potential as a hub for global fuel trade. \u201cSri Lanka could have become a centre of world fuel trade with the Trincomalee oil tanks,\u201d he stated. \u201cInstead, Singapore took that role, all because of opposition and protests here.\u201d He also pointed to previous strikes that delayed the development of essential projects, such as power plants and the Colombo Port, which eventually fell behind regional competitors.",
    "The former minister accused NPP leaders of spreading falsehoods, including claims about corruption and money hidden overseas, which, he alleged, misled the public. \u201cThe NPP talked about stolen money hidden in Uganda and claimed Rs. 160 from every litre of fuel went to ministers\u2019 pockets. Where\u2019s the evidence?\u201d he asked, suggesting these stories were fabricated to sow division and mistrust among the people.",
    "Reflecting on his own decision to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Nanayakkara said that he and MP Harin Fernando chose to stand by Wickremesinghe despite facing political risk. \u201cWe had the courage to stand with Ranil when he was alone in Parliament. Today, because of that decision, 22 million people are living comfortably,\u201d he claimed, mentioning that basic utilities and services like electricity and fuel are now accessible to citizens across the country.",
    "Addressing Sri Lanka\u2019s economic future, Nanayakkara discussed delays in the IMF program, attributing them to promises of tax cuts and salary increases made by the Government, which are now being reconsidered. \u201cThe IMF is watching, evaluating how these promises can be delivered without damaging our economy. This delay means we\u2019re looking at another six months before the next instalment,\u201d he explained, calling for patience and commitment to sustainable policies.",
    "Nanayakkara highlighted concerns over rising costs, especially regarding LP gas, which he predicted would increase after the election. \u201cLitro Gas profits were used to keep prices stable, but this won\u2019t last forever,\u201d he cautioned, noting that private companies may raise prices post-election.",
    "In his concluding remarks, Nanayakkara urged voters to recognise the importance of stability, emphasising that the decisions made by the former administration were guided by the goal of national progress rather than short-term popularity. He encouraged Sri Lankans to stay vigilant and make informed choices, especially as the election approaches."
