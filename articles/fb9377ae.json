    "The breakdown of human relationships and the increased isolation of individuals in modern society are significant contributors to rising suicide rates, says Prof. Mohamed Mahees of the Department of Sociology at the University of Colombo.",
    "Speaking during Ada Derana\u2019s current affairs programme \u201cBig Focus\u201d on Wednesday (09), he highlighted the growing detachment of people from one another as a pressing concern.",
    "Prof. Mahees pointed out that modern humans often prioritize their interactions with technology over meaningful relationships with others, which he believes is a root cause of this growing disconnection.",
    "\u201cWe see that most suicides are reported in developed countries, but Sri Lanka is not one of those. Despite this, the breakdown of human relationships and the isolation of people in society are major factors here as well,\u201d he explained.",
    "Furthermore, he emphasized the need for individuals to reconnect with themselves and others to rebuild stronger relationships stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t fully understand ourselves or others. To address this, we need to revisit our values and embrace a deeper passion for life\u2026The main reason for this is the collapse of human desires, ambitions and unfulfillment of hopes; living with great desires beyond necessity.\u201d",
    "Quoting poet Rudyard Kipling, he added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you lose everything you have; don\u2019t lose your passion for life. If you have that, you can regain everything.\u201d",
    "Prof. Mahees also commented on the role of economic hardships in worsening societal isolation. \u201cWith the recent economic challenges in the country, we see people unable to adapt, choosing to leave instead. This indicates deficiencies in our sense of humanity. However, we have solutions all around us \u2014 through nature, art, religion, and our environment.\u201d",
    "Highlighting the dangers of advanced technology, Prof. Mahees said that mobile phone use is more dangerous than a \u2018T-56\u2019 firearm, as it fosters a new form of isolation.",
    "\u201cPeople are now alone among people. In the past, we maintained connections with our families, village elders, and nature. Today, we see the individual increasingly isolated, immersed in their phones rather than interacting with those around them,\u201d he said.",
    "Prof. Mahees called for society to re-evaluate its values and priorities to address this alarming trend and prevent further isolation and disconnection in communities.",
    "If you or someone you know is in crisis and needs help, resources are available for immediate support:"
