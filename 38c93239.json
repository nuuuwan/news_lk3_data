  "original_body_lines": [
    "Pakistan's Saud Shakeel scored a marathon double century and made Sri Lanka's bowlers toil on the third day of the first Test in Galle.",
    "The precarious situation the visitors were in, and the position of advantage Sri Lanka had enjoyed on the second day -- when Pakistan were 101 for 5 -- seemed a distant memory today, as Shakeel, Agha Salman and later Naseem Shah defied the home team's bowlers.",
    "Shakeel benefited from some ordinary bowling from the hosts, with Prabath Jayasuriya and Ramesh Mendis persisting for long spells without much luck, and dropped catches on the way to his first Test double century.",
    "Shakeel and Salman extended their overnight partnership to 176 before Ramesh Mendis finally made the breakthrough when the latter charged him down the track and missed, for Samarawickrama to effect a stumping."
