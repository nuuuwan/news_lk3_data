    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka plans to introduce new legislation aimed at modernising the postal department through a public-private partnership though the service itself will not be privatised, State Minister of Mass Media Shantha Bandara said.",
    "Speaking to reporters, Bandara said the new Postal Act will replace Sri Lanka\u2019s postal ordinance that dates back to the British colonial period, which the State Minister said was a hindrance to reform.",
    "\u201cI will bring in a new act that we have been working on. Eighty percent of the work is complete. It is expected to be presented to parliament,\u201d he said.",
    "The state minister said that in 2022 the postal service\u2019s revenue was 7,000 million rupees while expenditure was 14,000 million. In order to reform the postal service into a modern and profitable venture, he said that a joint public-private ownership of the postal department will be implemented.",
    "\u201cThis venture will cost 10 billion rupees,\u201d Bandara said. \u201cWe will obtain 10 billion from the private sector and one billion from the state. However, we are not planning to privatise the postal service.",
    "\u201cThere is a level of trust that is invested in the postal system. Therefore, we should be able to digitalise and be able to deliver certificates such as exam certificates as well as those of birth, deaths, marriages and lands that were ordered online. Our goal is to create a postal service by 2025 that no longer depends on the state treasury,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul29/2023)"
