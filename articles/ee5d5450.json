    "The Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and the Colombo Port received two fully equipped ambulances as part of the ongoing Border Health Project, funded by the Government of Japan and implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).",
    "On behalf of the Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Ministry, the donation was handed to Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL) Chairman Air Chief Marshal H.D. Abeywickrema (Retd.) by Japanese Embassy Minister/Deputy Head of Mission Kamoshida Naoki in the presence of senior officials of the Ministry, AASL, and IOM.",
    "The ambulances, each valued at approximately $ 100,000, will enhance the emergency health preparedness of the Points of Entry (PoE) in line with International Health Regulations (2005).",
    "Equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, including cardiac monitors, oxygen supply systems, and advanced life support apparatus, each ambulance is tailored to meet the demands of the respective environments they operate in.",
    "In addition to the ambulances, the event marked the donation of a turnkey digital signage system and two battery-operated airport trolley pushers \u2013 the latter being a novel introduction at the BIA. The digital signage system, a turnkey solution comprised of 20 centrally controlled standing screens deployed across various terminals, is positioned to transform traveller experience at the airport. The system will be utilised to display targeted messages, emergency alerts, and announcements, including public health advisories and flight information.",
    "Speaking at the donation event, Minister/Deputy Head of Mission Kamoshida highlighted the importance of PoE being better prepared for possible public health emergencies so that Sri Lanka could attract more visitors in a safe environment and welcomed the arrival of the ambulances and other equipment.",
    "Accepting the donation on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, Air Chief Marshal Abeywickrema (Retd.) stated: \u201cI extend my profound gratitude to the Government of Japan, the Japanese Embassy, IOM, and the project team for their invaluable assistance and commitment to enhancing the BIA\u2019s health resilience as part of the ongoing Border Health Project. This generous donation will significantly benefit our passengers and the broader aviation community, strengthening our emergency health preparedness as the nation\u2019s primary gateway.\u201d",
    "This project is implemented by IOM with the support and guidance of the Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation Ministry and the Health Ministry and marks a renewed commitment of the Government of Japan towards improving health-resilient, pro-mobility border operations at Sri Lankan PoE."
