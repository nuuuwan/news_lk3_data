    "The National Shoora Council (NSC) yesterday urged UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to facilitate the grant of full membership in the UN to Palestine and to suspend Israel from the UN until Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is surrendered to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in pursuance of the international",
    "warrant issued by the ICC for the arrest of Israel\u2019s PM. The following is the text of the letter dated 14 September 2025 addressed to the SG of the UN.",
    "\u201cWe believe that by now, you are well aware of the despicable chain of unpardonable crimes being committed, for well over a hundred years, by the Zionist regime to destroy Palestine and its multi-religious people! What must have become more clear is that the ongoing cruel facets of genocide of the Palestinians are aimed at establishing a territorially expanding nuclear armed Zionist ethno-religious European colonial power in the Middle East.",
    "We are deeply concerned that Tuesday\u2019s Israeli attack in Qatar targeting the Hamas peace negotiators and the subsequently widening Israeli attacks on seven other Arab countries, without any provocation, in violation of international law are highly distressing and will adversely affect third world countries, including Sri Lanka for its oil supplies and prices.",
    "Global oil price escalation due to Israeli aggression and destabilisation of the Middle East will adversely affect Sri Lanka.",
    "We have noted that you seem to be as helpless as the Palestinians to arrest the systemic destruction by Israel of not only Palestine but also destabilising the Middle East as a whole. We are not surprised that the US military base in Qatar, established under a Qatari defence pact with the US, went dead silent over the incoming Israeli attack in Qatar!",
    "There is no denying that the creation of a Zionist Jewish State in Palestine was originally endorsed by the then League of Nations in 1924. Israel, a country born out of British backed terrorist violence in Palestine was given full membership in the United Nations in 1948, while the victim State, dismembered Palestine was kept out of the then UN altogether!",
    "You are furthermore well aware that Israel is a racist project in the heart of the \u2018Arab World\u2019, which comprises followers of all major religious persuasions in the Middle East. This project is falsely justified by religious scriptures, some misleading and others fundamentalist! The ongoing destruction of Palestine by Zionist Israel appears obviously to be motivated by the alleged \u2018Deuteronomic command to \u2018utterly destroy\u2019 the existing nations in Palestine, \u2018in order to realise God\u2019s promise of the land\u2019. Those who believe in a true God, including those Jews marginalised by the Zionist political Judaists, will not subscribe to this false fanaticism!",
    "The reality is that thousands of Palestinians have already been dehumanised, terrorised and murdered by Israel and its European settler colonialists in the \u2018Occupied Territories of Palestine\u2019. These massacres have been going on, for far too long, for decades well before the 7th October 2023 Palestinian outburst.",
    "Your Excellency! The world had been watching with horror the unceasing \u2018utter destruction\u2019 of Palestine by Netanyahu and his radicalised armed forces, even while your high office and your staff struggled relentlessly to restrain barbaric Israel\u2019s acts of terror unsuccessfully.",
    "The Palestinians including Hamas who defend their lands from foreign colonial occupiers are by no means terrorists! Attempting to wipe out the Hamas peace negotiators in Qatari soil and the attack on Qatar itself are horrible acts of \u2018State Terror\u2019 as the Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani told CNN soon after the failed Israeli attack in Doha.",
    "This appeal Excellency is to urge you to facilitate the granting of full membership status to Palestine in the United Nations without delay, from its current Observer status given in 2012. We also urge you to take necessary steps, including initiating amendments to the Charter of the United Nations, to suspend Israel\u2019s membership in the UN, reducing it to Observer status, until Israel hands over Benjamin Netanyahu to the International Criminal Court, notwithstanding the indictment against him pending in Israeli Courts accusing Netanyahu of bribery and fraud.\u201d"
