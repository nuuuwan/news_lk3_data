  "original_body_lines": [
    "Friends and family rally to pay remaining Rs. 65 m after Jayawardena only managed to pay Rs. 10 m initially",
    "The State Intelligence Service\u2019s former Director Senior DIG Nilantha Jayawardena has paid the full Rs. 75 million compensation ordered by the Supreme Court in connection with the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. The compensation was mandated after petitions were filed accusing him of failing to prevent the attack, despite having received prior intelligence.",
    "The compensation payment was confirmed yesterday by Jayawardena\u2019s lawyer, Chandaka Jayasundara PC, during a Supreme Court hearing. Jayasundara informed the Court that the full amount had been paid, submitting documentation to corroborate the payment. This announcement came as the Court was hearing a contempt of court case against Jayawardena for initially failing to make the full payment.",
    "Additional Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena, representing the Attorney General, confirmed that Rs. 65 million of the compensation had been transferred to the Office of Reparations yesterday. Jayawardena himself appeared in Court, apologised for the delay, and explained the circumstances that led to the late payment. Following his statement, the Court decided to close the contempt of court proceedings against him.",
    "The Supreme Court has rescheduled the case for 18 November to review the distribution of compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks. The seven-member bench, led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, will examine the methods used for disbursing compensation to ensure justice for those affected by the tragedy.",
    "At an earlier hearing, the Court had been informed by Additional Solicitor General Dilipa Peiris that Jayawardena had only paid Rs. 10 million of the Rs. 75 million ordered, leaving a significant balance unpaid. This prompted the Court to issue a notice summoning Jayawardena to explain the delay and consider contempt of court charges.",
    "Jayasundara PC, representing Jayawardena, said that his client had been placed on compulsory leave with a monthly salary of Rs. 127,000, making it difficult for him to fulfil the Court\u2019s compensation order. He further explained that Jayawardena had no external financial resources to draw upon for the remaining payment and had not intended to insult the Court with the delay.",
    "However, Jayasundara revealed that Jayawardena\u2019s friends and family had ultimately stepped in to raise the funds needed to complete the payment. These funds were deposited into the bank account of Jayawardena\u2019s wife, and a standing order was issued to transfer the remaining Rs. 65 million to the Office of Reparations, which has now confirmed receipt of the full payment.",
    "Chief Justice Jayasuriya, who presided over the case alongside six other justices, remarked that the Court had allowed sufficient time for the payment of the compensation. He noted that had the payment not been confirmed by 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the Court would have continued with contempt proceedings against Jayawardena. However, with the documentation provided by the defence confirming full payment, the Court chose to dismiss the charges.",
    "During the proceedings, Additional Solicitor General Siriwardena also informed the Court that Rs. 63 million of the compensation had already been distributed to the victims of the attacks through the Office of Reparations. Shamil Perera OC, representing His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, requested that the Court provide a list of the victims who had received compensation so far.",
    "The Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, which targeted churches and hotels, claimed the lives of more than 250 people, and the failure to act on prior intelligence remains a point of national controversy."
