    "The Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) has considered regulations under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2449/60 of 15 August 2025. This was approved during a meeting of the Committee held on Tuesday in Parliament, chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva. Accordingly, the said regulations to Parliament seeks approval to extend permission for the import of vehicles to boost the tourism sector. Under the previous regulation introduced in May 2024, approval was granted to import 1,000 brand new vehicles, the officials said. These vehicles could only be brought in under special permits issued by the Ministry of Tourism and the measure was aimed at strengthening transport facilities to support tourism development and was valid till 30 June 2025. Following a proposal by the Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Minister, the Cabinet of Ministers decided in August 2025 to extend this facility for a further three months, till 30 September 2025.",
    "Accordingly, a fresh regulation, published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2449/60 on 15 August 2025, has now been placed before Parliament for approval under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. During the discussion on vehicle imports in consideration of the industry request for an increase in transport capacity at subsidised prices, officials explained that such concessions could not be granted under the current policy framework. They further noted that providing relief to one sector would raise concerns of fairness and balance across other industries. Officials also highlighted challenges with the collection of the Tourism Development Levy (TDL). Despite registered hotels and formal establishments contribute to the levy, many tourist rest houses and Airbnb operators are not part of the system and therefore do not make payments. This has created an uneven playing field within the industry and reduced the funds available for tourism development.",
