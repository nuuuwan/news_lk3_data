That could include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S.

A Telegram channel affiliated with the Ukrainian military posted a video Tuesday that it says shows U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles being fired from an undisclosed location in Ukraine. The Associated Press could not independently verify the date and location the video was filmed.

### Sri Lanka could negotiate tax credits for dependents, medical with IMF

*2024-11-20 06:52:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-could-negotiate-tax-credits-for-dependents-medical-with-imf-188809/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s new administration wants to cut personal income taxes, take away value added taxes on some processed food items and education materials, without harming revenue targets in the International Monetary Fund program.

The IMF is fixated on revenues, so they are likely to require alternative taxes to make up for any tax losses.

It should also be kept in mind that under the current system where VAT is not separately billed at retail level and only an inclusive tax is displayed any VAT cuts will be pocketed by businesses as it had happened in 2019.

The political costs of value added tax has already been borne by the last administration.

Any new taxes on a population that has been hit by multiple taxes, is likely to have a political cost to the new administration.

With the central bank allowing the rupee to appreciate, many food and educational goods prices have started to fall.

*2024-11-20 06:16:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/PM-Harini-s-Money-Printing-debate/4-769446) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s reliance on money printing stems from its constrained fiscal position, where limited revenue, high debt, and dwindling foreign reserves demand immediate liquidity

Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya of the National People’s Power (NPP) recently addressed criticism from the Opposition regarding the Central Bank’s injection of funds into the economy.

Dr. Amarasuriya clarified that no new currency bearing the new Finance Minister’s signature had been issued. However, the key issue is not whose signature appears on the currency notes but the economic impact of these monetary policies.

### History Is Going To Repeat Again: Lifting Ban On Vehicle Imports Could Trigger It

History is going to repeat again. It is going to begin on 01 February 2025, with the lifting of import ban on passenger vehicles. With the blessing of the governor of the central bank, the government has already promised to remove the import restrictions of vehicles on February 01, 2025. On that day, it will begin to set the necessary conditions for a full-blown crisis again, possibly within a year or so. If the unrealized demand for vehicles for the past few years is accounted, the crisis could even begin within months.

This time only advisors are different. Previously, it was Dr. PB Jayasundera, president’s secretary of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the former governor of the central bank. This time the advisors are Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the incumbent governor of the central bank and the Director General of customs.
