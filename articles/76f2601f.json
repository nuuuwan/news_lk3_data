    "Colombo, Feb 24 (Daily Mirror) - The temperature in Ratnapura District in Sabaragamuwa Province and Kandy, Nuwara-Eliya in the Central Province had increased due to the decline of wind flow, the Department of Meteorology said.",
    "The temperature in Ratnapura was recorded to be 36c degrees, while Kandy recorded 30c and Nuwaraeliya 21c degrees.",
    "A climatologist from the Department of Meteorology told Daily Mirror that the decline of wind flow had resulted in the temperature rise.\u201cthe atmosphere does not get a cooling effect\u00a0when winds decline.this is why temperatures rise.this is a usual happening during this time of the year,\u201d she said.",
    "The Department earlier said people feel the heat more as their perspiration does not evaporate into the air. As per the explanation, evaporation reduces when there is more humidity in\u00a0the environment. People feel uncomfortable when their perspiration does not dry up and fails to get absorbed into the environment. Humidity is measured by using hygrometers. It is the\u00a0amount of water vapour in the air compared to the amount required to saturate it given as a percentage."
