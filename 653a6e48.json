    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The first phase of an India-backed digital identity project for Sri Lankan citizens will focus only on software development while data gathering in the second phase will be carried out by Sri Lankan agencies with data protection measures underway, an official said.",
    "The Government of India is overseeing the software development for the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity (SL-UDI) project, following an agreement by India to contribute 300 million Indian rupees, State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath said.",
    "Herath told reporters on Thursday July 13 that major automated biometric systems and other software systems will be installed with the full supervision and consultation of Sri Lanka\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA).",
    "The project, which commenced with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Sri Lanka and India in March 2022, has drawn criticism from opposition parties over the Indian participation in the project citing national security concerns.",
    "Responding to this, Herath said the first phase of the procurement process will only involve software development while data collection will not be till the second phase.",
    "\u201cBy the second phase, we will hand over that role to the Department of Registration of Persons. Someone might ask if data can be retrieved through the backdoor. We\u2019ll have a data protection initiative underway on that regard with the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT),\u201d he said.",
    "In a related development, Sri Lanka also plans to introduce new cyber security legislation in 2023 and also unveil a framework for a digital economy in November.",
    "State Minister Herath said in June that the proposed cybersecurity act, which has been on the cards for some years now and subjected to repeated delays, is aimed at protecting personal data and will also serve the wider national security interest.",

    "The technological knowledge needed in preparing a Digital ID will be provided by ICTA and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Lanka.",
    "With the launch of SL-UDI project, every citizen in the country will get a unique number, said Herath.",
    "The project aims to collect biographic and biometric information, including facial, iris, and fingerprint data, which will be stored in a centralized system for the purpose of issuing identification cards as per the standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).",
    "With the implementation of the project, more effective and efficient delivery of government services, poverty reduction and welfare programs; financial inclusion through better access to banking and other products/services, minimisation of corruption, will be ensured, an official statement quoted the minister as saying.",
    "In March 2022, Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers gave clearance to create a digital identity for every citizen backed by Indian finance, despite the existence of a national identity card for every citizen for decades.",
    "Sri Lanka activists had previously gone to court against the creation of a digital database of citizens with \u2018family tree\u2019 and other data saying it will give the government unlimited powers to track citizens and invade their privacy.",
