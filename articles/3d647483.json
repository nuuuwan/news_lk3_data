    "Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, Director of Communications for the Archdiocese of Colombo, says that they reject the report of the Committee of Inquiry, chaired by retired High Court Judge A.N.J. De Alwis.",
    "He made this statement in response to comments made by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and former MP Udaya Gammanpila during a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (21) where he disclosed the contents of a previously unreleased report regarding the Easter Sunday terror attacks.",
    "Speaking at a press conference held today (22) at the Archbishop\u2019s House in Borella, Rev. Fr. Gamini stated: \u201cIt is clear that a conflict of interest will immediately arise by appointing A.N.J. De Alwis, the sister of Prasanna De Alwis, who is accused of concealing and destroying evidence in a murder investigation, as the head of this committee.\u201d",
    "He further stated that a report produced under these circumstances cannot be regarded as impartial or independent.",
