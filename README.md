### வீரகேசரி இணையத்தள வாசகர்களுக்கு நத்தார் தின வாழ்த்துக்கள் !

*2024-12-25 09:56:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202095) · `ta`

உலகெங்கும் வாழும் கிறிஸ்தவ மக்கள் இயேசு பிரானின் பிறப்பை நத்தார் பண்டிகையாக இன்று புதன்கிழமை (25) கொண்டாடுகின்றனர்.

இறைவன் எளிமையானவன். ஏழை, எளியவர்களுக்கு நெருக்கமானவன். எளிய சூழல்களில் சஞ்சரிப்பவன். ஏழை - பணக்காரர், பாமரர் - படித்தவர், உயர்ந்த சாதி - தாழ்ந்த சாதி, நல்லவர் - கெட்டவர், கறுப்பர் - வெள்ளையர் என எந்த பாகுபாடும் பார்க்காதவன்.

எல்லோருக்கும் பொதுவான ஒளிமயமானவன்.  கருணையின் ரூபமாய் வாழ்கிறவன். இதையே ஆண்டவராகிய இயேசு கிறிஸ்துவின் பிறப்பு இந்த உலகுக்கு உணர்த்துகிறது.

இறைவன் தன் மகனான பாலகன் இயேசுவை ஒரு மாட்டுத் தொழுவத்தில் பிறக்கச் செய்தார். கந்தல் துணிகளால் சுற்றிக்கிடக்கவும் செய்தார்.  ஏனென்றால், இறைவன் தான் விரும்புவது எளிமையையே.  அந்த எளிமையே இயேசுவின் வாழ்நாள் முழுவதும் அவரோடு இருந்தது. அதுமட்டுமன்றி இயேசு அன்பானவர். அன்பையே அவர் தன்னைப் பின் தொடர்ந்தவர்களுக்கு போதனையாகச் செய்தவர்.

வீரகேசரி வாசகர்கள் அனைவருக்கும் இனிய நத்தார் தின வாழ்த்துக்களை virakesari.lk இணையத்தளம் தெரிவித்துக்கொள்கிறது.

ஓர் தேசமாக மீள கட்டியெழுப்பும் இந்த மறுமலர்ச்சி யுகத்தில் தமது குடும்பம் மற்றும் அன்புக்குரியவர்களுடன் காலத்தை செலவிடுவது மிகவும் முக்கியமானது. ஒற்றுமையுடன் செயற்படுதல், பகிர்ந்து வாழுதல் மற்றும் ஒருவருக்கொருவர் உதவி செய்வதன் ஊடாக எமது உறவுகளும் வலுவானதாக முன்னேற்றமடையும். ஆரோக்கியமான மக்கள் சமூகம் மற்றும் பலம்மிக்க தேசத்தை கட்டியெழுப்பும் பணியானது வீட்டிலிருந்தே ஆரம்பமாகின்றது என்பதை இதுபோன்ற கூட்டு முயற்சிகள் எமக்கு நினைவூட்டும்.

உள்நாட்டில் உட்பட வெளிநாட்டில் சேவையாற்றுபவர்களையும், அத்தியாவசிய சேவைகளில் ஈடுபட்டுள்ளவர்கள் உட்பட பண்டிகை காலத்தில் தமது அன்புக்குரியவர்களுடன் காலத்தை செலவிட முடியாத அனைவரையும் இந்த தருணத்தில் நன்றியுடன் நினைவுகூற வேண்டும்.

Pulled from the mud as an infant after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and reunited with his parents following an emotional court battle, the boy once known as “Baby 81” is now a 20-year-old dreaming of higher education.

Jayarasa Abilash’s story symbolised that of the families torn apart by one of the worst natural calamities in modern history, but it also offered hope. More than 35,000 people in Sri Lanka were killed, with others missing.

The 2-month-old baby was washed away by the tsunami in eastern Sri Lanka and found some distance from home by rescuers. At the hospital, he was No. 81 on the admissions registry.

His father, Murugupillai Jayarasa, spent three days searching for his scattered family, with little left to his name in those early hours but a pair of shorts.

First he found his mother, then his wife. But their infant son was missing. A nurse had taken the baby from the hospital, but returned him after hearing that his family was alive.

### Ecuador’s debt for nature swap: Innovative bond restructuring – lessons for Sri Lanka

*2024-12-25 06:16:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ecuador-s-debt-for-nature-swap-Innovative-bond-restructuring-lessons-for-Sri-Lanka/4-771007) · `en`

The Galapagos debt-for-nature swap highlights the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable economic growth

Sri Lanka unilaterally defaulted on its external debt in April 2022, exposing its long-standing economic and financial vulnerabilities and igniting a series of inter-related multiple economic crises—fiscal, debt, currency, inflation, and balance of payments—as well as a vast socio-political upheaval. The root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis was a result of misuse of public funds by politicians on an unprecedented scale and large fiscal deficits, which were increasingly financed by unsustainable public debt, particularly foreign commercial borrowings. This carefully over time navigated Sri Lanka into a public debt crisis, international sovereign bond unsustainability, liquidity crisis, and a collapse in the exchange rate.

### Empathy and festivity: Why this Christmas uniquely needs more empathy than ever

*2024-12-25 06:06:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Empathy-and-festivity-Why-this-Christmas-uniquely-needs-more-empathy-than-ever/4-771004) · `en`

There is more that connects these two words than the fact that they rhyme. Christmas is the most anticipated time of the year for so many families but with this special time comes a unique set of emotions and relationship realities.  It is this once-a-year occasion that drives our need for more empathy than at any other point in the year – for ourselves and for each other.

Often mistaken as an ability, we are born with more or less of, empathy is actually a pro-social skillset that we all possess in order to be able to connect to those around us. It is a neurological skillset and not a mindset. At this time of year, as we share our humility and compassion with others, it is our ability to deeply understand the perspectives of others that allows us to gain both strength and unity. So how do you ensure that you are getting it right? Read on below as global expert Mimi Nicklin shares her top tips for harmony and understanding as the holidays roll out.

### Sri Lanka cabinet approves ratification of UN convention on BBNJ

*2024-12-25 06:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-cabinet-approves-ratification-of-un-convention-on-bbnj-196277/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers has approved the ratification of the convention on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) agreement, the Cabinet Spokesman said.

The move is likely to allow the island nation to get more financial resources along with improved capacity and technical expertise to conserve marine biodiversity in its closest international sea.

The oceans beyond national borders remained largely unregulated, leaving them vulnerable to the escalating threats of human activities in the international seas.

Government officials say the global north’s focus on resources in the high seas and seabed poses significant challenges to maritime biodiversity, given their advanced technical capabilities and financial resources.

These efforts give rise to concerns regarding their effects on marine ecosystems, encompassing issues such as overexploitation, habitat degradation, the diminishment of genetic diversity, and disruptions to ecological interconnectedness.

අනුරාධපුර යුගයේ දුටුගැමුණු රජ සමය හා සම්බන්ධකම් ඇතැයි කියන රිදී විහාර පරිශ්‍රයේ, රුවන්වැලි සෑය ඉදිකිරීමේදී ඊට අවශ්‍ය රිදී ගොබයක් මතු වූ බව මා අසා තිබිණි.

කෙසේ වෙතත්, මගේ සිත වැඩියෙන් ම ආකර්ෂණය වූයේ, බුදුන් වහන්සේගේ සැතපෙන පිළිමය අබිමුව පිහිටි මල් ආසනයේ ජේසුස් වහන්සේගේ ජීවිත කතාව සිතුවම් කරන ලද පිඟන් ගඩොල් සිය ගණනක් වෙත ය.

වසර 34කට පසු යළිත් මා රිදී විහාරය වෙත ගියේ, ඓතිහාසික බෞද්ධ විහාරස්ථානයක දක්නට ලැබෙන ජේසුස් වහන්සේගේ ජීවිත කතාව දැක්වෙන පිඟන් ගඩොල් පිළිබඳව සවිස්තරාත්මක වාර්තාවක් සැපයීමේ අරමුණිනි.

### Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid

*2024-12-24 19:11:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104476/global-hunger-crisis-deepens-as-major-nations-skimp-on-aid) · `en`

It’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.

The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60% of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.

The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46% of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.

*2024-12-24 17:12:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202051) · `ta`

பாராளுமன்றத்தில் எதிர்க்கட்சியின் பிரதம கொறடா பதவிக்கு சிறுபான்மை பிரதிநிதியொருவரின் பெயரைக் கூட பரிந்துரைக்காத ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்திக்கு 'கிளீன் ஸ்ரீலங்கா' வேலைத்திட்டத்தில் சிறுபான்மையினர் உள்வாங்கப்படவில்லை என்ற குற்றச்சாட்டை முன்வைப்பதற்கு தகுதியில்லை. அது முழு இலங்கையருக்குமான வேலைத்திட்டம் என்பதால் இன, மத பேதமின்றி எவரும் அதில் இணையலாம் என அரசாங்கம் அறிவித்துள்ளது.

அமைச்சரவை தீர்மானங்களை அறிவிக்கும் ஊடகவியலாளர் மாநாடு செவ்வாய்கிழமை (24) இடம்பெற்ற போது அமைச்சரவை பேச்சாளர் நளிந்த ஜயதிஸ்ஸ இதனைத் தெரிவித்தார்.

'கிளீன் ஸ்ரீலங்கா' வேலைத்திட்டத்தை முன்னெடுப்பதற்காக 18 பேரடங்கிய குழு நியமிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. பாதுகாப்பு படை உள்ளிட்ட துறையுடன் தொடர்புடையோர் அக்குழுவில் நியமிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளனர். ஜனவரியில் இக்குழுவின் சில வேலைத்திட்டங்கள் ஆரம்பமாகும்.

ஓரிரு மாதங்களுக்கு அல்லது ஒரு வருடத்துக்கு மாத்திரமின்றி ஜனாதிபதியின் கண்காணிப்பின் கீழ் நீண்டகால வேலைத்திட்டமாக இதனை முன்னெடுப்பதற்கு திட்டமிடப்பட்டுள்ளது.
