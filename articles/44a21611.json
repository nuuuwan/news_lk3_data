    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has prepared a national renewable hydrogen policy, to make the Indian Ocean island a regional hub, and also launched a just energy transformation (JET) study, with support from the United Nations Development Agency (UNDP).",
    "\u201cWith its vast renewable energy resources, Sri Lanka is well placed to leverage hydrogen technologies for decarbonising power generation, industry and transport, while enhancing energy security and attracting international investment,\u201d the UNDP said in a statement.",
    "The Ministry of Energy, the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority and UNDP in Sri Lanka hosted the Renewable Hydrogen Stakeholder Consultation Workshop \u2018From Strategy to Actions\u2019 recently.",
    "The forum brought together policymakers, private sector, financiers, academia and international experts to discuss the country\u2019s path to a green hydrogen economy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) Strategy for the Energy Sector, developed with support and technical expertise from UNDP, the Just Energy Transition (JET) Study, which outlines how Sri Lanka can shift to renewable energy, and Sri Lanka\u2019s National Renewable Hydrogen Policy, which provides a framework for positioning the country as a future regional hub for hydrogen and its derivatives, were launched at the event.",
    "The INFF provides actionable recommendations for mobilising and aligning diverse sources of finance, domestic and international, public and private, to advance an inclusive and equitable renewable energy transition in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cBy embracing renewable hydrogen, we are taking a decisive step towards energy independence, industrial competitiveness, and climate resilience,\u201d K T M Udyanaga Hemapala, Secretary to the Ministry of Energy, said.",
    "\u201cOur role is to ensure that the policy translates into practical solutions on the ground. From enabling infrastructure to safety standards and governance mechanisms, we are committed to building a robust ecosystem that allows hydrogen to flourish as part of Sri Lanka\u2019s clean energy mix,\u201d Wijendra J Bandara, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, said.",
    "\u201cRenewable hydrogen can be a game-changer for Sri Lanka, helping reduce emissions, diversify energy sources, and drive industrial growth,\u201d Marina Ten, Officer-in-Charge, UNDP in Sri Lanka, said.",
    "\u201cThe INFF is about connecting ambition with resources. It helps countries like Sri Lanka unlock and align the financing needed to achieve national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe JET study ensures people remain at the centre of this transformation, providing practical pathways for a fair and equitable shift to renewable energy. Taken together, these three initiatives provide Sri Lanka with the tools to drive innovation, attract investment, and deliver a clean energy transition that leaves no one behind.\u201d (Colombo/Sep23/2025)"
