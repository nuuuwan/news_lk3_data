    "The baby is not being thrown out with the bath water by the new AKD Government",
    "Change was the platform on which President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and later the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Government claimed power in the November 2024 elections. Change from the old ways of doing politics, of governance and in the way decisions are taken on behalf of the country and its people.",
    "And people fed up with the powers-that-be were seeking exactly that.",
    "Despite that, the NPP absolute majority was a bolt from the blue, even for the party itself. The NPP made pre-election statements, saying why it was not critical to get an absolute majority and why a simple majority would be enough to do its work.",
    "Yet the people spoke as one and by giving the party a full mandate to make changes, it gave AKD and his team a free hand to change the course of politics and governance in Sri Lanka.",
    "And the first impressions \u2013 90 days or so after Anura Kumara Dissanayake became the 9th Executive President and barely 45 days after NPP secured a two-thirds majority in Parliament \u2013 is a theme \u2013 of Continuity in Change.",
    "A 22-member Cabinet is a departure from the 56-member Cabinet of the previous Government in 2019.",
    "Many of the cabinet members and deputy ministers are engineers, doctors and graduates or postgraduates with experience in academia. This is a distinct departure from previous Governments who were filled with battle hardened politicians.",
    "There were no big firecracker celebrations to celebrate such a big victory. A small yet significant marker that brings focus on the actions that are demonstrating the new political culture that\u2019s envisioned.",
    "In the approach with the IMF and conversations about reducing the burden of taxes on the masses.",
    "There seems to be a conscious effort not to be overtly in the limelight. And an effort to tone down the previous efforts by politicians to hog it.",
    "Some sources speak of an over cautious approach in dealing with processes. Causing speculation if it\u2019s due to the inexperience and therefore diffidence of the team.",
    "In the way the Government engaged immediately with the IMF making it clear that they will be honouring all previous agreements and that there would be no earth shaking reviews that could cause alarm and concern among the larger international community.",
    "The Government has been nuanced in its pronouncements and has not gone on an instant witch hunt aimed at opponents, to placate voters, but clearly stated that any previous wrongdoing will be pursued in time and any guilty brought to book.",
    "The decisions not to replace the current central bank governor and secretary of finance are significant signals of the intent of the new Government \u2013 which is to retain those who are crucial in the rebuilding of the economy and for managing the monetary policy to prevent any crisis as seen in the past.",
    "There have been no vigorous \u2018red flag\u2019 waving metaphorically \u2013 no loud assertions of leftist ideology, but a pragmatic people oriented approach to policy and process.",
    "The Government\u2019s theme of \u2018Continuity in Change\u2019 has been demonstrated clearly in the recent visit to India by the President. Over the decades it\u2019s been a tradition of Sri Lankan presidents to first visit Delhi (before going anywhere else overseas). The President honoured this tradition but chose a date after the Parliamentary election to do so.",
    "Delhi rolled out the red carpet for the President of Sri Lanka, acknowledging the massive mandate he has received from the people of Sri Lanka and recognising that decisions he and his team take with regard to the bilateral relationship will determine its future.",
    "The change seemed in the way the President travelled to Delhi \u2013 by a regular UL commercial flight to Delhi. And returning taking selfies with other travellers in the airport.",
    "And the continuity was in the approach to India \u2013 appreciating its security concerns and assuaging any concerns that might exist in New Delhi therein. By acknowledging India\u2019s key role in bringing Sri Lanka out of the economic crisis in 2021. And in the agreements signed and stating up front that India is going to be a key partner in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic future. A leading news outlet \u2018Tehelka\u2019 reported on how the visit of the President resulted in a \u2018lowering\u2019 of apprehensions in India about the new Government.",
    "Indeed if this combination of powerful symbolic action to signal the change in political culture is combined by a pragmatic approach of continuing the wise things in terms of policy, Sri Lanka could be in for a period of sustained enduring stability and economic growth. And consequently, a popular Government backed by the grassroots.",
    "Of course the journey of this Government has just begun and it\u2019s too early to either celebrate it fully or to write an epitaph but it could be said that It\u2019s been an engaging start. Let\u2019s back it to fulfil its potential.",
