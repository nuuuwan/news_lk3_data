    "I was born at the very end of the nineteenth century and in my eightieth year I can look back on the careers of some of the prominent minority leaders about whom I shall say something in this article.",
    "The names that come to mind include the brothers Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Ponnambalam Arunachalam and their kinsmen, Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy and Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy. They came from the same highly educated and successful families of Jaffna.",
    "Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had held the office of Solicitor-General under British rule and often acted as Attorney-General, a post reserved for officers recruited from abroad. He was a polished speaker, though in his old age he was inclined to be somewhat long-winded.",
    "He was a fervent Hindu in later life and helped to build temples in Jaffna and Colombo. He was also interested in the movement to establish a university in Ceylon. He lived to a ripe old age and always clad himself in national dress, including a turban and a gold embroidered shawl thrown over his shoulder,",
    "Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam was correct and methodical in all his work and his speeches and writings. The last thing that could have been said of him was that he was a demagogue, although he was president of the Ceylon National Congress and the father of the nationalist movement in Sri Lanka. He won the Government university scholarship to England and won first classes at Cambridge.",
    "Returning to his home country, he joined the Civil Service and, step by step, rose to reach the highest ranks. In due course he was appointed Registrar-General, a Nominated Member of the Legislative Council and finally, a member of the Governor\u2019s Executive Council. He was never made a Government Agent. In those days the Government agencies in the provinces were the close preserve of European civil servants.",
    "Arunachalam was frustrated, seeing how the Ceylonese civil servants like himself and Paul Pieris were passed over. He resigned to pursue a career in public affairs. He teamed up with men like James Peiris, E.W. Perera and E. J. Samerawickrame and delivered a famous speech on \u201cOur Political Needs.\u201d",
    "It cannot thus be said that the minorities in Ceylon did not play an important role in public affairs. The Jaffna Tamils in particular acted as a spear-head. A recital of some of the names is itself instructive, even though as Tamils they were a minority community. Among those who served in the Legislative Council and the State Council were Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy, who had the same background as the Ponnambalam brothers, and Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy an eminent scholar and writer.",
    "A Mahadeva, who was a member of the Legislative Council and later a member of the State Council and a Minister, was a son of Arunachalam. A Kanasabhai was a Nominated Member of the Legislative Council representing the Tamils and K Balasingham, first a Nominated Member and thereafter an elected member of the Legislative Council.",
    "There were several prominent Tamil lawyers who graced the legislature, among them H.A.P. Sandrasegera K.C., Sir Waitilingam Duraiswamy, S. Rajaratnam and S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. Other leading Jaffna politicians were J.M. Hensman, William Mather and A. V. Kulasingham.",
    "Several Tamils gentlemen made their name in Colombo. These include C. Suntheralingam, a university scholar who went to Oxford and was one of the earliest professors of the Ceylon University; C. Sittampalam, formerly of the Ceylon Civil Service; and Father Peter Pillai, the O. M. I. priest who was rector of Catholic colleges and was keenly interested in politics.",
    "One can add to the list the names of a number of distinguished Tamils of their generation who touched public affairs in an official or unofficial capacity. K. Vaithianathan was Permanent Secretary for External Affairs and of great assistance to D. S. Senanayake, R. R. Crosette-Tambiah was Solicitor-General and C. Nagalingam and C. Thiagalingam, brothers of Suntharalingam, can also be mentioned. One of the most dynamic politicians of his time and a leading advocate of the Colombo Bar was G. G. Ponnambalam.",
    "Apart from the Tamils, other minorities contributed their quota in public life, e.g. Frederick Dornhorst, Alan Drieberg, C. Vanderwall, H. L. Wendt, Joseph Grenier and A. E. Buultjens. Many of the outstation towns had Burgher lawyers, planters and doctors who took part actively in public life.",
    "Among the Muslims, those who sat in the legislature included Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, N. H. M. Abdul Cader and E. G. Adamally, a prominent Borah merchant. M. T. Akbar, a Malay, sat in both the Legislative and Executive Councils and was a highly respected Supreme Court judge.",
    "The minority communities of Sri Lanka have not only played their due part but even a major role in the public life of the country. During the period of the riots in 1915 the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders who were flung into jail had no more sincere and eloquent pleader of their cause than Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan.",
    "Support from the minorities enabled Mr. D. S. Senanayake to convince the British rulers that Ceylon was ripe for self-government. In fact, minority leaders took a prominent part in the founding of the United National Party. At the first Executive Committee meeting of the UNP in September 1946, S Natesan moved the resolution to form a political party called the United National Party and the motion was seconded by T. B. Jayah. A. R. A. Razik (now Sir Razik Fareed) seconded the motion (moved by A. F. Molamure), for the adoption of the draft manifesto and Constitution of the party.",
    "There was a unity of purpose among the diverse communities. To the erosion of that unity in the post-independence era is traceable much of the nation\u2019s failure fully to measure up to the task of tackling many of its problems. Restoration of that unity will surely provide a key to success in the future.",
