  "original_body_lines": [
    "Northern China has reported an increase in \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d since mid-October when compared to the same period in the previous three years, the WHO said.",
    "\u201cWHO has made an official request to China for detailed information on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children,\u201d the UN health body said in a statement on Wednesday.",
    "China\u2019s National Health Commission told reporters last week that the respiratory illness spike was due to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and the circulation of known pathogens, namely influenza and common bacterial infections that affect children, including mycoplasma pneumonia.",
    "The Chinese capital of Beijing, located in the north of the country, is currently experiencing a cold snap, with temperatures expected to plummet to well below zero by Friday, state media said.",
    "Temperatures plummeted as the city \u201centered a high incidence season of respiratory infectious diseases\u201d, Wang Quanyi, deputy director and chief epidemiological expert at the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state media on Wednesday.",
    "Beijing \u201cis currently showing a trend of multiple pathogens coexisting\u201d, he added.",
    "At Beijing\u2019s Capital Institute of Pediatrics\u2019 Children\u2019s Hospital on Thursday, AFP journalists saw crowds of parents and children dressed in winter clothes.",
    "A parent surnamed Zhang accompanied her coughing nine-year-old son and said he had fallen ill with pneumonia.",
    "\u201cThere are really a lot of children who have caught it recently,\u201d she said.",
    "Li Meiling, 42, had brought her eight-year-old daughter, who was suffering from mycoplasma pneumonia -- a pathogen that can cause sore throats, fatigue and fever.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s true that a lot of children her age are ill with this at the moment,\u201d she told AFP.",
    "But she said she was \u201cnot particularly worried\u201d about the WHO announcement.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s winter, so it\u2019s normal that there are more cases of respiratory illnesses. It\u2019s due to the season.\u201d",
    "On November 21, media and public disease surveillance system ProMED reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in northern China.",
    "The WHO said it was unclear if ProMED\u2019s report was related to the authorities\u2019 press conference and that it was seeking clarification.",
    "The agency \u201chas also requested additional information on recent trends in the circulation of known pathogens, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that gives rise to Covid-19), RSV affecting infants and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as on the degree of overcrowding in the health system,\u201d the statement added.",
    "In the meantime, it urged people to take preventative measures, including getting vaccinated, keeping distance from sick people and wearing masks.",
    "The WHO gave no indication of China\u2019s response to the request for more information.",
    "And China\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment from AFP on Thursday.",
    "Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO repeatedly criticised Chinese authorities for their lack of transparency and cooperation.",
    "More than three years after cases were first detected in Wuhan, heated debate still rages around the origins of Covid-19.",
    "Scientists are divided between two main theories of the cause: an escape from a laboratory in the city where such viruses were being studied and an intermediate animal that infected people at a local market.",
    "Earlier this year, WHO experts said they were sure that Beijing had far more data that could shed light on the origins of Covid, and called it a moral imperative for the information to be shared.",
    "A team of specialists led by the WHO and accompanied by Chinese colleagues investigated China in early 2021, but there has not been a team able to return since and WHO officials have repeatedly asked for additional data.",
    "WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has stressed that getting to the bottom of the mystery could help avert future pandemics."
