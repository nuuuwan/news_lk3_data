  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The cabinet of ministers of Maldives has decided to dollarize a part of government revenues by collecting income tax, customs duty and pensions contribution in US dollars, a media report said.",
    "The new rules will apply to businesses which earn foreign currency revenues.",
    "The Maldives is experiencing forex shortages (the rufiyaa has lost its attribute of being a medium of exchange for cross border transactions) due to monetary policy incompatible with the exchange rate (excess rufiyaa liquidity).",
    "When a central bank or monetary authority injects money to banks to keep rates down or there is already lot of excess local currency liquidity which is not extinguished, forex reserves will be lost as the money is used by new borrowers or original depositors as an economy recovers.",
    "Amendments will be brought to the Pension Act, Income Tax Act as well as the MIRA Act to enable the government to collect dollar revenues.",
    "\u201cWe will rectify this by changing the government\u2019s laws and regulations,\u201d Attorney General Ahmed Usham was quoted as saying by the news portal edition.mv.",
    "\u201cThe Cabinet has decided to change that. That is, to have companies earning income in dollars to pay the government in dollars from now on.\u201d",
    "Dollarizing revenues will help government avoid the transaction of changing rufiyaa into dollars without disturbing the domestic reserve money base (non-reserve-passthrough transaction) and directly deal in US monetary system.",
    "It will help avoid the loss of cross-border medium of exchange property of the rufiyaa due to excess liquidity,",
    "When there is a strong domestic credit driven by excess liquidity or new liquidity injected to keep interest rates down and a monetary authority restricts the issue of dollars to match the parallel exchange rates (a kerb market) develops at a higher rate.",
    "The Attorney General said \u201cit has become evident that dollars are being sold on the black market to secure funds for government payments.\u201d",
    "Maldives already has substantial deposit dollarization, which has to be backed by dollar loans to enable them to be repaid.",
    "To maintain the peg, and avoid forex shortages, the monetary authority has to allow short term rates to go up or float through unsterilized interventions.",
    "Monetary authorities that use a formula to allow rates to go up with interventions and limit credit  are also able to maintain pegs to a large degree.",
    "By allowing large scale domestic use of foreign currency, the ability of a central bank to trigger forex shortages can also be avoided by reducing its ability to inject money and drive credit without deposits and mis-target rates through a \u2018transmission mechanism\u2019, analysts say.",
    "Central banks despite providing bad money through a flawed operating framework usually have a \u2018legal tender law\u2019 to enforce a money monopoly and prevent businesses and citizens from using lower inflating money.",
    "The original central banks which were private, lobbied governments to force people to pay taxes in their currency (note issue) to get people to use the money.",
    "In Sri Lanka during an economic crisis triggered by liquidity injected to keep rates down and also the use of swap and Asian Clearing Union loans to suppress rates, proposals to dollarize revenues of a petroleum utility were discouraged by macroeconomists who favoured the money monopoly.",
    "However in many small countries where there were not many macroeconomists, strong and fixed exchange rates have been maintained without any exchange controls. Others have dollarized during crisis times.",
    "Dollarization may allow countries to restore external stability without shrinking economic activity. (Colombo/Aug04/2024)"
