### Will the 2024 General elections redefine Sri Lanka’s political future?

*2024-11-13 23:31:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Will-the-2024-General-elections-redefine-Sri-Lanka-s-political-future/4-769215) · `en`

This election is expected to be a defining moment for Sri Lanka, with outcomes that could significantly impact its political and economic trajectory in the coming years – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The upcoming General elections in Sri Lanka are pivotal, given the country’s complex political and economic landscape. Several key factors are shaping expectations for the outcome.

First, economic challenges remain a critical concern. Sri Lanka’s economic recovery from a severe debt crisis and inflation surge has been slow, with many citizens still experiencing financial hardship. This context has led to frustration with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as many view its policies as ineffective in alleviating economic pressures. This dissatisfaction may boost Opposition parties like the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National People’s Power (NPP), who have gained traction with promises of economic reforms and anti-corruption measures.

### What we should learn from Nehru

*2024-11-13 22:46:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-we-should-learn-from-Nehru/4-769212) · `en`

Now after so many years we have to shamefully admit that in this age of religious ostentation, hypocrisy, superstition and orthodox thinking where priests of all faiths are gaining influence and getting political patronage for opinions, there is now a deep gap between the Nehruvian understanding of scientific approach and its practical application and implementation in the Indian context. It has come a long way. But Nehru is as relevant today as he was then.

While today there is a deluge of superstitious clerics and leaders everywhere in the country, about seventy years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had foresightly emphasised that, ‘Politics led me to economics and it was from that that I was inspired by science and knowledge to adopt a scientific approach to problems and life. Only science can solve the problem of hunger and poverty. Science is the only medium that can eradicate hunger and poverty.’

### Reality will dawn on 15 November; election promises should become legally enforceable

A system change will be meaningless unless governance participation is taken to the people in an effective, practical way not just during elections but in between them as well – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

In a society that has inequality and inequity, with many having no recourse to hold politicians responsible for the promises made, except believing promises by another set of politicians at the next election and believing them, and many ending up without opportunities for their advancement due to the failings of politicians, life does not change for them except going further downhill

Government has no wealth, and when a politician promises to give you something for nothing, he must first confiscate that wealth from you -- either by direct taxes, or by the cruelly indirect tax of inflation

Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s energy sector is expected to undergo significant changes, guided by social and economic reforms under the island nation’s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government. Here are five potential implications to the sector after the November 14 parliamentary elections:

The NPP’s policy platform strongly emphasizes environmental sustainability and energy independence. The government is expected to push for investments in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy projects, to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, as per the NPP’s policy document released before the presidential elections. This could lead to incentives for renewable projects, but it may also challenge existing energy providers reliant on non-renewable sources. ​

However, the Voting of the North and East expresses the suspicion of the Tamil people on Dissanayake's party. This is because they have voted for Samaki Jan. Balavegaya's Sajith Premadasa and the candidate of the civil society, Ariyanethran Pakiyaselvam.

### EXPLAINER: Possible policy impacts on Sri Lanka’s banking sector after parliament polls

ECONOMYNEXT – Under Sri Lanka’s President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) government, Sri Lanka’s banking sector is likely to experience significant changes and challenges as it navigates policy shifts focused on economic redistribution, social reforms, and restructuring. Here are five potential impacts on the banking sector after the parliament polls, in which NPP is believed to have an edge:

The NPP has historically advocated for stronger state control over strategic economic sectors, including banking. Under Dissanayake, the sector may face increased regulation and scrutiny aimed at reducing perceived corruption, addressing financial mismanagement, and protecting consumer interests. This could lead to a more restrictive operational environment for banks, with potential impacts on profitability and compliance costs. ​
