The Colombo High Court yesterday sentenced Niraj Roshan, better known as “Ali Roshan,” to 15 years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 20.6 million after convicting him of keeping five elephants without valid permits.

Prosecutors said that between July 2009 and August 2015, in several locations including Maharagama, Arawwala, Nawala, Battaramulla, and Oruwala, Roshan and others conspired to traffic elephants and possessed animals known to have been stolen.

The Attorney General filed 33 indictments under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the Public Property Act in connection with the case.

Roshan was found guilty of falsifying the elephant registry of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and unlawfully holding the animals in his custody.

Three others indicted in the case, Uchitha Nishantha Dammika, Palihepitiya Gamage Jayalath, and Paskuwel Fonseka Priyanga Sanjeewani, were acquitted.

### CEB unions launch ‘critical’ protest campaign phase this Sunday

*2025-09-19 23:53:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/CEB-unions-launch-critical-protest-campaign-phase-this-Sunday/56-781950) · `en`

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) trade unions are set to begin the third stage of their industrial action against the proposed restructuring of the utility from midnight tomorrow, to run until 24 September.

Union leaders described the forthcoming phase as critical, saying its outcome will shape the direction of future protests and have implications for the energy sector.

The decision was announced by CEB Technicians’ Association Chairman Kosala Abeysinghe.

He said the move comes in response to what unions describe as the Government’s refusal to address their concerns.

“We have warned this Government to listen. This is a response to the arrogance of the Minister and the Director General in particular. But if the President continues to respond in the same way, we will be compelled to escalate matters further,” Abeysinghe said.

The union campaign started on 4 September with a work-to-rule action, followed by a sick-leave protest on 17 and 18 September.

### Wordy end of a vociferous parley in Qatar

Empty resolutions and threats are not going to save dying Palestinians

“Every people in the world lives in a place. For Palestinians the place lives in them” (Danny Rubinstein – an Israeli writer)

“We were herders of animals until we received the revelation, and then we became herders of other societies. We gave up the revelation and had become herds of other societies” (Allama Iqbal)

The extraordinary Arab-Islamic Summit held in Doha to counter Israel’s bombing of a government residential complex in the Leqtaifiya District of Qatar, where negotiations over a US initiated ceasefire proposal were in progress with representatives from Hamas, ended as usual in chest-thumping threats, condemnations and declarations against Israel, but without any concrete agenda of action to stop the genocide and expulsion of Palestinians from their homes before annexing Gaza and the West Bank to create Eretz Israel.

### Tribute to Rajiv Perera on 60th birthday

*2025-09-19 23:29:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Tribute-to-Rajiv-Perera-on-60th-birthday/4-781937) · `en`

In life we meet many people, most of whom hardly leave a trace of their passing. Some, very few in fact, leave a mark so deep that no passage of time can erase it. For me, at the very top of that list is Rajiv Perera.

I knew of Rajiv at school – St. Thomas’, Mount Lavinia – where he was a few years senior to me. A fine sportsman, he played rugby for S. Thomas’, CH & FC, and Sri Lanka. On the field he was fearless yet always a gentleman, respected by teammates and opponents alike. That same spirit carried into the rest of his life, competitive when it mattered, but always fair, always gracious.

But I only really got to know him when I went to the UK for my higher studies, about 35 years ago. This was around the time that John Major had replaced the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, and was just settling in as Prime Minister. I knew only a few people in London. It was through the Thomian network that I met Rajiv. We clicked immediately.

### Similarities and differences of three recent uprisings in South Asia: Lesson for democracies

*2025-09-19 23:26:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Similarities-and-differences-of-three-recent-uprisings-in-South-Asia-Lesson-for-democracies/4-781935) · `en`

Taken together, these uprisings demonstrate both the resilience and the fragility of democracy in South Asia. They remind us that popular sovereignty is not exercised only at the ballot box but also in the streets when institutions falter. Repression corrodes legitimacy, while timely engagement can transform dissent into democratic renewal. For democracies everywhere, the lesson is clear: listen to citizens before the street becomes the only forum for dialogue

South Asia is living through an era of popular uprisings that has reshaped the political vocabulary of the region. In Colombo, Dhaka and Kathmandu, ordinary citizens—many of them strikingly young—have turned public squares into stages for democratic confrontation. These movements differ in their national contexts and immediate triggers, yet together they illuminate how people power can both rescue and test democratic institutions.

### China’s entry into SAARC: Gateway to South Asian prosperity

*2025-09-19 23:24:46* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/China-s-entry-into-SAARC-Gateway-to-South-Asian-prosperity/4-781934) · `en`

A SAARC revitalised by Chinese membership would cease to be a peripheral talking shop and become a formidable actor on the world stage

“China as a full member of SAARC? At first, the idea may sound bold, even strange. But it could be the spark the region needs to move forward. For years, SAARC has carried a huge promise; a platform to connect markets, people, and ideas across South Asia. Yet political tensions have often slowed its progress. Bringing China into the fold could give SAARC fresh energy, new opportunities, and a stronger voice in the world.”

China’s entry could change that. With its huge economy, global influence, and experience in building connections, China can inject new life into SAARC. It could open bigger trade opportunities, boost regional projects, and make SAARC more visible on the world stage.

### Response to Mahinda Rajapaksa: It is  not personal revenge or political terrorism

Leaders like Mahinda Rajapaksa created dependency networks, protected corruption, and prioritised personal luxury over public good

The Government has now revealed that between 2017 and mid-2025, Rs. 491.2 million was spent on the upkeep of former presidents and their widows. Of this staggering sum, Mahinda Rajapaksa’s share alone was approximately Rs. 231 million—nearly half the total. His list of privileges reads like a manual of extravagance: 111 staff members, including nine medical personnel, eight drivers, five mechanics, 16 chefs, 26 electricians, and even a dog handler. The residence he occupied had a rental value of more than Rs. 4.6 million a month. Just imagine! Many people and families live without proper shelter, a harsh reality on the ground

U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping made progress on a TikTok agreement and pledged to meet face-to-face in just over a month in South Korea.

The two sides appeared to lower tensions during the first call in three months between the leaders of the two superpowers, but it was not immediately clear if the call had yielded the expected firm agreement over the fate of the popular short-video app.

Trump did say the leaders agreed to talks on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that starts on October 31 in Gyeongju, South Korea, and for a potential later visit to China by Trump. Reuters previously reported that the two sides were planning such a meeting.

“We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote on social media.

More than 70 people have been killed following a drone strike on a mosque in Sudan’s Darfur region, a senior medical source has told the BBC.

Friday’s attack in the city of el-Fasher has been blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), but the group has not taken responsibility.

The RSF and the army have been engaged in a ferocious civil war for more than two years.

The paramilitaries are gaining ground as they fight to seize complete control of el-Fasher - the last army stronghold in Darfur and home to more than 300,000 civilians who have been trapped by the fighting.

One resident told the BBC the drone struck during morning prayers, killing dozens of people instantly.

The medical source said 78 died and about 20 were injured, but the process of extracting the bodies from the rubble of the building was still ongoing.

BBC Verify has authenticated footage showing around 30 bodies wrapped in shrouds and blankets next to the mosque, which was located in the west of the city.
