  "original_body_lines": [
    "Continued human existence and advancement rely on their collective action. A group of individuals working together to achieve an identified agenda.",
    "An authority managing collective action of a community is a government.",
    "Directing necessary collective action for the benefit of all is the purpose of a government.",
    "Examining how governments evolved enlightens us to identify the functions of a government and how collective action has been managed. And how it should be managed.",
    "Primitive humans lived in partly cleared spots in the wilderness as tiny communities. Members communicated with each other. Men, as a group, engaged in gathering forest resources for food and building shelter. Women helped prepare food and took care of children.",
    "As the communities grew in size, constraints surfaced. When hundreds of men work together to gather food, sharing the collection leads to conflicts. The result was the splitting of the community into two or more groups, that dispersed to occupy new territory. A trend, observed in primate populations.",
    "Agriculture, the first major innovation of humankind, changed the scenario. The profession required the engagement of a larger number of people. How do you coordinate the work of an excessively large group? Leaders emerged! They extended communication using messengers. Their thinking was the policy and what they said, the law.",
    "The administrative and executive structure built around leadership constituted the government.",
    "Even though most chieftains and the kings were tyrants, society progressed as a result of coordinated effort.",
    "A landmark innovation that shaped society was the invention of money. A way of measuring the worth of goods and services. The use of money increased production, facilitating the exchange of goods and honouring compensation for the services.",
    "The operations to maintain the community demanded resources (material and labour), and the people were taxed. Taxation allowed diversion of a portion of the production by individuals to implement collective action.",
    "The rulers used tax money to carry out projects essential for the livelihood of citizens, raise armies, and a good portion for their enjoyment. Paid little attention to the grievances of people and often ignored or violated their rights.",
    "In the next step of social development, democracy originated as a method for eliminating the evils of authoritarian rule. Where the necessary collective action was decided by people themselves.",
    "The primitive small communities were indeed direct democracies. There, the members got together and decided the course of action. In an evening discussion, they rationally agreed where to go for hunting next morning.",
    "Direct democracies, where all citizens vote to make decisions, were practised in Athens. People voted to decide major issues or appoint officials. Influenced by philosopher Solon (630-560 BCE), the statesman Cleisthenes, established the first direct democracy in Athens, 508 BCE, and the concept lasted for nearly two centuries. However, it was found to be impractical when the population grew large.",
    "A practical way of installing a democracy is by representation. In a representative democracy, the governing body is constituted of candidates elected by popular vote.",
    "How do you form a governing body with elected candidates? Aristotle emphasized the need for a constitution and defined it as a way of organizing the offices of Athens. In modern states, the structure of government, the principles to be abided by, and the procedures to be followed in its forming and functioning are described in the constitution. Generally, a carefully drafted written document and rarely a collection of statutes.",
    "A constitution also invariably embodies a \u2018supreme idealistic and conventional law\u2019 required to be followed by the government it defines.",
    "There is no theory to the base derivation of a constitution; its construction decided by experience, examples, and problems encountered in the functioning of a government.",
    "A primary objective of a constitution is to balance the concentration and distribution of the decision-making authority of the government. Unless, the authority is concentrated at an apex, prompt, unambiguous decision making would be difficult. At the same time, too much political power should not be transferred to the apex \u2013 the head of the government, the chief executive (elected by people in a democracy).",
    "Some constitutions introduce a ceremonially superior symbolic head of state with limited executive power. Often an approving authority of certain decisions made by the governing body.",
    "A constitution also defines an independent judicial system. And generally, that system, also acts as the custodian and the interpreter of the constitution.",
    "People get entrapped in the laws they make. For that reason, it needs to specify, how it could be amended",
    "Can a constitutional democracy, deteriorate, fail to serve people, and turn into a self-serving system?",
    "More than 2500 years ago, the great Greek philosopher, Plato, noted that democracies are not immune to the ills of authoritarian rule. It allows selfish and unqualified to get elected.",
    "They could manipulate the law or go through loopholes in it and gradually turn democracy into a virtual autocracy or an oligarchy? Or they rewrite the constitution to meet their wishes, following rules given for amendments in the existing constitution.",
    "Two of the most intricately drafted documents after much thought are the United States, the Deceleration of Independence, and the Constitution. Authors attempted a logical structure based on axioms similar to Euclid\u2019s geometry.",
    "In the closing speech at the constitutional convention 1887, the American polymath Benjamin Franklin said,\u201d Sir, I consent to this constitution, because I expect no better, and because I am not sure that it is not the best.\u201d",
    "In 1947, Kurt Godel, a great Austrian mathematician, who emigrated to the United States, read the constitution to prepare for the citizenship interview. He told his friends, Albert Einstein and Oskar Morgenstein (renowned mathematician and economist), who were to be witnesses to the oath, he found a flaw in the United States constitution. A loophole that allows legal conversion of American democracy to a dictatorship. Both Einstein and Morgenstein dissuaded Godel from bringing up this issue during the interview. And knowing the nature of the man, Einstein reminded Godel of his warning on the way to the immigration court. Instead, Godel told the judge, there was a flaw in the US Constitution, and he could prove its possible consequence. The judge declined further discussion and approved citizenship.",
    "No one knows for sure, what Godel meant, but his claim hints drafting a flawless constitution would be nearly impossible.",
    "Godel, regarded as the greatest logician since Aristotle, shook the world of mathematics at the age of 25, proving an assertion referred to as the incompleteness theorem. Godel may have seen something where \u2018mortals \u2018were blind!",
    "The devious will look for loopholes and manipulate the law for their advantage. The safeguard is, for citizens to understand the purpose, functions, and limits of a government to elect their representatives wisely. Keeping in mind, they are managers of collective action, appointed by people. And whether they are qualified to undertake responsibilities and their integrity. We have witnessed the repercussions of Plato\u2019s warning and suffered!",
    "A government enacts laws and frames policies. Enforce law, ensure rule of law, and implement policies. To achieve the said objective, its functions distributed (as ministries, departments, etc.).",
    "A government needs to address issues related to the ready availability of essential commodities and facilitation of services. People require food, materials, devices, and energy supplies to live. These are obtained by people\u2019s effort and what they earn. The role a government plays here, should be to initiate protocols to increase production and earnings and ensure fair and affordable distribution, clearing bottlenecks.",
    "A government needs to levy taxes on the earnings of the citizens and entities, fairly to cover the costs of collective actions.",
    "A government should provide protections to people. Protection against evils of society and external forces. Protection against poverty. Protection against ignorance (education). Protection against injustice and upholding justice. Ensure availability of services to take care of sick and impoverished.",
    "A government should promote intellectual, scientific, technical, and recreational endeavors and international cooperation.",
    "The above enumeration of the functions of a government is not exhaustive. As society moves, unexpected issues engendering the society could crop up, where the government needs to intervene.",
    "Equally important are the things that a government should not do.",
    "Human progress is not entirely a consequence of collective action. The individuals who made discoveries, introduced groundbreaking concepts, wrote books, painted pictures, composed music, started industries and businesses, or voiced against injustice have advanced society in astronomical quantum jumps. A government should not interfere with such activities abided by a law.",
    "The needs of individuals in a society differ, but individuals also have distinctions (colour, creed, ethnicity, spoken language, etc.). A government should not be biased towards distinctions.",
    "Individuals have varying responsibilities, beliefs, and desires. They are free to form groups and initiate collective activities to meet such aspirations, within the framework of law. A government, undertake only necessary collective action as decided by people.",
    "A government should not expand itself to a huge self-serving officialdom to strengthen partisan politics at a cost to the people",
    "After a long lapse, the people of Sri Lanka, seem to be gaining ground in understanding of the political landscape and their responsibilities. Hopefully, the trend will continue.",
    "Undeniably, social media overall has promoted rational analysis, convincing people. Even the false information it propagates would have acted contrarily, opening eyes and realization of the ulterior motive behind such postings.",
    "I conclude this article by quoting Benjamin Frankin once again. In the closing speech at the constitutional convention in 1887, he said:",
    "\u201cMuch of the strength and efficiency of any government in procuring and securing happiness to people depend on opinion, on the general opinion of the goodness of that government as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors.\u201d",
