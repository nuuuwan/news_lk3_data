### Sri LankaтАЩs ambitious governance and macro-linked bonds explained

Sri LankaтАЩs restructuring of $12.55 billion in international bond debt is set to lead to the launch of a series of new, as-yet-untested instruments linked to economic growth and governance.

Observers say it is one of the most complex set of instruments ever arranged in a restructuring. The bonds aim to give the country additional debt relief if the economy falters and to encourage it to improve its governance.

The governance-linked bond (GLB) is the first of its kind and is designed to reward Sri Lanka for transparency and effective economic management by reducing the interest on its debt. To earn that reduction, Sri Lanka must meet targets, or key performance indicators (KPIs), seen as indicating better governance.

The first KPI demands that Sri Lanka exceed a baseline ratio set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for total revenue to GDP in both 2026 and 2027, which the Fund has projected at 15.3% and 15.4% respectively.

*2024-12-17 10:03:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/201473) ┬╖ `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



World Arabic Day celebrates Arabic language & culture. Saudi Arabia leads efforts to preserve & promote Arabic through initiatives in AI, education, literature, & cultural events. Challenges remain, but progress continues to strengthen Arabic's global importance.

ЁЯЯй

On December 18, millions of people around the world unite to celebrate World Arabic Day to proclaim the richness and prosperity of the Arabic language.. The Arabic language spoken in 25 countries by more than 400 million people is a major pillar of culture, tradition, and intellectuals.

The Arabic language is a proof and medium of man who serves the beautiful, intelligent and spiritual information of man.

From the poetry of ancient Arabic poetry to the complex writings that decorate the walls of the buildings, the Arabic language has been a ship that transacted artistic heritage and culture for centuries.

Moreover, it is a hidden fact that the Arabic language has made enormous contributions to the public language of science, philosophy and literature during the Islamic Golden Age.

Scholars such as Al-Barafi, Ibn Sina (Avisenna), and Al-Quarismmi have written all the works in the Arabic language, which have been a guide to modern discovery in many fields from medicine to mathematics.

Bolivia was once a natural gas exporter and the YPFB was broken up and privatized under a rightwing president.

However, the domestic currency Boliviano collapsed from around 6.0 to the US dollar to 2,000 to 7.4 to the US dollar two years later as macroeconomists printed money.
