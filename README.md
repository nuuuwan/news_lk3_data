Wind industry sources estimate island nation has 65 GW onshore potential

The recently released National Electricity Plan document of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) notes that India and Sri Lanka have agreed on the detailed project report (DPR) for building a transmission line between the two countries. This marks a significant milestone in a journey that traces back to 2002.

“Detailed project report (DPR) for the India-Sri Lanka grid interconnection, i.e, between New Madurai (India) and Mannar (Sri Lanka) 1000 MW VSC HVDC Bipole line, with HVDC terminals at both ends in two phases of 500 MW each, has been agreed,” the document says.

The idea was first proposed about 25 years ago. Several pre-feasibility studies were carried out between 2002 and 2011. In 2002, a company called NEXANT did the study with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In 2006, the Power Grid Corporation of India reviewed and updated the NEXANT study.

### What Trump’s victory means for Sri Lanka

*2024-11-08 06:00:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-Trump-s-victory-means-for-Sri-Lanka/4-768982) · `en`

Regardless of how Trump’s rule finally ends, there can be no doubt that it is the harbinger of a destructive conclusion to the global order

The victory of Donald Trump in the US Presidential election held on 5 November 2024, is likely to be a defining moment in our global epoch. Trump brought together the decades-long projects of the American oligarchy and reactionary social forces. He ran on the agenda of amplifying the darkest trends in the American polity. But while the spectre of his return rose, the Democratic leadership held onto a bankrupt vision for the future that resisted interrogation of the US empire.

### Building social security system in  Sri Lanka: For the many, and not the few

Almost 25% of the population appealed against their exclusion from Aswesuma, indicating their lack of trust in the social registry and,

Sri Lanka has a new President. One of his most important tasks will be to restore the trust of the nation’s citizens in the State. In recent decades, the public’s trust in the State has been severely damaged. Some people have paid their taxes yet, over recent years, have experienced a progressive decline in the quality of public services, while a small number of individuals have taken advantage of the State to enrich themselves. Without trust in the State, it will be impossible for any Government to build a strong, fair and prosperous nation in which no one is left behind.

### Digitalisation will fail, unless

*2024-11-08 05:38:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Digitalisation-will-fail-unless/4-768977) · `en`

Unless those responsible for Government digitalisation develop an alternative to the present broken procurement model, the great hopes that have been placed on digitalisation are unlikely to be realised

If there is anything everyone supports, it’s digitalisation of government. It’s seen as the panacea for all our ills: tax avoidance, corruption, inefficient agriculture… You name a problem, that is the answer, or at least part of the answer. We’ve been trying for over two decades but with meagre returns.

What lessons for a reset can be drawn from our successes and failures? This moment when Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya has agreed to serve as Chief Advisor on the Digital Economy is an opportunity for a reset.

Go back to mid 2022. Think of the queues. In some places, three parallel lines as far as the eye could see, with only one lane left for traffic. The first challenge was to get fuel. The second was to navigate roads blocked by fuel queues.

### The solution to national issues is essential for a joint operation between the government and other political parties

*2024-11-08 03:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/198148) · `ta`

Here's a 200-character summary:



National issues require joint government-party efforts. Corruption eradication is crucial. New government addresses corruption concerns, arresting former officials. Opposition criticism faces voter skepticism due to slow progress on promised reforms. Minority communities' support uncertain. Constitutional amendments depend on cooperation with opposition parties.

🟩

One of the most important promises of the national people's power was to end the corruption of corruption that has enslaved the country. It was the main reason for the party to have a great glamor on the party. Following the introduction of the open economy in the late 1970s, the government and the private sector have been embraced by the government and the private sector.

Massive development projects and foreign aid gave people the opportunity to engage in corruption. The economic downturn and the risk of people to experience as a result, tightened the commitment to eradicate corruption and eliminate those involved in it.. As a party that never had political power, the national people's power (among the leading parties) was free from corruption.

### Analysis Of NPP Plan To Develop Tamil Areas

Recently during the election campaign in Jaffna, president Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that he will settle the Tamil aspirations for autonomy through development. Whether this is an empty rhetoric or serious intent, will have to be seen in times to come. Probably he may be thinking of counterbalancing Tamil nationalism with economic prosperity, similar to that of Scotland and Quebec scenario and present position in Tamil Nadu. Idealistically northern province has to be developed on par with southern province, which has seen in recent years mega projects such as deep sea port, international airport, expressway, extension of railway and cricket stadium and several minor ones. Realistically this may not happen as firstly there are no resources, and secondly no willingness as focus is on southern electorate.
