    "In Paris, we were engaged in a busy round of talks, with appropriate officials of the Egyptian Embassy there and the company with which we had signed the contract. The ongoing discussions necessitated several telephone calls to Cairo. Both our Embassies in Paris and Cairo were very helpful, although not adequately staffed. Getting to a mutually satisfactory agreement was not easy and one had to keep one\u2019s nerve and not show that there was any hurry to get back. After a few days of discussions and telephone calls, including to Sri Lanka, we were finally able to reach a satisfactory agreement with both the French and the Egyptians.",
    "There was also a 7000-ton parcel of flour due from Holland, and we were mandated to go there as well. But with the assistance of my colleagues, I was able to get that contract cancelled over the telephone, without our having to go over there. This was a great relief. We now had to go back to Egypt for the formal signing of the agreements relating to their purchase of the flour. The necessary documents were signed in Paris as well, with the company. In between these discussions, I met the French Under Secretary for Co-operation and Bi-lateral Affairs of their Ministry of Agriculture. He spoke excellent English. We established a I i ne of communication for the future.",
    "All of us being in the beautiful city of Paris for the first time, also wanted to grab what opportunity we could to see something of the city and the surrounding areas. We managed to go up to the highest level of the Eiffel Tower, with its panoramic view. We went to the Louvre and viewed the magnificent paintings including \u201cThe Mona Lisa;\u201d the beautiful and historic Cathedral of Notre Dame, so much a part of French history; the Pompidou centre with its distinctive industrial/technological architecture, with huge pipes and conduits, like an engine room of a ship on a massive scale; and the famous church of Sacre Coeur or Sacred Heart.",
    "From the hill, where the Church stood one got another panoramic view of Paris. The surrounding areas were full of people, souvenir shops and numerous artists with a talent for painting and pencil portrait sketches. We enjoyed walking along the Champs Elysee and taking a close look at the Arc d\u201dTriomphe. Our friends in the Embassy thought that we should also have the experience of seeing Monmatre and The Pigalle by night. This was an area somewhat akin to Times Square in New York, Soho and Picadilly in London. and King\u2019s Cross in Sydney. The area was full of cabaret and floorshows, adult films, sex shops, numerous restaurants serving a variety of food and of course, ladies of the night.",
    "It was an exciting place of colour, people, light and movement. Finally, we succeeded in finding the time to go up and see the imposing and historic Palace of Versailles with its acres of beautiful gardens. Before we left Paris, we were hosted to lunch by the well-known sugar trading firm Sucden at King George V Hotel. Sucden and the Food Department had a fairly long history of commercial dealings and besides partaking of an excellent lunch, this gave us an opportunity of meeting some of their important and senior people and establishing that personal contact which is always useful in mutual dealings.",
    "Back in Egypt, we had to spend another three days at meetings, drafting and amending documents. We also negotiated a fair deal on the ultimate price. The Egyptians, the First Under , Secretary in particular were very fair and reasonable. The only problem was that the prevailing work ethic meant many delays and postponements. By our standards, the pace of work was leisurely, the keeping of appointments to time, at the best, exceptional, and an undertaking to call back fictional.",
    "We were amongst a charming, friendly people of a durable civilization, which had flowed for 5000 years in which an hour or two, or a day or two did not really matter in the least. Finally, before taking the plane home I spent almost a full day at the Embassy, dictating a report on the long and complicated dealings in the two countries. It had a number of annexures, including copies of signed agreements, which had to be meticulously checked. Everything had to be carefully drafted and assembled because the Minister was to place it before Cabinet.",
    "The opening of the Prima Flour Mill took place on the 30th of November 1980 in Trincomalee. Negotiations for constructing this mill had been the result of the first offer of foreign collaboration to the new United National party government of July 1977. Prima Singapore had been the first foreign investor to come up with an investment proposal to the government, and that too as the government was set up. President Jayewardene always remembered this. On one occasion when our Deputy Minister had raised in public some issues regarding one or two terms of the agreement with Prima, the President summoned me. He asked me whether it was true that the Deputy Minister had raised some questions. I replied diplomatically that he had raised a few matters relating to the interpretation of the agreement about which he sought clarification. \u201cHe was not criticizing the agreement,\u201d I added.",
    "`\u2019Tell him that if he wants any clarification, he can talk to me. I don\u2019t want him making any public statements. Tell him, in that case I will remove him!\u201d There was subdued anger in his tone. I said that I would advice the Deputy Minister accordingly. As I was leaving, President Jayewardene added, \u201cPlerls, these people were the first to come and tangibly express confidence in my government. I don\u2019t want to upset them.\u201d I went back and tactfully, but firmly advised the Deputy Minister.",
    "I did not mention the \u201cremoval\u201d part, because I knew that he had a fighting spirit, and it would have led to unnecessary complications. But I made sure that he understood the gravity of making any public statements on this issue. In fact, the agreement with Prima, which had been concluded and signed, before I became Secretary to the Food Ministry, had been signed on our side not by Secretary Food. but Secretary, Ministry of Planning, a Ministry which came directly under the President.",
    "Later, during the time of Dr. Wickrema Weerasooriya as Secretary to the Ministry of Plan Implementation, the responsibility for any issue regarding the interpretation of the agreement was given over to that Ministry. Still later, it came directly under the purview of the Presidential Secretariat. The Food Ministry only came into the picture for the purchase and shipment of wheat for the mill, and the taking over and the transport of the milled flour.",
    "The ceremonial opening of the mill itself was a grand affair, with Cabinet Ministers, Ambassadors and various foreign dignitaries participating. At the time it was completed it was said to be the biggest flour mill in the world under one single roof. It was an impressive facility built to the highest international standards, and possessing the highest quality Swiss flour milling machinery. It was evident that Prima wanted to burnish its corporate image with a high profile and visible showpiece. They therefore did not stint on their investment. I remember Mr. Cheng the Chairman of Prima telling me that their original estimate for the mill\u2019s construction was US$ 26 million, but that they ended up with a final bill of over 32 million US Dollars. This was due to an oil price hike in the international market, and a general rise in the price levels of machinery and equipment during the period under reference.",
    "In spite of these unforeseen difficulties, they did not reduce on any quality aspects. Talking to the Chairman it was clear that he had also invested a great deal of personal pride in building a facility to the highest international standards, and that his credibility with the President was very important to him. These views were shared by Mr. Primus Cheng, one of his sons, and who seemed obviously his principal confidant and alter ego. Interestingly, in one of these conversations, the elder Mr. Cheng said, \u201cLook we have had additional costs of over US Dollars 6 million to meet.",
    "But we were still able to build the mill on time, because we could take immediate decisions. If you in the government were faced with this kind of situation, you would have been accused of inefficiency and incompetence, and instead of finding out what really happened and taking decisions, much time would have been spent on arguments and accusations, which would have added to the costs.\u201d How true.",
    "We were in Trincomalee for two days, and made use of the opportunity to have discussions with our officers about the logistical arrangements in taking flour away from the mill. If the outflow was not smooth and continuous the stores in the mill would get clogged up, which would then affect the rate of milling and which in turn would affect the clearance of the silos with serious consequences for the discharge of the 40 to 50 thousand ton bulk carriers coming into the Prima jetty with wheat.",
    "Arrangements were made to remove the milled flour on a 24-hour basis by road, rail and coastal vessel. Special rail spur lines were built right upto the flour stores of the mill, so that railway waggons could be placed alongside the stores. All these and numerous other arrangements were reviewed during our visit for the opening. Prior to that too there had been many meetings as well as visits to Trincomalee. Particularly on such visits, officials also discuss their personal matters. This time one of the staff officers had a most unusual problem, which he wanted to discuss with me in confidence.",
    "It was obvious that he was quite disturbed in mind. He told me that his young son who was now beginning to speak, was mentioning the names of certain people and places, and gradually of certain relationships including references to his \u201cfather, mother and a brother and sister.\u201d At first, my officer and his wife had ignored these disconnected sayings. But when they persisted, gradually acquiring greater clarity, they had become both frightened and upset. They then had made discreet inquiries, to find to their amazement that places and persons mentioned had been correct, and as related by their child, a child mentioned by that name had died of an accident.",
    "My officer said that there was no way, that his child could have acquired any of the information mentioned. He was also quite small. The father was now worried that the story would get out and that the press and the public would beat a path to his door. He wanted to know what to do. I said that my guess was that the child would gradually forget these intense memories with the passage of time, and the best course would be to sensitively divert his attention and interests to the present. I also hoped that the story wouldn\u2019t leak out.",
    "In the end as happens in such cases, the child gradually reduced his references until within a year everything was forgotten. But this was my first experience, of hearing such a story of what appeared to be a previous birth at first-hand.",
