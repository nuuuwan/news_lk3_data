    "The Parliament Secretariat yesterday said that the House Committee, chaired by Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne, has decided to appoint a special committee to present proposals to enhance the safety of food and beverages in Parliament.",
    "At the request of the Speaker, a team of Public Health Inspectors (PHIs), led by the Medical Officer of Health, Battaramulla, conducted inspections last April of the kitchens and other locations within the Parliamentary premises related to the preparation of food and beverages. Accordingly, the PHIs submitted to the House Committee a detailed report inclusive of their observations.",
    "Expressing his views on this occasion, the Battaramulla Medical Health Officer Y.B. Indika stated that although food safety inspections had been carried out in approximately 150 State institutions within the Battaramulla area, this was the first time that such an inspection regarding the safety of food in Parliament had taken place. He further noted that a report of the inspection carried out on the procurement of raw materials, food production, storage, and serving processes in Parliament had been handed over to the Speaker.",
    "The Speaker had emphasised the necessity of ensuring the safety of food and beverages in Parliament, since they are provided to MPs, foreign diplomats, State officials, members of the security forces, and other staff. Accordingly, the Speaker noted that this committee will be appointed in order to prepare proposals to promptly address the shortcomings in the existing infrastructure facilities, as well as other issues prevailing in the food and beverages sector of Parliament.",
    "It was proposed that this committee should comprise the Medical Officer of Health in charge of the area, PHIs, and an engineer/architect with expertise in kitchen work from the State Engineering Corporation, Director of Catering and Housekeeping Services of Parliament, and Coordinating Engineer of Parliament.",
    "In addition, the House Committee also paid attention to matters concerning the service and maintenance activities of the official residences of MPs at Madiwela. The Speaker instructed the relevant officials to take steps to urgently resolve the existing shortcomings in this regard."
