National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) said yesterday that the recent actions taken by the Sri Lanka Customs Officers’ Union, including a two-day “sick leave” campaign and work-to-rule initiatives, have had profound implications across Sri Lanka’s business community, particularly affecting exporters and importers. It said these actions were initiated due to perceived grievances and unmet demands from the Customs Officers’ Union on various issues.

NCE President Jayantha Karunaratne highlighted the significant disruptions caused by these actions. He emphasised that the work-to-rule approach has resulted in substantial delays in clearing imported goods at ports and checkpoints, causing disruptions in production schedules and logistical operations. These delays have particularly impacted exporters, who face stringent deadlines to fulfil international orders, leading to strained relationships with overseas buyers and potential financial penalties for missed deliveries.

Foreign Minister Ali Sabri confirmed that the presidential election in Sri Lanka will occur before October 17, adhering to constitutional requirements. Despite past delays, such as the 1981 referendum-induced postponement, elections have generally been conducted on time since 1931. The 19th Amendment reduced the presidential term to five years but didn't address the 83(b) clause, which could potentially affect future elections. The government is prepared for the upcoming election, highlighting achievements like uninterrupted power supply, increased tourism, higher public servant salaries, and enhanced dollar presence, assuring voters of a fair and timely process.

🟩

We are ready for the election. Foreign Minister Alisabri said the presidential election would be held before October 17, according to the Constitution.

He was speaking at the debate on the Motion on the Motion of the House on Thursday (11) in Parliament.

Whatever shortcomings in Sri Lanka, it is a country that has been continuously using the voting rights since 1931. Elections have been held in the country in a timely manner. Elections were not held in a timely manner. The election was postponed by the referendum in 1981. In this case, the election cannot be held.

The President's term of office was reduced to 5 years in the 19th Amendment of the Constitution. However in 83 (b) string is not mentioned in it. The idea has been brought to the cabinet to replace it. There is no need to doubt the presidential election. The election will be held before October 17.

### Is excessive board interference killing executive spirit?

Management’s role is to manage, and the board’s role is to oversee without killing the innovative spirit of management

Whilst in law, and on paper, a board is superior in rank to management, it is important that a board must never make the management feel inferior. Directors and executives must cohabit on a platform of collaboration, trust, and respect. The board-management relationship must be positioned as a value creating partnership where the board is humble in displaying some subservience to management’s technical, functional, and integrating expertise in running the company and the management appreciates the board’s advisory, guidance, governance, and oversight roles in increasing stakeholder value. A shared vision is vital and will result in management accepting the board’s untethered authority over selected aspects of the company

In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs

The EU and the US disburse significant amounts of money under the banner of doing good, and often mandate local partners with no subject matter expertise to drive programs on mental and sexual health, child welfare, nutrition and employee rights that do more damage than good to the future of our nation. When these are married to local individuals and organisations that give scant regard to the nation, its people and future; the outcomes can be perilous

The European Union and the US are amongst preferred export destinations, but winning buyers from these markets do not come easy. In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs. Hypocrisy and geo-political powerplay is rife, but cracks are slowly but surely beginning to show.

### Change, system or the people?

*2024-07-12 01:02:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-system-or-the-people/4-764161) · `en`

Whether a nation with this record can find the balance after a summersault of an attempted system change, only history will tell

From 1948, it has been an endless series of missteps, reflecting a national temperament which urges the path of backwardness and poor productivity. The emphasis was not on becoming a stronger or a wealthier nation, but on a hazy idea that all our ills are due to the nastiness of the system, there is this wealth somewhere in the country which should be distributed equally! A system must be created that feeds all the braggarts and the laggards (our Parliamentarians have already done this by voting in all kinds of benefits for themselves!)

A spectre is haunting Sri Lanka – the spectre of the NPP/JVP.

All powers of old Sri Lanka have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: A President without a popular mandate, a Government lacking credibility, political parties with tired faces, and businessmen with dark histories.

### Questions over the term of the President

Unsurprisingly the SC has dismissed the Fundamental Rights petition requesting the Supreme Court to hold that the President has a term of six years, in limine. Reportedly, the SC has found no merit in the petition.

If the term of office of the President had been interpreted to be six years, as the petitioner had sought, it would no doubt have been expressly in violation of the Constitutional provisions, limiting the President’s term to five years, introduced by the 19th Amendment.

What the petitioner had pleaded for was sort of a judicial review of post-enactment legislation by the Supreme Court, a power which the SC is not vested with under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It could hardly be surmised that the SC could arrogate to itself a power that is not vested in it by invoking any other doctrines of law, including inherent jurisdiction. However, the power of interpretation of the Constitution that lies with the SC is a power that it can use as it may deem fit.
