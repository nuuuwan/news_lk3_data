    "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has played a pivotal role by providing continuous loan disbursements, even after Sri Lanka declared a debt standstill decision due to the economically challenging situation the Ministry said.",
    "\u201cThis assistance enabled (us) to achieve the significant progress of the development projects without any hindrances of implementation. Moreover, the loans extended by (the) Saudi Fund for Development were provided on concessionary terms by offering the relief to the country\u2019s overall debt burden,\u201d it said in a statement.",
    "The agreements were signed on Monday and a total restructured amount was Saudi Riyal (SAR) 516,95 million.",
    "Treasury Secretary Harshana Suriyapperuma\u00a0 signed the agreements on behalf of Sri Lanka while Sultan Abdulrahaman A Almarshad, the Chief Executive Officer of the SFD signed the agreements for the SFD.",
