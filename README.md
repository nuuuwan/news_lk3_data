### Sri Lanka inflation rise only 3.3-pct over 21-months to June 2024

*2024-06-29 10:18:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-inflation-rise-only-3-3-pct-over-21-months-to-june-2024-170208/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation rose 3.3 percent over 21 months from October 22 when monetary stability was reached, data from the state statistics office showed with 12-month inflation at 1.7 percent.

However, it also highlights the failures of Sri Lanka’s cricket management to recognize and nurture homegrown talent.

### Due to the status of repayment of the loan, Sri Lanka will benefit from $ 17 billion - Ali Sabri

*2024-06-29 00:23:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187224) · `ta`

Sri Lanka, through successful debt restructuring with bilateral lenders including India, Japan, France, and ongoing negotiations with China, expects to gain around $17 billion. This achievement paves the way for favorable outcomes in talks for international bailouts, aiming to reduce its total debt to 95% of its GDP and lower foreign loan interest by 4.5% of GDP.

🟩

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said Sri Lanka would benefit from $ 17 billion benefit from the success of the debt reproductive process with bilateral credit providers.

The Minister added that the situation will help you succeed in negotiations on international bailouts.

Minister Ali Sabri said this at a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Center today (28).

“On April 12, 2022, Sri Lanka decided to suspend a certain amount of foreign loans. Some accused the rupee of Rs 600, 700, 1000 against the US dollar. But we controlled that situation.

In a contract with the International Monetary Fund, we were told to restructure the loan. For that, Lazart was appointed as our representative and Clipart Hans for legal matters. In the meantime, we first took steps to rebuild the domestic debt.It is noteworthy that despite such activities, we have been working as a country to pay off the debts of multi -regions.

### What are the solutions to the challenges facing the Sri Lankan tea that the dollar brings?

*2024-06-29 00:15:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187223) · `ta`

The challenges faced by Sri Lanka's tea industry are multifaceted, involving both internal and external factors. Here are the key challenges:



1. **Declining Production**: Over the years, Sri Lanka's tea production has significantly decreased from 340 million kg to around 250 million kg annually. This decline is attributed to various factors, including lack of investment in high-yield crops, inefficient use of government-provided land, and a shift towards employing temporary rather than permanent workers.



2. **Low Productivity**: The productivity of plantation companies is low, partly because of inadequate investment in modern farming techniques and technologies. Dr. Chandra Bose highlights that 30% of the land allocated for tea cultivation remains unused, indicating inefficiencies in land management and utilization.



3. **Shift to Temporary Workers**: A significant portion of the workforce has transitioned from permanent to temporary employment, leading to early retirement and reduced commitment to the industry. This shift has negatively impacted the stability and efficiency of the workforce.



4. **Economic Crisis**: The broader economic crisis in Sri Lanka has exacerbated the challenges faced by the tea industry. Rising costs of living and inflation have made it difficult for workers to afford even the current wages, let alone any increases. The increase in poverty levels, especially among plantation communities, underscores the urgency of addressing wage issues.



5. **Market Competition and Global Trends**: The global demand for tea has seen a decline, affecting Sri Lanka's export earnings. Changes in consumer preferences and competition from other tea-producing countries have also played a role in reducing Sri Lanka's market share.



6. **Government Focus and Legislation**: Criticisms have been raised regarding the Ministry of Plantation Industries' priorities, with allegations that it favors plantation owners over workers and fails to promote the growth and development of plantation companies effectively. The legacy of colonial-era laws and structures, such as the Labour Ordinance and the Plantation Human Development Fund, while intended to protect workers, have also been identified as areas needing reform to better address contemporary challenges.



7. **Proposed Solutions and Challenges**: Suggestions for converting workers into small plantation owners aim to address wage issues and empower workers economically. However, implementing such changes requires significant restructuring of the industry, including land redistribution, provision of capital, and support services. This approach faces practical and logistical challenges, including resistance from existing plantation owners and the need for substantial government intervention and funding.



Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive strategies that balance the interests of workers, plantation owners, and the broader economy. This includes investing in agricultural research and technology, improving working conditions and wages, reevaluating land use policies, and exploring innovative models of ownership and participation in the tea industry.

🟩

In 1972, the then government governmentization of all the gardens.Until 1992, the government held tea plantations.In 1992, the government leased these gardens to private companies.The private sector has been running the gardens for the past 32 years. About 22 private companies are currently leasing these tea plantations in Sri Lanka and about one lakh workers.The government is also running a few more companies. A government agency runs plantations in the name of People's Plantation Development Board. Similarly, the state of Elkaduwa Plantation on behalf of the state also manages gardens.The government runs a plantation company in the name of the Sri Lanka Plantation Joint Corporation.Under these three state agencies, there are 8000 workers.

According to statistics of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, the world's tea production has been increased for some years. Tea production has increased by 3.2 percent.By 2022, the world produced 6.7 million tonnes of tea.

*2024-06-29 00:07:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187222) · `ta`

The citizenry vote for politicians in the vain hope that ‘this time there will be change for the better’ – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Despite the critical engagement of scholars and other writers in the mainstream media attempting to introduce leadership models with countervailing themes such as plurality, inclusiveness, sensitivity, empathy, acute self-knowledge and other ‘softer’ attributes, the essence of political leadership in Sri Lanka in the intervening decade and a half after the end of the so-called ‘ethnic war’ has seen a hardening of positions

As Sri Lanka gears up for elections later this year, people of voting age would do well to gird their loins against being gulled again into casting their ballots unwisely for those whom we call our ‘leaders’.

In the past we’ve voted repeatedly for crooks, charlatans, the incompetent, the corrupt, and the utterly unrepentant of their litany of crimes.

### The responsibility of announcing the bankruptcy of Sri Lanka is not of international financial standards- Minister Ali Sabri responds to opposition parties

Sri Lanka's External Affairs Minister Ali Sabri responded to opposition criticisms about the country's debt repayment capacity, stating that international financial standards do not dictate the announcement of its bankruptcy. He emphasized that the government would disclose its recovery status rather than relying on external assessments. Sabri urged opposition parties to base their criticisms on accurate information, highlighting a $17 billion profit from bilateral credit restructuring as evidence of economic resilience.

🟩

International Financial Retariting Companies reveal the level of Sri Lanka's debt re -payment capacity development. On the contrary, it will not be revealed whether or not. External Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said the opposition parties should know this and present criticism.

He further stated at the media conference held at the Presidential Media Center on Friday (28).

On April 12, 2022, we announced that we cannot repay a sum of international debt. The Sri Lankan government announced this. Rather than foreign financing companies. Similarly, we will announce whether Sri Lanka is recovering from that situation. International financial standards will reveal the level of Sri Lanka's debt re -enactment capacity.

Opposition parties that spread bogus ideas among the people should understand this and then present criticism. We have received a profit of $ 17 billion as bilateral credit restructuring has been reached. This is a huge strength for our economy.
