    "In an effort to drive sustainable energy initiatives in Sri Lanka, Huawei recently organised a key conference titled \u2018Unleashing the Potential of a Sustainable Energy Future\u2019 in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and the Solar Industries Association (SIA).",
    "The event served as a dynamic platform for industry experts to share profound insights, fostering discourse on critical topics to drive the sector\u2019s evolution, with over 300 prominent renewable energy invitees.",
    "The objective of organising this platform was not only to create a platform for businesses, industries, and Government industries to collaborate and share ideas, but also to assist Sri Lanka in meeting its 2030 green energy vision.",
    "SLSEA Chairman Engineer Ranjith Sepala delivered the opening keynote speech on the challenges and opportunities in the 2024 renewable energy landscape. He emphasised the SLSEA\u2019s determination to overcome obstacles in order to meet the Government\u2019s target of 70% renewable energy by 2030.",
    "He also said that if the 70% renewable energy target is met by 2030, the demand for renewable energy will necessitate the investment of $ 8 billion in generation and $ 3 billion in transmission.",
    "\u201cHuawei is an important player in Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable energy sector, and I must thank Huawei and other collaborative organisations for this wonderful event. I hope that in the future, coal will power base load, and that in ten years, renewable energy will power base load. Now is the time to get ready because there are numerous opportunities for investors and developers to participate in this framework,\u201d he explained.",
    "Meanwhile, Professor Asanka Rodrigo of the University of Moratuwa echoed sentiments on the future trajectory of renewable energy, emphasising the inevitability of smart grids and the consumer\u2019s role evolving into a \u2018prosumer.\u2019",
    "Distinguished speakers such as Sri Lanka Standard Institution Deputy Director Engineering Hasitha Karunarathna, SLSEA Director General J. M. Athula, SIA President Engineer Asanka Tennakoon, SLSEA Project Coordinating Officer Padmadewa Samaranayake, and Professor Lidula Widanagama Arachchige at Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa collectively addressed various pivotal aspects of the industry, from regulatory standards to microgrid adaptation and best practices in the solar sector.",
    "The conference concluded with a resounding call for collective action, emphasising the vital function of technology, regulation, and collaborative efforts in steering Sri Lanka toward a greener, more sustainable future."
