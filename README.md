“I feel strongly indignant at the statements made by senior Israeli government officials that appear to categorically reject the very notion of Palestinian state-building,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.

“For our country, the question is not whether to recognise a Palestinian state, but when. The continued unilateral actions by the government of Israel can never be accepted,” he said.

“I must state clearly that if further actions are taken that obstruct the realisation of a two-state solution, Japan will be compelled to take new measures in response,” he added.

### Asia-Pacific issuers to have bumpy ride as trade strains hit: S&P Global Ratings report

SINGAPORE (S&P Global Ratings) Sept. 24, 2025 — Asia-Pacific’s credit conditions are keeping steady, after strong first-half growth and supportive financing conditions. However, the road ahead looks bumpy. That’s according to a report S&P Global Ratings published today, titled “Credit Conditions Asia-Pacific Q4 2025: On A Jagged Course.”

The “frontloading” of exports and resilient domestic consumption have supported the region’s growth in 2025. However, slower trade will start materializing in fourth-quarter 2025 as effects of tariffs start to unfold. Consequently, we expect Asia-Pacific’s growth to slow to 4.4% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026.

This combined with other risks could lead to reversals in market sanguinity and easy financing conditions.
