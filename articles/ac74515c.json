    "Laws are said to fall silent in times of war, but in this country, they fall silent even when the ruling party politicians go on the offensive to further their interests. The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) has complained that a group of JVPers who grabbed its party office in Yakkala, the other day, by attacking its members and driving them away, continues to occupy it, under police protection. In the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s barbaric attack on the FSP office and its workers, the JVP members produced a document calling it a court order confirming that the place belonged to their party. If so, they should have invoked the jurisdiction of that particular court to have the FSP activists evicted from the disputed building. They have committed a serious offence by taking upon themselves the task of carrying out a court order.",
    "The government may have thought Tuesday\u2019s incident would fizzle out, but the FSP is determined to keep the issue alive and takes it up at every forum, calling upon the police to act impartially, without going out of their way to curry favour with the JVP-led government. There is much more to the Yakkala dispute than a clash between the JVP and its erstwhile comrades in the FSP; it can be considered a foretaste of how the JVP is going to consolidate its power.",
    "One may recall that the police acted differently when two factions of the SLFP clashed over their party office at Darley Road in April 2024. The police sealed the place immediately, denying access to anyone, on the pretext of conducting an investigation. They did not act impartially, but they at least did not let either faction gain access to the party office, albeit temporarily.",
    "IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya never misses an opportunity to wax eloquent on what he calls the new-found independence of the police. But the manner in which the police are protecting the interests of the JVP at the expense of the FSP has belied his claim and proved that the police grovel before government leaders of their own volition. The police have demonstrated once again that they have no sense of shame and do not scruple to be at the beck and call of those in power.",
    "The deployment of police personnel and making other arrangements to guard a building seized by the ruling party amounts to a misuse of state resources, for the JVP politicians who descended on the FSP office and grabbed it obviously took the law into their own hands. So, in the final analysis, the police are using their resources to defend an unlawful act committed by the JVP. The police bigwigs responsible for providing security to the place may be held answerable one day.",
    "They should bear in mind that IGP Weerasooriya\u2019s immediate predecessor, Deshabandu Tennakoon, is now facing legal action against his allegedly arbitrary actions during the previous government. Those who are violating the law at the behest of the government at present should learn from Tennakoon\u2019s predicament.",
    "Unless the police act on the FSP\u2019s complaint against the JVP, over the Yakkala attack and property grab, and ensure that justice is served, they will set a very bad precedent; hereafter, those who win court cases concerning property matters may want to emulate the JVP and resort to violence. What the JVP has done in Yakkala is also antithetical to the new political culture it promised to usher in under an NPP government. If it is true that the FSP had occupied the disputed building for 13 or 14 years unlawfully until last Tuesday, when it was driven out, and a court has ruled in the JVP\u2019s favour, the government can have the dispute settled through judicial means, with the police acting impartially.",
    "Politicians\u2019 scruples fall by the wayside when power goes to their heads, and the governments they represent careen downhill like juggernauts before ending up in disaster. This, we have seen over the last several decades.",
