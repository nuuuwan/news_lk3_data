  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara has sent a Letter of Demand (LOD) to Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) Chairperson Kosala Wickramasinghe seeking Rs. 1 billion in damages for allegedly defamatory remarks made against him related to the South Korean E8 visa system.",
    "Nanayakkara has claimed that Wickramasinghe, during a recent media interview, implied his involvement in financial fraud linked to the visa system, causing significant harm to his political and personal reputation.",
    "In addition to the LOD, Nanayakkara has also urged Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath to investigate the allegations. In his letter to the Foreign Minister, he categorically denied any wrongdoing and stated that these accusations have caused severe reputational damage.",
    "The controversy follows SLBFE\u2019s recent revelation that several complaints had been received regarding persons defrauding money by falsely promising jobs under the South Korean E8 visa category. Nanayakkara has denied any connection to such activities, calling the accusations baseless and demanding accountability. A CID investigation is also ongoing."
