    "COLOMBO (News 1st); At a time where the government of Sri Lanka is facing major criticism from various factions for its proposed Broadcast Authority Regulatory Act, the Criminal Investigation Department and the Financial Crime Division summoned two social media activists, for inquiries on Tuesday (04).",
    "Activist Tharindu Uduwaragedara, who owns the YouTube channel Satahan Radio, was summoned to the CID to record a statement with regard to the comments he made over the arrest of Nathasha Edirisooriya, who was remanded for controversial comments she had made.",
    "\"I commented on the nature of the arrest, and the conduct of the media. I have been summoned to the CID for that,\" said Uduwaragedara.",
    "The social media activist stated that over the past few decades, the country has seen patterns of governance, where the rulers always incite the people using lies and racism, and thereafter drag the country into an abyss.",
    "\"The people started to understand that group via YouTube videos. According to the present government, there is no greater crime than speaking. The Anti Terrorism Act relates to expression. They have also appointed a committee to introduce laws against religious defamation,\" added Uduwaragedara.",
    "The social media activist, speaking to media, said that the government wants to introduce a Broadcasting Regulatory Act, and that document was leaked to the media.",
    "He added that the government is trying to introduce new laws for contempt of court, as well as social media regulation.",

    "\"They say that I sold this channel. The previous channel I worked for was SL VLOG. Some say it belongs to me. It does not belong to me. Our PR is here to show the list of directors,\" Handungoda said, speaking to the media, following his appearance at the Financial Crime Division.",
    "It is also noteworthy that Dharshana Handungoda was arrested on the 5th of February 2023, over posting controversial views on social media platforms.",

    "Amidst a slew of arrests and interrogations being carried out on journalists and social media activists in Sri Lanka, questions are being raised by various factions as to whether the media freedom of Sri Lanka is under threat once again, similar to the dark era in Sri Lankan history where multiple journalists were killed, assaulted, or disappeared."
