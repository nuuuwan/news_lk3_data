ஆசியக் கிண்ணத் தொடரில் சம்பியனான இந்தியா, பாகிஸ்தானின் உள்துறை அமைச்சர் மொஷின் நக்வியிடமிருந்து கிண்ணத்தை வாங்க மறுத்திருந்தது.

பாகிஸ்தான் கிரிக்கெட் சபையினதும், ஆசிய கிரிக்கெட் சபையினதும் தலைவர் நக்வி என்பது குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.

போட்டி முடிந்து ஒன்றரை மணித்தியாலம் தாமதமாக பரிசளிப்பு ஆரம்பமான நிலையில், மேடையிலிருந்த விருந்தினர்களிடமிருந்து குல்தீப் யாதவ், அபிஷேக் ஷர்மா, திலக் வர்மா ஆகியோர் தனிநபர் விருதுகளை வாங்கியிருந்த நிலையில், நக்வி இவர்களைப் பாராட்டியிருக்காததோடு, அவர்களும் இவரைக் கண்டு கொள்ளவில்லை.

மேடையில் கிண்ணம் இருப்பது போல் பாவனை செய்து இந்திய வீரர்களும், பயிற்சியாளர் குழாமும் கொண்டாடியிருந்தனர்.

Facing increasing isolation abroad and mounting pressure at home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will defend his intention to “finish the job” in Gaza when he meets US President Donald Trump on Monday (Sep 29).

The meeting comes days after Trump unveiled a 21-point plan aimed at ending the war in the Palestinian territory during discussions with Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

On Sunday, Trump hinted at “something special” to come in Middle East talks, adding in a post on his Truth Social platform: “WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!”

On Friday, Trump had told reporters in Washington “I think we have a deal” on Gaza, even as Netanyahu, speaking at the UN, vowed to “finish the job” in Israel’s war against Hamas.

But experts told AFP that Netanyahu appeared to be cornered, facing growing international and domestic calls to end the war.

### Your right to know: Why journalism and access to information matter more than ever

*2025-09-29 06:18:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Your-right-to-know-Why-journalism-and-access-to-information-matter-more-than-ever/14-782311) · `en`

Access to public information is an important resource for journalists, just as

journalists are essential vectors for enabling citizens to access information

Today is both World News Day and the International Day for Universal Access to Information – a good time to remember that if we lose our fundamental universal right to access to information, and if independent journalists lose the ability to report the facts, then our rights and democracies may vanish entirely.

Access to information is a fundamental human right empowering us all to make informed decisions, to participate in democratic processes, and hold our leaders accountable. It’s also critical for survival in a host of situations.

### Cultivating circular futures: Youth as agents of change

*2025-09-29 06:03:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Cultivating-circular-futures-Youth-as-agents-of-change/4-782305) · `en`

Empowering young people to lead in circular food systems generates ripple effects across communities, policies, and markets

On 29 September, the world marks the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste, highlighting one of humanity’s pressing paradoxes. As the global population nears 8.5 billion by 2030, we still waste 1.3 billion tonnes of food annually – enough to feed three billion people. Sri Lanka is no exception. This crisis calls for urgent action, and increasingly, young people are emerging as catalysts for change.

The traditional “take-make-use-discard” model has proved unsustainable. A shift toward circular approaches – refuse, regenerate, reuse, and redesign – is gaining global momentum. At the heart of this transformation lies a simple truth: when young people embrace circular principles, they can reshape communities and inspire wider system change.

### COPE, oversight, and boundaries of power: Necessary caution

Strengthening COPE should mean better research support, stronger audit collaboration, and continuous capacity

As someone who has been privileged to represent all three critical domains of the COPE process — as a Chairman of a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE), a Secretary of a Ministry, and as a Chair of COPE — I feel a strong sense of responsibility to express my concerns about the recent proposal put forward under Standing Order 137 by the current COPE Chair, Dr. Nishantha Samaraweera, MP (NPP).

The motion seeks to amend Standing Order 120, granting COPE the authority to directly refer its findings to law enforcement bodies such as the IGP or the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). While I appreciate the spirit of accountability that underpins the proposal, I must stress — with the full weight of my experience — that such a reform must be approached with great care, constitutional awareness, and institutional intelligence.

Tax revenues grew to 3,068.5 billion rupees, from 2,348.5 billion rupees and current spending also grew by a double-digit 11.2 percent to 3,381 billion rupees.

Sri Lanka has public sector bloated by unemployed graduates and salaries eat up a large volume of taxes, though nominal wage levels fell after recent currency crises and they now have to be increased. A salary hike was given this year.

Central bank wages have been steeply increased amid criticism as it was responsible for high level of inflation and open market operations, which critics hold out as the height of unaccountability.

Ramalingam Chandrasekhar, a member of the party's executive committee and minister, said the Gajendra team was muddy on us, saying that the sacrificial torch of Dileepan's commemoration on the last day of the pamphlets and the national people's power had nothing to do.

Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekhar made this statement while speaking to the media in Jaffna on Sunday (28).

Dileepan Memorial has been held for the past one week. Was blocked when we went to perform the observance there. After that a few days ago, the last day of memory ended. It was reported that someone had distributed pamphlets on that day and that the Gajendra team had dealt with their violence against him, and some others who had gone to hear justice.

The incident has nothing to do with the national people's power. There is no contribution in this. We don't have that downstream work. As a ruling party, we can take a different way if we want to take up the little ones. We do not do that iconic work.

### The road to safety: One man’s eight-year fight against mechanical negligence

*2025-09-28 23:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-road-to-safety-one-mans-eight-year-fight-against-mechanical-negligence/) · `en`

Calls for political will needed to stop the silent slaughter

Nine lives are extinguished daily, a tragedy often silently attributed to mechanical failures that a proper vehicle inspection could prevent. For eight years, Tokyo-based entrepreneur Sajeev Rajaputhra has carried the burden of this truth, tirelessly advocating for a modern Roadworthiness Inspection System (MOT).

Rajaputhra, an automobile expert, saw the crisis not just as a national shame but as a personal call to action. His solution was comprehensive: a high-tech Public-Private Partnership (PPP) leveraging Japanese expertise, automated inspection lanes, blockchain, and AI – a system requiring zero government funds, designed to eliminate the alleged corruption that plagues current emissions checks.
