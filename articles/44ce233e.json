    "Ratnayake highlighted that the turnout at the event reflected the country\u2019s solidarity with Palestine. He reaffirmed that the new Government, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, will continue to recognise Palestine as a free and sovereign State, working in alignment with established United Nations policies.",
    "The event saw participation from prominent figures, including Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, religious leaders, diplomats, and other distinguished guests. Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Chairperson Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, speaking at the event, drew attention to the increasing death toll in Palestine as reported by global media.",
    "\u201cThe calls of organisations such as the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the Human Rights Commission (HRC), which exist to protect smaller nations like ours, are not being heeded,\u201d he said.",
    "He emphasised that if a small country like Sri Lanka were to face a fate similar to Palestine, it would be crucial for these organisations and the global community to unite and work together."
