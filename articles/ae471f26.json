    "Dr. Rathnayake expressed his willingness to provide a confidential statement during a court session on Saturday, where the case over the procurement, supply, and distribution of the controversial medicine was taken up. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Dr. Rathnayake on Friday evening after recording his statement for over seven hours.",

The Magistrate granted permission for the move and ordered the suspect to appear before the Court on 4 March to provide the confidential statement.",
    "The Deputy Solicitor General requested the Court to name Dr. Rathnayake as the 10th suspect in the case, alleging misappropriation of Government funds.",

This act resulted in the misappropriation of a staggering Rs. 2 billion of State funds.",
