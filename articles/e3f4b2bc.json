    "The All Employees\u2019 Union of the Ceylon Electricity Board staged a protest outside its headquarters causing heavy traffic congestion along Sir Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mawatha in Colombo yesterday \u2013 Pic by Pradeep Pathirana",
    "Heavy traffic congestion was reported along Sir Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mawatha in Colombo yesterday, after Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) workers staged a demonstration opposite the CEB headquarters. The protest, which blocked one lane between the Lake House roundabout and Slave Island, disrupted evening traffic and forced police to advise motorists to take alternate routes.",
    "The demonstration was part of an escalating trade union campaign against the Government\u2019s plan to restructure the CEB into four entities. Large numbers of workers carrying placards gathered outside the CEB Head Office, shouting slogans and obstructing traffic for several hours.",
    "The protest follows a series of trade union actions launched earlier this month. Unions began a work-to-rule campaign on 4 September, refusing duties beyond their core responsibilities. As part of the second phase, employees called in sick on 17 September, continuing the action into a second day yesterday.",
    "Union leaders warned that measures would intensify if the authorities fail to respond to their demands.",
    "The CEB Engineers\u2019 Union has also opposed the move, arguing that dividing the State utility risks undermining its stability. Trade unions said their actions are aimed at pressuring the Government without directly disrupting electricity supply to consumers."
