    "Blackpool Coffee Entrepreneur Asitha Jayasinghe said: \u201cRegeneration can come only through a change of heart in the individual. And the daily coffee intake of an individual will directly enhance their capacity for self-development of themselves. We are glad that it was possible to introduce our products to a whole new market through the community event held at the Barefoot. It was seen that the audience visiting our stall were the perfect customers that our products seek, and we were able to have a good onsite sale and also built some solid relationships with customers for the long term. We thank the GLX team for organising and facilitating the event which helped our company at its best.\u201d",
    "The Road to Regen is supported by the \u2018Support to Small and Medium Enterprises in the Organic Agriculture Sector\u2019 program is the Multi-Donor Action (MDA) jointly co-financed by the European Union (EU) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The MDA is carried out as part of the \u2018Small and Medium Sector Enterprise Development Program\u2019 implemented by GIZ Sri Lanka."
