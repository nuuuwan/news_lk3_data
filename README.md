“We expect the envisaged loan-book growth to support NTB’s impaired (stage 3) loans ratio improvement over the medium term alongside economic stabilisation, but risks to asset quality are likely as new loans season,” Fitch said.

### Ranil’s Tamil Nadu obsession, comparative Anura-Sajith progressivisms, and North-East solutions

“…key growth drivers along with greater integration with giant and prospering neighbour India. With regard to the latter, he [Wickremesinghe] singled out land connectivity between Sri Lanka and burgeoning South India as a critical development.”

Whatever the outcome, a Kamala Harris presidential run will have a powerful positive impact on the consciousness of Asian (especially South Asian) women and girls, and on women and girls of colour throughout the world, thereby acting as a progressive factor in history.

I hope Vice-President Harris picks Senator Bernie Sanders as her running-mate because Republican JD Vance is a formidable aspirant Veep with a compelling story. The US Democratic party establishment will probably block Bernie, though he is faring very well in public opinion polls.

### SOERU and insulation it provides against bad privatisations

*2024-07-25 03:49:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/SOERU-and-insulation-it-provides-against-bad-privatisations/14-764710) · `en`

For decades, Sri Lanka’s SOEs have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and a lack of transparency. Apart from the burden on the public purse, the consequences for citizens have included substandard medicines to exploding gas cylinders. Over the past 20 years vested interests have mushroomed around SOEs.

The opposition to privatisation in Sri Lanka stems from a mixture of ideology and vested interests. On the ideological front, there’s a lingering sentiment, rooted in post-independence nationalism, that views state ownership as a bulwark against foreign exploitation. This perspective sees SOEs not just as economic entities, but as symbols of national sovereignty and social welfare, regardless of how well these entities actually serve the purpose for which they were set up.

### Forty-one years after ‘83 July do prez candidates have answers for “TNQ”?

The continuing lack of a political leadership in the Sinhala South that accepts the Tamil and Muslim people as equals and as citizens with equal rights and dignity, is what denies a decent political solution to the TNQ

The Sinhala South and its leaders cannot for a moment leave all responsibility with Tamil leaders for all these sectarian and extremist developments that make solutions more and more difficult. Political leaders in Sinhala South even now avoid discussing political answers to post-war issues in North-East and for their long-standing issue of sharing political power. Everything belted out on Southern Sinhala political platforms are issues for Sinhala-Buddhist consumption, no different to Sinhala-Buddhist politics of Black July, 41 years ago. No political leader in the South can be heard here in the South saying his or her political party would negotiate power sharing for Sri Lanka with Tamil and Muslim political parties

Successive regimes unsuccessfully tried to bury what happened during the war – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

A reconciled society respects and champions the rights of all citizens. Identifying issues that need to be addressed when working towards reconciliation becomes crucial. Achieving a just, equitable society requires equal life opportunities for all, regardless of anyone’s background.Effective reconciliation demands enlightened leaders addressing past crimes and rights violations. It transcends political classes, requiring genuine commitment

In Sri Lanka, fear is pervasive. Suppression of media and fundamental rights of people and repression of human rights defenders foster a climate of fear, silencing victims, and inhibiting reconciliation.

Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry

Imagine a fruit so versatile it can mimic the taste and texture of pulled pork and shredded chicken, so sustainable it thrives with minimal resources, and so nutritious it’s a powerhouse of vitamins and minerals.

Introduced to Sri Lanka by Arthur V. Dias, during the British colonial era, when rice scarcity threatened starvation, the jackfruit emerged as a crucial source of sustenance, with its rich carbohydrates and natural fats providing much-needed energy. This lifesaving role later earned the title “Rice Tree”.

🟩

On July 27, 1983, I decided to write a quarter at the refugee of the Air Force Air Force.

It was only after I saw thousands of Tamils ​​who lost their homes as an unexpected violence that had been unleashed on the morning of Monday 25th, and I decided to record the events in the quarter.

Many people lost their loved ones, and many were killed by Sinhalese.

I begin this diary with the firm belief that someday the people who call themselves Sinhalese Buddhists can someday be carried to the civilized world or somebody.

I am going to inform you about the things that took place at this camp and my personal experiences before sheltering at the Ratmalana Airport.

I am going to share their experiences with other refugees in this camp.

I went to my office in Maharagama. I went to the bus station on the road.

He said this at a press conference held at the Front of the People's Struggle

To this day we have regret that our political issues have been resolved to this day, as they are born in the North East and have been very badly met with the oppression of the North East.

Today, the Tamil people were killed in the capital of 1983, especially in 1983, without any science.

How many thousands of murders, violence and disappearance have been committed against the Tamil people.

At this time, how many parties from the South are coming north, they will say something about what they are going to give to the Tamil people, and they will say something else in the South.

There, Sinhala politicians continue to adhere to racism and the tactic for voting here.

DFCC’s net loans in total assets inched up to 56.9% by end-1Q24 from 54.1% in 2023, reversing a contracting trend since 2021 (74.9%), reflecting early signs of lending resumption, the rating agency said.

*2024-07-24 15:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189252) · `ta`

Lalith Ellawala, an opposition member, criticized the suspension of road development in Adulugama despite relocating Muslim residents without compensation. He urged quick development to honor their sacrifice, highlighting the impact on education and pedestrian safety. Minister Prasanna Ranatunga responded, stating the Asian Development Bank had suspended a loan installment due to a proposed rule under the Thousand Kilometer Road Development Program.

🟩

The road development has been suspended even though the Muslim people have been removed from their home and walls without any compensation for the development of Atulugama Road.

Opposition member Lalith Ellawala said that steps should be taken to quickly develop the road to honor the sacrifice of the people.

During the question of the oral answer in Parliament on Wednesday (24), the Bay of clarification was stated.

It is reported that the Muslim people of the area have been given the opportunity to remove their homes and safety walls for the development of the Atulugama Vidakama Road.. If this happens, this is a huge injustice to the dedication of the Muslim people of the area.

Only the Adulugama Muslim people in Sri Lanka have been able to remove their homes and safety walls and provide us with this opportunity for road development.

(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over her Republican rival.

In a 17-minute speech, Harris aggressively went after Trump’s vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon.

Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election.

“Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,” she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome.
