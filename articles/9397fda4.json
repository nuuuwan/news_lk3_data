    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will sign agreements on restructured debt with Paris Club creditors Wednesday, Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardana said as sources said talks with private creditors are also due to start later in the week.",
    "The relevant senior officials and State Minister Shehan Semasinghe has already left the country to sign the agreements, Minister Gunawardana said.",
    "Sri Lanka has held detailed negotiations with bilateral creditors ever since a sovereign default in 2022 and President Ranil Wickremesinghe has personally met leaders of friendly countries to expedite the restructuring, he said.",
    "The finalizing of the restructure was a \u2018great victory\u2019 for Sri Lanka he said.",
    "Details will be revealed to parliament by President Wickremesinghe and an address to the nation on Wednesday he said.",
    "Discussion with private bondholders are also taking place separately, he said.",
    "Face to face talks with bond holders are likely to start Thursday, sources said.",
    "Investors in a steering committee representing key bondholders have halted trading and are in a \u2018restricted\u2019 period Bloomberg Newswires reported.",
    "Sri Lanka is attempting to restructure 12.5 billion dollars of sovereign bonds and about 1.7 billion dollars of past due interest following the declaration of an external default in 2022.",
    "Private investors are seeking some so-called macro-linked bonds whose final haircut is linked to dollar GDP as well as some standard or \u2018plain vanilla\u2019 bonds with an upfront haircut.",
    "The style of bonds have not been used in sovereign restructurings before. In the latest round of talks more plain vanilla bonds may be discussed, sources aware of the thinking of some bond investors said.",
    "The ISB holders have proposed a 28 percent haircut and a 1.8 percent consent fee. The macro-linked bonds would have principle re-stated up to 92 percent of the original depending on the evolution of gross domestic product.",
    "Sri Lanka is restructuring debt using an IMF debt sustainability model applied to middle income countries with market access as opposed to debt sustainability model used in countries like Ghana applicable to low income countries requiring deeper haircuts on both domestic and foreign debt.",
    "Hair cuts may also depend on the maturity of bonds and the coupon interest.",
    "Ghana has higher levels of commercial debt having started to access capital markets from around 2007.",
    "Ghana also has a bad central bank like Sri Lanka and has gone to the International Monetary Fund 18 times.",
    "The country is also operating flexible inflation targeting (inflation targeting without a clean float), which critics say is the latest spurious monetary regime peddled to hapless unstable countries without a doctrinal foundation in sound money.",
    "Having done broad domestic debt restructuring as well as continued currency volatility both interest rates and inflation remains above 20 percent.",
    "Ghana\u2019s central bank has a worse monetary anchor (8 percent inflation plus 2 percent) compared to 5 percent plus two in Sri Lanka and runs into currency trouble despite being an oil producer like Iran, Venezuela and neighboring Nigeria.",
    "Nigeria has an inflation target of 6-9 percent but ends up with around 20 plus inflation and currency trouble.",
    "Sri Lanka has undershot its inflation target since reaching monetary stability in September 2022 and has appreciated the currency, amid deflationary policy giving a strong foundation for economic activity to resume. (Colombo/June26/2024)"
