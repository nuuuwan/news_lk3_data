    "The Overseas School of Colombo (OSC) has once again achieved international acclaim, winning Gold at the prestigious International ARC Awards in New York for its 2023/24 Annual Report, Timeless Dedication: Celebrating the Faces Behind Our Progress.",
    "\u201cThis triumph is not just about an award, but a reflection of OSC\u2019s philosophy, of who we are: a community rooted in trust and openness, where every individual is part of the story, striving for excellence in all we do, and carrying the Gecko spirit from Colombo to the world stage with pride,\u201d OSC\u2019s Head of School Nel Capadona, captured the essence of the Gecko ethos: a spirit embodied daily by every teacher, student, staff member, and parent who shapes OSC\u2019s enduring legacy.",
    "This marks back-to-back Gold victories (2024/2025), following a Silver in 2022, making OSC the only IB World School globally \u2013 and the only Sri Lankan educational institution ever \u2013 to triumph at the ARCs.",
    "Often hailed as the \u201cOscars of Annual Reports,\u201d the ARC Awards are now in their 39th year, recognising the highest standards in corporate communication and transparency. Past and present winners include global icons such as PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s, IBM, Coca-Cola, Nike, Boeing, PETRONAS, Walmart, Harley-Davidson, BMW, and Volkswagen.",
    "Yet for OSC, this victory represents more than a prestigious trophy. Timeless Dedication is a tribute to the very heart and soul of the school; the teachers who inspire, the staff who uphold, the students who strive, and the community that binds it all together.",
    "OSC Director of Marketing and Communications Jehan de Silva said: \u201cAs the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child \u2013 and at OSC, it is about celebrating the extraordinary people who bring professionalism, creativity, and heart to our community year after year. The theme of last year\u2019s report was about valuing everyone; academic, administrative, service, and beyond. This victory is not about the accolade itself, but about honouring the true faces behind OSC\u2019s remarkable journey.\u201d"
