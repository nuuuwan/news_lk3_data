    "Explaining the significance of this golden opportunity, Anura Hemachandra, Managing Director of Vogue Jewellers explained, \u201cUnderstanding that many Sri Lankans hold gold jewellery they may not use frequently or may wish to convert into a more sound investment, we have introduced this exceptional offer to convert your old gold into new gold at the best rates in the market.

    "The process of exchanging old gold jewellery for new gold not only secures a sound investment but also allows for easy exchangeability into currency or jewellery as needed, while also offering potential efficiencies for holders in terms of tax planning in the future. newly crafted (gold bullion) pieces are also more easily stored and moved discretely, adding to their allure as a secure investment.
