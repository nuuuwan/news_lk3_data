    "People\u2019s Bank, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading financial services provider, today announced its results for the period ended June 30, 2025, reporting operating income of LKR 80.8 billion and post-tax profit of LKR 18.2 billion. This achievement is particularly noteworthy, as this profit was recorded after recognizing significant impairment charges on exposures to several state-owned enterprises (SOEs).",
    "The Bank\u2019s net interest income rose to LKR 69.3 billion during the period, compared to LKR 27.6 billion in the corresponding period of 2024, reflecting the timely repricing of assets and liabilities in line with changing market interest rates. Consequently, net interest margins improved to 4.0% in 2025 from 3.4% in the end 2024. Net fees and commissions reached LKR 8.0 billion, recording a 16.8% growth, the highest ever for the same period. Total operating expenses stood at LKR 33.4 billion (2024: LKR 28.7 billion)",
    "Customer deposits reached LKR 3,125.3 billion (end-2024: LKR 2,854.7 billion), while net loans stood at LKR 1,592.3 billion (end-2024: LKR 1,522.0 billion). Total assets rose to LKR 3,571.8 billion on a solo basis (end-2024: LKR 3,297.8 billion).",
    "As of June 30, 2025, the Bank\u2019s Tier I and Total Capital Adequacy Ratios stood at 12.0% and 16.9%, respectively (end-2024: 10.9% and 16.5%). On a consolidated basis, the ratios were 13.2% and 17.6% (end-2024: 12.6% and 17.7%). These ratios reflect all prudential deductions, including those related to the sovereign-backed state-owned enterprise restructuring, which were fully accounted for, ensuring a conservative and prudent assessment.",
