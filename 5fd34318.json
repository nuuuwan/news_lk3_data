    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has endorsed a domestic debt restructuring (DDR) proposal with majority support, though opposition members had voted against it, COPF chairman Harsha de Silva said.",
    "The chairman himself had refrained from voting, he told EconomyNext Friday June 30 evening.",
    "Government members in the committee had voted for the plan at Friday\u2019s meeting, said de Silva.",
    "On Thursday, COPF had discussed the lack of consent of beneficiaries of the Employment Provident Fund (EPF) on the DDR plan.",
    "MP de Silva tweeted that evening that concerns were raised at the meeting about the burden falling on superannuation funds including EPF without considering the consent of depositors.",
    "\u201cWhile banks were excluded due to existing stress & non-performing loans, the EPF/ETF, which carries most of the burden, faces potential opportunity loss and lacks a say in decisions impacting peoples\u2019 life savings. This raises questions about #equity and #transparency.\u201d",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), which de Silva represents, has reportedly decided to vote against the DDR proposal after parliament convenes on Saturday July 01 for a special session on the matter."
