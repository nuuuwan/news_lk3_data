ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund is awaiting more details on Sri Lanka’s deal with sovereign bondholders to assess its compliance, Mission Chief Peter Breuer said.

“We are currently awaiting additional information and will provide the authorities with an assessment of the agreed terms to ensure consistency with the parameters and debt sustainability objectives under the IMF-supported program,” he said.

Advisors from both sides prepare deals on the belief that they are compliant with the IMF’s Debt Sustainability Analysis.

But during first round of talks, private bondholders were said to have been not fully able to prepare a proposal in line with the DSA unlike Sri Lanka, requiring more information on exactly how the April proposal was deemed to be in line with analysis.

*2024-07-05 03:38:37* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/ce78501zdwjo) · `si`

The text discusses the appropriateness of age in controlling a country, referencing historical and contemporary examples from Sri Lanka and globally. It highlights the constitutional requirements for presidential candidacy in Sri Lanka, emphasizing qualities such as political knowledge, honesty, and experience over age. It contrasts views between experts, noting the importance of maturity and fitness for leadership roles while acknowledging the potential of younger individuals. The piece concludes by reflecting on global trends where age ranges from the mid-30s to over 80 years for leaders, suggesting that both youth and experience have their merits in governance.

🟩

As the end of the 75-year-old successive president, the end of the four-year-old successive president, the end of the Sri Lankan history, has reached the first time since the end of the four-year-old successive president.

Among them are a lengthy political history or political generation, or individually, or a business background.

However, Sri Lanka has a history of failed several armed rebels, however, to acquire state power.

Studying the world situation show that the oldest leaders and young leaders have used their strength.

Presidential Election: The Supreme Court not overcome a petition for an interim order for the interim order to vote until we have been given interim order until he is given interim order until it is given until the election is given.

We do not have sufficient factors to say separately, whether there is a administrative change or economic change in young people or elderly rule.

### Why parate is so hot these days

*2024-07-05 01:18:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Why-parate-is-so-hot-these-days/14-763851) · `en`

The Parate is not that draconian as most of the people see it. Firstly it applies only for loans of which the capital is Rs. 5 million or above. In practice, no bank will exercise the Parate Right until a borrower fails to repay 7/8 instalments or more. The bank as much as possible negotiates with the borrower and carefully listens to the reasons of the borrower’s failure. Banks will in the first instance endeavour to understand whether the default is due to the own negligence of the borrower or due to something beyond his control. Even in the case of own negligence the bank will warn the borrower and try to correct him, leaving aside the Parate. When the default is beyond the control of the borrower, banks give them sound concessions based on case by case

Once the parate is abolished as proposed, the borrowers who are repaying satisfactorily will also, without thinking twice, refrain from repaying their loans

### Finance Ministry on Sri Lanka’s International Sovereign Bond Restructuring

The Joint Working Framework negotiated with the AHG provides a fair balance of risk sharing and sufficiently addresses the concerns of Sri Lanka and the requirements of bondholders. The MLB structure, following the adjustments made through the evolution of the proposed instrument, enables the appropriate sharing of upside between creditors and the debtor, whilst also ensuring that in this process, the debt sustainability of the debtor sovereign is not compromised. These terms require formal confirmation by the Secretariat of the Official Creditor Committee and the IMF staff in order to confirm conformity with comparability of treatment requirements and compliance with Sri Lanka’s IMF program debt sustainability targets

The negotiated Joint Working Framework enables a fair sharing of upside or downside between creditors and Sri Lanka in case of an economic over-performance or under-performance by Sri Lanka

### On a merry-go-round with “debt sustainability”

*2024-07-04 22:56:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/On-a-merry-go-round-with-debt-sustainability/4-763849) · `en`

SL people have been left totally out of the whole process of “debt restructuring” and in the dark on “conditions and measures” the Wickremesinghe Government has agreed to

One major reason there is no transparency in any of the transactions President Wickremesinghe entered into with the IMF and in debt restructuring, is untold geo-political tie-ups. I doubt the President would ever be transparent and accountable to the people with numerous geo-political obligations that would have to remain out of public eye. But people have a right to know the conditions they are tied to in “deferring bi-lateral loan instalment payments”

Sri Lanka signing agreements with bi-lateral lenders Japan, China and India to restructure external debts has received calculated praise from SJB leadership and from the IMF with expectations. Japan congratulated Sri Lanka for effectively “managing debt obligations”.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax: A poisoned chalice?

While the IMF staff report offered a foundational framework for the proposed IRIT, recent pronouncements from the Government hint at potential divergences from the outlined plan

While the IMF recommends a wider tax net with progressive rates, the current Income Tax system, with its narrow base and high rates, suggests that policymakers might prioritise other approaches. Additionally, the IMF criticises the “Net Annual Value” concept for its reliance on exemptions (such as exempting the primary residence) and the use of assessed values. This raises the question: “Is there a contradiction between the vision of the IMF with regard to the Tax Base pertaining to IRIT and the intention of the Government”?

As per the recently published IMF Staff Level Report, it is expected that the Imputed Rental Income Tax (IRIT) would be implemented before the beginning of the tax year, April 2025.
