  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s aviation sector is experiencing a strong recovery, recording nearly 10 percent year-on-year passenger growth. Yet, without urgent digital transformation and stronger collaboration among stakeholders, this growth could quickly become a bottleneck, warned SITA Asia Pacific president Sumesh Patel.",
    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review ahead of the SITA IT Aerotech Summit, at ITC Ratnadipa Wednesday which brought together SriLankan Airlines, Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd (AASL), Immigration, and Customs. He stressed that aviation is an industry that cannot operate in isolation.",
    "\u201cThe first impression of any country is its airport. If Sri Lanka wants to leverage its location and tourism potential, it must make passenger journeys smoother, faster, and more connected, Patel told The Island Financial Review.",
    "Colombo\u2019s Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) is already congested, and the long-delayed second terminal remains years away. Patel warned that current infrastructure will not be able to cope with projected demand.",
    "\u201cWith 8\u201310 percent growth annually, Sri Lanka will face 40\u201350 percent more passengers in just four years. The question is: how do we manage this with the facilities we have now? he asked.",
    "SITA has worked with AASL and SriLankan Airlines to expand self-service facilities at BIA. The airport currently operates eight self-check-in kiosks, with 20 more to be installed this month. Patel urged authorities to extend such services beyond SriLankan Airlines to include international carriers, easing counter congestion.",
    "Patel emphasised that SITA solutions are designed with \u201csecurity by design\u201d principles, protecting over 1,000 airports and most major airlines globally.",
    "\u201cAviation today is an interconnected digital ecosystem. Cybersecurity cannot be an afterthought\u2014it must be embedded across systems, applications, and stakeholders, he said.",
    "Artificial intelligence is also reshaping aviation. SITA\u2019s OptiClimb solution uses AI and machine learning to optimise aircraft take-off profiles, reducing fuel burn and carbon emissions.",
    "\u201cEvery aircraft is unique. Using AI, we provide tailored recommendations that cut costs and emissions. Fifty airlines already use this, including Singapore Airlines and Air India. We are in discussions with SriLankan Airlines to trial it here, Patel noted.",
    "On sustainability, Patel admitted that no country is yet \u201cfully there.\u201d While sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) remain the long-term solution, their high cost and limited supply make immediate efficiency gains critical.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s greatest strengths, Patel said, lie in its diverse tourism offerings and strategic location.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka caters to high-end tourists, budget travellers, nature lovers, and heritage seekers alike. If it positions itself as a hub, the economy can grow significantly. But this requires investment in passenger experience and seamless connectivity, he observed.",
    "\u201cFive years ago, silos were a real issue\u2014airlines, airports, and regulators weren\u2019t aligned. That is improving now. Events like this summit are designed to get everyone onto the same page, because aviation cannot succeed in isolation.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are not just another service provider. We are owned by 410 airlines and airports, including SriLankan Airlines. We\u2019ve been here since 1968, opened our office in 1981, and we are here for the long haul, he said.",
    "Concluding, Patel urged Sri Lanka to move beyond incremental fixes:",
    "\u201cThe aviation industry here is doing extremely well. But growth without transformation will become a hindrance. If Sri Lanka embraces the right technologies, it can outperform even regional giants in passenger satisfaction and efficiency.\u201d",
