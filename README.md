“Up to September, we’ve received 7,210 complaints regarding online scams, with the majority of these linked to social media platforms. When we focus specifically on online-based fraud, around 20% of the complaints involve financial scams. This highlights a growing trend of internet fraud targeting online banking users,” Damunupola stated.

He further explained that many victims fall prey to scams due to a lack of attention to security measures, particularly with One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

“Many users do not take proper care in safeguarding their OTPs or fail to recognize fraudulent websites. This often results in them being caught in these online banking scams,” Damunupola added.

President’s Counsel M.N.M. Zuhair, representing SLISM, argued that Gazette notification No. 2223/3, dated April 13, 2021, signed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was “ultra vires” (beyond legal authority), invalid, and unlawful. He contended that the notification had no force or effect in law and should be declared null and void by the court.

### Foreign observers at polls: Evolution of the concept and practice of election observation

Ideals and values of the organisation as well as the duty of transparency and communication appears to bear upon how elections are observed – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The question then arises as to whether all this makes them independent observers or observers who are partial to the sending organisation. The answer is of a binary nature. They are independent in so far as their functioning in the receiving country is concerned. They are required to not take sides in a contest, but to diligently observe whether the conduct of the election was free and fair. The agreement or understanding reached with the national agency and the mandate or the terms of reference under which the organisation concerned nominates the election observers are applicable here. This notwithstanding, there is no denying the fact that the observers bear partiality towards the sending organisation, which means that they uphold the ideals and values of that organisation at all times during their mission

### Greece as a lens to understand present political changes

The Government of Greece, like its counterpart in Sri Lanka, spent more than the revenue it generated year after year, piling up debt. Unlike in Sri Lanka, Greece lacked the ability to reset the economy by letting the currency float. In both countries the post-crisis focus was on the primary balance. In Sri Lanka this was to be achieved from the revenue side with no overt cuts in expenditure; in Greece by cutting Government expenditures including salaries and pensions, by downsizing Government, and by raising taxes. Syriza did it and now Greece is back to normalcy

Inflation in August 2024 was 0.5%, the lowest since 2000. There are no shortages. No bank collapsed. Reserves are up. Agreement is close on the commercial debt, the last piece of the restructuring.

In what could be the latest in a series of major blows to Hezbollah, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it appeared the replacement for slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had been “eliminated”.

Hashem Safieddine, a top Hezbollah official, was widely expected to succeed Nasrallah. Safieddine has not been heard from publicly since an Israeli airstrike late last week.

“Hezbollah is an organization without a head. Nasrallah was eliminated, his replacement was probably also eliminated,” Gallant told officers at the Israeli military’s northern command centre, in a brief video segment distributed by the military.

“There’s no one to make decisions, no one to act,” he said, without providing further details.

### Minority groups’ representation in Sri Lanka’s Parliament splintering: Research

ECONOMYNEXT – Representation of minority groups in Sri Lanka’s Parliament is in danger of weakening in the upcoming November 14 elections, which could affect their rights, an European Commission funded study has revealed.

Research by Oxford Brookes University as part of the Minority empowerment for democracy and pluralism programme revealed that major national parties have successively reduced the space within their parties for minorities to participate and raise their issues.

Minority ethnic parties are also divided and their campaigning is shaped by the majority agenda rather than the needs and rights of their communities.

“The main national parties in Sri Lanka have had a history of nominating representatives from minority communities who have gone on to take leadership positions. This is changing now with minority politicians in these parties often feeling isolated and finding fewer opportunities to raise minority rights issues,” lead researcher Dr Farah Mihlar said.
