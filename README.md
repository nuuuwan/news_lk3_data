### சூரியின் ‘மண்டாடி’ படப்பிடிப்பில் விபத்து: ரூ.1 கோடி  சேதம்

*2025-10-05 13:27:36* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/cinema/சூரியின்-மண்டாடி-படப்பிடிப்பில்-விபத்து-ரூ-1-கோடி-சேதம்/54-365757) · `ta`

சூரி நடித்து வரும் ‘மண்டாடி’ படப்பிடிப்பில் விபத்து ஏற்பட்டுள்ளது. இந்த விபத்தில் ரூ.1 கோடி மதிப்பிலான படப்பிடிப்பு உபகரணங்கள் சேதமடைந்துள்ளதாகத் தெரிகிறது.

மதிமாறன் இயக்கத்தில் சூரி நடித்து வரும் படம் ‘மண்டாடி’. இதன் படப்பிடிப்பு ராமநாதபுரம் சுற்றியுள்ள பகுதியில் நடைபெற்று வருகிறது. இதில் தொண்டி என்ற பகுதியில் கடலில் முக்கிய காட்சிகளை படமாக்கி வந்தது படக்குழு. அப்போது எதிர்பாராத விதமாக கேமரா இருந்த படகு கவிழ்ந்து விபத்துக்குள்ளானது. இதில் படகில் இருந்த 2 பேர் கடலில் மூழ்கினர். அவர்களை சுற்றியிருந்தவர்கள் பத்திரமாக மீட்டார்கள். இந்த விபத்தில் எந்தவொரு உயிர்ச் சேதமும் ஏற்படவில்லை.

ஆனால், கேமராக்கள் கடல் நீரில் வீழ்ந்ததில் கடும் சேதம் ஏற்பட்டுள்ளது. இதன் மதிப்பு மட்டும் ரூ.1 கோடி வரை இருக்கும் என மதிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளது.

### வாழைச்சேனையில் கட்டாக்காலி கால்நடைகள் அதிகரிப்பு ; உரிமையாளர்களுக்கு எதிராக சட்டநடவடிக்கை - பிரதேச சபை தவிசாளர்

*2025-10-05 12:25:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226931) · `ta`

கோறளைப்பற்று வாழைச்சேனை பிரதேச சபை பிரிவுக்குட்பட்ட பகுதிகளில் கட்டாக்காலி கால்நடைகளின் தொல்லை அதிகரித்துக் காணப்படுவதாக பிரதேச சபை தவிசாளர் எஸ்.சுதாகரன் தெரிவித்தார்.

இவ்வாறு கட்டாக்காலியாக வீதிகளில் திரியும் ஆடு, மாடு, போன்ற கால்நடைகளினால் தொடர்ந்தும் வீதி விபத்துக்கள் ஏற்படுகின்றன.

அத்துடன், காட்டாக்காலி கால்நடைகள் வெளிநாட்டு, உள்நாட்டு சுற்றுலாப் பயணிகள் மற்றும் பாதசாரிகளுக்கு பெரும் அசௌகரியங்களை ஏற்படுத்தி வருகின்றன.

எனவே, ஆடு, மாடு வளர்ப்பாளர்கள் தங்களுடைய கால்நடைகளை வீதிகளில் விடாமல் தங்களுடைய வீடுகளில் வளர்க்குமாறும் அல்லது மேய்ச்சல் நிலங்களுக்கு அனுப்பி அதனை பராமரிக்குமாறும் தவிசாளர் வேண்டிக் கொண்டுள்ளார்.

இந்த அறிவுறுத்தலை மீறி கால்நடைகளை வீதிகளில் விடும் உரிமையாளர்களுக்கு எதிராக கடும் சட்டநடவடிக்கை எடுக்கப்படும் எனவும் தவிசாளர் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

*2025-10-05 11:32:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226923) · `ta`

The attempt by a 12 -year -old boy, a 12 -year -old boy who was affected by the knee, was a success, with the ambition to swim and achieve the distance from the loss and achievement.

The boy has set a record of swimming from Sri Lanka Talaimannar to Tamil Nadu Dhanushkodi in 9 pm and 11 minutes last Friday.

The Rameshwaram Island and the 13 Sand Fails that followed it and the Baku Strait Sea are separated from the Gulf of Mannar. It is the most depth of Tamil Nadu, while the rocks and the dangerous jelly fishes are part of the sea.

He made these comments during a discussion with members of the United National Party and other parties on Thursday and condemned the current activities of the National People's Power Government with historical examples.

When Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, he did not support more than 50 percent. Hitler's party received just 44 percent votes. Therefore, Hitler destroyed the opposition parties on that day to keep his power.

I am familiar with the people who have spent a lot of life in life. People's love is free of profit goals based on the facts of trust and mutual respect.

Therefore, its value is more than ever. It is important to say that this is difficult to break as a heartfelt bond not just a political relationship.. Trys to break up can be strengthened. I have experienced the maximum happiness that is possible as a folk leader. I will give glory to honor.

### Combination of circumstances gives CBK the opportunity to dissolve Parliament

*2025-10-04 21:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/combination-of-circumstances-gives-cbk-the-opportunity-to-dissolve-parliament/) · `en`

Bradman takes final bow after a period on intense political manoeuvering

Ranil’s strength, according to the Constitution, came from his supremacy in Parliament. With great managerial skill he managed to keep at all times a sizable majority in place. The UNF never lost a vote in Parliament during those two years (Ranil was PM). The UNF itself was a coalition bringing together five parties which contested the election together. It must have brought much credit to his political acumen and management skills that in spite of severe stresses and strains, the UNF held together. It was also quite remarkable in a country where party political loyalties are notably fickle, that during the period of his government there was not a single resignation from party or office.
