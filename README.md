### Macron names ally Sébastien Lecornu as new French PM

*2025-09-10 06:40:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112340/macron-names-ally-sbastien-lecornu-as-new-french-pm) · `en`

President Emmanuel Macron has named close ally Sébastien Lecornu as the new French prime minister, 24 hours after a vote of confidence ousted François Bayrou as head of government.

Lecornu, 39, was among the favourites to take over, and he has spent the past three years as armed forces minister focusing on France’s response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

In a statement the Elysée Palace said Lecornu - the seventh PM in the Macron presidency - had been given the task of consulting political parties with the aim of adopting France’s next budget.

Pushing through a budget as head of a minority government was what brought down Bayrou, with left and far-right opponents condemning Lecornu’s appointment.

Bayrou had visited the president hours earlier to hand in his resignation, paving the way for Sébastien Lecornu to become the fifth prime minister of Macron’s second term as president.

Salesforce AI Research has unveiled new innovations to help enterprises deploy AI agents that are capable, consistent, and trustworthy.

At the center is CRMArena-Pro, a simulation environment that tests agents in complex, multi-turn scenarios such as sales forecasting, service triage, and CPQ processes. Acting like a digital twin of a business, it introduces real-world “noise” to measure accuracy, efficiency, and resilience before agents go live, enabling organizations to strengthen performance and trust.

To measure readiness, Salesforce launched the Agentic Benchmark for CRM, the first evaluation tool built specifically for enterprise workflows across five metrics: accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and sustainability. With new models emerging rapidly, this benchmark helps CIOs select the right AI systems while balancing performance with environmental impact.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers has decided to amend the country’s Press Council Act to expand scope of controversial 1970s media control law to electronic and online media, the government said.

The Sri Lanka Press Council Act was introduced during Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s government and has long been viewed as a tool for controlling the country’s print media rather than promoting press freedom.

The Act established the Press Council, a statutory body empowered to regulate newspapers, monitor journalistic practices, and enforce restrictions on reporting deemed to threaten national security, public order, or morality.

It gave the Council sweeping powers, including the authority to summon editors, seize publications, and penalize journalists or publishers who violated its provisions.

Critics argue that these provisions enable censorship under the guise of regulation, discouraging critical journalism and undermining the role of the press as a democratic watchdog.
