    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Legislators representing Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil-majority northern and eastern provinces and President Ranil Wickremesinghe were unable to reach a consensus on the inclusion of police powers in the full implementation of an India-backed devolution mechanism.",
    "At a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on Tuesday July 18, opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran said excluding police powers in the implementation of the 13th amendment to the constitution would not amount to a meaningful devolution of power.",
    "Noting that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had made three separate joint-statements with the government of India recognising the need to fully implement the 13th amendment including police powers, Sumanthiran said the steering committee of the constitutional assembly at the previous parliament had arrived at some measure of agreement on the way forward.",
    "\u201cSo now to go back and say [there is gong to be an] exception with police powers\u2026\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t seem meaningful at all,\u201d he said.",
    "Responding to the MP, President Wickremesinghe said while he agrees with Rajapaksa that there should be full implementation of the 13th amendment, there was an outcry when Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration had proposed the same.",
    "\u201cFirstly, I\u2019m Ranil Wickremesinghe, not Ranil Rajapaksa. I\u2019m not bound by \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say what President Rajapaksa did, but I do go along with him that there has to be full implementation of the 13th amendment. But in the discussion we had earlier, when I mentioned full implementation, there was a big outcry and we decided that we\u2019ll go ahead and take up police powers later. So you have to decide on that,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Sumanthiran said the president\u2019s previous deadline of February 04 for finding a lasting solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic conclusion was not met and the new deadline of July 31 also does not seem realistic. The TNA does not wish to be party for such a solution, he said.",
    "\u201cBut we\u2019re not opposed to you implementing any of these things,\u201d he added, referring to other proposals.",
    "Wickremesinghe said: \u201cI didn\u2019t say I\u2019m going to implement everything. I said the proposal will be given to you before July 31. Now I have given the proposals. Question is do you want to support it or not?\u201d",
    "The president asked Sumanthiran to submit his views to a committee of ministers that includes Ministers Susil Premajayantha and Prasanna Ranatunga.",
    "Jaffna district MP an former Northern Province Chief Minister C V Vigenswaran who had in February welcomed the president\u2019s overture to the Tamil community, said at Tuesdya\u2019s meeting that his position is that anything that strengthens the 13th amendment and will see its implementation is the need of the hour. President Wickremesinghe asked the MP to submit his views to the ministerial committee as well.",
    "\u201cThe minister\u2019s committee will start sitting in about two weeks\u2019 time. Those of you who want to come can come. In the meantime, I\u2019ll speak to other party leaders and find out their views,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Notably, Tuesday\u2019s round of discussion was ahead of an official visit to India by the president.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment would see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more nationalist-oriented parties including sections of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). In February, sections of Sri Lanka\u2019s Buddhist clergy took to the streets against the proposed full implementation of the constitutional amendment.",
    "A statement from the President\u2019s Media Division said Tuesday evening quoted him as saying that he had already put forth a \u201ccomprehensive proposal to address the problems faced by the people in those regions and it is up to the Tamil parliamentarians whether to take it forward or not\u201d.",
    "\u201cUltimately, the president underscored that the full enforcement of the 13th amendment can only be achieved if all party leaders in the parliament agree to a comprehensive devolution of powers,\u201d the statement said. (Colombo/Jul19/2023)"
