### Sri Lanka President’s party achieves historic win in the North

*2024-11-15 10:27:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-presidents-party-achieves-historic-win-in-the-north-187940/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s party has scored a historic victory in the Tamil-dominated northern province of Jaffna, paving the way for a significant majority in Parliament, where it previously held just three seats.

Dissanayake’s National People’s Power (NPP) emerged as the largest single party in the cultural capital of the minority Tamils, where traditional parties were deeply divided.

Official results show that Thursday’s election victory for the NPP in Jaffna marks the first win by a southern party in the region since the introduction of the new proportional representation system under the 1978 Constitution.

Since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, no southern party has politically dominated the north.

However, in the 1947 state council elections, the United National Party (UNP) won seats by fielding Tamil candidates.
