    "Says votes for NPP do not reflect public belief that it has best plan or team to rebuild SL",
    "Claims votes for President were driven by opposition to corrupt dealings, widespread disillusionment, and economic pressures",
    "Urges public to make informed, intelligent choices for SL\u2019s future rather than being swayed by attractive but empty rhetoric",
    "Says people did not look at manifestos last poll and urged them to carefully examine and compare SJB\u2019s one to those of others",
    "Former Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar has said that the votes cast for President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the recent Presidential election were more a reflection of public dissent against the existing corrupt political system than an endorsement of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party\u2019s ideology and policies.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Imthiaz Bakeer Markar said that he does not believe voters supported NPP candidate President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the recent Presidential election because they thought it had the best plan or team to rebuild the country.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone genuinely believes that the world has progressed through the NPP\u2019s ideologies, nor that following them is the solution to our recovery. Nor do people believe that the NPP has the most experienced and capable team. This vote was not cast based on such beliefs. It was driven by the opposition to the current political system, corrupt dealings, widespread disillusionment, and the economic pressures people are facing,\u201d he said.",
    "Bakeer Markar explained that the election result was, in many ways, an outlet for the public\u2019s frustrations.",
    "He also accused President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of making contradictory statements during and after the election campaign, particularly regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \u201cOnce someone assumes power, they are often forced to be more practical,\u201d he remarked. The former MP warned against misleading the public with popular slogans, inciting unrealistic hopes, and creating illusory visions that misguide them. He likened this approach to that of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose actions, he argued, ultimately led to the country\u2019s downfall.",
    "He urged the public to make informed, intelligent choices for the country\u2019s future rather than being swayed by attractive but empty rhetoric. \u201cWe need to steer the country in the right direction,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "Bakeer Markar also encouraged the public to carefully examine and compare the SJB election manifesto with those of other parties. \u201cIt\u2019s not filled with false promises. The people didn\u2019t compare the manifestos, they voted to express their opposition,\u201d he claimed."
