    "Considering the significant contribution of the tourism industry to the economy, Japan has agreed to extend a grant of Yen 1.17 billion (around Rs. 2.5 billion) via the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to strengthen border-related health preparedness at two key entry ports in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and Colombo Port will see an upgrade in its health capacities according to international practices, recommendations and standards through the grant facility.",
    "\u201cThe financial aid will help to improve health capacities to deal with direct contribution of the control of infectious disease and the overall security of all passengers, staff and staff of points of entry in various health emergencies,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "The initiative will help smooth the operation of entry points into the country, build confidence among visitors and arrange cross-border entry points to comply with international health regulations on movement.",
