    "LESSONS FROM MY CAREER: SYNTHESISING MANAGEMENT THEORY WITH PRACTICE \u2013 PART 20",
    "The last episode continued with more experiences from my stint at the ETF Board, from which I learned many lessons. Today, I continue with stories highlighting how I managed political interference and tackled other vital issues.",
    "The most challenging issue was when a vacancy occurred for the post of General Manager at ETF. Although, according to the ETF Act, I, as the Chairman, was the CEO, I needed a second in command. Even before we advertised the post, the Minister gave me the CV of a confidant of his, obviously expecting me to tailor the job specification based on his CV. I obviously didn\u2019t do so and asked the very experienced Board of Directors how to handle the issue. If he had become the GM, I would have lost control of the entire institution. The Board decided not to change the recruitment scheme and to appoint a top-level interview panel that would make the right decisions without fear. We received a high volume of applications, and the interview panel determined that the Minister\u2019s candidate lacked sufficient senior management experience for the post, as noted in the interview sheet. Another candidate was selected.",
    "The next day, I met the Minister. I told him, \u201cSir, something unexpected happened. The interview panel found his senior management experience insufficient and rejected him\u201d. The Minister was not impressed. With a sour face, he just said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d (ehemada?). I left his office. This short conversation was, of course, in Sinhala.",
    "When the post of Head of HR fell vacant, the State Minister\u2019s relative applied. The state minister was very decent, though. He told me there is no pressure to appoint her, but that I should make sure that if someone else was selected, it should be a person much more qualified and experienced than his relative. There were many superior candidates. I had promised the staff that I would be very fair and transparent in recruitments and promotions.",
    "I would not deprive any candidate of the rightful place, despite any political pressure. The staff became aware of the state Minister\u2019s relative, and rumours circulated that, despite my assurances, I would have to yield to political pressure this time. We finally selected a very good candidate, and when I informed the state minister, he was very decent about it. I maintained my credibility and effectively handled the political situation, too.",
    "Before my time, an incident had occurred in which the selected list for promotions was tampered with in the Ministry, with some names deleted by the former Minister or his personal staff. This would always come up as a grievance. I decided to investigate and found it was true. This was later corrected. Subsequently, when a promotion list was sent for approval to the Ministry, I refused to give additional details such as marks and interview details. I maintained that an autonomous Board has been appointed to the ETF, which appointed a suitable interview panel, and the Ministry should honour the decision of the Board without demeaning the Board by re-evaluating the decision of the Board. After much debate, this was accepted by the Ministry.",
    "Investments, too, came under severe political pressure. I was pressured to invest in various projects, including half-completed ones, when the promoters ran out of funds. I set up a strong investment team and a Board Committee on investments. Previously, the ETF had funded a small catering business that had closed down, and an IT outfit that was non-operational; even the assets of these investments could not be found. I was prepared to provide funds to venture capital companies that were well-equipped to evaluate projects, and we did so. We did not invest in any projects under pressure. Many entrepreneurs with political influence were quite displeased with me and openly hostile. However, I would feign interest in these projects and finally declare that they either did not fit into our portfolio or were not feasible according to our professional team.",
    "Sometimes I would lose patience when the Minister called meetings with such project promoters, and I would be blunt. Later, the Minister would caution me to listen attentively because these promoters had helped during the election campaign and, therefore, they had to be given a chance to present their case. We had to show interest in their projects, he told me. I realised that I needed to be more diplomatic. I was beginning to understand the mind of politicians.",
    "One factor that I am grateful for is the attitude of Mr Paskaralingam, the Secretary of Finance, and perhaps the public officer who was the President\u2019s right-hand man. I would get calls from him occasionally about some investment. Obviously, he had been asked to intervene by these project promoters. As soon as I explain that the Board is not in favour due to a particular reason, he would always say, \u201cThen it is okay, there is no compulsion.\u201d",
    "There were two incidents where I had to yield. One instance was when I received a call from Mr Paskaralingam, asking me to promote a particular officer for the position of head of the Division. We had advertised the post and already selected a good candidate who was much better than the internal candidate in question. I was told that the request came from the President himself. I explained that the internal candidate was one of the worst-performing officers and was unable to even control the staff. I was told that I had no choice because it was a request from the President. I offered to explain to the President how the Board would look ridiculous if that promotion was made. Mr Paskaralingam then blasted me, saying the President would not meet me to discuss the issue, but it had to be done. Finally, after much discussion, I agreed to create a new post with the same status as the Head of the Division. The latest post was more advisory and did not require leadership skills. It was agreed that the Ministry of Policy Planning would approve the new post without question. That night, I drafted the new job specifications, and the next morning, I obtained approval from our Ministry within an hour. The Ministry of Policy Planning gave approval the next day, and the Board approved it at the very next meeting. The President\u2019s objective was achieved, and the Board maintained its dignity.",
    "I was surprised by how the Government machinery worked when there was political pressure. Usually, our Ministry would either lose my letters of request or take a week or two to forward them to the relevant Ministry. The Ministry of Policy Planning would request various forms of additional information and sometimes even refuse to fill a post rendered vacant by a resignation. Even at that time, the stock excuse was that the IMF had recommended a freeze on recruitment. Sometimes I had heated arguments and an exchange of strong letters. In one instance, my request for approval to fill a post was turned down simply because I had advertised the vacancy before the post was approved. I had to argue that my initial training at State Engineering Corporation was to implement the activities in parallel to save time. In this latest instance, we were creating a new post, but still no questions were asked, and the approval was prompt.",
    "The other issue was when I had made some internal transfers. They were not to a remote area but just to another floor of the same building. I received a call from the Prime Minister to cancel one of the transfers. I flatly refused. When I was giving my explanations, the PM stopped me and said, \u201cWije, I am the Prime Minister of the country, and of what use is my position if I cannot get a simple transfer cancelled?\u201d. At that point, I relented. I put myself in the PM\u2019s shoes. What he said was true. I cancelled the transfer.",
    "Frederick Herzberg, who proposed the two-factor theory of motivation in 1959, was spot on. The hygiene factors were poor at the ETF. There were constant complaints of discrimination, unfair treatment, and a lack of transparency. Whenever I attempted to initiate a new program after taking office, I was met with resistance, accusations, stories of discrimination, grievances, and other issues. Initially, I had to pause my programmes and attend to resolving these issues first. Salaries and wages administration is a science and an art. Ad hoc additional increments for selected employees had caused further anomalies when point-to-point adjustments were made in the case of a general salary revision.",
    "I had to appoint committees with external experts to resolve anomalies and carry out a job evaluation to decide on the grading of posts. Once all these dissatisfiers were completed, the staff were more amenable to looking at new initiatives, and we were ready for the next phase of development. Some issues took almost five years to resolve. I learnt that unskilled and less professional meddling in carefully thought-out salary structures had resulted in disastrous consequences. In the private sector, it was not an issue because there are no scales but just salaries and allowances personal to each individual.",
    "Just before the General Elections, which had been held before I arrived at the ETF Board, an additional 100 staff had been recruited from the Ja-Ela electorate, but they had no work. They were housed in a temporary building in the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) premises next door.",
    "When I visited the place, I found them either sewing, knitting, reading newspapers or books. The hall they were housed in was very hot. It was in May that year. Every day, someone would faint due to heat stress. I asked the Factories Inspection Division of the Labour Department to conduct a study. The result showed that the heat stress exceeded the acceptable level for an office. I had to urgently find space for these 100 employees.",
    "The Labour Department had a much lower occupancy per square foot. Still, all the clerical staff, too, had large tables occupying unnecessary space. We struck a deal with the Commissioner of Labour. The ETF would purchase new compact tables at its expense and gift them to the Labour Department. In return, they would provide us with additional space, now that the existing space has been released. This solved the space problem, and all those housed in the CTB premises were brought \u201chome\u201d. Of course, they found productive work too.",
    "Spreading rumours and disinformation was a popular pastime at the ETF, mostly by mischief makers. Many organisations have their share of mischief makers. They would spread rumours, such as the ETF Board being scrapped due to the announced amalgamations of the EPF and the ETF, which would result in all losing their jobs. They would spread false stories about management decisions, creating fear or suspicion. I realised that rumours gather momentum only when there is a vacuum of official information, and this vacuum is filled with disinformation. Fortunately, I came across a document issued by the Federal Drug Authority (FDA) of the USA, which is the authority in the US to monitor and safeguard its citizens by issuing standards and enforcing regulations to protect people, regarding medicines. I found a document called the \u201cTalk Paper\u201d to be interesting. It is issued by the FDA internally to all at a particular level of management, allowing them to communicate the official version in response to inquiries. Officers of the FDA could therefore respond accurately and correct any fake news, as well as provide accurate and standard responses to queries about a newly discussed concern regarding a particular drug.",
    "I introduced a similar Talk Paper and distributed it to all executives and above. There was no intranet or email then. I had no option but to send out photocopies. It worked well. Whenever unofficial information spread, the staff would wait for the Talk Paper, much like we now immediately check the internet for fake news. Official versions were now available, and there were no vacuums available for mischief makers.",
    "My stint at ETF continues in the next episode with more initiatives, stories and lessons learnt.",
