‚ÄúMonth after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,‚Äù Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement.

‚ÄúOur damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,‚Äù she added.
