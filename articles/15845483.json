    "Vidullanka PLC\u2019s first project under its $ 12.85 million Engineering Procurement and Construction contract with the Guyana Energy Agency, the 0.7MW Moco Moco Mini Hydropower Plant, was inaugurated on 13 December 2024. The ceremony was graced by the presence of the Prime Minister of Guyana Brigadier (Ret\u2019d) Mark Phillips, as well as key representatives of the Government and local authorities, the Guyana Energy Agency (GEA), the Lethem Power Company and the community.",
    "In 2022, Vidullanka PLC won a competitive tender to the GEA\u2019s EPC contract to enhance the capacity and reconstruct the Moco Moco Mini Hydropower Plant and construct a brand-new project, the 1.5MW Kumu Mini Hydropower Plant. This achievement marks a milestone for the company as its first EPC contract to be undertaken in South America.",
    "Drawing on decades of experience in renewable energy development, Vidullanka PLC took on the extensive rehabilitation of the existing power plant structure in Moco Moco, which was successfully completed in the latter half of 2024. Vidullanka\u2019s work on the Kumu plant has also concluded as per the contract requirements, with the transmission access awaiting its grid connection. Together, the two power plants will deliver a total capacity of 2.2MW and feed up to 13.76GWh of clean energy annually.",
    "With the conclusion of the contract and the handover of the projects from Vidullanka PLC to the GEA, the power plants are expected to boost the regional economy and improve the livelihoods of the citizens of the region. The company\u2019s ability to create positive impact on infrastructure on shores beyond our own is a testament to Vidullanka\u2019s expertise, further cementing its position as a pioneer in the industry."
