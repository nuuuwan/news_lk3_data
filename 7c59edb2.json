    "COLOMBO (News 1st); In the heart of Sri Lanka's North-West Province, lay the village of Velgala, a place grappling with an age-old nemesis: water scarcity.",
    "Life in Velgala was a relentless struggle for survival, where every drop of water was a precious commodity, and to make matters even more worse, the villagers are forced to make the dangerous three-kilometer walk across elephant territory to get even a drop of clean drinking water.",
    "The three hundred and sixty plus children of Velgala Vidyalaya, the village school, bore the brunt of this hardship. Their days were marred by the constant thirst, and their health deteriorating from consuming contaminated water.",
    "The village's water source, a public well, was a treacherous oasis, its waters tainted with impurities, a silent harbinger of disease.",
    "Each sip from the well was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice against the insidious grip of illness.",
    "In September 2023, Gammedda embarked on a mission to liberate Velgala from the shackles of thirst, to transform the village's destiny, and meticulously crafted a water filtration system, a lifeline to quench the village's thirst.",
    "The new water filtration system was completed, and handed over to the school during an event that was graced by the leader of the Gammadda Movement Chevaan Daniel, in the midst of the blessings of the Maha Sangha.",
    "CA Sri Lanka President Sanjaya Bandara, Ibbagamuwa Zonal Education Director R. M. B. C. Ratnayake, Velgala Vidyalaya Principal E. M. B. B. Ratnauyake, teachers, parents, among others were present for this auspicious occasion.",
    "The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka provided crucial financial support, while the Sri Lanka Navy lent its technical expertise. Together, they wove a tapestry of hope and transformation.",
    "Gammadda's generosity extended beyond the water system. They showered the children of Velgala Vidyalaya with gifts, a soothing balm to the wounds of hardship.",
