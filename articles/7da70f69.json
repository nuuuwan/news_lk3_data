    "Sepsis is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions of people each year.The Global Sepsis Alliance (GSA) has designated September 13th as \u201cWorld Sepsis Day\u201d and the entire month of September to enhance awareness about sepsis. This day serves as a crucial opportunity to educate the public, healthcare professionals, and policymakers about sepsis, its symptoms, and the importance of prompt medical intervention.",
    "The College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka conducts educational programs to raise awareness about sepsis among healthcare providers and the public.",
    "Understanding sepsis is critically important due to its severe impact on global health. According to the Global Sepsis Alliance (GSA), sepsis affects 47 to 50 million people worldwide each year, leading to the deaths of at least 11 million individuals. This translates to a staggering death rate of one person every 2.8 seconds. Moreover, sepsis is linked to one in every five deaths globally.",
    "The consequences of sepsis extend beyond mortality; survivors frequently face long-term health challenges and complications. Recognising the signs of sepsis and ensuring timely medical intervention can be life-saving and help to reduce both the death toll and the enduring impacts on survivors.",
    "Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that begins with an infection.",
    "The body\u2019s immune system works to fight against microorganisms and protect us from illness. However, in sepsis, the immune system becomes dysregulated and begins attacking not only the microorganisms, but also the body\u2019s own organs, including vital ones like the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, and liver. This overreaction can lead to a critical condition known as septic shock, where there is a dangerous drop in blood pressure, resulting in inadequate blood supply to the organs and causing them to malfunction. Immediate recognition and treatment are crucial for survival. Unfortunately, 40% of individuals with septic shock do not survive this severe condition.",
    "Identifying Culprits: Microorganisms and Infections That Can Lead to Sepsis",
    "Sepsis is triggered by a wide range of organisms and infections, which can originate from various sources in the body. Bacteria are the most common cause, but viruses, fungi, and parasites can also lead to sepsis.",
    "Common bacterial infections that can cause sepsis include pneumonia, abdominal infections such as appendicitis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), meningitis, skin and soft tissue infections from wounds.",
    "Fungal infections, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems and severe viral infections, such as influenza, can also result in sepsis.",
    "The infection triggers an overwhelming immune response, leading to systemic inflammation and potentially life-threatening complications if not addressed early and promptly.",
    "Early detection is crucial for survival. Symptoms can sometimes be mistaken for other illnesses, so it\u2019s important to be vigilant, especially if you or a loved one has an infection.",
    "Sepsis can escalate quickly, making early treatment vital. Quick intervention with antibiotics and supportive care can significantly improve outcomes. The earlier sepsis is recognised and managed, the better the chance of recovery and survival.",
    "Sepsis is indiscriminate; it can strike anyone, regardless of age or background. However, certain groups are at higher risk, including those with long-term illnesses (such as lung, liver, heart, and kidney diseases), those with weakened immune systems (e.g., AIDS, diabetes, cancer patients, individuals without spleens), pregnant mothers, infants under one year, and the elderly (over 60 years old). People with recent infections or surgeries are at high risk since infections from surgical wounds or other injuries can lead to sepsis.",
    "If you experience symptoms of sepsis, seek medical advice immediately by going to the nearest hospital or medical centre. Health care professionals will evaluate your condition by checking vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and breathing rate. If sepsis is confirmed or suspected, you will likely be advised to be admitted to the hospital. Adhere to prescribed treatments, which may include antibiotics, fluids and other supportive measures. Early treatment is crucial, as the first hour is critical for effective intervention and a favourable outcome.",
    "Once admitted to the hospital with sepsis, patients typically receive immediate treatment to stabilise their condition. This includes;",
    "\u00b7 Blood and Specimen Collection: Various specimens, including blood, urine, and sputum, are collected to identify the infectious organisms, severity of infection and your vital organ functions. This helps guide the appropriate treatment.",
    "\u00b7 Fluids such as saline given directly to your blood to maintain blood pressure and hydration",
    "\u00b7 Other medications to support your blood pressure and other organ functions.",
    "\u00b7 If your condition is severe, medical professionals may determine that you need admission to intensive care.",
    "Sepsis can lead to severe complications if not treated quickly, including septic shock, which causes a dangerous drop in blood pressure and multi-organ failure. It can damage almost every organ in the body, resulting in conditions like kidney or liver failure, brain dysfunction and breathing problems. Survivors may face long-term effects such as physical disabilities, cognitive impairments, and chronic health issues. In severe cases, sepsis can progress to septic shock and ultimately result in death. Prompt treatment is crucial to reduce these risks and improve recovery outcomes.",
    "Survivors of sepsis may face long-term effects known as \u201cPost-Sepsis Syndrome\u201d.",
    "They can experience; persistent psychological issues such as anxiety and depression which can affect mental health, ongoing weakness and tiredness may hinder daily activities, problems with concentration, memory and thinking can linger.",
    "These physical and mental health issues can lead to a lower quality of life, even after the initial recovery.",
    "\u2013 Practice Good Hygiene: Regular handwashing is one of the simplest ways to prevent infections.",
    "\u2013 Stay Vaccinated: Vaccines for flu, pneumonia, and other preventable diseases can lower your risk.",
    "\u2013 Manage Chronic Conditions: Keeping chronic conditions under control can help prevent infections.",
    "\u2013 Care for Wounds Properly: Clean cuts and wounds promptly and seek medical care for severe injuries.",
    "On World Sepsis Day, take the opportunity to learn more about sepsis and share information with friends, family, and community members. Awareness can lead to quicker recognition and treatment. By increasing knowledge and encouraging swift action, you can help save lives and reduce the impact of this global health challenge.",
    "Engage with organisations and campaigns dedicated to sepsis awareness and research. Support their efforts through donations, volunteering, or spreading their message.",
    "World Sepsis Day serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of sepsis awareness.",
    "The Global Sepsis Alliance (GSA) provides extensive information about sepsis. In Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Sepsis Alliance which was launched in 2023, in partnership with the College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka (COAISL) and the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists (SLCM) , marking this day with a significant event: \u201cSepsis mini-congress\u201d. This congress will bring together experts from various fields to discuss and promote strategies for combating sepsis.",
    "On September 13th and beyond, let us commit to educating others and ourselves, supporting sepsis initiatives, and fostering a proactive approach to combating this critical health issue. Your awareness and actions can play a crucial role in fighting sepsis and improving health outcomes worldwide.",
