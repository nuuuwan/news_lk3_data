### Trump heads for historic second UK state visit

Donald Trump will get the red carpet treatment this week on an unprecedented second United Kingdom state visit, as Britain counts on royal pomp and circumstance to woo the unpredictable United States president.

From a flyby and carriage ride with King Charles III to a grand state banquet at historic Windsor Castle, Britain is pulling out all the stops to flatter Trump, who has long been fascinated with the monarchy.

The aim is to keep Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Trump’s good side when they meet at the British leader’s country residence for talks centred on trade, tariffs and the Ukraine war.

Trump will also be kept far away from crowds and protesters, with all the action taking place outside London, where a large demonstration against the 79-year-old Republican is set to take place.

Labour leader Starmer is not a natural bedfellow for right-wing firebrand Trump, but he has worked hard to win him over since the US president returned to the White House in January.

Rice manufacturers have avoided selling Giri Samba rice because they are offering a control price of the Keeri Samba at a price of more than 260 rupees.

Considering this situation, retailers are also avoiding selling Keeri samba rice.

In such a situation, the Rice Manufacturers Association has asked the government to remove the maximum retail price imposed on the Samba and Keeri Samba rice.

However, the Sri Lankan small and medium -sized paddy plant owners association is demanding that no measures take any steps to eliminate the maximum retail price of rice as the owners of large -scale rice mill owners are trying to make a profit.

In this context, the National Farmers' Union has demanded that the government immediately resolve the issue.
