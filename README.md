### Arugam Bay; hidden currents

*2024-11-25 01:05:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Arugam-Bay-hidden-currents/4-769617) · `en`

There has been growing public concern over the recent weeks, about happenings in Arugam Bay (AB). This analysis adds to the discourse.

Democratic states are obliged to protect all people within its borders, whether citizens or non-citizens. Non-citizens include tourists on short stays, subject to the law of the land they visit.

Informed sources report that Jewish places of prayer have been set up for Israeli tourists in AB. Though few would object to people at prayer, this raises a concern. Why would tourists on short stays want this, when they can pray in their rooms?

A likely answer links two possibilities. Some of these tourists are here to stay longer and have been permitted to do so. And, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the construction or designation of a Jewish place of prayer for Israelis. The stringent regulations governing the establishment of new places of prayer or worship for our own citizens, makes this favour even more puzzling.

Israel and its powerful backer the United States stand noticeably isolated in the global arena following 21 November’s arrest warrants issued unanimously by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, with increasing numbers of European powers declaring that the World Court’s decision ‘should be respected and implemented’.

Apart from the European Union (EU), Britain, Canada, France, Portugal, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Ireland, Finland, Czech Republic, Slovenia made public statements signalling that Netanyahu and Gallant will risk arrest if any of them entered their territories.

The US, Israel and Sri Lanka are amongst countries which are not signatories to the Rome Statute so far.

In the Parliamentary election campaign, RW asked the voters not to send inexperienced people to Parliament and reiterated that only his team has the necessary experience. The results of both the Presidential and Parliamentary elections showed that RW had failed to convince the voters on this point, like the economy stupid slogan of the Clinton campaign. AKD, in his President’s address, disproved his critics. However, after the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, it is the economy stupid that is going to loom over Sri Lanka making it AKD’s biggest challenge

In both statements, PAKD diagnosed the historical Sri Lankan political landscape, fuelled by mistrust and division, and highlighted those affected groups on language, religion, culture, etc., and the isolation of such groups, whose equal rights, and identities were pruned in these processes. Now the regional electorate has placed confidence in PAKD and NPP, it is natural for the President to directly speak to the affected promising democratic governance and actions to massage their wounded hearts
