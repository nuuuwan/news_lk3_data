    "(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: The maverick with the Midas touch)",
    "Regarding his business empire East West, Nahil Wijesuriya explained how he decided on the name of the company. While he was working for P&O Lines based in London, he had been discussing with a friend how difficult it was to send goods from the West to the East.",
    "Then in an eureka moment it dawned on him that the name \u2018East West\u2019 would be ideal for an import/export business. This was a time there were restrictions on importing certain items to Sri Lanka with some folks even going to the extent of sending things like Wilkinson blades in aerogrammes to the island.",
    "Meanwhile, Vajira Wijewardena of Anglo Asian, fame was manufacturing blades at his Anglo Asian factory under the brand name \u2018Sharp\u2019 and helping fill the dearth in the market. Nahil says of these blades \u201cWhen you shave one side of your face you need a second blade to shave the other side!\u201d",
    "He registered the name East West Enterprises UK, following which he started his business by buying a supply of Parker pens, which were in great demand, to export them to Sri Lanka for sale.",
    "To cash in on the wholesale discount price, the buyers were required to submit a letter, written on a company letterhead to the wholesaler. To do this, he printed a few letterheads that read \u2018East West Enterprises United Kingdom\u2019 to secure the discount.",
    "Unfortunately, after all his trouble, the pen business did not turn out to be very lucrative for him, thanks to his friends. They took all his merchandise free of charge, before he could send the consignment to Colombo. That was the prelude to East West today, sans the pen-grabbing friends!",
    "When Nahil was working as Technical Manager at Ceylon Shipping Corporation in 1976, responsible for all the technical aspects of the fleet under his purview, Lester Weinman, a ship\u2019s captain, was the Operations Manager looking after the port and commercial activities.",
    "Nahil instinctively felt that given their experience, together they should start up a shipping company. Nahil and Lester had first hand experience with the lack of good shipping and cargo handling agents as sailors in various ports they would sail through including Sri Lanka. With the advent of the open economy in Sri Lanka 1977, Nahil, together with his friend Jothy Godage, launched East West Enterprises from Jothy\u2019s home, at Perera Lane, Wellawatte, and it was their first registered office. Subsequently, in 1978 they were joined by Capt. Lester Weinman and Mrs. Vinitha Jayasinghe, who were appointed to the Board by invitation. Mrs Jayasinghe was invited to join, since her husband. Mr. Upatissa Jayasinghe, who was the Commercial Manager of Ceylon Shippimg Corporation, had planned to leave CSC with Nahil in order to join the Board of East West Enterprises but was unable to do so.",
    "With Lester joining the company, they became the first and only seafarers to operate a shipping agency at the time. Since they needed financing to pay rent and fit out an office with essentials like a fax machine and furniture, they decided to sell their brand new cars which they had purchased with their foreign earnings. Nahil owned a Toyota Corolla Mark 11-2000 \u2013 it was a fancy car and the only road trip he took in it was on his honeymoon to Bentota with Indrani, his first wife. He sold it to Ceylon Tobacco Company, invested the proceeds in East West and bought himself a little Fiat 600 for his use. However Lester was dilly-dallying on whether he should sell his Peugeot 404 and by this time the business was on an upward curve, Lester\u2019s car was never sold.",
    "At the onset, Lester suggested that they start up East West Enterprises on the first floor of his home on Alvis Terrace, Colombo 03, owned by F.X.R. Pereira. Their primary need was to obtain a post office box number for the new enterprise. On applying to the General Post Office (GPO) they were lucky to get a three-digit abandoned number. 678. Usually before the issuance of a P.O. Box number, an officer from the GPO visits the business premises for an inspection and a mandatory requirement was a proper signage of the business. So Nahil rushed to Walkers, and got the name East West engraved on a sheet of Formica: and fixed it on the balcony of Lester\u2019s home so that everything was in place for the inspector\u2019s visit and licensing.",
    "To commence operations on a professional note, the letterheads and relevant documents had already been given for printing, when Nahil suddenly realized the next day that this space at Lester\u2019s was not going to be adequate. Coincidentally, a few days later he met a gentleman, Mr. Hector de Silva, who was a namesake and good friend of his father-in-law. This gentleman was an executive in the top rung of Ceylon Insurance Co., and he had an office at Ceylinco House.",
    "Nahil mentioned that he was meeting Mr. Pathmanathan, at Ceylinco regarding renting of space and to his amazement Mr. Silva, informed him that he would be retiring in six months, and that they were welcome to rent the office he occupied at Ceylinco House. He added that he was willing to sit outside the office until his retirement in a few months. So Nahil took him up on his offer; which was a room on the fourth floor of Ceylinco House. That was how East West Enterprises, the parent company of the diverse portfolio of East West Group of Companies, came to fruition.",
    "The company was registered towards the latter part of 1977, with Nahil and Jothy Godage as Directors, its principal business being ship handling and haulage. In a few years, it grew to be the largest shipping and haulage agents in the country. \u201cAll this was made possible due to the enthusiasm, hard work, focus, persistence and dedication in everything we did,\u201d says Nahil.",
    "There was a time during the initial stage of their shipping operations when they would drive to the airport with a typewriter, letterheads and seals in the boot of Lester\u2019s car. They would pretend to be clerks, and enter the customs arrival area. It is a customs department requirement that a letter of discharge is furnished by the handling agents of a particular vessel to clear each sailor on arrival before assigning them on-board another ship. He says one of them would run to the car park, type out of the letter, sign, set the seal and rushed it back to the customs officers, who would always question as to how they were able to get the clearance letters so fast.",
    "They spun a little fib about a clerk who rushes to the office, collects the letter and rushes back, or some such story. Fast-tracking an otherwise time-consuming operation was one more little thing that contributed towards their success.",
    "Towards the middle of September 1977, Indrani and Nahil were blessed with their son, Vajira. They were living in the Gower Street residence at the time of his birth. The first Wijesuriya of the",
    "third generation had arrived and Nahil was thrilled. After the intial excitement, things settled down and they got into a routine. Indrani was a stay-at-home mom. Vajira celebrated his 40th birthday a few years back I marvel at how fast the years have rolled by.",
    "We reverted to our discussion on Nahil\u2019s most endearing topic, his business empire \u2013 East West. It was the 1980s and the company at the time was on its way to \u2018greater things\u2019. As they expanded, diversifying into bunkering services, salvage and towage, a container freight station, haulage, a travel agency and a customs clearing house, each of these agencies, though singular in designated operations and with a three-way directorate, were steered through the shipping agency, their flagship company East West Enterprises.",
    "In the years leading up to the present, when Nahil took over as Chairman of the Group, he diversified into other areas such as real estate, hospitality, media and information technology, among a host of other minor operations. With the real estate boom in the mid to late \u201980s, he foresaw the long-term potential of the investment property market and divested most of the larger operations, going head on into real estate.",
    "Nahil is a citizen of Singapore and requires an annual visa to live in Sri Lanka. In the sphere of business, like his dad, he has always thought out of the box, at most times looked at the big picture, been bullish in business, and is extremely forward-thinking. All of these attributes have contributed tremendously to his business acumen. Many people have told Nahil that he has been very \u2018lucky\u2019 in business, to which he vehemently protests saying that it\u2019s utter nonsense. He says he has always been ready for a challenge and always looked at the downside in any venture, intelligently working through tough situations, thankfully ending up with excellent results. He is a major skeptic but believes it is divine intervention that has brought him to where he is today. \u201cDeep down I know I am blessed,\u201d says Nahil.",
