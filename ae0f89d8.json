    "Cricketing minnows Oman, coached by former Sri Lanka captain Duleep Mendis, pulled off a massive upset by beating Ireland by five wickets in their opening World Cup qualifier in Bulawayo on Monday, the Gulf sultanate's first-ever victory over a Test nation in an ODI.",
    "The other Group B match saw Sri Lanka crush the United Arab Emirates by 175 runs.",
    "George Dockrell hit 91 not out and Harry Tector 52 as Ireland reached a respectful 281 for seven wickets in their allotted 50 overs.",
    "But they hadn't counted on the fighting qualities of an Omani side for whom opener Kashyap Prajapati hit 72, while skipper Zeeshan Maqsood pitched in with 59, Aqib Ilyas 52 and Mohammad Nadeem 46 not out.",
    "A triumphant Maqsood said it was an \u201chonour\u201d to have beaten Ireland, eventually by five wickets with 11 balls remaining.",
    "\u201cIf we continue like this, some more results will be in our favour. It was a collective and combined performance, which we need to beat a good side. We came here to go there (to India) and play.\u201d Ireland captain Andy Balbirnie called the defeat \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe felt like we had a pretty good score,\u201d he said. \u201c280 in a one-day game is pretty good. They were hard to bowl to at times. We felt right in the game.",
    "\u201cOman's win didn't take us by surprise... it's a long tournament. We need to get back into it pretty quickly.\u201d"
