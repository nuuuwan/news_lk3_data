    "The average daily turnover, which was 1.49 billion before the September 21 election has more than doubled to 3.74 billion rupees after the election.",
    "\u201cMore than the election, it is about uncertainties going out of the window,\u201d Dimantha Mathew, Chief Research & Strategy Officer at First Capital Holdings PLC, told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cThere were political and policy level uncertainties. There were also uncertainties over the continuity of the IMF programme and the completion of the debt restructuring. However, they have been managed well. With that, the investor confidence has significantly improved.\u201d",
    "\u201cFalling interest rates also have contributed to the current situation. The investor mindset has changed and now they see the equity market as an avenue for higher return.\u201d",
    "However, the market has been mainly boosted by local buying with foreign investors still on the selling side, the official data showed.",

    "\u201cThe index gain is also because investors see increased corporate profitability,\u201d Mathew said.",
    "\u201cOur valuation is around 9 times. This means our stocks are still cheaper. But, of course we are still not out of woods.\u201d (Colombo/December 23/2024)"
