### Fitch assigns Hayleys Fentons first-time national rating of ‘A+(lka)’; outlook stable

Fitch Ratings has assigned Hayleys Fentons Ltd., (HFL) a National Long-Term Rating of ‘A+(lka)’. The outlook is stable.

The rating reflects HFL’s leading market share in domestic rooftop solar panel sales and installation, which drove cash flow in the financial year ending March 2025 (FY25), alongside slowing growth amid regulatory risks. Diversification into power generation over the next few years carries execution risk but could enhance revenue visibility, subject to the weak credit quality of the sole offtaker, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable).

HFL’s A+(lka) rating comprises its standalone credit profile of ‘a(lka)’ and a one-notch uplift for support from its stronger parent, Hayleys PLC (AAA(lka)/Stable), reflecting moderate operating incentives but low legal and strategic incentives.

### Palestinian leader pledges to work with Trump, others on UN-backed Gaza plan

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas pledged at the United Nations on Thursday to work with U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, France and the United Nations on a peace plan for Gaza overwhelmingly backed by the world body.

The 193-member U.N. General Assembly earlier this month overwhelmingly endorsed a seven-page declaration that aims to advance a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians and end the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants.

The declaration emerged from an international conference at the U.N. in July - hosted by Saudi Arabia and France - on the decades-long conflict. The United States and Israel boycotted the event and have rejected the international efforts.

Separately, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Wednesday that Trump had presented a 21-point peace plan for the Middle East and Gaza during a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries on the sidelines of this week’s U.N. General Assembly.

### Stark Realities Of A Medieval Genocide Hidden By Mainstream Media

Little boys whose hands and parts of their face or torso are being blown off from booby-trapped cans of food that soldiers had left behind for starving children; soldiers who leave behind, poisoned food for a starving people to eat, booby-trapped toys that explode when excited children picked them up are promoted as the world’s most moral army.

The harm they have been doing is diabolical, and yet, they expect you to believe they are the victims. Invoking a long-forgotten holocaust and screaming discrimination, they expect you to suspend fundamental human reason to believe that the daily sniping of children with so called “kill shots” to the head or chest and the bombing of entire neighbourhoods that bury families alive and wipe out whole bloodlines is self-defence and just.

It is a tragedy that we still follow the line expounded by the carbon emitters and polluters of the environment. We have accepted a high debt and fossil dependency scenario as the indicator of ‘Economic Development’. Our concerns with adaptation to the ongoing climate changes brought about by our own actions, seem to be minimal. The current disasters of fishermen getting caught in an sudden, random, wind events, are a foretaste of things to come. Sudden violent downpours that strip and erode the soil or delays in rain bearing winds that create harsh drought conditions, will become more frequent. The ‘climate affected’ population will grow with every event. We are witnessing the thin edge of the wedge.
