    "In Dubai\u2019s dazzling nightlife scene, where mainstream electronic dance music (EDM) often dominates, Sound of Harmonies (SOH Records) has carved out a bold new path for Progressive House \u2013 a subgenre of house music, originating in the UK in the early 1990s.",
    "Founded in January 2025 by Sri Lankans Halishan (Tuan Sabreen) and Alex \u2013 T (Alick Wiratunga) SOH is more than just a record label. It is a cultural movement redefining how the Middle East contributes to the global underground scene.",
    "One of the label\u2019s defining milestones came with the release of Avantime UK\u2019s debut EP \u2018Dusk and Dawn\u2019 on Sound of Harmonies Records, in early 2025.",
    "This massive release captured worldwide attention, supported by legends in the underground music scenario, including Hern\u00e1n Catt\u00e1neo, Subandrio, and Nick Warren.",
    "The EP also achieved the distinction of being featured twice in the Balance Croatia mix series (the mixes showcase a variety of progressive house and electronica artistes) \u2014 a testament to its quality and international impact.",
    "SOH\u2019s momentum doesn\u2019t stop there.

Each brings their own sonic identity, but all share a common thread: deep, authentic Progressive House that resonates beyond borders.",
    "What sets SOH apart is its mission to put Dubai on the global Progressive House map. For too long, the UAE has been associated with luxury-driven festivals and commercial sounds. SOH is rewriting that story, proving that underground music culture can thrive in the region. By joining Proton\u2019s respected global platform, the label ensures every release travels far beyond the Middle East, reaching fans in Europe, South America, Asia, and beyond.",
