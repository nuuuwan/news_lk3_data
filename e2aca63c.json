    "Sri Lanka thumped Zimbabwe by 8 wickets to take the series by 2-0 on Thursday (11th January) in a rain-curtailed match. Hasaranga humbled Zimbabwe with his career-best show.",
    "He tore apart Zimbabwe\u2019s batting lineup with his venomous bowling as he picked up 7 wickets to bundle Zimbabwe for a measly 96, which Sri Lanka chased down easily.",
    "Earlier, Zimbabwe won the toss and opted to bat first. Coming out to bat, they were all at sea facing Wanindu Hasaranga.",
    "Hasaranga was breathing fire as he removed both of the openers in a blink of an eye. He then went for taking Craig Ervine and Milton Sumba, Zimbabwe were falling apart and had no clue in front of the Sri Lankan attack. However, Hasaranga\u2019s 7 fer was enough to bundle Zimbabwe out for a paltry 96 runs.",
    "In reply, Daniel was scratchy and scored 12 off 28 balls. While Avishka Fernando was gone for a 4 ball duck. But Kusal Mendis had no respect for the opposition as he started to smoke things around the park from the very start of his innings. He scored a good-looking 66 off 51 deliveries. Samarawickrama had to do a finishing touch and he did it pretty well with his 14* off 17 balls to take his side home with 8 wickets remaining. With the win Sri Lanka won the ODI series by 2-0 and the T20 series will commence from 14th January."
