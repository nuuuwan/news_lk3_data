  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lankan musicians are generally seen, and heard, in Europe, Canada, the States, Australia, and the Middle East.",
    "How about China! Perhaps, we may think China is not the ideal place for western musicians, and their kind of music, but Nisha Peiris, from Sri Lanka, has proved otherwise.",
    "Nisha has been in the music scene for quite a while, generally performing in Europe. However, after marriage, he is on the move as his wife\u2019s work takes her to different countries, every three to four years.",
    "After completing almost five years in South Africa, they are now in Guangzhou, China.",
    "All this happened in 2021 and Nisha says it wasn\u2019t the ideal time to move to China as Covid restrictions were quite tough, at that point in time, although the live music scene was still active.",
    "\u201cA couple of weeks, after settling down, I started doing my usual \u2018band hunting\u2019 which I generally do when we move to a new destination.",
    "Nisha says he got to know many other musicians, while performing with the American band, and gradually got involved in the music scene in Guangzhou.",
    "According to Nisha, there are over 50,000 expats living in this province and, among them, there are many brilliant musicians from all over the world, plus countless entertainment venues, bars, pubs, and restaurants, featuring local and foreign bands, playing western music.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to impress, from the very beginning, and the loud cheers that I get, especially from the Chinese audience, when I say I\u2019m from Sri Lanka, is very encouraging, indeed. What\u2019s more although many Chinese do not speak much English, they love English music.\u201d",
    "In addition to performing with bands, in Guangzhou, Nisha also does solo gigs, and has even played with Chinese bands \u2013 and being the only non-Chinese member in the lineup.",
    "\u201cChinese musicians are so musically educated and quite easy to work with. I generally play my choice of music (Blues) when performing with them.\u201d",
    "Nisha also mentioned that he has got an opportunity to work with a Chinese guitar company, called Laviere Guitars, doing their promotional work, including visiting mega guitar factories, etc.",
    "And, guess what! The Laviere guitar company turned out a NISHA PEIRIS Signature Guitar and they even send Nisha their top notch guitars for him to use at his gigs.",
    "A few weeks ago, Nisha, who hails from Moratuwa, performed in Melbourne, for the very first time, in front of his old school mates, at the CAMBRIANS (Prince of Wales College) dinner dance.",
    "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m away from Sri Lanka, I still have a healthy relationship with both the old and young musicians, back home.",
    "\u201cI always love to share my musical knowledge, and experience, with the youngsters, and I\u2019m happy to guide whoever who seeks my advice.\u201d",
