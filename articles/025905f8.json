    "Russia\u2019s Tass news agency said a tsunami of 3 to 4 meters was recorded in a district on the Kamchatka Peninsula.",
    "The Japanese weather agency initially sent a tsunami advisory but upgraded it to a warning after the preliminary magnitude of the quake off the Russian Far East was revised upward from an initial 8.0.",
    "The quake registered 2 on Japan\u2019s seismic intensity scale of 7 in Hokkaido.",

    "At the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex, which is undergoing decommissioning following the 2011 quake-tsunami disaster, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. instructed workers to evacuate to elevated locations.",
    "Following its procedures for natural disasters, the company manually halted the release of the wastewater at 9:05 a.m.",
