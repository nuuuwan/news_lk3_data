SLRSMU leader Somata Somata Somaratne said he was holding a media briefing on these issues over the past few days.

‚ÄúToday, by the Railway General Manager, some subordinate authorities are unable to provide the right solution to the problems that arise.

Accordingly, our trade union action will continue on the basis of a discussion held with the Secretary or Minister of the Ministry tomorrow.

‚ÄúThe Railway Department has failed to provide the necessary facilities for passengers and maintain rail services. Trains are canceled daily or derailed.

We can't allocate the machine for an additional school train from Nanuoya to Kandy. During the last government, we were on strike, but we were forced to ignore our demands due to administrative issues, ‚ÄùSomatna said.

Former minister accuses PM of misleading public on salary hike claims.

üü©

Former minister Kanjana Wijesekera has accused Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya of a recent comment on the proposal of the state sector's salary.

Kanjana Wickremesinghe has posted on his X page that Ranil Wickremesinghe's former government has taken all necessary measures to recognize the salary hike for public servants since January 2025.

‚ÄúThe approval of the Cabinet was appointed to appoint a committee and to evaluate the state sector and pay hikes by May 2024. The group met with trade unions and shareholders and discussed public sector issues. The recommendations of the committee were handed over to the President and submitted to the Cabinet and approved by August 2024, ‚Äùhe said.

He added that the Cabinet approved in August 2024 to allocate the necessary funds for the 2025 budget proposals.

Kanchana Wijesekera said that the committee included the officials of the Treasury, Budget Department, Management Services and other required shareholders.

The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SL CERT) today issued an alert to the public about the surge in fake messages being disseminated via social media and communication platforms, particularly WhatsApp.

These deceptive messages are designed to fraudulently obtain personal and financial information by impersonating credible institutions, including banks, commercial organizations, and international bodies, according to the SL CERT.

Recent observations by Sri Lanka CERT indicate that cybercriminals are using social media platforms, fake websites, SMS, and even postal services to reach potential victims. In many cases, these messages falsely promise donations, monetary rewards, high-value products, or services and request sensitive information, including One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

By interacting with these fraudulent messages or clicking on embedded links, individuals risk exposing their personal data to criminal misuse, including financial fraud and identity theft, it added.

Harini Amarasuriya denies Ranil Wickremesinghe's claim about raising civil servant salaries, citing lack of implementation steps. She accuses him of making false promises to voters.

üü©

Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya has said that despite the Cabinet decision to increase the salaries of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the procedures for implementing the resolution have not been followed.

‚ÄúAlthough Ranil Wickremesinghe claims to have decided to raise the salary of civil servants, it is evident that it was not recognized by the consent of the Treasury or Finance Ministry when reviewing the Cabinet decision.

A decision was announced, but the necessary measures were not taken to implement it. So, what does it mean?This clearly points out the false promise made to mislead the civilians during the election, ‚Äùhe said at a public meeting held on October 27.
