    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 An event to celebrate Matariki \u2013 the M\u0101ori New Year was held at BMICH, Colombo on Friday (14).\u00a0Matariki is a special occasion in the New Zealand calendar which marks the start of the M\u0101ori New Year.",
    "Often referred to as the M\u0101ori lunar new year, the festival of Matariki marks the mid-winter rising period of its namesake constellation \u2013 commonly known as the Pleiades \u2013 and signifies a time of beginnings and endings, coming together, remembrance of the dead, and traditionally, the planning of crops and planting.",
    "Matariki can be a time to farewell the dead, honour ancestors and celebrate life.\u00a0It's also a reminder of one's responsibility to the whenua or land and environment.",
    "While there's no one way to celebrate, many New Zealanders will spend time with loved ones over some kai or food. Friday's event was also held to mark the official commemoration of the \u00a0New Zealand High Commission's opening which has been deferred since mid-2021 due to a combination of COVID-19, the Sri Lanka economic crisis, and developments in New Zealand.",
    "Speaking at the event High Commissioner of New Zealand Michael Appleton spoke about the bilateral relationships between the two countries.\u00a0\"Our Matariki holiday is about unity, renewal, celebration, hope, and a new beginning\", said the High Commissioner.",
    "He added that the celebration gives New Zealanders a chance to pause, reflect and look optimistically towards the future.\u00a0The high commissioner stated that given the themes of Matariki, which are renewal and new beginnings, it would be very appropriate to celebrate the official opening of the High Commission of New Zealand in Sri Lanka.",
    "\"Over the past two years and challenging circumstances for Sri Lanka, and indeed the world, we have sought to cowrite a new chapter in the relations between our two countries\", said High Commissioner Appleton.",
    "He stated that the reason behind the establishment of the High Commission is to renew the connections between the two countries' governments, economies and societies, and take it to the next level.\u00a0Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Dinesh Gunawardena was\u00a0the Chief Guest of the event.",
    "Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister Gunawardena said that he was certain the establishment of the High Commission \u00a0would forge stronger links between the two countries, focusing primarily on advancing economic relations, trade, education, investment partnership, especially in the field of animal husbandry, livestock development and also in the support extended in the economic reforms that Sri Lanka is proceeding with.\u00a0Diplomats, state officials and several parliamentarians also participated in the event.",
