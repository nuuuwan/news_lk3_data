    "The National Movement for Social Justice Chairperson and former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, emphasised the critical need for good governance, asserting that it is not a luxury but a necessity in today\u2019s world.",
    "Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Institute of Democracy and Governance (IDAG) in Colombo yesterday, Jayasuriya expressed concern over the current political leadership in Sri Lanka, noting a departure from the values upheld by past leaders such as D.S. Senanayake and Don Baron Jayatilaka, as well as their successors. He lamented that self-interest and scandals now seem to overshadow the commitment to serving the public.",
    "Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, reflecting on his time as a lawmaker, highlighted the significance of honourable leadership, stating that true leadership is demonstrated through actions, not words. He noted that Sri Lanka is at a pivotal moment, grappling with numerous challenges, and one undeniable truth has emerged: good governance is no longer a luxury but a necessity for the country.",
    "Speaking at the inauguration of the Institute of Democracy and Governance (IDAG), which coincided with his 84th birthday, Jayasuriya emphasised that the institute is not just the realisation of his vision, but a reflection of the values and principles he upheld throughout his public life.",
    "He expressed hope that IDAG will help restore the values that once guided Sri Lanka\u2019s political leaders, training future leaders while instilling in them the ideals of democracy, decency, and honest public service. He stressed that only through good governance can the nation achieve lasting progress, peace, and prosperity.",
    "Delivering the keynote address, veteran civil servant Austin Fernando emphasised the urgent need for a systematic overhaul in Sri Lanka, echoing recent remarks by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya. He highlighted that governance today is plagued by corrupt deals and non-transparent procurement processes, while those identified as the \u201cfinancial assassins\u201d behind Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis remain unpunished and continue with their lives.",
    "Fernando pointed out that the public widely believes that more politicians and bureaucrats should be held accountable and face the law, beyond those who have already been brought to justice. He underscored the importance of inclusive citizen participation in governance, calling it a cornerstone of transparent nation-building.",
    "IDAG will offer educational programs, conduct community engagement initiatives and actionable research on democratic governance. The Institute, a brain child of Karu Jayasuriya will also focus on leadership development, policy advocacy, civic education, policy reforms and public accountability. According to IDAG, their aim is to cultivate a new generation of leaders equipped to address contemporary governance challenges.",
    "The event was graced by diplomats, politicians, academics, professionals, civil society activists, and other distinguished dignitaries. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the IDAG and the Institute of Politics, establishing a partnership for implementing the courses offered through IDAG.",
    "During the ceremony, Karu Jayasuriya also awarded scholarships to a select group of students, offering them the opportunity to study Democracy, Decentralisation and Local Governance at the newly inaugurated IDAG."
