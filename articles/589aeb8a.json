    "That\u2019s the subject being discussed at the moment, and for good reasons, as well.",
    "When one talks about National Costume the reference is obviously to clothing that represents a country\u2019s culture, history, and people. It can also reflect a country\u2019s industry, beauty, and character.",
    "National costumes, traditionally worn by people from a particular country, especially on special occasions, or for formal ceremonies, can be a source of national pride and can provide clues about a country\u2019s heritage, geography, and history.",
    "However, the National Costume section, in these beauty pageants, for both men and women, has given a new meaning to this attire, and many are of the opinion that it would be appropriate to rename this section as Most Creative Costume.",
    "According to Google, the usage of the term \u2018costume\u2019 is more limited to unusual or out-of-date clothing and attire intended to evoke a change in identity, such as theatrical, Halloween, and mascot costumes\u2026and, I would add, a fancy dress parade or, in our part of the world, perhaps even a devil dancing ceremony!",
    "And the weight of some of these costumes, where even the contestant finds it difficult to move about freely, trying to keep the headgear and other accessories from falling apart, does take its toll on the wearer, and it happened at the recent Mr. World 2024 contest held in Vietnam, when Vietnam\u2019s representative collapsed backstage and required assistance from his team to remove the costume he was wearing for the National Costume segment.",
    "What\u2019s more, beauty pageants are popping up like mushrooms here and quite a few of them are unheard-of. What a waste of money, time and energy.",
    "I\u2019ve also been told that some of the local winners have to fork out quite a tidy sum to go for the international event.",
    "I believe local beauty pageants should have some level of centralization and coordination, laws, regulations and industry standards.",
    "Of course, there are local pageants that are well organised, and done in a very professional way, and kudos to the people responsible for such pageants.",
    "What also caught my attention, on social media, was a visual referring to child modelling.",
    "Kids need to be in school, LEARNING, and not being groomed, at this tender age, to be a model.",
    "What are the Education authorities doing, and also the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, and the National Child Protection Authority?",
    "Let\u2019s hope the new setup will move into action before it\u2019s\u2026yes, what comes to mind is the late Desmond Kelly\u2019s \u2018Too Late for Regrets.\u2019",
