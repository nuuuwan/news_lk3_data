    "The Hambantota International Port (HIP) supported a joint initiative by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) and the Hambantota Chamber of Commerce, which are on an initiative to attract investments into the southern hinterland of Sri Lanka. In line with JETRO\u2019s business engagement in India, the delegation of investors consisted mainly of Japan-based business organizations with branch offices in India and some in Sri Lanka, an HIP news release said.",
    "\u201cHIP is keen to support investment events of this nature as they open up opportunities for investors to do business on a regional level from the south of the island.\u00a0 The opportunity for Japanese companies operating in India and Sri Lanka to look at the deep south to build industry is timely at this particular juncture of Sri Lankan history.\u00a0 The rapid development process taking place at our port and the establishment of the last pillar of HIP\u2019s master plan, which is container operations, will vastly support the development of industries in the southern hinterland,\u201d says Wilson Qu, CEO of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG)",
    "During their visit, the delegates participated in a short familiarization tour of HIP, where they observed the port\u2019s facilities and engaged with its officials.
