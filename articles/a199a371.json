    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers have approved a concessional loan scheme at 4 percent interest to encourage younger people into the agricultural and industrial sectors, minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.",
    "\u201cIt has been proposed to provide a maximum loan facility of 5 million rupees to a beneficiary,\u201d Jayatissa told reporters.",
    "A 4 percent interest is to be charged per annum and the scheme will be implemented over 5 years.",
    "\u201cThe lack of concessional financial facilities has been identified as an obstacle to creating entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector.\u201d",
    "This reduces the attractiveness of agriculture for young entrepreneurs, increases the amount of uncultivated land and reduces food production, he said.",

    "The government\u2019s objective is to create 50,000 agricultural entrepreneurs within 5 years, Jayatissa said."
