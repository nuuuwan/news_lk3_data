    "The Colombo High Court has fixed 15 October for the next pre-trial conference in the case against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and his family over alleged unlawful acquisition of assets worth about Rs. 97 million. The case was filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.",
    "Rambukwella, his wife, three daughters, and son-in-law appeared before High Court Judge Mohamed Mihal when the matter was taken up yesterday.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, representing Rambukwella, told the Court that 12 documents required by the defence had not yet been provided. He argued that indictments had been filed without handing over these papers, which he described as an irregular move.",
    "CIABOC Assistant Director General Subhashini Siriwardena said efforts were being made to trace and release the requested documents, though some were tied to ongoing inquiries.",
    "The judge directed the Commission to supply the documents without delay and listed the case for a further pre-trial conference on 15 October. The indictment covers the period between August 2020 and June 2024, during which Rambukwella served as Minister of Mass Media, Health and Environment. The prosecution alleges that he and his family unlawfully accumulated assets and property during this time."
