    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Bolivia has authorized 27 companies to import fuel, breaking the monopoly of state-run Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) media reports said, as fuel shortages and queues hit the country amid foreign exchange shortages.",
    "\u201cI went to the pump on Calle 35 in Chasquipampa and there was nothing, then to the one on Calle 21 in Los Pinos and there was none either,\u201d a fuel user was quoted as saying by the publication El Diario.",
    "In late November even worse queues and diesel and petroleum had bigger shortages, the newspaper said.",
    "Bolivia was once a natural gas exporter and the YPFB was broken up and privatized under a rightwing president.",
    "However, the domestic currency Boliviano collapsed from around 6.0 to the US dollar to 2,000 to 7.4 to the US dollar two years later as macroeconomists printed money.",
    "In the inflation and stabilization crisis that followed, leftist President Eva Morales came to power amid public protests.",
    "Under the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) or Movement Towards the Left , the petroleum sector was partially re-nationalized due to lack of exploration as resources were frittered away.",
    "The country was now importing fuel with YPFB having a monopoly. Energy SOEs have been key reasons for the driving credit in countries with central banks with flexible inflation style regimes (intermediate regimes) including  Venezuela, Ecuador (before dollarization) and more recently in Laos.",
    "Authorities had said private imports of fuel would be allowed to be sold at market prices, though reports said there was still not enough clarity on how it will be done.",
    "Sri Lanka also invited private companies to operate as the policy rate and sterilized interventions created forex shortages.",
    "Private businesses in Bolivia had warned in November that the economic model of the MAS that started 20 years ago had now run its course.",
    "\u201cThe private sector notes that the current economic model has been exhausted with critical results for society as a whole,\u201d business chambers were quoted as saying after a meeting on November 21.",
    "\u201cConsequently, it is urgently necessary to open a new economic cycle with an emphasis on the market with a broad and active participation of the private sector and Bolivian families.\u201d",
    "The President of the Chamber of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Cainco), Jean Pierre, said that the lack of diesel endangers food security and that summer planting was already two weeks late.",
    "The Bolivian economy and agriculture sector is also crippled by price controls, reports said. Chambers had also warned against price controls, saying it was leading to a collapse in production.",
    "Sri Lanka also has price controls on rice, amid rising excess liquidity in the banking system.",
    "Large volumes of the national budget went for fuel subsidies. In 2021, 439 million dollars was budgeted for fuel subsidies which had grown to 1.42 billion by 2024.",
    "For next year 2.1 billion dollars are expected to be spent on fuel subsidies amid rising budget deficits.",
    "When macro economists resist market interest rates with open market operations or direct financing of the budget to maintain inteest rates, exchange rate pegs break and economies collapse.",
    "In a budget law for 2025, the Central Bank of Bolivia has been authorized to \u201cgrant an extraordinary loan on concessional terms in favor of the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance\u201d Ed Diario reported.",
    "Though the official exchange rate is 6.9 Bolivianos to the dollar, the unofficial rate was more than 11 to the dollar, reports said.",
    "Parallel exchange rates can reduce central bank interventions and the consequent printing of money to maintain its policy rate by replacing lost liquidity in the banking system through inflationary open market operations after the intervention.",
    "However, unless rates are raised and money printing halted, the credit system will continue to face forex shortages and parallel exchange rates.",
    "In Sri Lanka when the official exchange rate was 200 to the US dollar, there were several parallel exchange rates within and without the banking system running up to 240 to the US dollar.",
    "An attempt to float the currency (end interventions) in March 2022 failed due to a surrender rule (which is an intervention), and the rupee collapsed to 360 to the US dollar.",
    "Rates were then hiked with the rupee re-pegged at 360 to the US dollar until credit slowed.",
    "Amid forex shortages Sri Lanka liberalized fuel imports. First aviation fuel was allowed to be imported, then bunker operators brought diesel for industries in dollarized payments.",
    "Three private firms were also given distributor licenses, on the initial condition that they will import fuel for one year with their own foreign exchange.",
    "In Sri Lanka, a nationalist administration led by then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was kicked out in the initial inflation crisis from rate cuts, and a more market oriented interim administration under President Ranil Wickremesinghe was kicked out in the stabilization crisis."
