    "\u201cOnce the evaluation committee went through the initial evaluation, they saw that only two proposals can be implemented according to the technical and financial capabilities.

    "\u201cOnce they give back the RFPs, then they will be evaluated. There is no restriction on the capacity. That is up to the company to decide. We have only given a minimum amount of investment. The minimum investment if at all it is around $4 billion.\u201d (Colombo/July 04/2023)"
