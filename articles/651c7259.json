    "In an exciting new study, researchers have unveiled rare and fascinating instances of intrageneric predation and cannibalism in monitor lizards (Varanus), behaviours that are seldom documented in the wild. The study, led by Przemyslaw Zdunek, Geemal Harold, and Suranjan Karunarathna, highlights several significant observations from across the globe, shedding light on how these large, carnivorous reptiles interact with each other and how predatory behaviour plays a role in their survival strategies.",
    "Suranjan Karunarathna, one of the lead researchers, speaking to The Island explained that monitor lizards have long been recognised as opportunistic predators, consuming a wide range of food sources, from small mammals and reptiles to birds and fish.",
    "However, he said that their new research introduces an intriguing layer to their ecological profile: Varanus species, especially larger ones, not only hunt a variety of prey but also engage in cannibalism and predation within their own genus.",
    "\u201cThe idea that monitor lizards might prey on one another is not new,\u201d Karunarathna stressed. \u201cBut our study provides the first direct observations of adult Varanus salvator salvator\u2014the Sri Lankan Water Monitor  Kabara goya\u2014preying on an adult Varanus bengalensis, the Bengal Monitor, in the wild.\u201d This observation, which took place in Weerawila, Sri Lanka, provides crucial insight into the aggressive and predatory behaviours of monitor lizards that have typically been overlooked.",
    "The documented interaction was striking. The larger Varanus salvator\u2014estimated at 200 cm in length\u2014initiated an aggressive wrestling match with a smaller Varanus bengalensis\u00a0Tala goya (about 120 cm in length). After an intense struggle that lasted nearly 40 minutes, the Varanus salvator succeeded in overpowering its opponent, biting and eventually swallowing it whole. \u201cWhat was particularly striking in this case was how the larger monitor lizard held the smaller one by the neck for several minutes, ensuring it was immobilised before swallowing it headfirst,\u201d Karunarathna explained.",
    "This type of predation is highly energy-intensive and, as the researchers noted, involves a calculated risk. \u201cSwallowing large prey whole requires the predator to carefully overpower its victim and ensure it\u2019s fully subdued before consumption,\u201d Karunarathna pointed out. Such predation offers substantial nutritional benefits, but also comes with the potential for failure, which can drain valuable energy reserves. Despite these risks, the nutritional payoff from such large prey may explain why monitor lizards engage in such behaviours when possible.",
    "Beyond Sri Lanka, other noteworthy instances of cannibalism were observed in Singapore and Bali. In the Kranji Coastal Nature Park in Singapore, an adult Varanus salvator macromaculatus was seen holding a smaller Varanus nebulosus, a Clouded Monitor, in its mouth, shaking its prey before disappearing into the forest. Karunarathna also recalled an alarming observation in Bali where a sub adult Varanus salvator bivittatus was seen with a juvenile of the same species in its jaws, trying to shake and swallow it.",
    "These cases of cannibalism among Varanus species reinforce the idea that these reptiles, like many other carnivorous animals, are opportunistic when it comes to food sources. While they typically target smaller prey, monitor lizards are also capable of engaging in violent, cannibalistic encounters when the opportunity arises.",
    "\u201cCannibalism and intrageneric predation may not be as uncommon as previously thought,\u201d Karunarathna said. \u201cOur observations suggest that, in the right circumstances, cannibalism might be a more frequent occurrence among monitor lizards, particularly in situations where food is scarce or competition for resources is high.\u201d The ability of monitor lizards to prey on conspecifics may allow them to reduce competition for food and territory, ensuring the survival of the dominant individuals.",
    "A surprising cultural perspective emerged from the Weerawila area in Sri Lanka, where local villagers initially misinterpreted the aggressive encounters between the two monitor lizards as courtship rather than predation. Karunarathna explained, \u201cVillagers\u00a0in Sri Lanka believe that these violent interactions are mating rituals, not fights for survival. They also hold the belief that such encounters between Varanus species create new \u2018poisonous\u2019 animals, which leads them to avoid hunting or killing monitor lizards.\u201d This cultural belief, whether rooted in myth or misunderstanding, has inadvertently contributed to the conservation of monitor lizards in that region, as villagers avoid killing these animals despite the potential risks they pose.",
    "Interestingly, these insights are not just valuable for the field of herpetology but also highlight the intricate relationships between culture and wildlife conservation. While the villagers\u2019 beliefs may not align with the scientific understanding of monitor lizard behaviour, their avoidance of hunting these animals has undoubtedly benefited local monitor populations. \u201cThis shows how human cultural practices can sometimes inadvertently align with conservation goals, providing unintended protection for these animals,\u201d said Karunarathna.",
    "In addition to the documented predation events, the researchers also discussed the broader implications for monitor lizards\u2019 ecological roles. \u201cMonitor lizards, by virtue of their size and diet, occupy an important ecological niche as both predators and scavengers,\u201d said Karunarathna. Their ability to consume large prey, including other reptiles, allows them to control populations of smaller species, contributing to the overall balance of their ecosystems.",
    "The observations presented in this study broaden our understanding of monitor lizard behaviour, particularly their feeding strategies and social dynamics. \u201cThese rare predatory events shed light on the adaptability and ecological significance of monitor lizards, revealing that their diet is far more varied and opportunistic than we previously realised,\u201d Karunarathna added.",
    "He also said that with further studies on monitor lizard behaviour, particularly in their natural habitats, they hope to uncover even more about the ecological roles these reptiles play, as well as the evolutionary advantages that behaviours like cannibalism and intrageneric predation may confer. These findings also highlight the importance of preserving monitor lizard habitats, which support not only these fascinating creatures but also the delicate ecological systems they help maintain.",
