ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has affirmed People’s Leasing & Finance’s (PLC) National Long-Term Rating at ‘A-(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The rating reflects PLC’s financial strength as a large finance and leasing company (FLC) focusing on vehicle financing and other asset-backed loans, Fitch said.

“A gradual easing in vehicle import bans may further underpin growth, albeit with some collateral value risk.”

PLC’s franchise also benefits from the linkages with its parent, state-owned People’s Bank (A(lka)/Stable), the country’s second-largest bank, the rating agency said.

Fitch noted that the operating environment for Sri Lanka’s finance and leasing companies (FLCs) continues to stabilise, with improving GDP growth.

“We expect PLC’s core vehicle financing business to benefit from improving economic conditions and the potential liberalisation of vehicle imports.”

Here's a summary of the key points in approximately 200 characters:



Sri Lankan politicians often prioritize personal interests over national needs. The Japanese Ambassador notes lack of transparency in trade practices. Current government maintains IMF program structure. Corruption remains a significant issue, hindering foreign investment. Delays in customs processes affect business operations. Political figures like former Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva have been accused of demanding bribes. Overall, political instability and corruption continue to impact Sri Lanka's economic development and foreign relations.

🟩

There are opportunities for Sri Lankan politicians to act on their interests, they are looking forward to their interests, Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Missukoshi Hidaygi said.

He said that there is no open trade environment in Sri Lanka, but Japanese companies do not follow the rules.

The Ambassador, who stated that they are not bribed, "he said," it is customary for Japanese to leave the country. "

Question - We are currently in the midst of the IMF plan. How far you are confident that the current government will continue to carry out this?

Answer: I have already negotiated with the President's Foreign Minister. With these negotiations, the new government is concerned that the new government is maintaining the main structure of the IMF program.

They have re -appointed the Secretary of the Treasury, who was negotiating with the International Monetary Fund.

This is the best signal that the new government respects the agreement with the International Monetary Fund.

The main reason for the Supreme Court finding Sirisena responsible was the assertion that he had been made aware of a prior intelligence warning of the attack, which killed 280 and wounded 500.

An Indian intelligence agency had provided details of the impending attack.
