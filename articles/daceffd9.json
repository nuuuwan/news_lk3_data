    "About 40 people including children have died in a stampede at a Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) rally held by popular South Indian actor, Joseph Vijay Chandraskehar, popularly known as Vijay. Tens of thousands of people who had been waiting to catch a glimpse of their hero surged forth when he began his speech, according to media reports. Tamil Nadu and the Centre have reportedly launched probes into the tragic incident, and Chandrasekhar has promised to compensate the families of the victims. Chief Minister M. K. Stalin, the BJP and the Congress are likely to go all out to use Saturday\u2019s tragedy to discredit Vijay, who poses a formidable challenge to them.",
    "However, people, driven by herd instinct, do not behave rationally, and the TVK rallies are likely to draw even bigger crowds in the future, enabling the actor-turned-politician to realise his political dreams. This part of the world is notorious for the deification of celluloid heroes, and other such characters including self-proclaimed messiahs, who thrive on people\u2019s ignorance, credulousness and blind faith. Worryingly, the gullible electors who are easy prey for cunning politicians and others of their ilk have the numerical strength to sway the outcomes of popular elections.",
    "Education, science and information technology have made vast strides, but many people are still driven by herd instinct when making political decisions. There are situations where they behave just like lemmings or wildebeests that cross the Mara River, infested with crocodiles. The supporters of actor Vijay couldn\u2019t have been unaware of the danger of being in a seething crowd, India being no stranger to deadly stampedes.",
    "Crafty politicians and (other) con artists make the most of people\u2019s susceptibility to mass hysteria to achieve their goal of savouring power and enriching themselves further. The rapid expansion of social media reach has enabled them to dupe the masses effectively. Herd instinct dominates a society during crises, as was seen in this country during the Covid-19 pandemic and at the height of the economic crisis (2022), when people took to the streets in their thousands mostly in response to social media posts. We had many people rushing to a far-flung village in Kegalle and pushing and shoving to obtain some kind of herbal syrup touted by a shaman as a cure for Covid-19. The conman took even the so-called educated Sri Lankans for a ride, and made a killing before having himself vaccinated against Covid-19! Some years ago, we had large crowds of people flocking near religious statues, claiming that they could see what they described as rays miraculously emanating from those concrete objects. Numerous instances of religious pareidolia\u2014seeing sacred images that do not really exist\u2014have also been reported.",
    "As for the dominant role played by herd instinct and mass hysteria in politics, one may recall Nietzsche\u2019s words of wisdom. Various theories are based on the assumption that people make rational decisions, but Nietzsche was one of the thinkers who challenged the so-called supremacy of reason, and argued that human life was deeply shaped by instincts, drives, metaphors and irrational forces. The behaviour of electors in developing countries, especially in South Asia, has arguably vindicated him. Most South Indian film stars have nothing to offer by way of skills to support their claim that they will be able improve the people\u2019s lot; even their edge-of-the-seat movie stunts are performed by others, but they use their popularity to secure positions of power at the expense of the educated, intelligent and capable individuals. Here in this land like no other, the people of Gampaha once elected a teledrama actress to Parliament. They did so while preening themselves on their high literacy rate! The star even beat very senior politicians in the race in terms of preferential votes, and subsequently admitted in a television interview that she had no knowledge of the country\u2019s Constitution.",
    "What is known as \u2018emotional contagion\u2019, the \u2018bandwagon effect\u2019, etc., usually take precedence over reasoned analysis of policies and principles of politicians and political parties in South Asian electoral contests. The last two general elections in Sri Lanka serve as examples.",
