  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. PresidentDonald Trump on Saturday said he was directing the U.S. military to deploy to Portland, Oregon and to protect federal immigration facilities against \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d, saying he was authorizing them to use \u201cfull force, if necessary.\u201d",
    "Ordering the latest crackdown on a Democrat-led city, Trump said in a social media post that he was directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u201cto provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.\u201d",
    "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, who like other Oregon officials learned of Trump\u2019s order from social media, said: \u201cThe number of necessary troops is zero, in Portland and any other American city. The president will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it.\u201d",
    "Violent crime in Portland has dropped in the first six months of 2025, data show. Homicides fell by 51% compared to the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary data released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association in its Midyear Violent Crime Report. That report showed Portland had 17 homicides in the period compared with 56 in Louisville, Kentucky, and 124 in Memphis, Tennessee, which have comparable population sizes.",
    "In a press conference on Saturday, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, rejected the need for troops and said she spoke with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
    "\u201cThere is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city,\u201d Kotek said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to continue communicating that to the president, and I hope he will be open to reconsidering the deployment.\u201d",
    "U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, wrote on X that Trump \u201cmay be replaying the 2020 playbook and surging into Portland with the goal of provoking conflict and violence.\u201d",
    "In 2020, protests erupted in downtown Portland, the Pacific Northwest enclave with a reputation as a liberal city, following the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The protests dragged on for months and some civic leaders at the time said they were spurred rather than quelled by Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops.",
    "It was unclear whether Trump\u2019s warning that U.S. troops could use \u201cfull force\u201d on the streets of Portland meant he was somehow authorizing lethal force and, if so, under what conditions. U.S. troops are able to use force in self-defense on domestic U.S. deployments.",
    "The Pentagon did not offer any clarification about whether Trump was deploying National Guard, active-duty troops or perhaps a mix of the two, as was the case in Los Angeles earlier this year.",
    "\u201cWe stand ready to mobilize U.S. military personnel in support of DHS operations in Portland at the President\u2019s direction. The Department will provide information and updates as they become available,\u201d said Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesperson.",
    "Asked about the Portland decision on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents needed to be protected amid protests against immigration raids.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to put up with it. This administration is not playing games,\u201d she said in an interview on Fox News.",
    "Portland Police Chief Bob Day said there had already been an increase in federal law enforcement in recent days to bolster security at the ICE facility in the city\u2019s southwest.",
    "There have been growing tensions in major U.S. cities over Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration crackdown days after a shooting targeting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others seriously wounded.",
    "On Thursday, Trump told reporters that \u201ccrazy people\u201d were trying to burn buildings in Portland. \u201cThey\u2019re professional agitators and anarchists,\u201d he said, without providing evidence.",
    "Trump last week signed an executive order that declares the anti-fascist antifa, opens new tabmovement a domestic \u201cterrorist organization\u201d as part of a crackdown on what he claims is left-wing-sponsored political violence.",
    "According to U.S. law enforcement, there has never been a terrorist incident in the United States connected to antifa. Trump first sought to designate the movement as a domestic terror organization during the nationwide George Floyd protests.",
    "The most notorious episode involving the movement occurred in Portland in August 2020, when Michael Reinoehl, a self-identified antifa supporter, shot and killed Aaron \u201cJay\u201d Danielson, a member of the far-right group Patriot Prayer.",
    "Reinoehl was killed by federal and local law enforcement officers during an attempt to arrest him.",
    "Trump has made crime a major focus of his administration even as violent crime rates have fallen in many U.S. cities. His crackdown on municipalities led by Democrats including Los Angeles and Washington has spurred legal challenges and protests.",
    "The Trump administration\u2019s goal of deporting record numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has framed the push around criminals, but it has arrested many people without criminal records. Residents in New York, Chicago, Washington and other Democrat-leaning metro areas have pushed back in recent months.",
    "In the Chicago suburb of Broadview on Friday, ICE used tear gas, less-lethal rounds and pepper balls to quell protests outside an immigration detention center. Protests have also occurred outside other detention centers around the country, including in Portland."
