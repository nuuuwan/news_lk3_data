  "original_body_lines": [
    "At the Ambassador\u2019s Roundtable hosted by Pathfinder Foundation, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Levan S. Dzhagaryan, provided a comprehensive overview of his Government\u2019s position on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, NATO expansion, international law, global energy scenario and security dynamics in the region.",
    "The event brought together think tank experts and media professionals for a candid discussion on current geopolitical challenges, with a special focus on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
    "In his remarks, the Russian Ambassador outlined historical, political, and security factors that led to Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and its broader concerns regarding Western policies. Regarding Ukraine and the origins of the conflict, the Ambassador referenced the 2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and noted that it marked a turning point in Russia-Ukraine relations. He highlighted that the post-2014 Ukrainian Government pursued policies that alienated Russian-speaking populations in specific regions of Ukraine, and claimed that development contributed to Moscow\u2019s decision to launch its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in 2022.",
    "Central to the Ambassador\u2019s presentation was Russia\u2019s long standing opposition to NATO expansion. He stated that Ukraine\u2019s potential membership posed a direct threat to Russian national security. Drawing parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and military deployments near its borders, the Ambassador said he believed that the Minsk Agreements were not intended to be fully implemented \u2014 a development he described as damaging to diplomatic trust. While reiterating Russia\u2019s stated openness to peace negotiations, the Ambassador emphasised that talks must reflect \u201crealities on the ground.\u201d He stressed the Russian Government\u2019s position that Ukraine must remain a neutral, non-NATO-aligned state. He also questioned the legitimacy of the Ukrainian leadership, but stated that Russia would be open to negotiations if they were \u201cserious and well-prepared.\u201d",
    "He stated that delays in negotiation would only worsen the situation for Ukraine and that Russia remains open to talks \u2014 provided its core security demands are addressed. \u201cWe are not threatening anyone,\u201d the Ambassador said, \u201cbut we expect our legitimate security concerns to be respected.\u201d",
    "On the Iranian nuclear issue, the Ambassador reaffirmed Russia\u2019s support for Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear development under international frameworks and urged the international community to support diplomacy.",
    "Focusing on Russia-Sri Lanka bilateral relations, Ambassador Dzhagaryan observed that Russia-Sri Lanka economic cooperation remains limited due to sanctions against his country. Russian tourists visiting Sri Lanka face difficulties because of restrictions in the international payment system, particularly with blocked credit card transactions. Nonetheless, he announced that direct flights between Russia and Sri Lanka are set to resume in early October, which is expected to significantly boost tourism. He also confirmed that he is exploring avenues for economic collaboration, while acknowledging that sanctions continue to hinder large-scale projects. Regarding Sri Lankan tea and trade, he stated that Sri Lankan tea remains highly popular in Russia, with several well-known Sri Lankan brands widely available across retail outlets. The Ambassador emphasised that sanctions have not affected the tea trade and that Russia remains a key export market for Sri Lankan tea. He further noted that, despite sanctions, Russia\u2019s domestic economy has strengthened, citing increased local production and a reduction in import dependency.",
    "The Ambassador spoke about a recent Buddhist Forum held in Kalmykia, Russia, attended by Sri Lankan participants, and announced a forthcoming visit by a Russian delegation to Sri Lanka in October \u2014 an effort to strengthen cultural and religious ties, particularly through shared Buddhist heritage.",
    "Following the Ambassador\u2019s address, a broad-ranging Q&A session covered various topics. On the subject of BRICS, Ambassador Dzhagaryan emphasised that it is not an anti-Western alliance but a cooperative platform. He encouraged Sri Lanka to engage with all BRICS members regarding its membership. He also reiterated Russia\u2019s policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States."
