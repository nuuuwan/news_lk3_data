  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is willing to listen to alternative views in Sri Lanka\u2019s loan program implementation steps, but the island nation is on a knife edged path and it could slip to a vicious cycle, the global lender\u2019s Mission Head for Sri Lanka said.",
    "The economic reforms under the IMF program have burdened the Sri Lankans with higher taxes, resulting in low disposable income for the public.",
    "With Sri Lanka going for presidential polls later this year, President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government is likely to slow down the implementation of the IMF reforms, government officials have said.",
    "An IMF mission was in Sri Lanka for the second review of its $3 billion, 4-year loan and met officials from the government, opposition, and civil society organizations.",
    "Peter Breuer, the IMF Senior Mission Chief said they got many proposals during their discussions,",
    "\u201cWith respect to the election, yes, we heard many different proposals,\u201d Breuer told reporters in Colombo at the conclusion of the second review of the program.",
    "\u201cFor us, what is absolutely key is that the program objectives are achieved. Because, with those, Sri Lanka has a chance of emerging from the crisis. That path is a knife edged path.\u201d",
    "Many political parties including the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) want to reduce the tax burden faced by the people.",
    "Higher taxes have made Wickremesinghe\u2019s government unpopular among the voters.",
    "The IMF mission met many groups this time including main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP) who have promised to renegotiate Sri Lanka\u2019s deal with the IMF.",
    "Breuer, however, warned the country could go back to crisis again if the reforms are not sustained.",
    "\u201cWe acknowledge in our press report that the green shoots we see for the economy that\u2019s the beginning of the virtuous cycle and we have to keep it there,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s knife edged and could easily go back to the vicious cycle and that\u2019s what we want to prevent.\u201d",
    "He said alternative proposals should not deviate from the original goals of the programs including fiscal and economic reforms.",
    "\u201cWe are willing to listen to alternative suggestions of how the program objectives can be reached and these must be realistic and achievable within the time frame of the program,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe program is the result of robust discussions that we had in the summer of 2022 and since then at the periodic reviews we have been looking at progress under the program.\u201d",
    "\u201cI would argue that it is quite well thought out but of course we are willing to take alternative views. The important part is that the hard won gains of the Sri Lankan people over the past two years are not unravelled.\u201d (Colombo/March 21/2024)"
