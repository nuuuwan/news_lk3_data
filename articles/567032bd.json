Easter Sunday\u2014also known as Resurrection Day\u2014celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter takes place three days after Jesus\u2019s death on Good Friday. This holiday concludes the \u201cPassion of Christ\" series of holidays that began with Ash Wednesday.",
    "As Sri Lanka is still reeling from the devastating suicide bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people and injured hundreds of others on 2019 Easter Sunday, the police have decided to implement a special security plan at all churches across the country.",
    "Accordingly, police officers, together with the priests and boards of trustees of churches have prepared security plans tailored to each church while the Holy Masses are in progress from 29 - 31 March.",
    "Under this security plan, the church premises are inspected before the commencement of the sermons and body searchers will take place if deemed necessary.",
    "Special attention will be given to churches that attract crowds in large numbers. Additionally, the assistance of the Special Task Force (STF) and the Tri-Forces personnel will be obtained in the event the number of police officers deployed to churches is inadequate."
