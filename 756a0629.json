I also urge the opposition to work together.Let\u2019s get both parties together and pass this.\u201d- President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Special Statement to Parliament",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "(Full Text of Special Statement made in Parliament on 26 April 2023 by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe)",
    "I would like to address the concerns that have been raised in the media and elsewhere about the economic and financial issues that our country has faced. In July 2022, Sri Lanka was hit with riots, arson, and state bankruptcy, causing a complete loss of trust in our country.",
    "However, after eight months, we have managed to turn things around and it\u2019s now being called the Sri Lanka comeback story. We have entered the path of renaissance and are reborn, and I am counting on the support of the whole country to take it forward.",
    "Let me give you a brief overview of the situation we faced. Our tax cuts in late 2019 cost us 4% of gross domestic product, and things only got worse with the Covid epidemic. In February 2022, the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated by 40% against the US Dollar within three months, and it continued to depreciate. Economic growth contracted by 7.8% throughout 2022, and inflation in September 2022 exceeded 70%, with food inflation rising as high as 95%.",
    "In this challenging backdrop, I decided to assume the presidency in July 2022 because I believed that our country could recover. If I had not taken responsibility during a time of agitations and protests, our country would have been completely destroyed. I didn\u2019t hesitate even when the paintings in my home library were burnt down and destroyed.",
    "At that time, Sri Lanka\u2019s total debt was 83.6 billion US dollars, with foreign debt at 41.5 billion US dollars and domestic debt at 42 billion US dollars. By now, our overall debt ratio as a percentage of GDP has become 128%. Due to non-repayment of bilateral and private loans, the amount of outstanding debt from April to December 2022 was estimated at 2.7 billion US dollars.",
    "By the middle of 2022, Sri Lanka was unable to import goods and services from abroad due to the worsening foreign exchange deficit. In May 2022, interest related to foreign loans failed to be paid. This was the first time in the history of Sri Lanka that we had to face such a situation.",
    "As soon as I took over the government, I began negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. As a result, in September, we reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund regarding extended credit facilities.",
    "The comprehensive credit facility consists of six major reforms, which are as follows:",
    "(a)\tRevenue Based Fiscal Consolidation \u2013 This reform includes institutional changes related to the public finance sector, strengthening the social security network, and introducing business reforms in the public sector.",
    "(c) Implementation of multiple strategies to ensure the restoration of financial stability, including the formation of foreign reserves under a flexible foreign exchange rate regime.",
    "(d) Implementation of relevant policies and reforms to ensure the stability of the financial sector.",
    "(e) Implementation of structural reforms necessary to control corruption \u2013 In this regard, the Minister will present the relevant draft.",
    "Today, we received the financing assurance from foreign creditors, with the Paris Club and India working together to grant it. India was the first to publish it, and we are grateful for that.",
    "China is expected to deal with it separately, so we will discuss with the Paris Club and India on one hand and negotiate with China on the other.",
    "After these discussions, we will have talks with private creditors. This agreement will enable us to receive approximately $3 billion from the International Monetary Fund over the next four years, with the potential to obtain about $7 billion from other institutions. This money is crucial for us.",
    "Additionally, we have regained the trust of foreign banks and financial institutions, with economic stability already being established in the country. Social Security is receiving more funding, and investors are showing a keen interest in Sri Lanka.",
    "We have entered into agreements with the International Monetary Fund 16 times in the past, but we have not fully implemented them. On the 17th occasion, when we achieve stability, we must address our long-term weaknesses and move forward with a new program.",
    "One of the points to address is debt restructuring talks with our bilateral countries and private creditors. We want to restructure these loans, as failure to do so will result in a loss of liquidity. In order for the government to move forward, the restructuring must be done in rupees or dollars. The government wants to obtain funds for this service.",
    "Therefore, we must first negotiate with foreign creditors. We hope to initiate these discussions soon, with domestic debt restructuring also being considered. A final decision has not yet been made, but it is important to discuss this issue. Negotiations cannot be held with terms and conditions already in place. It is easier for us to join negotiations without conditions.",
    "Every aspect must be given special attention to ensure that no one is harmed in the process. Some banks may express their inability to cope with the program, but it is important for them to accept it in order to move the economy forward.",
    "There are concerns that the stock market may collapse, and some may not be able to offer different conditions. However, decisions will be made in parliament, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that no harm is done to anyone, such as the members of the Employees Provident Fund.",
    "We have initiated necessary programs to support the poor, and the World Bank has provided funding for this. We are currently implementing a program to give aid to those who truly deserve it and remove those who do not. Our aim is to create financial stability and protect the low-income people.",
    "To achieve these objectives, we are holding joint discussions with the Paris Club and India on one platform, while separate negotiations with China are also underway. We have nothing to hide, and several steps need to be taken in this regard.",
    "We have taken 09 prior actions (PAs) which we agreed to so we are qualified.",

    "Under staff baseline scenario, US$17 billion in debt service reduction is required, including the arrears accumulated in 2022",
    "So we are trying to get a 17 billion debt reduction on that side. Do you want it or not. Are we going in for debt restricting? We can\u2019t manage without debt restructuring. That is what I want to make it clear to all the members.",
    "However stability alone is not enough for us. In actuality, the nominal GDP for 2019 was just $89 billion during this period. The gross domestic product will be the same in 2028 as it was in 2019. If we stay with the growth rate of 3%, we can lose the national income of nine years. If we maintain the current growth rate of 3%, we may lose nine years of national revenue. Furthermore, it has been predicted that the Sri Lankan GDP will decrease by around 3% in 2023.",
    "Economic positivity will likely be confirmed in the fourth quarter of 2023. If the economy grew at least 3% or 7% each year starting in 2019, our GDP would be worth 110 billion dollars. But if we go to 5%, it will be 130 billion dollars. In fact we believe we will be able to reach 3% or 4% in the first two to three years.",
    "Following that, we must aim for a growth rate of at least 6% to 7% over this time period. That should be agreed upon by everyone in this House. However, this may be done at 7% or 8%. We have opportunities for that. That is why we are restructuring the entire legal system. Some regulations have to be removed. Some people wonder why corporations are being sold. They can be better run by the private sector. We leave them to the private sector.",
    "In addition, various restrictions have been imposed for 25 to 30 years, depending on the preferences of each ministry. Let us now look at the economy and decide which limits will be retained and which will be lifted. A highly competitive social fair market system is required. We require a green economy. The economy must be digitalized. There are several activities available for this. Agriculture is being modernized, and new industries are being introduced. That is something I will address separately.",
    "We have no other option but the IMF agreement. There have not been alternative suggestions. If there is no other alternative, let\u2019s approve this. I also urge the opposition to work together. Let\u2019s get both parties together and pass this.",
    "Representatives of the International Monetary Fund visit our country every six months. Therefore if there are any shortcomings, we may address them and find a solution. Trade unions have highlighted concerns about taxation. All of these people will discuss and come up with a solution, and then we will all join together and develop a single national policy framework.",
    "What is the country\u2019s national policy framework till 2048? There are policies and initiatives in place for the first five years. Let\u2019s discuss them. There is a national assembly. In particular, there are other committees. Let\u2019s make the entire parliament a government to implement this program. Let\u2019s get together for this. There may be differing viewpoints.",
    "Now we have to build the country for 2048. If we do not accomplish this, we would be betraying the country\u2019s youth. Their future has been destroyed. Think about the youth of the country. Don\u2019t just think about grabbing power only. If this program is not done, none of us will be able to survive in another two or three years. So I urge everyone to come together to approve this. After that we will come together and prepare the set of policies required until 2048. I also, urge you to provide support to implement the program during the next five years."
