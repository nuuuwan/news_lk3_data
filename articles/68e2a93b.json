    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the implementation of a new project to enable expatriates living overseas to apply for passports online through 20 identified Sri Lankan missions and offices abroad.",
    "The move is supported by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), and aims to streamline and digitise the passport application process for Sri Lankan expatriates.",
    "The IOM has agreed to provide the necessary funding and technical support to establish biometric capture satiation, supply related equipment and develop secure online systems that will connect foreign mission with Department of Immigration and Emigration.",
    "\u201cThe project will likely enhance efficiency by allowing passport applications to be processed digitally at Sri Lankan missions, reducing delays and minimising manual paperwork,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "Acknowledging the foreign exchange contribution to the economy via remittances from the expatriates, he said it was important that the Government provide such facilities to Sri Lankans living overseas. \u201cThrough this system we are also exploring opportunities to get them to visit Sri Lanka during holidays, which will further boost forex inflow,\u201d he added",
    "A joint proposal for the project was submitted by the Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath and the Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananda Wijepala."
