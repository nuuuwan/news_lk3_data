### As Dissanayake visits, India must embrace Sri Lanka’s new dawn

*2024-12-15 23:50:16* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/As-Dissanayake-visits-India-must-embrace-Sri-Lanka-s-new-dawn/4-770537) · `en`

This week, Modi will learn that under AKD’s tenure, Sri Lanka too will seek to strike the right balance of partnerships between India, China and other global powers, in a manner that is ultimately calibrated towards the best long-term interests of Sri Lanka. Dissanayake has the savvy to appreciate the importance of maintaining strong ties with India, but is extremely unlikely to compromise his principles in doing so

One side-effect of the polarising effect of nationalism and populism around the world in recent years has been a decrease in the political stability and mandate enjoyed by incumbent regimes. From the erosion of nationalist hegemony in Malaysia or India to the rise of populism in the United States and pockets of Europe, swings in both directions have led to fragile coalitions, divided legislatures and a rise in uncertainty.

### Maintaining cohesiveness within NPP

*2024-12-15 23:46:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Maintainingcohesiveness-within-NPP/4-770536) · `en`

How will the NPP inculcate their preference and behaviour among the new faces in the Parliament?

Every single member in the party must understand and absorb the vision of the leadership of the NPP. The stated vision must be transparent and explicit. It must not provide loopholes for a cynic to implicitly translate unfavourably. They all must share the same vision as that of the leadership. Once this is established they are able to formulate the missions that are relevant for their own territories of work

Many of our previous Governments of recent times fell into major problems since the leadership lost control of its party members. The problem was further compounded since quite a few of them were coalition governments. The NPP is a single party government with enormous power. Yet NPP can’t afford to remain complacent.

### Increasing tax revenue without hiking tax burden

*2024-12-15 23:38:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Increasing-tax-revenue-without-hiking-tax-burden/4-770535) · `en`

Taxes are certainly essential to fund public services and infrastructure, but a disproportionately high tax burden can backfire

No one willingly parts what they own, unless the return is of equal or greater value, regardless of its tangibility – and this applies to taxes as well. The million-dollar question for Sri Lankan taxpayers is: what do we really get in return for the taxes we pay?

Despite the Government’s efforts to promote taxation as a civic duty, flawed tax policies are undermining public trust. The fundamental principle of taxation is fairness, which means taxation should be based on ability to pay.

However, the previous Government’s decision to reduce VAT and income tax thresholds and to increase their tax rates, amid inflation that has risen from 9% to an unprecedented 70% in 2022, was anything but prudent. Such a move contradicted the fundamental principle of easing the tax burden during an economic downturn.

### Critique on Engineering Council of Sri Lanka, its Act and conduct

*2024-12-15 23:29:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Critique-on-Engineering-Council-of-Sri-Lanka-its-Act-and-conduct/4-770533) · `en`

The circular sought to compel all engineers, including those with foreign qualifications or specialised knowledge in fields not recognised by IESL or IIESL, to conform to the ECSL’s registration requirements

The absence of a properly defined hierarchy among engineering practitioners – one that accounts for both academic qualifications and practical experience – created confusion and uncertainty within the profession. It was argued that any attempt to regulate engineers without first establishing such a hierarchy was both arbitrary and irrational. This argument underscores the ECSL’s lack of preparedness and its failure to establish a coherent regulatory framework before issuing far-reaching directives through the circular

### Cyclone slams into France’s Mayotte archipelago, killing at least 11

At least 11 people were killed after a cyclone slammed into Mayotte, the most intense storm to hit the French Indian Ocean archipelago north of Madagascar in nearly a century, French weather forecasters and authorities said on Sunday.

Cyclone Chido swept through Mayotte overnight, Meteo-France said, bringing winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph) and damaging makeshift housing, government buildings and a hospital. It was the strongest storm in more than 90 years to hit the islands, the forecaster said.

It was difficult to ascertain the precise death toll after the cyclone, which also raised concerns about access to food, water and sanitation, authorities said.

“For the toll, it’s going to be complicated, because Mayotte is a Muslim land where the dead are buried within 24 hours,” a French interior ministry official said.

முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க தொங்கு பாலத்தில் என்னை தூக்கிச் சென்றாரா? அல்லது ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்கவை தூக்கிச் சென்றாரா ?என்பதை மக்கள் ஆராய வேண்டும். உண்மையில் ஜனாதிபதியையே ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க தூக்கிச் சென்றுள்ளார். கடன் மறுசீரமைப்பு விவகாரத்தில் அரசாங்கம் இரட்டை நிலைப்பாட்டில் செயற்படுகிறது என ஸ்ரீ லங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் நாமல் ராஜபக்ஷ தெரிவித்தார்.
