    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has ended 2023 with 12-month consumer prices to December rising  4.0 percent, according to the most widely watched Colomb Consumer Price Index, with prices rising 0.9 percent in the month.",
    "Since the effects of the central bank\u2019s inflationary policy ended in September 2022, leading to a balance of payments surplus prices have only risen 3.0 percent with the index (re-based) growing from 189.3 points to 195.1 points to December.",
    "The lower price rises were helped by currency appreciation in March even as services such as education and housing continued to rise with market interest rates and deflationary open market operations (a type of regime that is found in Singapore).",
    "Currency appreciation, for which deflationary open market operations are required, helps bring down traded goods prices (food and energy) and offset continued rises in services like education and housing which adjusts to the currency collapse in 2022.",
    "Interest rates started to come down without any overt money printing to trigger forex shortages as SOE borrowing and private credit slowed.",
    "The central bank has generally been selling down its Treasury bills stock (overselling at auction and injecting short term to overtrading market participants), but in December overt money printing began.",
    "Analysts had warned that within the new monetary law with a so-called John Law provision, there was enough room for a determined inflationist central bank to print money and de-stabilize the system as soon as private credit recovered, as had happened in the past.",
    "However overall monetary policy had been deflationary, allowing foreign reserves to be collected without depreciating the currency and imposing more hardships on the people."
