    "Dilmah Tea celebrated the Top 70 including 37 award winners of a unique photography competition and exhibition \u2018One Earth: Unveiling Sri Lanka\u2019s Biodiversity\u2019, that went beyond conventional wildlife photography competitions to capture the often-overlooked dimensions of biodiversity.",
    "\u201cInviting both established and aspiring photographers through Open and School categories, One Earth inspired participants to move beyond picturesque jungle scenes and reveal the fragility, urgency, and resilience of nature in backyards, waterways, and nightscapes \u2013 resulting in a powerful collection of images carrying compelling conservation messages,\u201d a Dilmah news release explained.",
    "Launched in June, the competition received around 400 submissions. Judging was conducted anonymously, with photographers identified only by a code to ensure fairness. The distinguished panel of judges, whose wildlife photography has been featured internationally, included wildlife photographer Luxshman Nadaraja, conservation photographer Sankha Wanniatchi, and wildlife photographer Ravisara Jayamanna.",
    "The judges praised the variety of species represented from reptiles and amphibians to insects, birds and mammals, and expressed excitement at the level of interest from students, particularly their choice to highlight lesser-known species such as reptiles.",
    "\u201cPhotographing rare herpetofauna species can play a vital role in conservation efforts,\u201d said Ravisara Jayamanna.",
    "The awards ceremony was held at Genesis by Dilmah \u2013 Centre for a Sustainable Future in September alongside the public exhibition of the top 70 photographs. Thirty-seven winners were recognized and awarded a collective LKR 3 million to support their photographic journeys, with first, second, and third places presented in each category, alongside seven special mentions and two People\u2019s Choice awards.",
    "The People\u2019s Choice was selected through online voting where the winners garnered over 3,500 votes each from a total of 16954 votes.",
    "The winning entries featured striking and thought-provoking images. The image titled \u201cCrime Scene\u201d captured what first appears to be degraded forest land, but on closer look reveals the distant shape of a dead elephant and, just metres away, the plastic waste dump that caused its death. Another powerful image, \u201cA Polluted Hunt,\u201d showed a Brahminy Kite swooping into Bolgoda Lake to catch a fish, only to release it after discovering it was trapped in plastic.",
    "The exhibition also highlighted often-overlooked species such as fungi, caterpillars, and ants. One photograph featuring a mushroom growing in the photographer\u2019s backyard, submitted almost by chance, won first place in the \u2018Biodiversity in the Backyard\u2019 category, showing that conservation stories can emerge from even the smallest and most ordinary moments.",
    "In the school category, one student captured a beetle on a windowpane, encouraging a shift from focusing solely on charismatic species to appreciating everyday biodiversity.",
    "\u201cAppreciate nature in its entirety as an ecosystem. There\u2019s no need to rush behind only charismatic species. Train yourself to see beauty in everything, and you will be the greatest beneficiary,\u201d said Luxshman Nadaraja at the awards ceremony.",
    "This was the first time Dilmah hosted a photography competition of this nature, building on the success of its earlier initiative this year, Flutter Shutter, Sri Lanka\u2019s first-ever butterfly photography competition. Dilmah plans to make One Earth an annual event, using visual storytelling as a powerful medium to inspire conservation and deepen appreciation for Sri Lanka\u2019s extraordinary biodiversity.",
    "Dilmah is a family tea company founded on a commitment to quality, authenticity, and integrity. Through its humanitarian and environmental initiatives, Dilmah promotes biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture and community empowerment. Every cup of Dilmah Tea supports these efforts through the MJF Charitable Foundation and Dilmah Conservation.",
