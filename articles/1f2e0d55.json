    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Consumer confidence in Sri Lanka continued to decline in January 2024, reaching the lowest levels since entering the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, according to a survey by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP).",
    "The IHP said in a statement on Friday February 16 that the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), the broadest measure of the public\u2019s view of their personal economic status and the national economy, fell 5 points to 16 points in January.",
    "The Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE), which tracks future perceptions, decreased 5 points to 21 points, while the Index of Current Conditions (ICC), a measure of perceptions of current conditions, also decreased 5 points to 10 points, the IHP said.",
    "\u201cConsumer confidence has been falling for nine months since it recovered after the announcement of the March 2023 IMF extended fund facility (EFF) agreement. Levels are now back to where they were before the IMF EFF,\u201d the institute said.",
    "According to the IHP, its consumer confidence indices range from zero to a potential maximum of 100, with levels below 50 indicating net pessimism.",
    "\u201cThey follow the same methodology commonly used in the United States and Europe, with data collected by telephone interviews. These estimates are based on 508 interviews conducted in January 2024 and 14,778 adults surveyed between October 21, 2021 and January 31, 2024, with sample sizes varying between indices depending on response rates and responses weighted to match the national population.\u201d",
    "The IHP\u2019s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) platform tracks public opinion and wellbeing daily using a large national panel recruited by face-to-face interviews and other randomly dialled respondents, with numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications that use the data.",
    "SLOTS was launched in August 2021 to track public experience and opinion during the recovery from COVID-19. It has been extended to track public perceptions during the economic crisis.",
    "SLOTS interviews representative samples of Sri Lankan adults daily by telephone to gather their current views and situation. All interviews include a core set of common questions, with additional rotating sets of other questions that examine issues of topical importance. The survey has previously been funded by the Neelan Tiruchelvam Trust, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Asia Foundation in Sri Lanka, and others. Current fieldwork is financed by the IHP Public Interest Research Fund and others, the IHP said. (Colombo/Feb16/2024)"
