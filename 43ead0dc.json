    "The token strike at the outpatient department of Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) in Colombo has been called off, says Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, the spokesperson of Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).",
    "The medical officers at the LRH launched a 24-hour strike at 8.00 a.m. this morning (July 19) in protest of the conduct of a female specialist doctor at the hospital.",
    "Deeming the conduct of the specialist doctor \u2018unprofessional\u2019 and \u2018unacceptable\u2019, the GMOA sought immediate solutions for the \u2018longstanding issue\u2019.",
    "The token strike was, however, called off after the Health Ministry\u2019s secretary promised in writing to probe the matter and to fulfil the requests made by the government medical officers, according to the GMOA\u2019s spokesperson."
