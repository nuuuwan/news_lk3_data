  "original_body_lines": [
    "The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours.",
    "The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
    "The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2% of Gaza\u2019s entire prewar population of about 2.3 million.",
    "Among the dead reported in the overall toll were 10 people, including a family of four, who were killed in an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said.",
    "The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza City\u2019s eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said.",
    "Israel claims Hamas is responsible for the civilian death toll because it operates from within civilian areas in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel has failed to take sufficient precautions to avoid civilian deaths.",
    "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel responded by heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.",
    "A separate strike on a school on Sunday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least 13 people, including six children and two women, according to Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital initially reported the strike had killed 16 people, but it later revised the death toll as the three other bodies had been from a separate strike that hit a house.",
    "The Israeli military said it had \u201cconducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center embedded within a compound\u201d that had served as a school in Khan Younis. It did not provide evidence.",
    "In central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners gathered for the funeral of a Palestinian journalist working for the Qatari-based Al Jazeera TV network who was killed Sunday in a strike on a point for Gaza\u2019s civil defense agency. They carried his body through the street from the hospital, his blue bulletproof vest resting atop.",
    "The strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gaza\u2019s main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government.",
    "Al Jazeera said Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed.",
    "The International Federation of Journalists said last week that 104 journalists and media workers have been killed so far in 2024, with more than half of them perishing during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
    "The group said that since the Oct. 7, 2023, start of the war, at least 138 had been killed, including 55 Palestinian media professionals in the calendar year.",
    "The Israeli military said its strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants \u201cwho were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the \u2018Civil Defense\u2019 organization in Nuseirat.\u201d It accused the journalist of having been a member of Islamic Jihad, an accusation his colleagues in Gaza denied.",
    "Gaza\u2019s civil defense also rejected the claims that militants had been operating from the site.",
    "\u201cWe were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement,\u201d Mahmoud al-Lawh, the journalist\u2019s cousin, told The Associated Press. \u201cThese claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime.\u201d"
