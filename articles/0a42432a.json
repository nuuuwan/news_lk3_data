    "The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society\u2019s (WNPS) PLANT initiative recently joined forces with Interact District 3220, a youth-led movement in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, to launch \u201cGreenCon\u201924\u201d with an ecosystem restoration project at Frocester Estate in Govinna. Second week November, nearly 100 Interactors from over 20 schools across Sri Lanka trekked uphill to participate in this effort to rejuvenate a vulnerable wet-zone habitat.The Frocester Estate, managed by Horana Plantations under the Hayleys Group, is a critical site for ecological restoration under WNPS PLANT, which focuses on improving habitat connectivity across Sri Lanka\u2019s endemic-rich southwestern quadrant. Previous successes by PLANT at Maskeli Oya and Halwatura regions laid the groundwork for this collaboration. Restoration at Frocester Estate, formally launched with support from Interact District 3220, integrates education and practical conservation efforts.",
    "Guided by Rotary International\u2019s motto, \u201cService Above Self,\u201d Interact District 3220 embodies youth-driven change. GreenCon\u201924 united students from Kandy, Gampaha, Colombo, and Galle to address critical environmental challenges. Participants engaged in tree planting, learned about ecosystem connectivity, and explored the region\u2019s biodiversity under the guidance of PLANT teams.\u201dEach sapling symbolizes a promise to protect the environment for future generations,\u201d said Int. PP. Kavishkaa Premanand, Chairperson of GreenCon\u201924. Beyond planting, the initiative encouraged dialogues about tackling invasive species and enhancing biodiversity conservation.",
    "Nestled near the Kalu Ganga River Basin, the Frocester Estate is home to rich biodiversity but has suffered habitat degradation from invasive species and agricultural expansion. With 40 hectares under natural regeneration, the estate is a critical conservation site within Sri Lanka\u2019s wet zone, where 90% of the country\u2019s endemic species are found.",
    "On the day of the event, participants planted 500 native trees, including Diya Na (Mesua thwaitesii), Dawul Kurundu (Neolitsea cassia), and Hora (Dipterocarpus zeylanicus), which provide essential habitats and contribute to ecosystem health. This project, supported by Traffisafe Limited (UK) under its sustainability initiatives, addresses key restoration challenges, including the spread of invasive species.",
    "Restoration projects like this extend beyond environmental impact; they serve as outdoor classrooms for practical environmental education. Students learned about the vital role of native trees in supporting biodiversity, explored a nearby stream to understand aquatic ecosystems, and experienced first-hand the complexities of restoration work. PLANT\u2019s emphasis on scientifically driven restoration empowers communities and youth to contribute meaningfully to conservation efforts.",
    "PHF Int. PP. Damian De Cruz, District Interact Representative, remarked, \u201cBeing in the field and contributing to a greener future was an unforgettable experience\u2014a reminder of how deeply connected we are to the world around us.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s wet zone faces significant threats from human activity. Restoration efforts like those at Frocester Estate aim to counteract these threats by reintroducing native vegetation to suppress invasive species, stabilize soil, and improve water quality. These initiatives also restore wildlife corridors, reducing human-wildlife conflicts while fostering ecological connectivity.WNPS PLANT, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest private ecosystem restoration initiative, protects over 2,500 acres, creates new forests across 360 acres, and conserves over 1,000 species. With over 30 partners, PLANT manages more than 50 kilometers of forest corridors and continues to integrate education with conservation.",
    "The convention for GreenCon\u201924 participants, held at St. Joseph\u2019s College, Colombo, featured a session where PLANT shared its broader conservation journey, including the Emerald Trail initiative. This collaborative approach underscores the importance of engaging schools, communities, and organizations to ensure the success of restoration projects.",
    "Looking ahead, the PLANT team, along with local communities, aims to plant over 5,000 trees at Frocester Estate, creating a thriving biodiverse forest. Continued support from partners like Traffisafe Limited ensures the project\u2019s sustainability.",
    "WNPS PLANT invites individuals, organizations, and corporates to join its journey of ecosystem restoration. Whether through financial support, volunteering, or spreading awareness, everyone can contribute to this collective effort to restore Sri Lanka\u2019s natural heritage and become part of \u201cGeneration Restoration.\u201d",
