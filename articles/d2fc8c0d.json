    "The rupee collapsed steadily from 113 without a war to 300 in a series of currency crises triggered by so-called flexible inflation targeting and potential output targeting, which critics say is the worst spurious monetary doctrine to hit unfortunate nations after the basket bank crawl doctrine of the 1980s.",
