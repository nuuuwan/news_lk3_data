    "Speaking at \u201cTogether we win \u2013 We are Gampaha\u201d rally, stresses political agendas must align with the country\u2019s needs",
    "Invites Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake to join the national effort",
    "Recalls crises of two years ago and lists salient achievements since then",
    "Reiterates his dedication to the nation, and how he worked selflessly for the country\u2019s betterment, not personal gain",
    "The people of the Gampaha District yesterday decisively endorsed Ranil Wickremesinghe for re-election as President in the upcoming Presidential election, said the President\u2019s Media Division in a statement.",
    "It said over 250 Gampaha local Government representatives, along with 26 SLPP Ministers and MPs, pledged their strong support for the President at the \u201cTogether we win \u2013 We are Gampaha\u201d rally in Kadawatha.",
    "Marking two years in office as President, Wickremesinghe at the rally emphasised that he will never allow the country\u2019s future to be dictated by political agendas. Instead, he believes that politics should be aligned with the country\u2019s agenda. He also extended an invitation to Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake to join him on this journey.",
    "Representing the people of Gampaha District, Minister Prasanna Ranatunga proposed that President Wickremesinghe should stand as the Presidential candidate in the upcoming election. The proposal received unanimous approval, along with over 15,000 attendees including 26 Ministers and MPs and 250 former local Government members of the SLPP. They raised their hands in support, and the resolution was passed unanimously at the rally.",
    "During his speech, President Wickremesinghe reflected on taking over the country without an economy or functioning government on 21 July 2022. He emphasised that he has fulfilled his responsibilities and consistently worked for the nation\u2019s betterment, rather than personal gain.",
    "Addressing this public rally, the President also said: \u201cI report to you that I have fulfilled the primary responsibility entrusted to me on that day. I took over a country that was facing an economic collapse and lacked a functioning government.\u201d",
    "\u201cDespite these challenges, we persevered. Today, we have successfully completed the debt restructuring program and it will be officially announced in the coming days. At the same time, we have received funds back for the projects we have supported, and all restrictions have been removed. Additionally, work on the Central Expressway is being restarted. In this brief period, we have accomplished what had not been achieved in 75 years.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are leading a revolution aimed at building a better future for the youth. This movement is designed for you and should be carried forward. We have presented the Economic Transformation Law to Parliament, with plans to increase our GDP fivefold over the next 20 years. Significant advancements have already been made in modernising education, reforming vocational training, establishing new universities, and digitising the country.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe future of our country cannot be determined solely by political agendas. I will not allow that. Politics should align with the country\u2019s needs; otherwise, our country has no future. We must advance as a proud nation, making meaningful changes rather than issuing false promises. The country\u2019s progress should not be driven by political agendas, but by a shared vision for national development. I invite Sajith Premadasa and Anura Dissanayake to join us in this effort. Let\u2019s embark on this journey together.\u201d"
