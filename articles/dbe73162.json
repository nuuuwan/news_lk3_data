    "Rashi Prabha Ratwatte, the wife of former Plantation Industries and Mahaweli Development State Minister Lohan Ratwatte, was remanded yesterday over the possession of an illegally assembled, unregistered luxury vehicle. The Nugegoda Magistrate\u2019s Court ordered her detention until 7 November after she appeared in response to a court summons.",
    "The investigation began following the arrest of Lohan Ratwatte, who was taken into custody after the police discovered an unregistered Lexus SUV at a residence on Shalawa Road, Mirihana, owned by his wife, Rashi Prabha Ratwatte. Acting on a tip-off, police located the luxury vehicle on 26 October. Following the discovery, Lohan Ratwatte was also remanded until 7 November but is currently undergoing treatment at the Colombo National Hospital, having been transferred from the prison hospital due to an alleged medical emergency. Authorities reported that both Lohan Ratwatte and his wife have not been fully cooperating with the investigation. During initial questioning, Lohan Ratwatte claimed that the vehicle had been brought to the property by his Coordinating Secretary, who recently died under mysterious circumstances in Kandy. The couple denied ownership or knowledge of the vehicle, asserting that the house was being occupied by Rashi Prabha Ratwatte\u2019s mother when the SUV arrived about three weeks ago.",
    "Despite these claims, police suspect that attributing the vehicle\u2019s presence to the deceased secretary might be an attempt to mislead investigators. According to the police Rashi Prabha Ratwatte had also avoided attempts by them to question her further until she appeared before the court yesterday. The investigation is ongoing, with both Ratwatte\u2019s set to remain in remand as scrutiny over their involvement continues."
