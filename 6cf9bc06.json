    "The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka has hailed President Ranil Wickremesinghe for Sri Lanka\u2019s strong statement against the burning of Quran in Sweden recently. Following is the letter written by The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka Vice President Hilmy Ahamed to President Wickremesinghe with a copy to Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry",
    "The Muslim community in Sri Lanka and the world over appreciate and welcome your Excellency\u2019s Government\u2019s strong statement against the burning of a Quran in Sweden on one of our holiest days. It has sparked outrage in many Muslim countries and widespread condemnation around the world of the Swedish authorities.",
    "In the incident in Stockholm, two men, watched by a crowd of people, tore pages out of a Quran and burned them outside a mosque. The timing of the burning of Islam\u2019s holy book, during the important Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, further angered and pained Muslims in many countries, who were celebrating the holiday, which honours the end of the hajj pilgrimage.",
    "The Quran is believed by Muslims to be the literal words of God, and intentionally insulting by defacing copies is blasphemous. Conversely, respecting the Quran is an important element of the religious faith in Islam.",
    "Islamophobists around the world continues to blaspheme Islam, the Holy Quran and our beloved Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, in the guise of freedom of expression. This is contrary to the democratic principles of freedom of expression ingrained in the United Nations charter. It is the responsibility of every government to ensure the rights of Muslims to have the freedom to practice their faith with dignity, as is the right of all citizens of their respective countries.",
    "Several Muslim countries have summoned their Swedish envoys and expressed their anger and disappointment at the Swedish Government\u2019s stand on allowing blasphemy of religions and its leaders.",
    "The Swedish court in expressing its support for freedom of expression had not permitted any burning protesters. We are yet to see how the Swedish justice system works on those who were in contempt of court.",
    "Thank you, Your Excellency for reminding the world that a tiny Island in the Indian Ocean can express its solidarity with the Muslims around the world when two islamophobists have insulted the Holy Quran.\u201d"
