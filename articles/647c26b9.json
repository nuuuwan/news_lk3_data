    "(BLOOMBERG) Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s football career has been a series of glittering firsts, from a record transfer to Real Madrid to scoring more competition goals than any man in history. He\u2019s now notched up another huge win off the pitch: becoming the first billionaire player.",
    "During more than two decades at some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs, including Manchester United and Juventus, the 40-year old Portuguese national hasn\u2019t been shy about cashing in on his stardom with lucrative side gigs for the likes of Armani and Nike. But it\u2019s now, in the twilight of his playing career, that he\u2019s been catapulted into the top ranks of the richest sportspeople, inking a fresh contract extension in June with Saudi Arabian team Al-Nassr that\u2019s reportedly worth more than $400 million.",
    "Ronaldo\u2019s net worth has now climbed to $1.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is valuing his wealth for the first time, making him the first footballer identified by the index to achieve that status. For a long time, he and Lionel Messi, with whom Ronaldo has dueled for the title of greatest player, earned similar wages. But they diverged dramatically in 2023 with Ronaldo\u2019s move to the Gulf and Messi joining Major League Soccer\u2019s Inter Miami. Still, the Argentine is set to earn a stake in the US club once he retires, a deal that could again bring him level with his long-time rival.",
    "Ronaldo surprised many by joining the relatively unknown Riyadh-based Al-Nassr saying \u2014 with characteristic self-confidence \u2014 that he was seeking a new challenge after having \u201cwon everything\u201d in Europe. While some may have questioned his playing ambitions, the transfer unlocked one of the biggest ever contracts in football, as well as the highest average annual pay for a sportsperson. Saudi earnings are also tax-free and his contract reportedly includes perks such as an equity stake in the club and private jet access."
