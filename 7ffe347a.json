    "The convention of the Travel Agents Association of India, after an 18-year hiatus, is scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka\u2019s capital Colombo from July 6 to 9 with over 700 participants primarily from India, RRM Lilani wrote the report.",
    "The historical connection between India and Sri Lanka, spanning thousands of years, adds to the significance of the 67th Convention of the TAAI. TAAI\u2019s 2022 Convention, originally planned for April 19 to 22 in Colombo, was postponed due to political unrest and economic crisis but today, as Sri Lanka is on its revival path, the Convention has been brought to Sri Lanka to promote a regional tourism network.",
    "Sri Lanka Tourism said that India continues to lead among the top ten markets, with the number of Indian tourist arrivals expected to double by 2023. To promote Sri Lanka\u2019s attractions, cultural value, and travel opportunities, Sri Lanka hosts roadshows in India to create a positive perception among Indian tourists.",
    "In Colombo, TAAI, the largest and oldest tourism agency in India, is set to showcase the theme of \u2018Futuristic Focus on Transcending Borders\u2019 and emphasize Sri Lanka\u2019s position as a safe, convenient, and welcoming destination for Indian tourists, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. The convention, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators, has received strong support from Sri Lankan Airlines.",
    "The event would be inaugurated by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, along with other key dignitaries and delegate members from both countries.",

The Government of India introduced the e-Tourist Visa (eTV) scheme for Sri Lankan tourists on April 14, 2015, and reduced the visa fee as a goodwill gesture.
