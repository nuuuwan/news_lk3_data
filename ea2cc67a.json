    "Washington, DC:\u00a0Today, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 9-month Stand-by arrangement (SBA) for Pakistan for an amount of $3 billion to support the authorities\u2019 economic stabilization program.",
    "The arrangement comes at a challenging economic juncture for Pakistan. A difficult external environment, devastating floods, and policy missteps have led to large fiscal and external deficits, rising inflation, and eroded reserve buffers in 2023.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s new SBA-supported program will provide a policy anchor for addressing domestic and external imbalances and a framework for financial support from multilateral and bilateral partners. The program will focus on (1) implementation of the FY24 budget to facilitate Pakistan\u2019s needed fiscal adjustment and ensure debt sustainability, while protecting critical social spending; (2) a return to a market-determined exchange rate and proper FX market functioning to absorb external shocks and eliminate FX shortages; (3) an appropriately tight monetary policy aimed at disinflation; and (4) further progress on structural reforms, particularly with regard to energy sector viability, SOE governance, and climate resilience.",
