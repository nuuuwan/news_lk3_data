    "The Hemas Outreach Foundation, dedicated to transforming early childhood education in Sri Lanka, recently opened its first Piyawara preschool in the plantation sector at the Pedro Estate, Nuwara Eliya. The initiative, carried out in partnership with the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) and Kelani Valley Plantations, is part of Hemas\u2019 broader efforts to expand access to quality education for underserved communities.",
    "The newly established preschool will provide 50 children from plantation worker families with access to quality early childhood care and education in a nurturing, inclusive environment. By opening its doors to children in underserved communities, the Foundation continues its mission of bridging educational disparities and building brighter futures for every child, regardless of background.",
    "Currently, the Piyawara initiative operates 70 preschools across Sri Lanka. With the addition of the Pedro Estate preschool, the network now spans 71 schools nationwide, with five more under construction in different districts. This expansion reflects Hemas\u2019 focus on reaching vulnerable communities, particularly in the plantation sector, where access to early education is limited.",
    "\u201cThe opening of our first preschool in the plantation sector marks an important milestone for the Hemas Outreach Foundation. By creating opportunities for young children at the very start of their learning journey, we not only invest in their future but also strengthen the wellbeing of their families and the wider community,\u201d said Hemas Outreach Foundation Chairperson Abbas Esufally.",
    "The Piyawara model upholds nationally accepted quality standards through regular assessments, continuous teacher training, and structured improvement programs, ensuring that every preschool under its network delivers lasting impact.",
    "For over two decades, the Hemas Outreach Foundation has led the way in early childhood development through Piyawara, established in partnership with the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. Today, Piyawara stands as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s successful public-private partnerships in early education.",
    "The opening of the Pedro Estate preschool further strengthens Hemas\u2019 belief that every child deserves equal opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive; a commitment that underpins the Group\u2019s wider efforts to ensure that no child in Sri Lanka is left behind.",
