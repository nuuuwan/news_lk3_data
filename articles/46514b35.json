    "The All Ceylon Egg Traders\u2019 Association has called on the government to introduce a pricing formula to stabilize the price of eggs in the market.",
    "The Secretary of the association Anura Marasinghe stated that it costs less than Rs. 25 to produce an egg, making it feasible to sell them at a price of Rs. 35 per egg.",
    "\u201cThe issue of escalating egg prices remains unresolved, with current market rates ranging from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 per egg. We urge the government to appoint a committee and establish a transparent pricing formula,\u201d Mr. Marasinghe said.",
    "He further noted that the actual production cost of an egg is between Rs. 20 and Rs. 23, while farm-gate prices currently stand at around Rs. 30.",
    "The association believes a pricing mechanism would benefit both producers and consumers, ensuring fair pricing across the board."
