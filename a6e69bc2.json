  "original_body_lines": [
    "In order to foster economic growth and prosperity through the enhancement of its aviation industry, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is urging Sri Lanka to establish a comprehensive aviation blueprint.",
    "Philip Goh, the Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific at IATA, emphasized the considerable potential of aviation connectivity in propelling Sri Lanka's economic and social advancement.",
    "However, Goh emphasized that achieving this outcome would require deliberate planning and strategic efforts, rather than relying on chance alone.",
    "In his keynote remarks at Aviation Day Sri Lanka, organized by IATA and the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL), Goh suggested three areas to consider in the aviation blueprint: facilitating sustainable growth, safety, and sustainability.",
    "Facilitating Sustainable Growth: \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s aviation blueprint needs to facilitate the sustainable growth of the industry and having an updated airport masterplan is the first step. I urge the government to engage in a consultative approach involving airlines to ensure that industry input is factored in,\u201d said Goh.",
    "Goh urged Sri Lanka to digitize processes for passenger and cargo facilitation. \u201cMany of the country\u2019s passenger and cargo processes continue to be paper-based. As traffic grows, digitalization will be key to address capacity constraints, increase efficiency and improve the travel experience. IATA\u2019s One ID and One Record initiatives can help support this,\u201d said Goh.",
    "Goh also highlighted the need to keep costs low, in particular jet fuel. Airlines pay more for jet fuel in Sri Lanka than at other major airports in Asia. He recognized much has been done in recent months to lower the cost of jet fuel, and encouraged the government to review and consider placing limits or capping the amount that CEYPETCO can mark up for supplying fuel at the airport.",
    "Safety: \u201cIt is important for Sri Lanka\u2019s aviation sector to grow sustainably in a safe manner, and IATA is doing our part to support the country\u2019s efforts. Utilizing the International Airlines Training Fund, IATA will support the aviation industry in Sri Lanka by conducting safety related training in August for CAASL and Sri Lankan Airlines,\u201d said Goh.",
    "Goh encouraged the government to explore how the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) and IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) can be used to contribute to greater aviation safety in Sri Lanka.",
    "Sustainability: \u201cI am delighted that net zero carbon from aviation by 2050 is one of the stated policy goals of Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable aviation environment policy, including the need to ensure the availability of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in the country,\u201d said Goh. SAF is expected to abate more than 60% of aviation carbon emissions by 2050.",
    "Goh called on the government to adopt a comprehensive consultation process involving airlines and other aviation stakeholders as the government develops sustainability policies."
