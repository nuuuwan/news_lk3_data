    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) outlined its monetary policy strategy for 2024 and beyond, reaffirming its commitment to price stability while fostering economic expansion.",
    "Under the Flexible Inflation Targeting framework, the CBSL's primary objective remains keeping domestic price rises in check. The target inflation rate for 2024, set in collaboration with the government, stands at 5% based on the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI).",
    "Currently, monetary policy adopts an accommodative stance. Following a gradual loosening since June 2023 due to easing inflationary pressures, the November 2023 interest rate cut marked a pause in further easing. This allows the previous policy actions to fully impact the economy and prevents undue strain.",
    "While recent tax and tariff increases are expected to temporarily push inflation higher, the CBSL views this as a consequence of administrative measures and not a reason for a policy shift. Well-anchored inflation expectations further reinforce this stance. Nonetheless, the Bank remains vigilant, prepared to proactively adjust policy if necessary to safeguard price stability.",
    "The CBSL anticipates that normalizing market lending rates and improved investor and business confidence will fuel private sector credit growth, propelling the economy towards its full potential. However, the Bank acknowledges potential risks and challenges, both domestic and international, that could hinder the projected recovery.",
