### AKD and JVP-NPP’s mega-mandate: Re-founding the nation

*2024-11-21 02:48:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-and-JVP-NPP-s-mega-mandate-Re-founding-the-nation/4-769507) · `en`

There were two classic works on Sri Lanka after 1956. “Ceylon: Dilemmas of a New Nation” (Princeton 1960) by Howard Wriggins (he acknowledges with thanks the input of Mervyn de Silva--aged 30 at the time) and “The Emerging Elite: A Study of Political Leadership in Ceylon” by Marshall Singer (MIT, 1964).

Political theory holds that the ‘circulation of elites’ is imperative for the health of the body politic and society. The composition of the President Anura Dissanayake’s new JVP-NPP Cabinet, as that of the new Parliament, signals that a new elite has emerged and acceded to power and rulership. It faces the old dilemmas.

Over a decade, Sri Lanka’s politics has displayed extreme electoral volatility manifested in swings of increasing amplitude. These began with 2015 when the voters swung against the Rajapaksa regime and elected the liberal-reformist Yahapalanaya (‘Good Governance’) government of Maithripala Sirisena as President and Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM.

With the recent General election victory of the National People’s Power (NPP), Sri Lanka has entered a new chapter in its history. This moment of transition offers a unique opportunity to address the deep-rooted issues that have plagued our governance, economy, and social fabric. The people of Sri Lanka have spoken decisively, expressing their desire for change, transparency, and a fresh approach to leadership.

This article seeks to advise the new administration on critical priorities, highlighting the mistakes of the past and proposing pathways to ensure long-term prosperity, public satisfaction, and fiscal responsibility.

Over the years, successive governments have been criticised for systemic corruption, policy inconsistency, and economic mismanagement. From large-scale scandals like the Central Bank Bond Scam and the Avant Garde Maritime Scandal to misjudged projects like the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and many more, public trust in leadership has eroded significantly.

The stunning electoral sweep of the National People’s Power (NPP) led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is “an earthquake in Sri Lankan politics”, says Erik Solheim, the former Norwegian peace facilitator in the island nation.

The former diplomat also feels that the strong showing by the NPP in areas populated by Tamils, particularly in the north, marked “a very strong call for a new start in ethnic relations in Sri Lanka”.

Solheim, who has interacted closely with many Sri Lankan leaders, however, warned that while the NPP’s inner core “is for sure non-corrupt, eradicating corruption is a huge task”.

Solheim, now a committed green activist, piloted the Western-backed peace process which led to a historic pact between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in early 2002.

Tisaranee Gunasekara’s usually excellent writings are informed by a strong moral compass. In her recent examination of the Arugam Bay controversy (Daily FT, 6 Nov. 2024), however, that compass wobbles to the point of fracture.

Some preliminaries. Her account of the often gruesome atrocities meted out by the Israeli IDF to civilians in Gaza, and now Lebanon, is both accurate and sobering. And in this context it’s also good to see that she highlights opposition to the Israeli war both from within Israel itself, the Jewish American community – and, as she could have added, global Jewry. Thus, opposition to the war is not the issue in focus here. Rather, the key questions raised by her article relate solidly to Sri Lanka-directed realities and concerns.
