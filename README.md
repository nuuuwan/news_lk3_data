### UK lawmakers back landmark bill to gradually phase out smoking for good

*2024-04-17 09:34:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98678/uk-lawmakers-back-landmark-bill-to-gradually-phase-out-smoking-for-good) · `en`

The British government’s plan for a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking cleared its first hurdle in Parliament on Tuesday despite vocal opposition from within Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party.

The bill, a key policy announced by Sunak last year, would make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2009. If passed, the bill will give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world. Authorities say it will create modern Britain’s “first smoke-free generation.”

Under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, children turning 15 this year or younger will never be legally sold tobacco. Once implemented — officials are aiming for 2027 — the legal age of sale that people in England can buy cigarettes will be raised by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population.

Colombo, April 17 (Daily Mirror) - Government officials continued to sound upbeat in striking a deal with the bondholders, however, authorities this week failed to reach a consensus regarding the terms of restructuring.

Despite “constructive discussions”, authorities and the bondholders did not agree on restructuring terms, Sri Lanka said in a regulatory filing to the London Stock Exchange.

The restructuring of the debt, amounting to over US$ 12 billion, is a mandatory requirement set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the island nation to continue in its efforts to come out of the debt crisis.

According to the filing, Sri Lanka rejected the ‘Macro-Linked Bond’ (MLB) proposal as it still had concerns, whereas the members of the Steering Committee articulated the reasons why they believed the terms of their MLB proposal were fair and reasonable.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe took part in the World Bank’s Bio-Diversity Financing Forum on the sideline of the IMF/World Bank Spring Meeting in Washington late on Tuesday as the island nation is looking to borrow through nature-lined Green Bonds.

Sri Lanka’s Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) introduced listing of Green Bonds in April last year and officials say a few parties have expressed interests in listing. However, so far no listing has been done.

The money raised from Green Bonds, a nature-linked debt instrument, could be used only for green projects like renewable energy, unlike conventional corporate debenture, which could be used for anything the government wants.

The island nation has set targets to become carbon neutral in 2050 and is looking for $11.26 billion in investment to meet its renewable energy targets in eight years through 2030, government officials have said.

### Addressing gender inequality key priority for Sri Lanka: ADB

As Sri Lanka looks to reach higher growth aspirations, addressing gender inequality is a key priority, the Asian Development Bank said.

In an economically active population of 8.5 million in 2022, female labour force participation in Sri Lanka was only 32.1 percent, down from 33.6 percent in 2018 prior to the economic crisis.

Key reasons for this include lack of safe and affordable childcare facilities, inadequate provision for flexible working hours, onerous household responsibilities and care duties socially imposed on women, and public transport inadequacies for women.

“While the private sector has addressed these shortcomings to some extent, the government can tackle gender inequality through a more supportive framework for female labour participation by introducing flexible work hours and mandating equal pay, the ADB said in its recent outlook report.

In democratic electoral politics, the strength of leaderships lies in how open and committed they stand against injustice and for democratic and fundamental rights. In Sinhala South, mainstream political leaderships took over majoritarian extremism. In post-war Tamil politics, established political leaders failing to stand with their people allows religious extremism.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila has requested official documents from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the ceding of Katchatheevu Island from India to Sri Lanka. He submitted a Right to Information (RTI) request on 11 April.

Gammanpila said the request was made at an opportune time, as India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has brought up the Katchatheevu issue during the lead-up to India’s general election, which begins on 19 April.

He expressed a desire for the public to have access to the relevant documents, including what he termed historical evidence dating back to the 12th century BC and the exchange of letters between India and Sri Lanka on the subject.

The Katchatheevu issue was raised on Indian political platforms by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, who accused the rival Congress party of underhandedly giving the island to Sri Lanka. Modi also criticised the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for its alleged involvement in the matter.

*2024-04-16 22:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/soes-seen-as-failing-sls-ordinary-citizens/) · `en`

State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Sri Lanka have long served the interests of its employees and politicians, neglecting the welfare of ordinary citizens, Research Consultant at the Advocata Institute Rehana Thowfeek said.

Speaking at a recent media briefing titled, “Burden and The Urgency of State-Owned Enterprise Reform” held at the BMICH, Thowfeek emphasized the urgent need for reform, stating that despite Sri Lanka defaulting on its loan repayments for nearly two years, meaningful progress has been lacking in the country.

Thowfeek highlighted the detrimental impact state intervention in markets has on consumer welfare, attributing inefficiencies to the enrichment of politicians at the expense of taxpayers. She outlined recent reform efforts, including the passing of the SOE Reforms Act and a new Banking Act, alongside the establishment of the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SOERU) and the Holding Company.
