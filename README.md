After two weeks of negotiations in Baku, Azerbaijan, COP29 ended at 5:30 a.m. during a closing plenary that lasted through the night from Saturday to Sunday, 24 November, almost two days after the scheduled closing of the sessions. Key negotiation items included climate finance and adaptation, among many others: but what are some of the main outcomes, and where does the world go from here?

“COP29” is shorthand for the 29th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as the concurrent meetings of Parties to the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol. Since 1995, a COP was held every year except 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the meeting. As agreed between countries, the location of the COP is subject to regional rotation, with this year’s COP filling the Eastern Europe slot, and next year’s COP (COP30) taking place in Bélem, Brazil, in the Latin American and Caribbean region.

Reflecting on the life, legacy, and cost of Velupillai Prabhakaran’s revolution

In 1984, in an interview with Anita Pratap, Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Tamil Tigers and self-styled champion of Tamil Eelam, shared his views on the geopolitical dynamics influencing the Sri Lankan conflict: “Induction of US arms is not only a threat to the Tamil freedom movement but also to India’s national security. America’s objective, as you will certainly be aware, is not simply confined to helping the Sri Lankan army to crush the Tamil liberation struggle. Their ultimate aim is to secure a naval base at Trincomalee. Such a happening will convert the Indian Ocean into a war zone, and will increase the tension prevalent in the region.”

### What was 29% of N-E Tamils’ mandate for NPP Government?

*2024-11-30 04:54:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-was-29-of-N-E-Tamils-mandate-for-NPP-Government/4-769911) · `en`

Post-war issues the north-east wanted answers for, will not get trashed merely because 29% in N-E voted for NPP

Plenty is written about the JVP-led NPP in 2024 September-November elections, with many comparisons and much praise. It is a historic achievement, no doubt. It was only possible with an amateur politician Gotabaya elected president by 6.9 million voters in 2019 November totally messing up everything possible. Politically naïve and meek too, he was a total contrast to what he was projected to be, a “Hitlerite” leader. The #GotaGoHome protest campaign brought to Galle Face Green turned into a violent protest in four weeks. Re-labelled as “Aragalaya” it wrecked the entirety of traditional party politics leaving the JVP/NPP to claim they fit in best to clean up the “system”.

Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath, in a recorded video message to the High-Level Segment of the 115th Session of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Council on 26 November 2024, stressed the importance of ensuring safe, orderly, regular, rights-based migration.

The High-Level Segment of the IOM was themed: ‘Regular Migration Pathways: A Global Call for Action’, and the 115th Session of the Council was held in Geneva from 26-28 November.

Migration has been a part of human existence for centuries. Today, people migrate voluntarily, primarily for work, or are compelled to do so due to natural disasters, climate change, conflict, and economic instability. In the process, they increasingly resort to irregular pathways of migration, risking their lives, and often falling victim to human trafficking.

### Bond “scam” returns to headlines

*2024-11-30 04:48:32* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Bond-scam-returns-to-headlines/4-769909) · `en`

Once described by Sri Lanka’s Attorney General as ‘the greatest financial loss perpetrated on the people” the so-called ‘bond scam’ has returned to the headlines.

On Monday 26 November a Colombo Court ordered a former Governor of the Central Bank to report to Colombo on 25 February 2025.

Arjuna Mahendran the controversial Governor at the time, is a Singaporean national of Sri Lankan origin. Mahendran, having left Colombo during the tail end of the Presidential Commission inquiring into the issuance of bonds, has not returned to Sri Lanka since.

The so-called ‘bond scam’ attracted controversy within weeks of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government which was grandly titled Yahapalanaya governance.

The title meaning, ‘Good governance’, fell far short by the time we exposed the serious conflict of interest that seemingly manifested itself.

The Government is heading to make a serious mistake unintentionally in another area by lifting the ban on vehicle imports

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the inauguration of the first session of the 10th Parliament delivering a speech, said that the NPP Government must go with the IMF framework and the previous administration’s debt restructuring agreements as they have been endorsed by the IMF. It is true. Renegotiating for a new Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) is now dead. That is good, because we must end this process as early as possible to enter a new beginning.

If the Net Present Value analysis proves beneficial for us to ensure debt sustainability even under the macro-linked bond mechanism we must finish this process. The NPP Government is going to do it possibly by the end of December this year. It is a great consolation.

### The Port City Colombo SEZ: How well would it navigate Asia’s evolving economic landscape?

From bustling metropolises to serene island paradises, the Asian continent has been prided as an oasis for diverse locations with tax-friendly policies that translate into higher standards of living. However, the tides are turning as mature economies adopt global minimum tax standards, eroding traditional tax advantages and pressuring high-income countries to adjust.

This shift affects Asian economies that have long relied on competitive tax rates to attract multinationals. Now, SEZs in countries like Singapore are adapting by promoting high-value industries, digital infrastructure, and skilled labor as key draws. Emerging SEZs in regions like Port City Colombo (PCC), Sri Lanka and SEZs in Vietnam, however, still leverage flexible tax policies to attract investment, creating a dynamic and evolving landscape across Asia.

### Technology and human judgement

*2024-11-30 00:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/technology-and-human-judgement/) · `en`

A tragic incident where a car, reportedly guided by Google Maps, plunged off a bridge under construction, killing three persons in India has sparked a debate on whether online navigation apps should be held responsible for such mishaps. There are arguments for and against the culpability of the providers of online navigation services in respect of incidents of that nature, which however are rare.

The above-mentioned accident and the debate thereon are of much relevance to Sri Lankans, many of whom use Google Maps, daily. Those who are engaged in food delivery, e-commerce, ride-hailing transport, etc., cannot do without online navigation. Gone are the days when directions were given verbally; anyone who cannot provide or follow ‘locations’ online is considered a dinosaur, today. Most people across the globe cannot think of a day without Google Maps and other such online navigation platforms.

### Lessons For Sri Lanka From The Great October Revolution

Lenin disagreed with that view.

Given the current dominance of capitalism, did Lenin underestimate, the opportunities available for the imperialist capitalist order to expand quantitatively and horizontally?
