    "Famed journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge\u2019s daughter Ahimsa has expressed hope that the newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will bring justice to her father who was assassinated on 8 January 2009. \u201cToday, we stand with hope and unwavering determination in seeking justice for my father, whose life was unjustly taken for speaking truth to power. The pain still lingers 15 years on, but I remain resolute in my pursuit of the truth and accountability,\u201d Ahimsa said. She noted that Saturday\u2019s election result has given a renewed sense of hope. \u201cThe JVP has historically been critical of the establishment and we are hopeful this leadership will bring a fresh perspective into finally addressing the atrocities that have taken place in Sri Lanka\u2019s recent human rights history.\u201d She said that, despite the overwhelming evidence by brave and skilled detectives like Shani Abeysekara and Nishantha Silva, for 15 years the Governments in power refused to take meaningful action regarding her father\u2019s assassination, which is a stark reminder of the country\u2019s culture of impunity. \u201cIt left my family no choice but to seek justice beyond our shores.\u201d \u201cFor the first time, we were hopeful that, regardless of the outcome of this election, justice could prevail with either of the two leading candidates. Our family would like to thank Sajith Premadasa who has consistently and personally promised justice for our family under a Premadasa presidency. He fought long and hard in his campaign and he\u2019s fought even harder for Sri Lankans,\u201d Ahimsa said. \u201cThe people have spoken, and we congratulate Anura Kumara Dissanayake who has vowed justice for my father and many other families who suffered horrific losses under the Rajapaksa reign of terror. We look forward to working with his Government in pursuit of accountability and a just Sri Lanka. While the road to justice is long and arduous, I remain committed in my fight for my father and honouring his legacy,\u201d she added."
