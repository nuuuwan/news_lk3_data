    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked business leaders to educate their employees on the significance of the country\u2019s domestic debt restructuring (DDR), noting that reduced interest rates will follow along with development assistance.",
    "At a meeting held at the presidential secretariat in Colombo Thursday March 29, Wickremesinghe and other government officials had briefed various stakeholder groups on the debt restructuring exercise.",
    "\u201cThe president urged the business leaders to educate their employees on this crucial step aimed to ensure that individuals and industries comprehend the significance of this financial manoeuvre. He said by engaging in widespread explanations, stakeholders can grasp the nuances of the restructuring and gauge its influence on their livelihoods,\u201d a statement from the president\u2019s media division (PMD) said on Friday June 30.",
    "Anticipated reduction in interest rates, providing a glimmer of hope for individuals burdened by financial obligations is expected, according to the president. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, experts predict a noticeable decline in interest rates within a matter of months, the statement said.",
    "\u201cI think best is for you all to go out and explain what this debt restructuring means to you all and to the workforce. I think that\u2019s what you all should do and if you can keep that momentum in the next few days, it will be very helpful. This is about the best that we can achieve. With this comes the fact that our interest rates will come down. It\u2019s a matter of months before it comes down. Secondly, the development assistance will start, which will be a boost to a part of the construction sector,\u201d the president was quoted as saying.",
    "As part of this restructuring, an injection of development assistance is on the horizon, poised to breathe new life into the construction sector. This infusion of support has the potential to stimulate growth, create employment opportunities, and invigorate the overall economy, the president has said.",
    "Addressing trade union representatives, the president said failing to restructure domestic debt could lead to a potential increase in interest rates for loans obtained by small businesses. According to the PMD statement, he had also expressed concerns about the possibility of the dollar\u2019s resurgence, given the strengthening of the rupee. DDO must be conducted simultaneously with foreign debt optimisation to mitigate this risk, he was quoted as saying.",
    "The law guarantees the continuation of the 9 percent annual interest provided to beneficiaries under the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF), the president had noted, urging unions not to harbour any doubts regarding future benefits. (Colombo/Jun30/2023)"
