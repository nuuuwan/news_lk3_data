    "Alleges certain members of the Council are working from within to obstruct the Council's efforts",
    "Announces a Parliamentary Select Committee will be formed to probe its functions and delays",
    "Highlights challenges in making appointments to top posts including that of IGP",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe accused certain members of the Constitutional Council of sabotage yesterday.\u00a0 In his address to Parliament, Wickremesinghe attributed the absence of an IGP and new judges in the country, to the Constitutional Council and its members. He claimed that the body had caused delays by not promptly approving names for these positions.",
    "The President announced that a Parliamentary Select Committee will be formed to probe the delays of the Council in approving names to high posts in Sri Lanka as it appears that certain members were sabotaging its functions. Accordingly, the committee will be appointed next week.",
    "The President's comments came in the wake of a heated parliamentary discussion regarding the delays caused by the Constitutional Council in approving appointments to high-ranking positions in Sri Lanka.",
    "Regarding the appointment of Court of Appeal President Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne to the Supreme Court, the President said he was unaware of the reasons for the delay. He clarified, \"It was a name nominated by the Chief Justice that was put forward to the Constitutional Council by me.\"",
    "The President emphasised that essential decisions were hindered due to certain members of the Constitutional Council allegedly working from within to obstruct the Council's efforts. As a result, President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced the decision to establish a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate issues pertaining to the Constitutional Council.",
    "\"Today, we are unable to make appointments to the Police Department or the Judiciary. The Speaker has written to the Constitutional Council and their response states that they cannot reach a decision. One member is yet to be appointed to the Constitutional Council. Among the six members, there is a split on the decision, and two are abstaining from voting, causing delays in appointments,\" President Ranil Wickremesinghe disclosed in Parliament.",
    "\"What has occurred now is a situation where we have no Inspector General of Police, and there are also no Judges. I am uncertain how justice is expected to prevail because, at present, the police cannot function, and the courts are at a standstill. If certain members of the Constitutional Council are acting destructively, we cannot proceed with this approach,\" expressed the President.",
    "He also highlighted the challenges in appointing an Anti-Corruption Commission despite the passage of relevant laws due to similar issues with the Constitutional Council. Wickremesinghe clarified, \"This Council falls under the Executive, even though it is considered a Parliamentary Committee and the Constitutional Council. The Council is tasked with scrutinising the eligibility of the names nominated by the President for appointments to high posts. So, as the Executive, I have taken the necessary action in this regard.\"",
    "The President made these statements in response to queries raised by Opposition MPs Sajith Premadasa, Harsha de Silva, and Rauf Hakeem."
