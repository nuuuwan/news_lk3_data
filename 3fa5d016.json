    "TikTok is a social media app that lets users create, share, and view short videos. The app is primarily used for creating and sharing creative and entertaining content, such as lip-syncs, dances, and comedy skits, but you\u2019ll also find filters, effects, and music overlays to enhance your video content.",
    "One of the significant advantages of TikTok is its easy-to-use interface, which appeals to beginners and experienced users alike. Another advantage is the vast library of music and sounds that can be used to create unique and engaging content, especially for the younger audience,",
    "However, unfortunately, in our scene, I\u2019ve noticed quite a few TikTok users \u2013 girls, in particular \u2013 uploading sexually provocative content, and I guess they believe that by sexualizing themselves in their TikTok videos they can gain greater attention.",
    "In fact, scroll through any social media, and it isn\u2019t long before you see girls shaking their booty for likes and comments.",
    "Many others, guys included, portrait themselves in such absurd and foolish ways that I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t feel shy when they see themselves in such videos \u2013 like Being Silly, Kid Stuff, Silly Jokes, Crying, Offering Silly Advice, etc.",
    "Certain known personalities, too, seem to be bitten by this bug.",
    "For many, TikTok (and social media), is everything, but they must remember that anything in excess can be harmful to the mind.",
    "According to experts, as with any social network, TikTok is also plagued by imagery, messages and trends that could cause real harm to users\u2019 mental health, including:",
    "* Content that promotes unhealthy lifestyles and unrealistic body image.",
    "* Dependence on online validation from other users (more likes, comments and shares).",
    "Additionally, I\u2019m told, the platform\u2019s addictive nature may have both positive and negative impacts on mental health, depending on how it\u2019s used.",
    "Research proves how bad social media is for one\u2019s mental health. The toll on your brain comes in many forms. You\u2019ll find ample cases of the usual social media scourges\u2014harassment, abuse, and cyber-bullying.",
    "If TikTok is done for purely entertainment purposes, it\u2019s fine and I\u2019ve seen people making some awesome videos, and it\u2019s certainly a good source of entertainment.",
    "So, let\u2019s have TikTok videos for entertainment, and not STUPID and VULGAR.",
