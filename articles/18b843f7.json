    "The relevant case was taken up before a seven-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya this morning, whereas the case was adjourned until 1.30 p.m. as President\u2019s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for defendant\u00a0 Jayawardena stated before the court that since his client is an active duty police officer, he is not in a position to demand money from outside parties for payment of the compensation.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel further informed that however, the taking into account the situation, Jayawardena\u2019s friends have come forward to help paying the rest of the compensation that is to be paid and that the relevant amount will be settled to the Office for Reparations through the bank today.",
