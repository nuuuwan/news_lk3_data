    "It is obligatory on the part of adherents of democracy the world over to bow their heads in remorse and reverence to the memory of five Al-Jazeera journalists who were killed in what appears to be a targeted Israeli military strike in the Gaza. Prominent among them was Anas al-Sharif, a journalist who won the esteem of the world of democracy for his courageous and conscientious reporting of the endemic suffering of the people of the Gaza.",
    "The killing of the journalists would, rightly, be seen by the defenders and practitioners of democracy as an attempt at suppressing press freedom and the freedom of expression. That is, two fundamental freedoms of humanity have been brazenly violated. In other words, truth-seeking has been murderously assaulted. It is up to the civilized world to ensure that it is not allowed to bleed to death.",
    "Very rightly, press freedom is considered a defining essence of democracy. Minus press freedom and the closely allied freedom of expression humanity would verily \u2018be in chains\u2019. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of all those who cherish their individual and collective freedoms to denounce the killing of the Al-Jazeera journalists. They need to stand up and be counted.",
    "The recent killing of the five journalists in the Gaza was preceded by the 2022 killing in the West Bank, in an Israeli attack, of Palestinian- American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla. What makes their killings particularly remorseful and revolting is the fact that they were felled in \u2018targeted\u2019, coldly calculated attacks. That is, the truth was sought to be suppressed. Accordingly, democratic opinion the world over is the poorer by their unconscionable slaying.",
    "However, the task facing the world of democracy is to bring the killers of the above notable journalists to justice. Would justice, indeed, be served? This is an issue of the greatest magnitude in this connection but if the killing of Abu Aqla is anything to go by no such momentous development would come to pass and the international community would be compelled to look on in helpless and embarrassed silence as the blood-letting continues.",
    "In the short term, though, the independent press the world over and the champions of democracy would need to be vocal, visible and unambiguous in their denunciation of the killing of the journalists. Protest demonstrations are very much in order and the press in Sri Lanka too should consider it obligatory to demonstrate its outrage over the killings.",
    "While the UN is in a state of helplessness over such lawlessness for quite obvious reasons it is in the power of the US to put things right on this score to some extent by holding Israel accountable for the crimes in question. The fact that it is \u2018the world\u2019s most powerful democracy\u2019 makes it stringently obligatory on the US\u2019 part to protect press freedom and other values that are of fundamental importance to democracy.",
    "However, the US\u2019 reluctance to take issue with Israel on the killings while exposing its official posturing on democracy as duplicitous establishes the weight that Realpolitik considerations carry in its formulation and implementation of foreign policy. That is, global power and influence are of greater importance to the US than fundamental freedoms and values that define and enrich democracy.",
    "What gives added salience to the above questions are current, crucial developments in the Ukrainian theatre. US President Trump is seemingly going the \u2018extra mile\u2019 to help settle the Ukrainian tangle through a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday but the US\u2019 tolerance of Israeli military excesses in the Gaza calls in question the sincerity of the US as a peacemaker. However, there could be some basis to widespread claims that the US President is passionately focused on clinching the Nobel Peace Prize, come what may.",
    "However, it is not only the US that has much soul-searching to do in the current turn of developments on the international stage. The South too needs to do likewise. This applies in particular to the more economically vulnerable states of the South.",
    "This is on account of the fact that most of the latter states prefer to shy away from taking on major powers of an authoritarian mould in the Eastern hemisphere on whom their economic dependence is great but would criticize the US and its allies uninhibitedly on human rights issues. Such adoption of double standards needs to be decried. Authoritarian repressive states today dominating the BRICS, for instance, are as open to censure as the US and Israel are on human rights violations and excesses. These BRICS heavyweights too need to be spiritedly opposed by democratic opinion everywhere.",
    "On the question of bringing peace to the Ukraine these issues need to be strongly focused on. Press freedom and national sovereignty are sides of the same proverbial coin. The major countries of the South would be guilty of gross partiality if perceived US irregularities on the foreign policy front are criticized by them while the fact that Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty has been violated by Russia is ignored or glossed over by them for instance. All fundamental freedoms are intertwined and constitute an organic whole as it were.",
