### Netanyahu to take the stand in his corruption trial for the first time

*2024-12-10 08:25:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104122/netanyahu-to-take-the-stand-in-his-corruption-trial-for-the-first-time) · `en`

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks.

Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying.

Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing.

Harnessing RE resources offers energy security and creates avenues for investment with skilled job opportunities opening for management, financial and technical specialists

Some of the factors that discourage investment flow and impede rapid development are the current sovereign credit risk ratings, state of the economy, risks associated with the principal sector player – the CEB, uncertainties associated with ongoing power sector reforms, cumbersome regulatory framework and seeming ineffectiveness of the regulator – PUCSL, expressions of environmental concern and geopolitics that influences project financing and development

I was an attendee at the International Conference on “Reimagining of the Electricity Industry for the Future” held on 28 November 2024 organised by the Sri Lanka branch of The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

### America has two presidents as the world braces for another Trump term

*2024-12-09 16:04:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/america-has-two-presidents-as-the-world-braces-for-another-trump-term/) · `en`

The election of Donald Trump as US President for yet another term has sent many world leaders scurrying for cover. Especially in the West. But even China is concerned. In the US itself, the longstanding maxim that there can only be one president at a time is being put to the test every day. Joe Biden, the outgoing president, is scrambling to salvage his legacy after a disastrous last year that has diminished all his achievements over the first three years on the domestic front.

Externally, Biden’s presidency has been a monumental failure, from the impulsive withdrawal from Afghanistan that kickstarted it, to the hopelessly painful stalemate in Ukraine and the relentless mass devastation in Gaza that are dragging out its end. With the pardoning of his son Hunter Biden, the outgoing president has ceded even the little moral hump that he had over Trump.
