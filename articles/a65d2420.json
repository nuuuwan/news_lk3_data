  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has recently (13 August, 2025) ordered a one-month suspension of the construction of two wind power plants in Mannar Island in order to review the issues raised primarily by the local communities. \u00a0It has been reported that the community representatives raised serious concerns over a nine-day long continuous agitation (code named \u2018Karunilam\u2019 \u2013 Black soil) against the impacts of environmental destruction, involuntary displacement and violation of consent not only during the wind farm project implementation but also those associated with prawn farms and mining of mineral sands such as ilmenite).",
    "The local representatives have apparently faulted the authorities for failing to properly implement the environmental recommendations and the report findings of the Central Environmental Authority on the impact on livelihoods, the environment and the regional economy.\u00a0 They have argued that since the Cabinet approval has already been given for these wind farm projects, it can even be challenged legally to obtain a court injunction against the project in order to receive redress to the issues they have raised.",
    "In response, the president has reportedly stated that construction would not move forward without the approval of the Central Environmental Authority and compliance with the recommendations given in its assessment reports. He has stressed that while development is essential to strengthen the economy, it must be conducted with the consensus and solutions primarily in addressing local concerns. Consequently, a decision has been made by the relevant state agencies to develop a framework to identify and resolve the issues faced by local communities due to wind power plants and other issues during this one-month grace period.",
    "In this regard, the Land Reclamation Department has been tasked with assessing flood risks from the wind power plants, several other government agencies including the Departments of wildlife and Forest Conservation, Mahaweli Authority, Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Environment have been instructed to prepare a joint report on northern lands and submit proposals to resolve the issues raised by the local communities and the general public, at large.",
    "The controversy over wind power plants in Mannar is an old one and I have already written two previous newspaper articles \u00a0\u00a0as this subject is having national and regional significance somewhat akin to the now ill-famed Sinharaja Logging Project of the 1970s. ( 1). https://island.lk/mannar-wind-farm-project-another-folly-like-the-sinharaja-logging-project-on-the-horizon/). 2). https://island.lk/a-plea-for-establishing-a-transboundary-blue-green-biosphere-reserve-in-gulf-of-mannar-and-palk-bay/ ) and another in LORIS (https://www.wnpssl.org/pdf/loris/lorismagazinevolume30issue-3.pdf).",
    "In my first article published in 2024 (before the presidential elections), I drew some parallels between the Mannar Wind Farm Project with that of the Sinharaja Logging Project. The executive order issued by the president is somewhat similar to the appointment of a special commission headed by a cabinet minister during Mrs. Banadaranayake\u2019 government in early1970s mandated to examine the veracity of the public criticism and make recommendations on the continuation of the logging project.",
    "This problem of Mannar wind farms still persists because the Sri Lankan governmental authorities representing different key stakeholder sectors (environmental, social and economic) have still not jointly \u00a0come together to commit in a coherent and integrated manner to reconcile the need for power generation, mineral sand mining, illegal fishing, prawn farming and future oil exploration needs with\u00a0 peoples\u2019 concerns despite a number of authoritative reports, position papers and research publications have already been prepared to address these issues in a scientific manner for the Mannar region as a whole\u00a0 (and beyond). In that respect, the current situation is very much different from that prevailed during the Sinharaja logging project and we hope that a scientific evidence-based solution acceptable to all stakeholders could be arrived at within a shorter period of time.",
    "I am listing below several reports by both national and international agencies that are of great value for the review committee to consider (if they haven\u2019t already) along with the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out for the now withdrawn Adani Project, which had its own share of inherent deficiencies and hence drawing in criticisms from both national and international scientific community. \u00a0I am also hoping that my effort would provide the general public an opportunity to share their own views on this nationally and regionally important issue rekindling the events that took place during Sinharaja logging project, half a century ago.",

    "It is indeed surprising that with all these (and perhaps, more) background and baseline information being available, a realistic appraisal of these windfarm and other developmental projects has not been done to adequately safeguard the interests of the local people and the environment while engaging in multifarious development projects.",
    "It is very likely that in response to the president\u2019s directive, the relevant government authorities will have to hurriedly develop a policy framework and a strategic action plan to identify and resolve the issues raised by the local communities stemming from wind power plants, mineral extraction and prawn farming, within a period of one month from 13th August 2025.",
    "Consequently, \u00a0it is quite probable that an ad hoc framework to address the above issues will be prepared to meet the deadline set by the president during this short period of time. However, a longer-term approach is needed along globally accepted scientific and socio-economic principles and guidelines, in order to attract investors to convert these perplexing challenges to viable opportunities benefiting the local communities, the environment and the economy through, for example, climate finance instruments. The rest of this article is directed towards that objective.",
    "Marine, Coastal (and Inland Terrestrial) Spatial Planning in the Mannar Region",
    "Marine and Coastal Spatial Planning is a proven conflict resolution tool tested over 100 countries/territories that aims in addressing disputes among disparate stakeholders by effectively integrating divergent human endeavors in marine and coastal environments in achieving ecological, economic, and social objectives for sustainable long-term development.\u00a0 \u00a0It is a process aimed at better decision-making for the use of marine and coastal resources, promoting sustainable development, and addressing conflicts between different ocean uses. It involves a comprehensive, integrated, ecosystem-based approach that moves away from the traditional, single-sector management of coastal and marine areas. \u00a0Mannar being a small and somewhat rectangular island, the spatial planning process needs to address issues pertaining not only to marine and coastal areas but the inland terrestrial landscapes in an integrated mode.",
    "A position paper titled \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s Blue Economy\u2019 by UNDP Sri Lanka & Laxman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies and another titled \u2018Diving deep into the Blue \u2013 A case for a Marine Spatial Plan for Sustainable Blue Economy in Sri Lanka\u2019 by the UNDP Sri Lanka (2023) have proposed a Blue Economy development approach for Sri Lanka while highlighting\u00a0 recommendations and commitments to a nationally driven sustainable Blue Economy pathway anchored by a Marine (and Coastal) Spatial Plan. They provide guiding principles to balance both the economic and conservation objectives of Sri Lanka\u2019s marine territory and offer a broad governance framework for an inclusive, whole-of-society approach which needs to be efficiently coordinated among the government, civil society, and the private sector.",
    "The UNDP & LKI jointly proposed Blue Economic Policy Framework while strengthening the protection and management of ocean and coastal ecosystems, it contributes to attracting investments in marine and coastal ecosystems-based economic sectors which have the potential to transform the present challenges to novel opportunities to maximize the social and economic benefits of the existing valuable resources, both living and non-living, to all stakeholders in an equitable manner.",
    "The two UNDP led reports have detailed out a blueprint for the blue economy and also, they have outlined an MSP Roadmap for Sri Lanka. They emphasize that integrating Sri Lanka\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) into the Blue Economy approach is essential to promote nature-positive economic recovery in combination with a carbon-neutral, sustainable future. The Blue Economy framework must reflect the Nationally Determined Contributions and finance such interventions in alignment with blue economic principles.",
    "As an example, there could be investment opportunities that include restoration of coastal \u2018blue carbon\u2019 sinks (sea gras, mangroves, and coastal wetlands) thus opening the door for innovative blue-carbon crediting schemes generated by quantifying the amount of carbon captured and stored by these ecosystems. Participation of local communities in these projects as business partners would contribute to their livelihood improvement through equitable sharing of benefits (thus meeting some of their current demands) and to climate change mitigation and adaptation, in the longer-term.",
    "In addition to these UNDP interventions, a UK Government-led team visited Sri Lanka in July 2024 to build on the support offered through the Ocean Country Partnership Programme (OCPP) and share the lessons learned from the UK on Marine Spatial Planning.\u00a0 The team met with a range of government ministries, departments and agencies (including NGOs) to discuss and agree priorities in relation to MSP \u2013 a tool that is used to manage conflict between activities and promote sustainable and equitable use of the marine environment.\u00a0 Interestingly enough, their visit concluded with a two-day consultation workshop on adopting a Strategic Environmental Appraisal (SEA) approach to MSP for Northwest Sri Lanka that includes Mannar region, as a pilot MSP. \u00a0Their final report too, would be invaluable for the review team to consider.",
    "Also, the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) has been preparing zoning maps and integrating natural habitats with impacting human activities using IOC-UNESCO guidelines towards preparing an MSP for the Gulf of Mannar region.",
    "I have gone into great length in highlighting the tremendous amount of groundwork done on Marine (and Coastal) Spatial Planning, a sine qua non prerequisite for resolving human conflicts in natural resource-rich regions like the Gulf of Mannar. Most likely, the local communities would have participated as important stakeholders in, at least, some of these exploratory exercises and as such, they may be quite familiar with issues arising from the proposed wind farm projects.",
    "Therefore, instead of taking a piecemeal approach at this juncture in response to the President\u2019s directive, a longer-term MSP based approach for the Mannar region as a pilot case study for eventual developing a Marine (and coastal) Spatial Plan for entire Sri Lanka would be more desirable. At the same time, this would be a viable solution to the problems that may be in store which may crop up time and again whenever such unplanned development projects get underway.",
    "Sri Lanka possesses a territorial sea of 21,500 km2 and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastal line at an extent of 517,000 km2. From living resources to exploitable minerals and hydrocarbons, fisheries, access to shipping lanes, offshore renewable energy, oceanic recreational opportunities such as surfing, whale and dolphin watching, deep sea diving, sea entertainment etc., the opportunities for economic value addition are virtually limitless. \u00a0Therefore, Sri Lanka has a compelling case for the adoption of a sustainable blue economic model, with a particular focus on an MSP to attract investors for collaborative management of these vital natural resources, according to the UNDP-led reports.",
    "Besides, Sri Lanka is the current chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA 2023-2025) and the six priority areas the IORA Council of ministers focusing under the Sri Lankan leadership of IORA are i) Trade and Investment, ii) Maritime Safety and Security, iii) fisheries Management, iv) Disaster Risk Management, and v) Blue Economy \u2013 all of which are well represented in the Mannar region. With national, regional and international endorsement along with their overwhelming support, Sri Lanka can lead by example and demonstrate the potential of the Blue Economy to other Indian Ocean developing states. If Sri Lanka can use this Mannar region as a pilot case study as a first step and extend it thereafter to the entire island it will undoubtedly strengthen collaboration on measures to enhance regional governance mechanisms.",
    "In this regard, the Government should use the Gulf of Mannar case study as a springboard for developing an island-wide Marine (and coastal) Spatial Plan with sufficient credibility needed for public/private investor confidence to mobilize capital for climate-resilient investments. \u00a0As a first step in this exercise, the government must strengthen its conservation strategies/targets and then judiciously allocate marine and coastal resources in order to make climate finance opportunities more attractive to potential investors.",
    "In an earlier article (The Island, 04 April 2025), I have highlighted the conservation needs that would help a Blue Economic environment for the Sri Lankan sector of the Gulf of Mannar Region. There I have suggested that once a marine and coastal spatial plan is developed for the Sri Lankan side of the Gulf of Mannar, it should seek the possibility of linking it up with the already established Indian Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve to develop a trans-boundary biosphere reserve. Conservation investments of this nature will increase investor confidence in unlocking the potential of the Blue Economy for Sri Lanka.",
