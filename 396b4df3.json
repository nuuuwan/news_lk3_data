    "Christmas is a joyful holiday season packed with activities. It is a time to share gifts and create memories. Families, friends, and organizations come together for a time of joy, love and togetherness. However, with the economic crunch and the ongoing natural disasters affecting our country, this season continues to be a challenging time for the majority of Lankans. Although it may be difficult to find the holiday spirit in extravagant celebrations and materialism, the true meaning of Christmas needs to be found in our hearts.",
    "One game plan to turn things around is to look beyond our difficulties and finding ways to spread love and joy among those who are struggling. There are many ways to go about this. Making donations to relief efforts is one. Volunteering our time to help those in need is another step. As communities, we can come together to make a difference in the lives and families of those who are struggling.",
    "One group that cannot be really overlooked is those who are struggling with mental health. A kind courtesy call or a simple encouraging gesture, can make a world of difference to those lonely, anxious, and depressed hearts. Such acts of kindness and generosity have the power to transform lives and bring joy and happiness to both the giver and the receiver.",
    "Another segment of society that is really taking the brunt of things is the local farmer communities and home industries. This Christmas, let us make efforts to do some shopping, supporting local businesses. Not only will it help those businesses, but it will also spread the joyous spirit among these individuals who have been working so tirelessly to keep their businesses running and helping our economy.",
    "Amid all the crazy festive activities, how about creating some space to remind ourselves of the true meaning of Christmas. Set aside some time to be alone with God and meditate on all the goodness and love He has showered upon our lives. Daily, spending one hour of silence before God practicing His presence during this festive season, can truly enrich our lives. Since this time of the year is all about giving, because God gave first, during this daily hour of silence, ask God, how He wants you to go about giving this season and beyond.",
    "As we celebrate the birth of Jesus, let positive attitude enveloped in love and forgiveness guide our hearts, because limitless possibilities come with it. Remember, when we come together as friends and families, it is also a time to forgive and let go of old grudges. God Himself is our model and example, with His ultimate forgiveness through the Birth of His Son.",
    "Christmas is not just a joyous holiday season, but it is also a state of mind, where we make peace with God and fellow human beings because the Prince of Peace rules and reigns in our hearts. When we have this mindset anchored in love, joy, hope and peace, then we will be able to join with the heavenly choir and sing to our hearts\u2019 delight, \u2018Joyful, joyful we adore thee\u2019 and keep the holiday spirit alive this Christmas.",
