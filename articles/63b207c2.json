    "T Suthendiraraja alias Santhan  a Sri Lankan national who was one of the six convicts released in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, died on Wednesday morning at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital (RGGH) in Chennai.",
    "Santhan, who was released by the Supreme Court in November 2022, was kept at the special camp near the Tiruchirapalli Central Prison. Last week, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Chennai issued an order to deport Santhan to Sri Lanka; however, he was admitted to the RGGH for treatment for a kidney-related ailment.",
    "Addressing the reports, E Thenirajan, Dean, RGGH, said that based on the directions of the Tiruchirapalli district collector, Santhan was admitted to the hospital on January 27. Thenirajan said a team of doctors were treating him at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and constantly monitoring him. He said Santhan was diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis or a liver disease.",
    "\u201cHe suffered a setback to his health yesterday (Tuesday) night. He had lost consciousness and we were providing treatment. Around 4.30 am today (Wednesday), he suffered a cardiac arrest.",
    "He was revived following a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) procedure and was on ventilator support. However, he failed to respond to further treatment and passed away at 7.50 am,\u201d he said.",
    "Thenirajan said they would carry out the post-mortem procedures now and take further measures to send his body to Sri Lanka.",
    "According to court documents, Santhan is believed to have fled then strife-torn Sri Lanka in 1991 and reached India by boat, along with Sivarasan, who led the assassination team and was never caught alive, and a few others. According to the Supreme Court order, Santhan\u2019s role in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was direct and active.",
    "Santhan was initially sentenced to death for his involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, however, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released in November 2022, along with five other convicts, after spending over three decades in prison.",
    "Who was Santhan, Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict who died less than 2 years after his release?",
    "Days after an order was issued to send him home to Sri Lanka, T Suthenthiraraja alias Santhan  one of the seven released convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, died in Chennai. He was 55.",
    "Who was Santhan, and what was his role in Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s assassination? How did he get involved in that conspiracy?",
    "Santhan died at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai on Wednesday. He had been admitted to the hospital last month and was undergoing treatment for non-alcoholic liver disease.",
    "According to a doctor who was treating him, he suffered a cardiac arrest on Wednesday and breathed his last at 7.50 am.",
    "When did he come to India, and how long did he spend in jail?",
    "A Sri Lankan citizen, Santhan was accused No. 2 in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. He was charged for his active association with Sivarasan, considered the mastermind behind the assassination.",
    "According to CBI case files, Santhan came to Tamil Nadu with Sivarasan in April 1991.",
    "The chargesheet described him as a member of the LTTE\u2019s intelligence wing who was close to Sivarasan. In February 1988, Sivarasan suggested that Santhan continue his studies in what was then Madras (now Chennai), and in February 1990, he secured admission at the Madras Institute of Engineering Technology, where his expenses were met by the LTTE.",
    "On May 21, 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. In 1998, a TADA court sentenced 26 of the 41 accused to death, including 12 who had died in the blast or during the investigation. In May 1999, the Supreme Court freed 19 of them, while upholding the death sentences of Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan, and Nalini, and commuting the death sentences of Payas, Ravichandran, and Jayakumar to life.",
    "Santhan spent over 32 years incarcerated, including a decade in solitary confinement. He was also a death row prisoner for 22 years until the Supreme Court commuted the death sentences of four into life in 2014.",
    "When Santhan, along with six others, were finally released in November 2022, it was the first time he stepped out of the prison complex in 32 years, as he had not had a single parole. The release, however, did not last long.",
    "While three convicts \u2013 Perarivalan, Nalini, and Ravichandran \u2013 were released, four Sri Lankan nationals \u2013 Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, and Murugan \u2013 were sent to a special prison camp for foreigners in Trichy. It was meant as a transit point before their repatriation.",
    "However, as the state government and the Union government dragged their feet on paperwork for their repatriation, all four wrote several petitions stating they were denied basic freedoms under humanitarian grounds.",
    "Among the four sheltered at Trichy prison, Santhan was the only Sri Lankan national who wanted to return to own country. After a long delay, on Friday, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Chennai issued an order to deport Santhan to Sri Lanka.",
    "Murugan, Payas, and Jayakumar were seeking to go to Europe to join their immediate relatives who migrated there during the war in Sri Lanka.",
    "While Santhan had declined to meet this reporter multiple times since 2012, Perarivalan, who spent nearly three decades in prison with Santhan, recalled him as a man \u201cwho lived in his own world\u201d.",
    "Santhan never spoke to anyone in prison. Overtly religious, he used to regularly perform puja and rituals at a temple inside Vellore prison. \u201cHe would sit in the prison temple for almost the entire day,\u201d said Perarivalan in an earlier interview.",
    "Santhan\u2019s family lives in Udupiddy in the Jaffna district in northern Sri Lanka. His father died in 2013 and his mother, Maheshwari, 78, lives with her younger son Sudhakaran. After Santhan left home, the family was displaced in 1995, and returned to their small two-room house only in 2010.",
    "In an extensive conversation with The Indian Express recently, Sudhakaran, who is 16 years younger to his brother, said he met Santhan twice after 1991 \u2013 once in 2014 and then in 2017.",
    "According to Sudhakaran, Santhan left home to study in London in 1990. \u201cWhen he was arrested, he had a ticket to fly to London three days later, which I read in the book of the late Special Investigation Team chief K Raghothaman,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOur life was always caught up in trouble. Be it from the LTTE or the Sri Lankan Army; we were victims of the war. After his arrest, he used to write letters for some time, but then we lost touch. Once he said that he reduced communication fearing that it would be trouble for us. There was extreme poverty in the period when he left for London. Not even once did we have food three times a day. I remember how my mother used to skip food for us. After the war ended and we managed an income, my mother continued to skip food for her son in prison,\u201d Sudhakaran said.",
    "The first visitor Santhan had after his arrest in 1991 was Sudhakaran, in 2014. \u201cI was six when he left home in 1990. We waited for him at the visitors\u2019 room at the Vellore Central Prison. The moment he entered the room, I cried. Seeing me, he was surprised. He asked, \u2018Thambiyaa?\u2019 (Isn\u2019t it my brother?). I said, \u2018aamam\u2019 (yes). He said he wouldn\u2019t have met me if he knew that it was me. He said he wanted to see me only back at home, not in prison.",
    "A Q-branch official stood there, consoled me. He told me my Annan (elder brother) was mentally upset. Exchanging a few words, he hurried back. He reminded me that I should inform him in advance next time as he has to do pujas at the temple inside, and that he will finish that early to meet me,\u201d Sudhakaran said.",
    "For Maheshwari, Santhan\u2019s mother, life was all about war, miseries, and concerns about her son trapped in a \u201clifelong curse\u201d.",
    "\u201cI remember the day he left us. It was Sithirai Parvam (an auspicious day falls in the Tamil month of Chithirai, in April). I was fasting that day. He had puttu (a dish made of ground rice and coconut) and left home. He was helpless. War was brewing. He said he would go to London and take his sister and brother too,\u201d she told The Indian Express after Santhan\u2019s release in 2022."
