  "original_body_lines": [
    "Dasun Shanaka produced a solid all-round performance, including bowling figures of 4/23, as former champions Sri Lanka overcame some jittery moments to down Ireland by 41 runs in their T20 World Cup warm-up game.",
    "Put in to bat at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground here on Friday, Sri Lanka saw their batting misfire in the initial phases of the game.",
    "They lost half of their side for 82 runs in 11 overs before managing to post a respectable 163/8.",
    "All-rounders Wanindu Hasaranga (26), Angelo Mathews (32), and Shanaka (23) fired up the proceedings down the order to take them to a competitive total.",
    "In reply, quick-fire knocks from Paul Stirling (21) and George Dockrell (17) were the bright spots in the initial stages of the Irish chase, but former skipper Shanaka swung the momentum with his medium pace bowling as Ireland were bowled out for 122 in 18.2 overs.",
    "Sri Lanka will face South Africa in their opening match in New York on Monday, while Ireland will be up against India on Wednesday.",
    "At Lauderhill: Sri Lanka 163/8; 20 overs (Angelo Mathews 32 not out; Josh Little 2/45, Barry McCarthy 2/31) beat Ireland 122; 18.2 overs (Curtis Campher 26; Dasun Shanaka 4/23, Maheesh Theekshana 2/14, Wanindu Hasaranga 2/40) by 41 runs."
