    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s Election Commission will announce the date of the election before the end of this week, commission chairman R M L Ratnayake told a private news network.",
    "Ratnayake told the privately owned NewsFirst Wednesday July 24 morning that the gazette notification in this regard would be published before the weekend.",
    "\u201cAs I stated before, we will announce the date before the end of this week. There is no backtracking at all. We have selected a date that is nearest and most suitable after September 17 for the election,\u201d he said.",
    "Ratnayake told the media at a press conference on July 16 that the commission will publish the notice announcing nomination and election dates before the end of July.",
    "\u201cOur first task is to publish the notice on the election. From the day the notice is published, nominations have to be accepted between 16 and 21 days. The election should be held within four to six weeks of from the day of accepting nominations,\u201d said Ratnayake.",
    "\u201cThe candidates must have enough time to do their campaigns after handing over nominations. Time is also needed to cast postal votes and carry out other duties. The election date should also be convenient for the voters. For the acceptance of nominations, we have to consider cultural factors unique to a country like Sri Lanka. Some people consider things like the Rahu period. So we have to find a date that is suitable for everyone,\u201d he said.",
    "Ratnayake said the election commission intends to issue the notice before the end of July.",
    "\u201cThis notice will contain the nominations date and the election date. We plan to then hold the election on the most suitable day after September 17.",
    "\u201cSome people had suggested that we have delayed this to end July to the benefit of one party or another. I want to point out that we can delay we can extend it to August 20 if needed,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul24/2024)"
