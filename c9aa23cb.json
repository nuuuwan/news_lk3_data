    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (Peoples Liberation Front)led Jathika Jana Balawegaya (National Peoples Power) has gone to courts seeking elections to local government bodies. A fundamental rights petition was filed  in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka by Parliamentarian Dr.Harini Amarasuriya, former MP Sunil Hadunneththi and  National Peoples Power (NPP)  secretary Dr. Nihal Jayasinghe on March 14th. The FR petition sought a court order directing relevant authorities to hold a free and fair Local Government election. Among those cited as respondents were officials from the Treasury, Elections Commission and Attorney-Generals Department.",
    "Elections to 340 local authorities comprising 24 Municipal councils, 41 Urban councils and 275 Divisional councils were earlier scheduled for March 9th by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka. . However polls were postponed indefinitely due to lack of financial resources to conduct the poll. The Govt headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe was accused by opposition parties of withholding necessary funds with the intention of preventing local govt polls. It was alleged that the Govt was averse to elections at this juncture because it was currently unpopular and would fare badly in polls.",
    "Subsequently the Elections Commission announced a fresh poll to be held on April 24.Once again the elections Commission found itself unable to procure the funds necessary to conduct elections. It was alleged again that the Treasury was not releasing the funds necessary on time. As such it appears that the elections would not take place as announced on April 24. There is uncertainty in the air about the future of  LG polls.",
    "It is against this backdrop that the JVP led NPP has filed a FR petition seeking a court order to ensure local govt elections.  The NPP has more than altruistic interest in ensuring local govt elections. The JVP led NPP  is confident that it would do very well at the hustings if  LG  polls are held soon.  If the  NPP does well as expected, the JVP led front will intensify it\u2019s demand for an early  dissolution of Parliament and the holding of  fresh elections. The NPP hopes to win and form a new Govt if and when Parliamentary elections are held. Time is of the essence. Delayed elections may alter this situation. Therefore the NPP is seeking legal recourse to enable early elections.",
    "The National Peoples Power (NPP)  is a left-leaning, working class \u2013 oriented  broad front consisting of the JVP and 27 other organizations. These entities comprise small parties, trade unions, rights groups, student and youth organizations. The JVP is the pivotal, pre-eminent force in the NPP.  The JVP as well as the NPP are led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake MP. Dissanayake contested the 2019 Presidential elections and finished a poor third with 418,553 votes (3.16%). At the 2020 Parliamentary polls, the JVP led NPP  contesting under the compass symbol  got only three MPs comprising two elected and one  appointed from  the national list .",
    "Given this poor electoral performance in 2019 and 2020, few would have expected the JVP/NPP to be a  potential \u201cwinner\u201d in the 2023 local govt elections. However the  political climate seems to have changed in favour of the compass now.  Apart from well-attended  mass- meetings and political rallies,  several  political surveys and opinion polls indicate that the JVP/NPP may be riding the crest of a  wave similar to Latin America\u2019s \u2018pink tide\u201d.",
    "An important pointer in this regard is the Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) undertaken by the Institute of Health Policy. (IHP) This is a poll based on  multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) voting intentions estimates.  The survey analyses potential voting trends and gauges the level of support  for political parties if  Parliamentary elections are held currently. The SLOTS chief  investigator is the IHP Executive Director Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya.",
    "According to media reports about the  SLOTS,  the JVP led NPP and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) are   the leading contenders. Both the SJB and NPP were  running neck to neck for the months of November and December 2022 and January 2023. There was a marked change in February 2023. Support for the JVP-led NPP surged in February, giving it a clear lead with 43% of likely General Election voters, compared to  30% for the SJB. The SLPP, the UNP, and the ITAK had the support of 4% of likely voters each, while support for the SLFP was  2%.",
    "The IHP  analysis  also disclosed  that in the 12 months from  February 2022,  the JVP-led NPP has gained 30 points while the SJB has gained 11 points. Meanwhile, the SLPP and the SLFP  have been steadily declining and lost 28 and 15 points respectively. The UNP   support has been  fluctuating  and gained 2 points.",
    "On a province by province  level, the JVP-led NPP and the SJB  are  both equal , leading in four provinces each. The JVP/NPP has been leading in the Western, North Western, North Central and Southern provinces while the SJB  has been topping the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa, Uva and Central provinces. The Tamil National Alliance(TNA) is first in the Northern province with the SJB coming second.  An interesting aspect of the provincial break-down is that the SJB has more support in provinces with larger concentrations of minority ethnicities as opposed to the NPP which has more support in largely Sinhala majority provinces.",
    "SLOTS Lead Investigator and IHP Executive Director Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya   speaking to a morning newspaper pointed out that  on the basis of the survey trends, the SLPP, SLFP, and UNP would fail to win seats in many districts if a Parliamentary Election was held today. The votes they poll, may be insufficient to gain seats. He also stated that  according to the latest poll, he electorate appeared  to be moving away from the confusion that followed the collapse of the administration led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. In earlier polls, potential voters had been repeatedly  switching  between parties, without any party  dominating.",
    "Opinion  polls and surveys  do not necessarily reflect  voting trends correctly at all times. If so there wont be a need for elections. The minds of voters can be assessed correctly only in an election. However some surveys if done correctly do serve as straws in the wind. The IHP is a research centre based in Colombo In the case of the IHP/SLOTS the methodology adopted  according to media reports has been as follows-",
    "\u201cThe SLOTS combines interviews from a national sample of adults (aged 18 years and over) reached by the random digit dialling of mobile numbers, with the others coming from a national panel of respondents who were previously recruited through random selection. The IHP estimates voting intent using an adaptation of the MRP, which exploits data from all the SLOTS interviews to estimate voting in a particular month.\u201d",
    "\u201c The February 2023 MRP estimates are based on 421 interviews conducted in February, and 10,050 interviews conducted overall from 31 August 2021 and 12 March 2023, with a margin of error assessed as 2-5% for leading parties. All estimates are adjusted to ensure that the sample matches the national population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, geographical location, and voting in the 2019 Presidential and 2020 General Elections.\u201d",
    "The SLOTS estimates  say the JVP/NPP has surged ahead in popularity in February 2023 and established a clear lead.The IHP/SLOTS reports have received some coverage in the media. Apart from this there were also two \u201cintelligence\u201dreports that stated the JVP/NPP was ahead of  other parties in popularity. The intelligence reports  noted that the JVP led NPP enjoyed wide support in both rural and urban areas. Support in the rural areas was higher than in urban areas. The JVP/NPP was tipped to come first in most Local Government authorities if elections were to be held in March.",
    "I myself have no access to these intelligence reports  but very reliable Govt sources have disclosed the essence of these intelligence reports to me. It appears that these reports  have heavily influenced the powers that be in preventing LG elections being held this year. This also means that there is very little chance of the LG polls being  ever held this year.",
    "If the opinion polls, surveys and intelligence reports are correct, elections to the local authorities will result in the JVP/NPP doing best with the SJB coming next in most Sinhala majority councils. The minority parties  would do well in  many local bodies in the Northern, Eastern and Up Country Provinces. But parties like the SLPP, SLFP and UNP  are expected to fare miserably.",
    "A grand slam by  opposition parties would not affect the President or his Govt. A defeat in LG polls will not bring about a change of Govt. However victory in LG polls will result in the opposition parties intensifying their call for an early Parliamentary poll. Demands asking  President Wickremesinghe to  quit may escalate. The JVP fortified with an impressive performance in the Local Govt polls could spearhead this anti- Govt movement. This obviously is the main reason for the Wickremesinghe Govt obstructing LG polls.",
    "The current situation in which the JVP  and SJB are the chief contenders for the electoral crown is a new development in Sri Lankan politics. \u201cThe  Media Analysis\u201dreport of \u201cVerite Reearch\u201d dated Feb 13-19 pinpoints the JVP\u2019s  current ascendancy in electoral  politics. Here are excerpts \u2013",
    "\u201cFor the first time, the JVP/NPP appears to be viewed as one of the two big players in the election competition. Thus far, the party has always occupied an important position in electoral races, but one that was limited to being considered either the third- or fourth-ranked party in the electoral competition.\u201d",
    "\u201c However, the unusual and relatively disproportionate attention and criticism received by the party suggests that the NPP is being viewed as a major competitor and a \u2019threat\u2019 to the electoral base of the other major parties.\u201d",
    "\u201c Thus, in the current dynamics of election campaigning, the NPP appears to have captured the space of a mainstream political party, despite only holding three seats in parliament.\u201d",
    "It is therefore  quite clear that the JVP is going to do well if Local Govt elections are held soon. The JVP led NPP has scented the sweet smell of success in Local Govt polls. The filing of a FR petition seeking LG elections is a manifestation of the party\u2019s fervent desire to bring about a speedy poll. This is understandable. The JVP has also threatened Island-wide protests if LG elections are not held early.",
    "Why is the JVP led NPP  expected to do well in electoral politics? How did the party which was an \u201calso ran\u201d emerge as a potential winner? What is the  particular appeal of the JVP to voters in the current situation? In short what has enabled the JVP led NPP to scent the sweet smell of success in polls? These questions will be delved into in detail in the second part of this article.",
