    "Colombo, Feb 26 (Daily Mirror) - The notice published on the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) official website notifying Russian and Ukraine tourists to get their visas in order, has been taken down.",
    "Industry sources shared with Daily Mirror that the notice was removed today since the Ministry of Internal Security maintains that it did not issue such an update.",
    "However, on 22 February, the Department of Immigration and Emigration wrote to the Ministry of Tourism requesting to inform Russian and Ukrainian tourists that the complimentary visa extensions offered end on 23 February.",
    "As per the notice, a 14-day grace period, expiring on 7 March 2024, will be provided to either return home or extend the visas through the formal process.",
    "While a tussle is currently ongoing between the relevant authorities and ministries in this regard, the stance on the visa remains unclear."
