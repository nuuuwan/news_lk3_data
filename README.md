In 1973, the government distributed 10 kg of rice to low-income families, threatening jail and fines for taking more. Initially, it aimed to prevent rice imports and self-govern, but now imports are allowed. This change led to the publication of a warning in Weerakesari on November 15, 1973, about confiscation and fines for taking over half a rice.

🟩

The government provides 10 kg of rice each to low -income families in the country. However, in 1973, the government announced that those who were taken over the rice would be jailed and fined.

### Pro-China party wins Maldives election in landslide

MALE, April 22 (Reuters) - Maldives voters handed President Mohamed Muizzu's party a landslide win at parlimentary elections, media said on Monday, an outcome set to shift the Indian Ocean archipelago closer to China and away from traditional partner India.

Muizzu's People's National Congress (PNC) won 65 of the 93 seats up for grabs on Sunday, preliminary results from the Maldives Elections Commission and media projections show.

The main opposition Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) dwindled to just 12 seats from 65 earlier.

Both Beijing and New Delhi have wooed the Maldives as they vie for influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Elected last year, Muizzu has pledged to end the country's "India First" policy, straining ties with New Delhi.

His government has asked dozens of Indian military personnel to leave the Maldives, a move critics say could hasten its shift towards China.

Muizzu's post as president is not affected by Sunday's vote, in which 368 candidates contested for five-year terms.

### Pro-China party wins Maldives election in landslide, media say

*2024-04-22 14:40:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98775/pro-china-party-wins-maldives-election-in-landslide-media-say) · `en`

Maldives voters handed President Mohamed Muizzu’s party a landslide win at parlimentary elections, media said on Monday, an outcome set to shift the Indian Ocean archipelago closer to China and away from traditional partner India.

Muizzu’s People’s National Congress (PNC) won 65 of the 93 seats up for grabs on Sunday, preliminary results from the Maldives Elections Commission and media projections show.

The main opposition Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) dwindled to just 12 seats from 65 earlier.

Both Beijing and New Delhi have wooed the Maldives as they vie for influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Elected last year, Muizzu has pledged to end the country’s “India First” policy, straining ties with New Delhi.

His government has asked dozens of Indian military personnel to leave the Maldives, a move critics say could hasten its shift towards China.

Muizzu’s post as president is not affected by Sunday’s vote, in which 368 candidates contested for five-year terms.

### Sri Lanka rupee quoted in spot-next dollar market after pressure

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee was quoted at 302.20/30 to the US dollar in the spot next (spot plus one day) market after the stop opened tentatively at 302.00/75 levels, dealers said.

There were one or two sporadic deals at 302.00 to the US dollar, but the spot market was not very active in early trade, dealers said.

Market participants are recovering from a heavy dose of moral suasion last week, after the rupee came under upward pressure from an ‘oversold position’.

Sri Lanka’s central bank collected 715 million dollars from the interbank market in March, three times the around 200 million it collected in the previous two months.

The central bank was able to collect large amount of dollars in March as the rupee was allowed to appreciate steeply within a short time amid deflationary policy, encouraging importers to delay payments and also creating market incentives banks to short their open positions.
