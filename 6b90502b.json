    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and SriLankan Airlines have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to promote aviation sector jobs among school children, through television programs and in-person orientations by SriLankan personnel.",
    "The \u2018Guwan Sihina\u2019 program focuses on schoolchildren from rural areas, Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena said on Thursday (14).",
    "\u201cThere are 4.4 million children across the nation, especially in rural areas, who come to school to only learn what they will be questioned in examinations,\u201d Gunawardena said. \u201cThere is a skills mismatch.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn contrast to most developed countries, we do not offer opportunities for these children to broaden their understanding and ideas of the world beyond the school curriculum. That\u2019s why a majority of Sri Lankans historically have struggled to find stable and sufficient incomes,\u201d he said.",
    "According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) statistics, in the next 20 years due to rising demand, 27,000 new aircraft will be needed to be added to the current 17,000 commercial fleet. Over 617,000 pilots will be needed to fly these crafts.",
    "It also estimates that 609,000 new technicians will be needed to maintain these new aircrafts, and 40,000 air traffic controllers will be needed on ground, in 10 years time.",
    "Gunawardena said that he was thankful that they can reach children through the television, to offer them the opportunity to see the jobs available in the aviation industry, naval field, ports and shipping sectors at a young age.",
    "\u201cWe should help bring awareness to the sector, especially among the young and brave students of the O/L and A/L classes. We should show them what we have, attract them and prepare a generation of children suited for tomorrow\u2019s world.\u201d",
    "Civil Aviation Authority Director General P A Jayakantha said: \u201cWe face challenges in finding persons with the right skills, qualifications and experience. This is a national responsibility, and we have to bring awareness to these children with the programs we have conducted.",
    "\u201cThose who benefited the most from our programs, in the past, have been the children of urban areas,\u201d he said.",
    "Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala De Silva said the aviation sector made a profit of 26 billion rupees and the ports sector 19 billion rupees, this year. \u201cI gave 10 billion of this to the treasury,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Dec14/2023)"
