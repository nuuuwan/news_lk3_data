    "The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) today warmly welcomed the UK Government\u2019s announcement of liberalised rules of origin under the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS), which will come into effect in early 2026.",
    "The reforms will allow Sri Lankan manufacturers to source up to 100% of inputs for garments from any country worldwide while continuing to enjoy tariff-free access to the UK market. This represents a significant upgrade to existing trade arrangements, reducing restrictions on processing and aligning Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector with the same rules available countries enjoying \u201cComprehensive Preferences\u201d under the DCTS.",
    "The UK remains one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most important export destinations for apparel. The simplified rules will enable manufacturers to compete more effectively in global markets, diversify sourcing strategies, and maintain consistent access to UK buyers. The changes will also support Sri Lanka\u2019s role as a trusted, value-added supplier within global fashion supply chains.",
    "Welcoming the announcement, JAAF Secretary General, Yohan Lawrence, said: \u201cThis reform is a timely recognition of Sri Lanka\u2019s role as a resilient and responsible sourcing destination. By removing restrictions on input sourcing, the UK has levelled the playing field for our manufacturers, giving them the flexibility to deliver greater value to global brands and UK consumers alike. We see this as an opportunity to expand trade, strengthen industry competitiveness, and secure more jobs and livelihoods across Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector.\u201d",
    "JAAF acknowledged the constructive engagement between the UK High Commission, the Department of Commerce , and the Sri Lankan apparel industry in advocating for this change. The new rules are expected to boost exports, improve efficiency, and strengthen the long-standing trade partnership between the UK and Sri Lanka.",
    "The apparel industry is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export earner, directly employing over 350,000 people and supporting the livelihoods of more than a million across its value chain. Liberalised trade arrangements such as this ensure the sector continues to drive the country\u2019s economic recovery and long-term growth.",
