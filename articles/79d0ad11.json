    "Undertaking a special inspection visit to the Container Terminal (JCT) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, he said the container operation capacity was increasing due to the current crisis in the Red Sea in the Middle East.",
    "Due to the war situation in the Middle East region, the shipping companies have been motivated to divert their ships to the Colombo port as a safety measure due to the terrorist threats to merchant ships sailing through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea.",
