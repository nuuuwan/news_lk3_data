In 2024, democratic rule faces a significant test with an estimated 4 billion people in over 60 nations heading to the polling booths to elect their leaders.

Corruption and Crime in our country have hit a new high. According to Transparency International, “Sri Lanka is the 115th least corrupt nation out of 180 countries”. According to the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency International Corruption Rank, Sri Lanka averaged 87.50 from 2002 until 2023, reaching an all time high of 115.00 in 2023.

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) say, impunity has over the years become institutionalised and systematised. Mechanisms to hold state actors to account for their actions have been eroded.

During the time of former President Rajapaksa, via amendments to the Constitution, checks on the arbitrary use of power were diluted, and institutions to protect the independence of the judiciary were tampered with.

Enterprise Risk Management is pivotal in addressing emerging risks through its multifaceted approach

Enterprise Risk Management has become an increasingly essential solution for mitigating emerging risks, mainly because it provides a structured, systematic, and holistic approach to identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks across an entire organisation. As emerging risks are often characterised by their unpredictability and potential to rapidly evolve, Enterprise Risk Management’s comprehensive framework is particularly suited to address these challenges. Enterprise Risk Management enables organisations to respond to emerging risks in a strategic, coordinated, and agile manner. It’s not just about mitigating risks but also about seizing the opportunities that arise during times of uncertainty, turning potential threats into drivers of innovation and growth

National plans have not worked in Sri Lanka or anywhere else. The Indian Planning Commission has been redesigned and renamed. Can there be sectoral policies? Yes, there should be national policies for specific sectors that are based on evidence and broad stakeholder consultation, even in rapidly changing fields such as digital. They should not change every time a Government changes or a minister is appointed. But they should be reviewed and modified as circumstances change. Should efforts be made to articulate sector policies? Yes, to a limited extent. An approach that accepts the imperfection of information and difficulties of articulation and seeks a balance between workable certainty and flexibility is what will work

These was Ronnie’s observations: central banks in countries like Singapore and Hong Kong were much more efficient than the central banks in this part of the world, including the central bank in Sri Lanka. But the central banks in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh were worse than even the bad central bank in Sri Lanka. Why the central banks in Singapore or Hong Kong were successful was because those countries continued with open economy policies. They did not adopt socialist systems. They were going on modifying or developing the open economy systems. According to Ronnie, that was the secret to their success. What Ronnie implied was that if the country adopts a set of a good flexible economic policy package, its central bank also becomes an institution of worth
