    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The average yield of Sri Lanka\u2019s Employees Provident Fund is 11.5 percent, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said, amid questions and projections on the impact of re-structuring its investments to meet International Monetary Fund debt targets.",
    "The EPF is managed by the central bank and concerns have been raised that its yield is too low and keeping it under central bank management is a conflict of interest as the agency also is charged with selling government debt and that it is a \u2018captive fund\u2019.",
    "\u201cThe EPF is a medium to long-term fund. Its average yield at the moment is 11.5 percent,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "According to one analysis made in parliament, the average yield of government bonds now in issue was 13.52 percent.",
    "The EPF had paid around 9 percent to beneficiaries in recent years after taxes and expenses, he said.",
    "Under the domestic debt restructure the EPF is expected to get 12 bonds.",
    "Until end 2025, the bonds will get a coupon of 12.0 percent, which will fall to 9.0 percent until maturity.",
    "Bond will start to mature from 2027 and be subjected to market rates.",
    "The difficulty in coming up with a projection, as for the current portfolio, or the re-structured bonds, is to come up with a re-investment yield (a long term interest rate) for maturities, even if coupons are assumed to be taken out, analysts say.",
    "The government is proposing to tax pension funds that do not exchange bonds, at 30 percent compared to the current 14 percent.",
    "Authorities say they have calculated an opportunity loss based on whether there is higher tax or not.",
    "\u201cThere is some impact on the EFP,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an opportunity cost. If this was not done, there would be long term interest of 9.4 percent. It will fall to 9.1 percent.",
    "\u201cThere is an opportunity loss of 4 percent based on rough calculations,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "\u201cFor example if the current value is 100. Because we do this, the 100 will fall to 96\u201d",
    "\u201cIf the tax is chosen the loss would be 79. The 100 will become 79.  Those are the two choices.\u201d",
    "The question of equity had been addressed through taxation. (Colombo/July07/2023)"
