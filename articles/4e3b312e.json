    "I have lived in exile in the United Kingdom for more years than I care to remember. Now, in retirement, my thoughts often drift back to my youth recalling the faces and names that once filled the media and shaped our lives, in our island paradise.",
    "The mid-twentieth century was a time of great upheaval, shaping not only the course of nations but also the lives of ordinary people like us. In Ceylon, the Second World War and the struggle for independence from British rule cast long shadows over our families and communities. These were the years in which we grew\u2014from infants in our mothers\u2019 arms to adults carrying the weight of responsibility in a changing world. It was a period of transition and enormous transformation.",
    "As a newly independent nation, unity among all its people was crucial for progress and prosperity, although at times this wisdom was overshadowed by the chaos of politics.",
    "It has long been my wish to paint portraits of some of the people who stood at the forefront of those turbulent times. They were the faces we saw in the news, the names that stirred hope, fear, pride, or defiance. In painting them, I hope to preserve not only their images but also the memory of an era that shaped who we became.",
    "The biggest upheaval in the Indian subcontinent in the last century was the partition of India. By this division in 1947, two independent dominion states were born. It was done on religious lines into India and Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh. It lead to one of the largest mass migrations in history. It displaced 15 million people and caused about a million deaths. Lord Mountbatten, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and Mohammed Ali Jinnah were the personalities involved in the process who worked tirelessly for a peaceful transition. The partition remains a raw and painful memory for many.",
    "Since politics is naturally divisive, I have chosen not to share my personal views or pass judgment on their actions. Instead, I\u2019m reminded of Mark Antony\u2019s words in Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar: \u201cThe evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\u201d",
    "There exists an ancient taboo, later crystallized into a well-known aphorism popularized by the Spartan philosopher Chiron of ancient Greece: De mortuis nihil nisi bonum \u2014 \u201cspeak no ill of the dead.\u201d I hold his wisdom and philosophy in high regard.",
    "My education has brought me to where I am today. I have included portraits of two of my teachers in the faculty of Medicine Colombo. They represent the many who taught and educated us beyond the call of duty. I have nothing but praise for them all.",
    "Prof. O.E.R Abhayaratne had his early education at Royal College Colombo. He began his career in the Health Service in 1933. After holding several key posts in Public Health and Preventive Medicine he proceeded to the University of Edinburgh for postgraduate training. In 1949, Dr O.E.R Abhayaratne was appointed the first Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at the University of Ceylon. He became the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in 1953 and remained so until his retirement in 1967. Although he richly deserved a long retirement, he passed away suddenly in 1969.",
    "The Professor will be remembered for his personal qualities of kindness, integrity, warmth and humanity. Now I realise the sheer scale of his vision and his professionalism. Many of us have been greatly enriched by having known him and being his students. Our thanks go to one of the greats of our time and one of the finest to walk the corridors of the faculty. He truly was a credit to our profession. He left the world a better place and left the faculty of medicine up there with the finest institutions in the world. We will forever keep him in grateful memory.",
    "He was appointed as Professor in 1959 and became a fine teacher of Forensic Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine Colombo. In 1961, Professor Fernando took one year sabbatical leave and proceeded to London and was successful in the Barrister\u2019s examination of the Lincoln\u2019s Inn, London.",
    "In 1965 there was a lavish party for the medical fraternity at the Health Department Sports Club under the auspices of the Medical Students Union. Drinks flowed freely and there was a lot of it about. That was such a fun afternoon. When the alcohol levels rose so did the background noise. Prof HVJ Fernando and Dr WDL Fernando (JMO) warmed up to the occasion and sang with great forensic detail their signature tune of \u201cOfficer\u2019s daughter who hanged and died\u201d. This popular song was sung with such intensity and passion; they received a rapturous ovation. I still keep a recording of the song sung by Eranga and Priyanga to recall those happy times of my youth.",

Long live the Lankan nation!\u201d I wish this is engraved in the hearts and minds of every Sri Lankan. These words came to haunt our people in later years.",
    "In 1946 he turned down the offer of a Knighthood from the British Government and he did so politely.",
