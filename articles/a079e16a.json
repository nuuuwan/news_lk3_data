    "I am  beginning the new year by re-posting \u201cThe Hymn of Ceylon\u201d on my Blog.",
    "The \u201chymn of Ceylon\u201d was written by by Rev. W. S. Senior. Walter Stanley Senior was a scholar, pastor, teacher and poet who served in Sri Lanka for many years as Vice Principal of Trinity College, Kandy and Vicar at Christ Church, Galle Face.",
    "Rev. W.S. Senior\u2019s  \u2018Hymn of Ceylon\u2019. was always sung at the annual prize giving event of St. Thomas\u2019 Preparatory School in Kollupitiya where I studied from 1959 to \u201964. It is a Christian hymn and was set to the melody of \u2018Danno Budunge\u2019 by Devar Surya Sena as requested by Senior himself.",
    "When we sang the lines \u2018Give peace within her borders, Twixt man and man goodwill,\u2019 in those days of innocent childhood, little did we realise that this blessed Island was going to be torn apart by a cruel war lasting for decades. The war has ended now. What is sad and troubling are the efforts by extremists on either side of the ethnic divide to whip up communal passions. One hopes and prays that saner counsel prevails and the merchandising of hatred ceases.",
    "Here is Rev. Senior\u2019s \u2018The Hymn of Ceylon\u2019 for the island and all her people."
