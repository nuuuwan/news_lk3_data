    "\u201cIt is an honor and a privilege to be appointed the Country Director of ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission. ADB was a trusted partner of the people of Sri Lanka during the pandemic and the economic crisis. I intend to further enhance our collaboration as Sri Lanka embarks on a journey to recover from the crisis and come out stronger and more inclusive than ever before,\u201d Mr. Kadono said. \u201cADB will support the government\u2019s efforts to undertake reforms through budgetary support anchored on the International Monetary Fund program, while providing assistance to ensure that the people of Sri Lanka are well-supported through the transition.\u201d",

He then held progressive positions in Central and West Asia Department and Southeast Asia Department as an Energy Specialist, including being stationed in Viet Nam from 2012 to 2015 where he led projects in the power sector value chain from generation and transmission to distribution.

In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, he led the formulation of the financial sustainability plan for the power sector, which was responsible for the bulk of public debt, advised the government on regional power trade, and was a member of the Green Growth Development Policy Operation. He also led complex hydropower projects and dam safety initiatives in East Asia and the Pacific and provided cross-support to operations in South Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa.",
