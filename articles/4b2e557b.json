    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2019s Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer says the IMF program is showing signs of working and is translating into real outcomes thanks to the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 commitment to the program and its implementation.",
    "He had stated this during the meeting held today (07) between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the visiting IMF team at the Finance Ministry, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) reported.",
    "Mr. Breuer further stated that it is heartening to see the country\u2019s economy starting to turn around following the recent economic crisis.",
    "The IMF will commence its second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program for Sri Lanka today (March 07) with an opening meeting with President Wickremesinghe.",
    "Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe had said this marks a crucial milestone in the ongoing efforts by the government to enhance stability and economic growth.",
    "The lawmaker said the government aims to conclude a successful review and reach the staff-level agreement which will help unlock the third tranche of the global lender\u2019s bailout package of USD 2.9 billion.",
    "\u201cThis will accelerate our growth trajectory, fostering increased confidence in the economy,\u201d he added.",
    "Speaking to Ada Derana in this regard, Semasinghe had said Sri Lanka is expecting the third tranche of the IMF loan in June.",
    "The IMF had previously said the second review of Sri Lanka\u2019s $2.9 billion bailout could be completed in the first half of 2024, provided it manages to meet debt restructuring and revenue targets set under the program.",
    "The IMF executive board cleared the first review of Sri Lanka\u2019s bailout package in December 2023, providing approximately USD 337 million in funds as the second tranche to help tackle the fallout from the country\u2019s worst financial crisis in decades.",
    "Sri Lanka received the first tranche of the loan in March 2023 after the executive board approved the 48-month EFF program."
