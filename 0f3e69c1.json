  "original_body_lines": [
    "A government with a people's mandate should have the right to intervene in the affairs of the Central Bank as it is directly connected to the financial and economic policies of the country, NPP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.",
    "He told Parliament that the new Central Bank Bill proposed that the Central Bank should be an independent body without coming under the purview of the Executive and the Legislature.",
    "Speaking during the debate on the Central Bank Bill, he said, according to the new Bill, the Central Bank was authorized to reach agreements with international organizations, if it needs any theoretical advice.",
    "\u201cThis international organization is none other than the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Hereafter, it is not the government elected with the people's mandate that will decide on the economic and financial policies of the country. The Central Bank is the heart of the economy, which decides interest rate, exchange rate and printing of money,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said the Central Bank and the Treasury must make a collaborative effort to rescue the country from the economic crisis. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
