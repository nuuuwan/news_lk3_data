    "(The largest, most spectacular and most famous tourist caves in Australia)",
    "Of the several groups of limestone caves in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales in Australia the most famous are the Jenolan Caves. These are well-managed and open to the public while three other known groups of caves are not sufficiently developed to allow visitors.",
    "The Jenolan caves, some 175 kilometres to the west of Sydney, got their name from the aboriginal name \u2018Genowlan\u2019 for a mountain in the district and are said to have been accidently discovered by Charles Whalam in 1838 when he was on the trail of an escaped convict turned highway robber.",
    "An area of 24 square kilometres round the caves was declared a government reserve in 1866 and since a year after that guides have conducted visitors round caves with the aid of candles and flares. In 1894 the entire system was provided with electricity and an intricate network of graded and protected stairways and pathways have since been developed in stages to help visitors to see as much of the caves as possible from the best angle.",
    "Today\u2019s guides conduct groups of visitors at regular intervals according to a well-defined route for fees payable at the site office of the National Parks and Wild Life Service of NSW. Several of these guides are university graduates having specialized in geology and know the vast area covered by the caves like the back of their hands. They are well trained and answer visitors\u2019 questions clearly and with authority.",
    "The origins of caves go back to about 300 million years when reefs built of minute creatures known as coral polyps covered regions even further inland of the areas of the caves of today. In a later geological period, with the receding of the sea, the reefs got covered with layers of mud and sand and the resultant pressure and heat caused the coral reefs to turn into marble and limestone.",
    "About half a million years ago the limestone started to erode due to seepage of water through fine cracks on the layers of soil above and with time underground streams developed causing caves, caverns and tunnels to form. All this while rain water which often contains acids in minute quantities seeped through the surface and the weak acid caused a chemical reaction which dissolved the limestone.",
    "As the limestone in solution dripped and trickled into the caves crystalline limestone or calcite was deposited on the floors and walls of the caves. In some areas traces of minerals such as iron in the water, from rocks and soil through which is passed, caused the limestone to be coloured in beautiful shades of pink, orange, yellow and reddish brown. In areas free of such minerals the calcite is milk-white or resembles crystal, clear and sparkling.",
    "The Jenolan Caves consist of nine spectacular caves with such names as Imperial, Orient, Chifley River, Skeleton (with bones probably of an early aborigine converted in calcite) Temple of Baal etc. The calcite formations too have such romantic names as Indian Canopy, Gem of the West, Cathedral Windows, Lot\u2019s Wife, Queen Esther\u2019s Chamber, the Shrine, Pillar of Hercules, Egyptian Collonade, Crystal Cities, Bridal Veil, and many more named after what the early discoverers thought each formation looked like.",
    "The caves contain eight basic types of calcite formations. When droplets of limestone in dissolved form dry on the roof of the caves and grow downwards over the years the formation is known as a stalactite while heavier drops which fall on the ground and grow upwards are known as stalagmites. Some stalactites are hollow and are called straw stalactites. When stalactites and stalagmites meet, as they often do, the formation is called a column.",
    "When limestone solutions are too small to form droplets but ooze our of cracks in rocks, solid formations pointing in various directions result and these are known as helictites. A paper-thin shawl formation in the Temple of Baal is very appropriately called The Angel\u2019s Wing. Pool deposits are those where sizable quantities have hardened forming a calcite pool.",
    "These extraordinary formations, with powerful electric spotlights cleverly focused on them leaving other parts of the cave in gloom, are exquisitely beautiful and the sheer size of some are awe-inspiring. There seem to be no end to what one can imagine them to resemble clouds, trees, animals, almost anything.",
    "The vegetation, wildlife and the mountain landscape of the Blue Mountain region above the caves are as fascinating and beautiful as the formation of the caves. The limestone soils of the area support a very different type of vegetation from that normally seen in other parts of New South Wales. The National Parks and Wildlife Service has provided the area with several miles of paths and walking tracks to make it pleasant and convenient for the visitor to see a great deal in a few hours.",
    "A day of sightseeing is pleasant but as the evening approaches the sharp nip in the air and tired feet draws the visitor to nearby Caves House with its rough stone outer walls, old style elegance, warmth and modern-day comforts. It is a gracious Elizabethan resort hotel, one of the best in the state, with the original building dating back to 1898 and providing typical Aussie fare, king-size portions of barbecued meats, salads, fruits, cheese and of course, plenty of excellent Australian beer and wine.",
    "Note: The historic caves are will remain closed to the public for 18 months due to ongoing road repair and refurbishment of the Cave House.",
