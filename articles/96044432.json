    "The Israeli military said it also struck a \u201cmilitary target in the area\u201d of the presidential palace in the capital, as well as armoured vehicles loaded with heavy machine guns and weapons on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria.",

    "At least 165 members of the government forces and 18 Bedouin tribal fighters have also been killed in the clashes, while 10 members of government forces have been killed in Israeli strikes, it says.",

    "On Sunday, armed Druze fighters reportedly encircled and later seized a neighbourhood of Suweida city that is inhabited by Bedouin.",
    "The clashes soon spread into other parts of Suweida province, with tribesmen reportedly launching attacks on nearby Druze towns and villages.",
    "Syria\u2019s interior ministry later announced that its forces and those of the defence ministry would intervene and impose order, saying the \u201cdangerous escalation comes in light of the absence of relevant official institutions\u201d.",
    "Earlier this year, Israel\u2019s prime minister demanded the complete demilitarisation of Suweida and two other southern provinces. He said Israel saw President Sharaa\u2019s Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as a threat. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN and UK, but no longer by the US.",
    "The Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country\u2019s military assets since the fall of the Assad regime.",
