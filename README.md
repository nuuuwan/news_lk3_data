### White House says new H-1B visa fee applies only to new applicants

*2025-09-21 10:51:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112720/white-house-says-new-h-1b-visa-fee-applies-only-to-new-applicants) · `en`

The White House said on Saturday that the new 100,000-U.S.-dollar fee for H-1B visas will not apply to current holders of valid visas re-entering the United States, following confusion and concern sparked by the Trump administration’s introduction of the measure.

The fee, taking effect on Sunday, “applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in a post on X. “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.”

She also said that it’s a “one-time fee that applies only to the petition.”

The H-1B program allows U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation raising the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to 100,000 dollars, saying the move is intended to ensure that the United States brings in highly skilled talent whom American workers cannot replace.

### Pentagon imposes new restrictions on media covering the US military

*2025-09-21 09:07:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112717/pentagon-imposes-new-restrictions-on-media-covering-the-us-military) · `en`

The Pentagon has unveiled new restrictions on media covering the US military, requiring them to pledge not to disclose anything not formally authorized for publication and limiting their movements within the Department of War.

The new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday (Sep 19), require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply, or risk losing their media credentials.

The move is the latest by the administration of President Donald Trump to control media coverage of his policies, and after he suggested that negative stories could be “illegal.”

The Pentagon “remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust,” the memo says.

But it adds: “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified”, effectively barring material sourced to unnamed officials.

A massive, sprawling facility, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others have repeatedly raised allegations of systematic human rights abuses by US forces at Bagram, especially pertaining to detainees in Washington’s murky “War on Terror”.

### Tribute to Rajiv Perera on his 60th birthday

*2025-09-20 16:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tribute-to-rajiv-perera-on-his-60th-birthday/) · `en`

In life we meet many people, most of whom hardly leave a trace of their passing. Some, very few in fact, leave a mark so deep that no passage of time can erase it. For me, at the very top of that list is Rajiv Perera.

I knew of Rajiv at school – St Thomas’, Mount Lavinia – where he was a few years senior to me. A fine sportsman, he played rugby for S. Thomas’, CH & FC, and Sri Lanka. On the field he was fearless yet always a gentleman, respected by teammates and opponents alike. That same spirit carried into the rest of his life competitive when it mattered, but always fair, always gracious.

But I only really got to know him when I went to the UK for my higher studies, about 35 years ago. This was around the time that John Major had replaced the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, and was just settling in as Prime Minister. I knew only a few people in London. It was through the Thomian network that I met Rajiv. We clicked immediately.

### My golden years at Kingswood College

*2025-09-20 16:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-golden-years-at-kingswood-college/) · `en`

Mr. Louis Edmund Blaze’ started his school, which he named Boys’ High School at No. 11, Pavilion Street in the Kandy town itself (the premises were secured by Mr. JW Samaraweera) with 11 boys – quite a coincidence between the school roll and its address – on May 4, 1891 with the intention that it should be run as far as possible on the lines of the old British Public Schools. Later, when the number of students grew, the school was shifted to Brownrigg Street (now Yatinuwara Veediya).

As the rooms in Pavilion Street became too small with increasing number of students, the school was shifted to a house in Brownrigg Street, which had been built by Mr. William Staples about 50 years before. The school began academic activities on January 12, 1898. In December 1897 the school moved into larger premises in Browrigg Street, where the school hall was built and the Boys’ High School took the name of Kingswood College.

### Trump adds $100,000 fee for skilled worker visa applicants

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will add a $100,000 (£74,000) annual fee for applicants to the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers.

Trump’s order mentions “abuse” of the programme and will restrict entry unless payment is made.

Critics have long argued that H-1Bs undercut the American workforce, while supporters - including billionaire Elon Musk - argue it allows the US to attract top talent from around the world.

In another order, Trump set up a new “gold card” to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.

Trump’s order is due to come into force on 21 September. It would only apply to new requests, but companies would have to pay the same amount for each applicant for six years, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.
