### Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu agree new Gaza peace plan

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say they have agreed a new peace plan for Gaza, warning Hamas to accept it.

The plan proposes an immediate end to military operations, with Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of the more than two dozen hostages who are believed to be dead within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.

A Palestinian source familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC that Hamas officials have been given the White House’s 20-point proposal.

It demands that Hamas will have no role in governing Gaza, and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.

Speaking at a news conference following talks at the White House, Trump called the plan “a historic day for peace”.

But he said that Netanyahu will have US backing to do what he has to do if Hamas does not agree to the plan.

Netanyahu then said Israel “will finish the job” if Hamas rejects the plan or does not follow through.

### BASL defends lawyers’ car passes, says Gazette does not apply

*2025-09-30 02:25:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/BASL-defends-lawyers-car-passes-says-Gazette-does-not-apply/56-782389) · `en`

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has written to the Inspector General of Police to clarify the position on lawyers’ car passes, following recent public debate on the issue.

In its letter, the Association said that attempts to invalidate or remove the passes on the basis of a Gazette Notification would be unlawful, since the order does not extend to the use of BASL-issued vehicle passes.

The Association argued that the passes, displayed on windscreens, do not contravene the Motor Traffic Act.

The BASL expressed confidence that the existing system of issuing passes would continue unchanged, emphasising their role in day-to-day legal practice and security arrangements.

If blocked by a veto-wielding country, the UNGA has the means to bypass the Security Council

An immediate ceasefire in Palestine, which is being bombed every 8-9 minutes according to the UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, was deadlocked at the Security Council last week through a veto by the United States of America. A deadlock which blocked a potential halt to the killing of civilians at a scale and intensity that the world has not seen in living memory outside of World War II.

Thankfully, all is not lost at the United Nations. In this situation of deadlock where there is a threat to global peace and security, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) isn’t entirely helpless. If blocked by a veto-wielding country, the UNGA has the means to bypass the Security Council by invoking a 1950 Resolution known as Uniting for Peace, Resolution 377 A(V), which gives the General Assembly the power to recommend a number of mechanisms including the use of force.

A Budget that focuses on well-being goes beyond numbers and policies; it invests in the potential of every citizen

Every year, the arrival of Sri Lanka’s national Budget brings with it familiar rituals: speeches in Parliament, presentations filled with charts, and days of debate about deficits, spending, and taxation. Economists pore over fiscal strategies, politicians argue about allocations, and ordinary citizens ask the most important question of all: “How will this affect my life?”

Traditionally, Budgets are viewed as accounting exercises, designed to raise revenue, control expenditure, and maintain economic stability. These objectives are crucial, but they often overlook something fundamental: how people actually experience security, opportunity, and dignity in their everyday lives. A nation’s financial plan is not just about balancing books; it is about shaping lives.

Justice delayed has not only compounded victims’ suffering but has also damaged institutional credibility

To analyse the justice delays and inconsistencies following the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, and to propose policy measures to strengthen the rule of law, enhance prosecutorial and judicial independence, and restore public trust in Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system.

The Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in April 2019 killed over 260 people and injured hundreds.

Inconsistencies in prosecutorial decisions by the Attorney General’s Department, coupled with judicial delays, have raised questions about political interference, institutional weakness, and erosion of public trust.

This case has become a litmus test for the credibility of Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system.

Justice must be equal, timely, and free from political influence.

Prolonged delays have weakened the principle of equality before the law.

Britain’s interior minister on Monday (Sep 29) proposed tough new rules for migrants seeking to settle in the United Kingdom, as the ruling Labour Party bolstered its fight against the hard right at its annual conference.

Migrants looking to remain indefinitely will have to have a job, not claim benefits, and undertake volunteer community work under plans designed to claw back support among voters drawn to the anti-immigrant Reform UK party, whose popularity is soaring.

Confronting Reform, led by firebrand Nigel Farage, is the main theme of Labour’s four-day gathering in Liverpool, northwest England.

Currently, migrants with family in Britain and who have lived there for five years qualify for “indefinite leave to remain” - permanent residence - as do those who have lived legally in the UK for 10 years on any type of visa.

Eligible applicants meeting those thresholds also earn the right to live, work and study in the UK and to apply for benefits and British citizenship.

US President Donald Trump said on Monday (Sep 29) he would impose a 100 per cent tariff on all foreign-made movies, an unprecedented move that threatens to upend Hollywood’s global business model.

The step signals Trump’s willingness to extend protectionist trade policies into cultural industries, raising uncertainty for studios that depend heavily on international box-office revenue and cross-border co-productions.

Trump announced the measure in a post on his Truth Social platform, claiming US movie-making is losing ground to international competition.

“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing candy from a baby,” he wrote.

However, it was not immediately clear what legal authority Trump would use to impose a 100 per cent tariff on foreign-made films.
