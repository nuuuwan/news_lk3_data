  "original_body_lines": [
    "13 female Muslim principals have filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) regarding the cancellation of their Efficiency Bar Examination Grade II results by the Department of Examinations due to their head coverings worn during the examination.",
    "According to examination candidate M.Z.H. Fawzana, the group sat for the examination in August 2023, seeking promotion from Grade II to Grade I in the Principal service. The exam was held at Kotahena Maha Vidyalaya, and the group did not face any issues on the first day of the examination, which lasted for six hours.",
    "However, on the second day, after completing one examination paper, she claimed officials from the Department of Examinations took photographs of their NIC and index numbers. Fawzana noted that they had already proved their identification to the invigilators before the exam. \u201cLater in December, we were summoned to the Department of Examinations for an inquiry as we had been wearing head coverings during the exam. However, they assured us this would not affect our examination results,\u201d she said.",
    "Nevertheless, when results were released in June 2024, she said the group discovered that their results had been cancelled.",
    "She noted that while the Education Minister had directed the Department of Examinations to release their results, the group filed an appeal with the Department as well, but to no avail.",
    "Fawzana said such instances of harassment and mistreatment of Muslim women have become commonplace. \u201cOur request is to rectify the injustice. This is a religious garb. We confirmed our identities at the examination. We request our results to be released and to prevent such occurrences from taking place going forward,\u201d she said.",
    "Counsels appearing for the group said the Department of Examination are accusing the women of refusing to confirm their identification by uncovering their ears when requested by the invigilators. The counsels said however no such occurrence had taken place.",
    "While the relevant parties were called before the HRCSL last week, the Department of Examinations was however a no-show at the petition hearing."
