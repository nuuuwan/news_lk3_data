  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has added wheat flour to a list of goods under import license, under the island\u2019s import and export control law.",
    "A license fee of 0.1 percent of the CIF valued of a shipment will be charged.",
    "Wheat flour which was shipped before June 14, and arrives in the country before June 14 will be cleared by Customs.",
    "Shipments on letters of credit or advance payment made before June 14 will be cleared from another 60 days from June 14.",
    "Sri Lanka imposed controls on 3,000 goods after the central bank printed money to cut rates from 2020 as the Treasury economists also cut taxes (employment of so-called macro-economic policy to boost growth or a close a gap between potential output), triggered forex shortages.",
    "Some of the import controls have since been relaxed amid better monetary policy.",
    "Sri Lanka enacted an import and export control law in 1969. In the 1960s Sri Lanka started to go to the IMF. Balance of payments deficits came at the time partly due to using printed money for rural credit (central bank re-finance) and roundabout rate cut.  (Colombo/July15/2023)"
