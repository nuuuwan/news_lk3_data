The submission was made following the current tariff calculation methodology, it added, noting that however, the ‚Äòelectricity sector regulator‚Äô rejected the proposal, citing the need to implement any tariff revisions considering the first six months of 2025, rather than the last quarter of 2024.

This will be my first Christmas without my father, Eric Cooray, who passed away three months ago. Life has felt strange since that inevitable moment, one I always dreaded, while never anticipating just how difficult his loss would be to accept.

Almost every day starts and ends with thoughts of my father, from fond memories of my childhood to imagining how proud he would be of his beloved grandchildren. Throughout my life, he inspired me in countless ways. Even now, I draw so much strength from memories of him that it still feels like he is guiding me from the heavens, giving me the strength to keep moving forward.

Delivering his inaugural policy statement to Parliament, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake dealt mostly with the economy and, in particular, the IMF agreement. The problem he faces is that the former government agreed to terms with the IMF that did not consider the impact on the people, but gave priority to meeting fiscal targets. The President acknowledged that the government had no alternative but to continue with it as the country had gone too far down the road to change direction. He said, ‚ÄúThe negotiations had already been ongoing for more than two years. If we were to restart discussions on the restructuring programme for an extended period it will be impossible for us to move the economy forward‚Ä¶‚Äù

Surely, racism has caused enough damage to us to warrant its erasure from our midst with the condemnation it deserves, without leaving it more room to further flourish in deceptively benign ways.

Sri Lanka: Protesters demand E8 visa for South Korea jobs. Foreign Employment Bureau denies opportunities. Government intervention sought.

üü©

Some people who are looking forward to working for South Korea for South Korea on the E8 visa have been fighting in front of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau in Battaramla, saying they have not had the opportunity to go to Korea due to the attention of the authorities.

Minister Vijitha Herath met with some of the protesters last Friday. In the meantime, the E8 Visa said that action would be taken to take the necessary measures to legalize South Korea.

However, the foreign employment work is hiding the opportunities for South Korea, so they are struggling to prolong the time as they have to go to work.

But it is illegal to send to business on E8 visa. The President of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau said it could not be allowed. As well as the console is not likely to get a visa without knowing. The Chairman of the Bureau said that there is no truth in reporting that we have got a career opportunity for South Korea.

The stock market yesterday witnessed a downward trend due to speculation pertaining to a JKH transaction with the Adani Group, wherein the Adani Group had built a container terminal at the Colombo Port.

US prosecutors on Wednesday charged Indian billionaire Gautam Adani with involvement in a plan to pay more than US $ 250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts, and concealing the plan as the group sought money from US investors, reports said.
