    "In the establishment of land connectivity between India and Sri Lanka, an alternate route, instead of ancient Ram Setu or Adam\u2019s Bridge, is considered to avert Hindu religious sensitivities, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "During the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India recently, the proposed project was discussed with the aim of improving access to Sri Lankan ports. When the same idea was mooted a long time back, the construction of a bridge along ancient Adam\u2019s Bridge was mulled, though.",
    "Ram Setu, also known as Adam's Bridge, is a trail of limestone shoals between Pamban Island, off the south-eastern coast of Tamil Nadu, and Mannar Island, off the north-western coast of Sri Lanka.",
    "The mythological belief is that it was built by an army of monkeys, led by Lord Hanuman on behalf of Lord Ram whose army was marching towards Sri Lanka to rescue his wife Sita, held captive by Ravana.",
    "In India, the Sethusamudram shipping channel project has also been facing protests from some political parties, environmentalists and certain Hindu religious groups. Even the Indian Supreme Court has been moved against it.",
    "A top source familiar with bilateral discussions said a new route will be considered in the construction of the proposed land connectivity though it will be slightly longer than Adam\u2019s Bridge.",
    "President Wickremesinghe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held result-oriented bilateral discussions on connectivity. (Kelum Bandara)"
