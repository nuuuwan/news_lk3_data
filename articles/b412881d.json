    "The Tea Exporters Association (TEA) hosted its 26th Annual General Meeting (AGM) at Taj Samudra, bringing together nearly 500 stakeholders, diplomats, and industry leaders to reflect on the progress of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry and chart a bold path forward under the theme \u201cResilience & Revitalization.\u201d",
    "Delivering his address, Huzefa Akbarally, Chairman of TEA, reaffirmed the Association\u2019s commitment to strengthening the global position of Ceylon Tea:",
    "\u201cIn 2025, we project tea exports of 270 million kilograms and revenues exceeding USD 1.5 billion, an increase of nearly 10 % from last year. This growth is a testament to the resilience of our smallholder farmers, who produce 70% of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea. Yet, smallholder yields have declined, and urgent investment is required in replantation and block-in-filling to secure their future. With the right support, Ceylon Tea can achieve the government\u2019s target of 400 million kilograms and USD 2.5 billion in export revenue by 2030.\u201d",
    "Gracing the occasion as Chief Guest, K. V. Samantha Viddyarathna, Minister of Plantation and Community Infrastructure, stressed the importance of collective action:",
    "\u201cCeylon Tea is not only a proud brand but also a lifeline for our economy. By 2030, our ambition is to reach record levels of production and exports. This requires strengthening the foundation of the industry by empowering smallholders, adopting new technologies, and building resilience. We count on the Tea Exporters Association to help us deliver on this vision for the nation.\u201d",
    "As Guest of Honour, Sunil Handunneththi, Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, highlighted the role of exporters in protecting Sri Lanka\u2019s global reputation:",
    "\u201cThe name \u2018Ceylon Tea\u2019 carries weight worldwide. To safeguard it, we must move beyond bulk exports and focus on branding, packaging, and value addition. Fertilizer supply and global competition are critical challenges, but through partnership between government and the private sector, I am confident the industry will achieve its highest returns yet.\u201d",
    "Delivering the Keynote Address, Dr. Martha Tesfaye Woldemichael, IMF Resident Representative for Sri Lanka, drew parallels between the tea industry and the country\u2019s recovery:",
    "\u201cThis AGM is not just a business gathering\u2014it is a celebration of resilience. Like Sri Lanka itself, the tea industry has weathered crisis and is now on a path to revitalization. More than 90% of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea production is exported, sustaining two million livelihoods. By embracing sustainability, competitiveness, and innovation, this industry can remain a cornerstone of the country\u2019s economic renewal.\u201d",
