    "Despite initial reports that Ven. Ajahn Brahm was held back at the BIA due to the presence of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardane at the airport, sources clarified that it was not due to the Prime Minister that caused the delay but it was instead because of Minister Nimal Siripala de\u00a0 Silva.",
    "Sources said the Prime Minister was at the VVIP lounge\u00a0 and was to fly to Thailand while Minster Nimal Siripala de Silva and\u00a0 Ven. Thera was at the VIP lounge and was ready to fly on a Singapore\u00a0 Airlines flight to different destinations.",
    "Meanwhile, the Presidential Secretariat has sought a report from the\u00a0 Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL) for keeping\u00a0 Singapore bound Ven. Ajahn Brahmawanso (Ajahn Brahm) at the Bandaranaike\u00a0 International Airport for more than 12 hours reportedly due to the\u00a0 negligence of the airport officials, official sources said.",
    "\u201cWe will handle the incident officially as a minister was\u00a0 also involved and will make a statement to the media in a few days,\u201d an\u00a0 AASL official said.",
    "It was reported that the Thera had arrived at the BIA at\u00a0 around 10 pm on Tuesday (30) to take a Singapore Airlines flight to\u00a0 Singapore and then to Perth, Australia and was seated at the VIP lounge\u00a0 to board the flight.",
    "Subsequently, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva left the\u00a0 VIP lounge with the airport official who kept assisting Venerable\u00a0 Thera.",
    "After boarding the minister, the official returned to the VIP\u00a0 lounge as he forgot to take the Thera with him. When he came to take the Thera it was several minutes late.\u00a0 By that time it was too late for the Thera to board the flight.",
    "It was reported that the Thera had been in Sri Lanka for nine days and attended several programmes.",
    "The Thera had been permitted to use the VIP lounge on the\u00a0 direction of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Airport & Aviation\u00a0 Services Sri Lanka Ltd. Chairman has reportedly apologised to the Thera\u00a0 for being kept waiting so long.",
    "Meanwhile, issuing a statement, SriLankan Airlines said\u00a0 \u2018The Thera has booked on a different airline, when the unfortunate delay\u00a0 occurred at Bandaranaike International Airport in the early hours of 31\u00a0 May 2023. SriLankan Airlines, however, promptly stepped up and went\u00a0 beyond to help Venerable Ajahn Brahm to find an alternative flight.\u201d"
