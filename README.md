### Sri Lanka deflation possible near term, rates unchanged: Central Bank

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank said it was holding policy rates at the current 8.25 to 9.25 percent levels, with the price index likely to head down in the near future.

“The Board observed that inflation is likely to remain well below the target of 5 per cent over the next few quarters, potentially recording deflation in the immediate future driven by changes to administratively determined prices and easing of supply conditions,” the central bank said giving ‘cost-push’s style reasons.

“Accordingly, the latest projections confirm that headline inflation is likely to be below the target by a notable margin in the forthcoming months while core inflation is projected to remain around the current levels on average.”

However other analysts have pointed out that the central bank has operated deflationary monetary policy since late 2022 and also allowed the exchange rate to appreciate, (a strong external anchor)providing exceptional monetary stability helping keep prices down.

The tourist visa was later cut down to 50 dollars but with a single entry.

### Has the new Government already violated its own principles?

This is the first time NPP has got the opportunity and people are watching critically to see whether it is able to deliver on promises

The new NPP Government came to power in a momentous change of the political landscape of Sri Lanka. For the first time a simple village folk has become the President. It is great to see the change of guard. We should genuinely wish Anura Kumara Dissanayaka the strength and focus to deliver on promises.

AKD appears to be highly focused and his rise to power came in the midst of rampant corruption and abuse of power by most politicians of the previous governments, and quite rightly, the NPP highlighted those abominations and depravities, pledging to eradicate them, bring the perpetrators to justice, and steer the country towards a just and fair society. The people were so distressed and despondent that they clearly wanted a system change. NPP offered that. People accepted it. It is now up to the NPP to deliver.

### A call to Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya: Lighten school bags, reform education

Now we are witnessing some changes in the socio-economic context in Sri Lanka. There is a need for better integration of all sectors with proper alignment focusing on the advancement of our nation. In this context, the education sector is really important and there should be a serious discussion between all stakeholders in primary, secondary and tertiary education in Sri Lanka to decide the future landscape of Sri Lankan education.

In Sri Lanka today, it’s not uncommon to see a student weighing 24 kilos carrying a schoolbag that weighs 10 kilos! I consider this as one measurement to indicate the disaster of our education system. Most of the children coming under the category of grade six to 10 have around eight subjects per day questioning whether Sri Lankan educationists have done the justice for our next generation (which we need to discuss in a separate article).

“They tried to bury us. They did not know we were seeds.” — Anura Kumara Dissanayake

The 2024 Sri Lankan Presidential election results have displayed a significant change in the decades-long distribution of political party alignment among the Sri Lankan people. This transformation showcases the desperation of Sri Lankans to choose a leader free from crimes and corruption. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a veteran politician and the leader of the National People’s Power (NPP), has won the election, dominating the majority of votes in 14 out of 22 districts.

This election marked a historic moment, electing the first leftist leader as President from a socialist and social democratic political alliance. It demonstrates that most Sri Lankans are shifting away from traditional party politics to focus on a leader who can truly relate to and understand the hearts and minds of ordinary people.

Sri Lanka has just elected a new President amidst a deepening economic crisis. The people have provided a clear mandate for change and relief from the economic distress pervading their lives.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has taken over at a crucial time. Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its history in 2022, and is now in the middle of an IMF program, and a debt restructuring process that are predicated on austerity and repayment of the larger share of past debt to the creditors. How should Sri Lanka approach debt restructuring and the IMF’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) with parameters for reduced public spending and minimal debt relief?

The European Union (EU), with its vast market of over 448 million consumers, has always been a key destination for Sri Lankan apparel exports. Known for its high-quality and ethically produced garments, Sri Lanka has secured a strong foothold in this competitive space. However, new sustainability and labelling requirements introduced by the EU present both challenges and opportunities for Sri Lankan apparel manufacturers. This feature explores the evolving regulatory landscape, the hurdles Sri Lankan companies face, and the benefits of complying with these changes.

The EU has been a leader in promoting sustainability, transparency, and traceability in global supply chains, particularly in the garment industry, where environmental and social concerns are prevalent. Regulations such as the EU Textile Regulation, the Digital Product Passport (DPP) initiative, and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act aim to ensure that imported goods meet stringent environmental and ethical standards.

The Sri Lankan youth team has suffered the worst defeats in the Asian Football Joint Federation (AFC) Asian Bowl qualifying round in Tajikistan.

Sri Lanka has given 12 goals to the opponents in the 3 matches they played in the E. Group. But there was no goal on behalf of Sri Lanka.

Although others continue to play in these three matches, they have not been able to make any progress.

Sri Lankan instructor Rajamani Devasakayam, who has lost the chance to go to the next round, will be welcomed if they give the players a chance to the players in the seat so far.

It is good for the instructor to think about giving a new goalkeeper opportunity as goalkeeper Ahmed Sharif has given up 12 goals. Football critics say there is no justification for taking 22 players and keeping some of them as mere spectators.

Sri Lanka lost 0 - 4 in the first match with North Korea, 0 - 3 in Tajikistan and 0 - 3 in the third match yesterday.
