    "Women in Management (WIM), in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), co-hosted the \u201cTop10 Champions of Diversity 2024\u201d, recognising trailblazing male leaders in Sri Lanka who embody diversity and inclusion across their organisations.",
    "The awards ceremony, which was held on 9 December 2024 at Shangri-La Colombo, follow the annual Top50 Women\u2019s Awards by WIM, bringing to light the role of male allies in gender inclusion.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s standing in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index, ranked 115th out of 146 countries, highlights the urgent need for transformative change. Women in the country face a significant 30\u201336% gender pay gap, particularly in informal sectors. Social and cultural norms, compounded by unpaid caregiving responsibilities, often confine women to part-time or low-wage work, perpetuating systemic inequalities. Men play a pivotal role in advancing gender equality and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by challenging stereotypes, supporting equal opportunities, and actively advocating for systemic change.",
    "Women in Management Global Founder and Chairperson Dr. Sulochana Segera emphasised the critical importance of this initiative stating: \u201cTrue leadership transcends boundaries and embraces inclusivity. Top10 Champions of Diversity celebrates those who not only break glass ceilings but also dismantle the walls that confine others. This initiative is about driving change, one leader at a time, to build a more equitable and inclusive world.\u201d",
    "World Bank and IFC Country Manager Gevorg Sargsyan reiterated the importance of embedding DEI into organisational strategy, saying: \u201cFocusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) isn\u2019t just the right thing to do \u2013 it\u2019s a smart business strategy. Companies that integrate DEI into the fabric of their core operations, rather than relegating it to a secondary focus, see transformative results. By embracing diverse perspectives, fostering equity, and cultivating inclusive environments, organisations unlock innovation, boost employee satisfaction, and drive sustained success. It\u2019s a win-win for both businesses and society.\u201d",
