    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), a local corruption watchdog, has formally filed a complaint over appointment into Palmyrah Development Board (PDB) during the election campaign period, citing the move as violating the election laws.",
    "The recent appointments made at the PDB in Jaffna \u201cappear to contravene current election laws\u201d, TISL said, citing that the ruling party has approved swift changes in several new board members as well as chairman twice within the gap of 12 days.",
    "The election law prevents making new appointments, promotions, or transfers during the election period without prior approval from the Election Commission.",
    "\u201cThe recent changes at the PDB raise serious concerns about compliance with these legal standards and call into question the governance practices upheld during this sensitive period,\u201d the TISL said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThese appointments undermine public trust and could challenge the fairness of the electoral process. TISL urged the Election Commission to investigate these appointments and take prompt corrective action.\u201d",
    "The TISL also called on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s government to halt such appointments across public institutions until the conclusion of the parliament election to avoid perceptions of political bias or undue influence over public bodies.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has strongly criticized similar moves when it was in the opposition.",
    "Before the presidential polls, Dissanayake and his party members pledged a clean governance without corruption, nepotism, and political interference. (Colombo/October 21/2024)"
