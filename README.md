### Sri Lanka state spending contained below budget to August amid monetary stability

*2024-10-19 09:51:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-state-spending-sharply-below-budget-amid-monetary-stability-184182/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state spending is running sharply below budget, official data show, with the central bank also providing exceptional monetary stability bringing prices down absolutely.

Recurrent expenditure grew only 4.4 percent to 2,042 billion rupees by August 2024, against a 14.5 percent budgeted number, with non-interest expenditure rising 4.6 percent, compared to a budgeted 8.7 percent.

Salaries and wages were up 6.7 percent, against a budgeted 12.5 percent.

However more taxes collected from the people will have to be spent on state salaries in the future, due to slashing of spending power in the 2022 currency collapse.

Spending on goods and services were up 8.2 percent against a budgeted 13.7 percent and subsidies and transfers were up 1.5 percent against a budgeted 3.9 percent.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has provided exceptional monetary stability in 2024, allowing the currency to appreciate amid deflationary open market operations.

### Israel and Hamas signal resistance to ending Gaza war after Sinwar’s death

Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza and reiterated its stance that hostages the militant group took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops.

The group’s staunch position pushed back against a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin a day earlier that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming.

The conflicting stands signal continued deep resistance on both sides to ending the war, even as President Joe Biden and other world leaders press the case that Sinwar’s death is a turning point that should be used to unlock stalled cease-fire negotiations.

### Does President AKD Borrow Money Like Ex-Prez Ranil?

“Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education” ~ Stephen Covey

Recent bitter criticisms by some opposition ex-parliamentarians regarding government borrowing (i.e., President Anura Kumara Dissanayake) have no substance; it is for mudslinging and due to ignorance of the subject matter. President AKD is performing his mandatory work responsibilities as the Minister of Finance, similar to ex-Prez Ranil Wickremesinghe. Borrowing by President AKD has no burden on the total debt or Debt to GDP as per the IMF Program. Payment to pensioners, fertilizer, and fuel subsidies are within the fiscal space. No funds have been borrowed and wasted at all. Fertilizer and fuel subsidies greatly benefit the economy in numerous ways. Given the recent meeting by President AKD with the agricultural officials, formulating a National Agricultural Policy and having a public discussion on the same is a top priority of the government in the right direction.

### 2024-10-18 (Friday)

### How important was India’s help to Sri Lanka in 2022?

*2024-10-18 23:42:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-important-was-India-s-help-to-Sri-Lanka-in-2022/4-768162) · `en`

India’s help was significant at a crucial time as Sri Lanka was going through a nightmarish

The IMF program is to give Sri Lanka $ 3 billion over four years with conditions. India gave $ 4 billion in one year to Sri Lanka with no conditions. Also, the timing is important to note. The IMF program came in 2023 when Sri Lanka had stabilised to a large extent under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also, most of the toughest policies that were needed for Sri Lanka to achieve macroeconomic stability were already put in place by the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe when the IMF program was approved. But India came to Sri Lanka’s aid when Sri Lanka was staring at the abyss with a Government that was behaving very irrationally in January 2022 with the country facing macroeconomic instability. This point should not be forgotten by the Sri Lankan public

### Towards a climate-smart tourism sector: Building resilience through financial instruments

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector holds great economic and social importance, but it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change

The tourism sector is an important pillar of Sri Lanka’s economy, providing income and employment for more than 400,000 people directly and indirectly across areas such as hospitality, transportation, and retail. However, like many other sectors, it is facing serious challenges and risks connected to climate change, necessitating a transformation towards sustainability and resilience.

Innovative financial instruments and risk transfer solutions could play an important part in enhancing the sector’s capacity to withstand climate-related shocks, recover from losses and damages, and adapt to long-term climatic changes. If Sri Lanka can pioneer new business models and creative risk management tools, it could help communities, entrepreneurs, tourism companies, and other stakeholders to turn the country into a more vibrant, resilient, and prosperous destination.

### In appreciation of Professor Kumar David

Professor Kumar David, once an academic in the Engineering Faculty, Peradeniya University, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in the UK and Hong Kong has left for eternal rest, last Monday while in Los Angeles, USA. We believe the “left” leaning English reader would miss Kumar’s forays into political controversies, with his own reading of issues that often provided dissenting, but populist perspectives, he developed over the decades since leaving the NSSP in 1980 July. Politically, he was advocating for “unity in the scattered left”.

Professionally too, he stood out as an exceptional, pragmatic thinker and was accepted for that. We believe he still remains the youngest to be appointed to the Director Board of the CEB way back in 1970, perhaps after the change of government in July. Kumar would not have been 30 years then. He was also a strong critic of the Mahaweli Development power generation scheme in 1979, when the blueprint was out for academic observation.

New Zealand, with the highest number of experience in the International T20 Women's cricket, qualified for the semi-finals.

Despite these occasions, they were allowed to play the final, but they had to be satisfied with the runners-up in two.

West Indies also played a semi-final match of the Twenty20 Women Cup.

However, they were able to play the final at the tournament held in India in 2016.

It was once defeated by the strong Australian group and crowned World Champions.

அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தில் சமகால அரசியல் போக்கானது மக்கள் கருத்து இல்லாமல் அரசியல் கட்சிகள் தாமாக சிந்தித்து செயற்படுகின்றது.

ஆரம்பத்தில் தேர்தல் கேட்பது என்றால் பிரதேச புத்திஜீவிகள், அதிபர்கள் , இளைஞர்கள், ஆலய அறங்காவலர்கள் என மக்களின் கருத்து கேட்டதன் பின்னரே வேட்பாளர்கள் அரசியல் கட்சிகளில் நியமிக்கப்படுவர்.

ஆனால் இப்போது யார் வேண்டுமானாலும் தேர்தல் கேட்கலாம் என்று புதிய கோட்பாடு அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தை பெறுத்த மட்டில் உருவாகியுள்ளது.

தேர்தல் காலத்தில் மாத்திரமே அரசியல் கட்சிகளின் வரவு அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தில் காணப்படுகின்றது தமிழ் கட்சிகள் அனைத்தும் ஒன்றிணைந்து ஒரு வேட்பாளரை முன் நிறுத்தி குறித்த வேட்பாளருக்கு களம் அமைத்து வெற்றி பெற வைக்க வேண்டும்.
