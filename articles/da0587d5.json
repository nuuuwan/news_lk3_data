    "Life can be exciting. Murky at times of course, but often happier than deserved. Elections are over and a systems change is in place, pleasing many of us mightily and most of us hopefully.",
    "The oppressed, repressed and inevitably depressed populace necessitate \u2013nay- demand a radical change in any country. The Gaza tragedy of a crumbling state, the unchecked, vulpine attitude of Israel, the appalling disasters climate change is inflicting on the world and the unchecked militarization of many nations is causing a miasmic cloud that is growing in intensity and spares no one. Sri Lanka is better off than most would you not agree?",
    "I am no political analyst. I only know what I like and right now I feel the country is adopting a progressive stance which many of us favour. The hoped for and expected victory by the NPP is satisfying indeed and it is a matter of national pride to know that our new Prime Minister is the BEST qualified Prime Minister in the world at this moment",
    "However, there is no doubt that the new Government of Sri Lanka MUST be aware that with its hoped for victory come responsibilities and consequences. Voters are being faced with a fascinating kaleidoscope of personalities. Many are unknown which can be a good thing. Academic qualifications are a great plus point for any candidate and many of the new politicians have them.",
    "Within the older parties there is no doubt that their days of supremacy are ended. Most of the former uneducated bunch we have been forced to put up with earlier will fade into the sunset (we hope). In short, most of us have a rare feeling of anticipation despite some surprising entries to Parliament on the National List.",
    "Personal loyalties are certainly meant to be sacrosanct but political loyalties need constant re-assessing. The follies of formerly \u2018Good\u2019 politicians have quite stunned me (and others) of late. To remain unchanged in one\u2019s political opinions smacks of a lazy and unthinking mind. Early opinions MUST change as better as abler people will constantly become available for public office.",
    "I admired Mr. Premadasa Snr\u2019s ability in getting work done. He was a hardworking and achieving leader and expected those working for him to be ready and available whenever he called. He had a plan for the country and the ability to inspire those who came within his purview. I am not touching on his faults here.",
    "But his son does not have his drive nor his leadership qualities.",
    "Sajith Premadasa speaks well in both Sinhala and English but is unnecessarily critical and does not seem to realize the an Opposition leader is not meant to voice his opposition ALL the time. We are now in a state where we hope for success in bringing Sri Lanka back to prosperity. Criticizing the Government before it has time to even turn round and breathe, reflects poorly on the critic.",
    "We need English.(Again my opinion which is not always popular,) What little we have now is inadequate. Here are Lee Kwan Yew\u2019s three Guidelines for his outstanding success in making the undeveloped little State he inherited into mega achieving one it is today.",
    "\u00b7 He chose English for the new state of Singapore over the impassioned demands of nationalists for a language of their own.",
    "\u00b7 He employed the best intellectuals available including the British from whom Singapore had only recently gained independence.",
    "Is it not sad to remember that he made Sri Lanka of 1947 his model to emulate?",
    "Perhaps the Govt. can make life a little easier for themselves and the Govt. Schools by requesting that those who can afford to pay something towards education should do so. This need not infringe on the Free Education Act. Those who need Free Education should be provided with it but we find it a little unfair that often millionaire offspring are educated in Govt. schools. A system COULD be devised to temporarily help with the enormous cost of bringing English to all and yet retain the national Languages as has India.",
    "Let me make my usual impassioned plea that religion should NOT be taught in schools as an exam subject. The high crime rate of Sri Lanka is mute testimony of the failure of this religious teaching.",
    "Here is the alternative I suggest that will RAISE understanding and suppress the antisocial elements raising their heads among school children\u2026. suicide being one of them. Religion is a parent\u2019s responsibility. It is not the responsibility of some uncaring and untrained teacher who is trying to complete a syllabus and prepare a student for an exam rather than stressing on the moral side of religion.",
    "These teachers of religion in Government schools are regarded as Archangel Gabriels trumpeting out the syllabuses touted by our Dept. of Education. How can this inconsequential and impersonal religious training take the place of parental teaching of the tenets of their OWN religion to their OWN children? Are parents too lazy to do so? It is so easy to pass on the responsibility to the school and most schools care only for exam results not for the mental health of the child.",
    "Let us rather teach VALUE EDUCATION as an alternative to religion in schools. ALL Sri Lankan students will thus be united in schools at least. As a Principal of Asian International school some years ago, this is a system I tried with much success and parental popularity before the Government insisted that even International Schools must teach ONLY the student\u2019s religion to him/her. Immediately classes were divided into four and students of International Schools were separated by religion. Is national unity even possible under such ridiculous educational systems?",
    "To those who criticize big weddings, lavish parties, fashion pictures and public social interaction I would ask what harm all this\u2019 hoo-haa\u2019 does? Basically we are social beings. Everybody needs friends around. Whether the number is just one or one thousand the principle of interaction is the same.",
    "Those who can afford to splurge are circulating money after all. Hotels benefit, caterers benefit, shops benefit, tailors and fashion designers benefit and the ripple effect ensures that money circulates. Any objections?",
    "One hopes that our new government will make English accessible to all AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. The expense of any system change will be horrendous. Perhaps parents could be given options? Diehard chauvinists could study in Sinhala if they wish but those who want English should have the right to chose it as their medium of instruction.",
    "There is no doubt that the sheer numbers of those choosing an English education will stun the chauvinistic nationalists who equate language with patriotism. The problems involving all this change boggles the mind. Where are the teachers? Where is the money?",
    "BUT a start must be made. How and where this can be done I have no idea. But I know it is possible. Nakedly displayed authority is usually anathema, but here is one time it may be necessary in order to upgrade our education. Obviously it will have to be done in stages and those left out of the first stage are going to feel by-passed. Governments may have to close their ears to such laments and explain the progressive plan of new syllabuses to critics who abound in Sri Lanka\u2026 alas!",
    "Until recently we regarded the Police with a jaundiced eye. We accepted nothing could be done without influence or bribery. Policeman were polite enough over minor infractions but no one really expected a follow through of any complaint unless backed (as said earlier) by higher authority.",
    "I give a composite example. A poor woman (lets call her Mani) has three children. Her husband starts an affair with a younger woman and abandons her to live with his paramour. Mani goes to the Police who actually advise her to put up with it. In several other cases I know of, the Police have taken no special action. Is the police empowered to act I wonder? Husband abuse their wives physically. Police action is as undependable as the monsoons.",
    "But there is a sudden change. Mani tells me that her latest complaint (yesterday) was heeded by a polite policeman who actually wrote down her complaint and promised to act. And why did she go again yesterday? She had been told, that of late, the police are running scared themselves. One can see with great satisfaction, that the formerly inexorable lines of authority of the police are being challenged, AT LAST, by a strong President.",
    "I live in Kotte. Between the garbage collectors and myself there exists a guarded neutrality\u2026a kind of semi-cordial one. The lorry comes down my way ONCE a week. Is this acceptable? Does my local municipality condone this? Garbage is stored in polythene and if these bags are not waiting at the gate for the Lordships of the garbage truck, the house is simply by-passed. If the bags ARE sitting at the gate they are torn open by every passing stray dog so every Monday morning the whole household is on alert for the shout that tells us of the is approach of our weekly saviour!! Surely there MUST be a better method?",
    "Yet every so often there arrives an unannounced health inspector to check on the state of our garbage and puddles of water collection. A few months ago my birdbath was full of water. (Why else would I have a bird bath) .The inspector claimed this was illegal as the bottom of the bird bath was slimy. In his opinion this attracted the dengue mosquito. As he was about to slap a Rs.25,000 fine on us I remembered a VIP who could help. He did \u2013 but what would I have done if he did not?. The birdbath still provides water for thirsty birds. For the record the birdbath was NOT slimy.",
    "One read of the enormous amount of security that used to be provided to undeserving ex VIPs. Most of our ex-Presidents including, the Rajapaksas, are not exactly that unpopular and I fail to understand why they need all this protection. Once they lose power no one wants to hurt them. To what end after all?",
    "Customs officers have been making millions we were told . So it seems a just punishment if they are made to pay back some of the loot, Deterrents to corruption are vital.",
    "It was also great to read that poor Dr Shafi of Kurunegala has been cleared at last. To have put ANYONE through that long legal nightmare did not speak well for a modern state.",
    "Let us give time and opportunity to our brand new Government and a brand new system that is trying to make Sri Lanka a better place for all of us, and attempt to put our criticisms on hold for at least a year.",
    "Her is some relevant humour which is so vital to any Government.",
    "\u201cPoliticians must be able to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next month, or next year \u2013 and then plausibly explain why it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe time God allots to us is like a beautiful piece of tissue which we embroider as best we can,\u201d (Anatole France) Let us use our time to embroider the \u2018Tissue of State\u2019 as skillfully as possible. May Sri Lanka be spared the ignominy of trailing in the rear of these New Worlds that beckon so invitingly . May we be one of the nations that makes this attainment a brilliant success.",
