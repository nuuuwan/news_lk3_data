    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers approved a proposal by Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera to spin off Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as a separate entity, the government information office said.",
    "It was felt that incorporating the refinery as a separate state-owned enterprise will allow local and foreign capital to be attracted to modernize and extend its life by another 25 years.",
    "The refinery was set up in 1969, but it can only process, more expensive light crudes.",
    "About 25 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s fuel needs are supplied by the refinery, the statement said."
