### Sri Lanka says Adani Port Project to continue despite US charges

Indian conglomerate Adani Group’s port project in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite US charges against its founder and sudden changes to its financing, the island nation said Friday.

A bombshell indictment in New York last month accused billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani and several colleagues of deliberately misleading international investors as part of a bribery scheme.

The charges sent Adani stocks into freefall and again raised questions over corporate governance at the family firm, whose founder is considered a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But Sri Lankan ports minister Bimal Ratnayake said the allegations against Adani had no bearing on the deep-sea container terminal project in the capital Colombo.

“The problem between Adani and the US... is not our concern,” he told reporters during a tour of the port on Thursday night.

“It is of high importance for us that western container terminal development by Adani goes ahead.”

இந்த மீன்பிடி நெருக்கடி பல வருடங்களாக இந்தியாவுக்கும் இலங்கைக்கும் இடையில் முக்கியமான ஒரு இராஜதந்திர பிரச்சினையாக நீடித்துவருகிறது. அடுத்தவாரம் இலங்கை ஜனாதிபதி அநுரா குமார திசாநாயக்க இந்தியாவுக்கு மேற்கொள்ளவிருக்கும்  விஜயத்தின்போது இந்த பிரச்சினை ஆராயப்படக்கூடிய சாத்தியம் இருக்கிறது.

" வடக்கு, கிழக்கு மாகாணங்கள் மற்றும் மலையகம் உட்பட சகல இனங்களையும் சகல பிராந்தியங்களையும் சேர்ந்த மக்கள் அண்மையில் நடைபெற்ற தேர்தல்களில் எங்களுக்கு (தேசிய மக்கள் சக்திக்கு ) ஒரு பெரிய ஆணையைத் தந்திருக்கிறார்கள்.  அவர்களது அக்கறைகளை கவனித்து தீர்வு காணவேண்டிய ஒரு பொறுப்பு எமக்கு இருக்கிறது" என்று வடக்கு யாழ்ப்பாண மாவட்டத்தை பாராளுமன்றத்தில் பிரதிநிதித்துவப்படுத்தும் சந்திரசேகர் கூறினார்.

*2024-12-13 08:02:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/204326) · `si`

Coconut shortage causes: high temperatures reduce seedling growth & pollination. Sri Lanka consumes 114 coconuts/year. Experts suggest increasing plantations to address scarcity.

🟩

Senior Professor of Professor Aruna Kumara says that the main cause of coconut shortage in the country is the hot-hot weather in the first few months of the Ruhuna.

He also said that the number of coconut seedlings in the country has reduced the number of coconut seedlings from about 70 lakhs.

"It has to be considered that the coconut is instantly increased to be scarce within a short period of time. Clear is not a quick increase. But for some time the population of these animals is increasing. High increase in temperature from March to June and the decrease in temperature and coconut availability. The best temperature for a coconut tree is a temperature like a Centigrade 27,28. But when it goes up to the centigrade, the pollination of the collise is reduced and the fruit decreases. "

In response to Ada Derana, Prof. Aruna Kumara said that Sri Lanka is the largest number of coconut consumption in the world and a person consumes 114 coconuts per year.

The competitive tender was apparently suspended in controversial circumstances amid attempts to bring in a rival unsolicited proposal by New Fortress Energy, a US-based company.

### Who guards the guards?

*2024-12-13 02:58:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/who-guards-the-guards-2/) · `en`

The Opposition continues to crank up pressure on Speaker Asoka Ranwala to resign over what it calls his false claim to have a doctorate. The JVP-led NPP government may have expected its opponents’ campaign against the Speaker to fizzle out with the passage of time. In this country, controversies crop up at such a rate that one finds it well-nigh impossible to keep track of them, and that may be the reason why the government has chosen to remain silent on the issue of the Speaker’s educational qualifications. But the Opposition remains maniacally focused on the Speaker’s claim in question, and SJB MP Ajith Perera has gone on record as saying that unless Ranwala resigns forthwith, the Opposition will be compelled to move a motion of no confidence against him. The government has sought to make light of the situation, but in vain.
