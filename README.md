The traditional corporate mindset in Sri Lanka often equates success with control. But in an era where volatility is the only certainty, holding majority stakes does not guarantee sustainability.

The recent decision by business magnate Dhammika Perera to acquire 50% of LAUGFS Holdings Ltd. (LHL) has taken the Sri Lankan corporate world by surprise. For decades, Perera has built his reputation on outright acquisitions and consolidating controlling stakes—an approach that has made him one of the most powerful figures in Sri Lankan business.

This time, however, the story is different. Instead of claiming majority control, he entered into an unprecedented 50:50 partnership. The move sent ripples across boardrooms, with many calling me in disbelief, some expressing concern, and others cautiously optimistic. Many friends and peers advised me against agreeing to an equal partnership, warning me about the risks of sharing power with someone of Dhammika’s stature and history.

If the Tamil Congress Front acts as the act of the Tamil Congress Front, it is the culmination of the sacrifice of Minister Chandrasekhar who attended the event of the sacrificial torch of Dileepan's brother.

Anyone can pay tribute to anyone; That is human dignity. Many people who stood against him during the time of Dileepan's brother struggled. Leading them stops near electoral politics. But what contradiction is it to refuse to allow others?

Political aggression is an unforgivable crime to make the memorial of a hero - the martyr. It is mentioned that this is nothing but barbarism violating human dignity.

Mushtaha Tower in Gaza City destroyed by Israeli fire on 5 September 2025 – Photo by Mahmoud Issa/Reuters

The Mushtaha residential tower stands tall next to a sea of tents in the West of Gaza City. A guided bomb from an Israeli military jet hits its base, throwing debris, dust, and a cloud of ashen hell into the air. While the video captures the air barely clearing, and even as we get a glimpse of the building still managing to stand, a second bomb hits. The Mushtaha tower comes down on itself in an explosion that rattles the earth.

There have been mice inside the tower, and insects. Cockroaches and their ilk. These insignificant creatures stand no chance as the world literally collapses around them. With no one to explain what is happening, no one around to evacuate them, the mice and the cockroaches die in their hundreds and thousands, and the former tower becomes their tomb.

### Geneva arena, Mahinda Rajapaksa returns to Ruhuna, Sri Lanka-Nepal outcomes

Ambassador of China calls on MR before he leaves Colombo residence

Bristling with misplaced arrogance as always, JVP theoretician and NPP Minister Bimal Rathnayake boasted in Parliament that 43 countries had spoken in favour of Sri Lanka after Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath’s address to the UNHRC in Geneva following UN Human Rights High Commissioner Volker Turk’s Report. Bimal seems unaware that 43 is not the most relevant figure. While all 193 UN member states are present in Geneva and have the right to speak, only 47 of the 193 have been elected members of the UNHRC with full voting rights at any given time.

Therefore, the relevant question is how many of the 43 countries that spoke in support of Vijitha Herath’s stand, currently enjoy UNHRC ‘member state’ status with voting rights? How many of the 43 can vote at this session?

The answer is 14. That’s way less than half, and slightly under a third.

Timor-Leste has scrapped a plan to give its lawmakers free cars after thousands of people took to the streets to protest against it.

On Tuesday, demonstrators burned tyres and set a government vehicle alight, while police responded with tear gas - hours later, the government bowed to public pressure and dropped the plan.

Despite this, many returned to the streets, with one protester telling the BBC that they estimated a turn out of around 2,000 demonstrators in the capital Dili on Wednesday.

Though the protests were initially triggered by the cars, they have now expanded to cover calls to remove lifetime pensions for retired lawmakers.

The unrest comes as governments across Asia, from Nepal to Indonesia, have been rocked by angry young protesters taking aim at the perceived excesses of lawmakers.

One student who has chosen not to be identified told the BBC that she was hit by tear gas while she was in front of her university campus.
