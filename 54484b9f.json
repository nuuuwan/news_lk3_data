    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Customs earned 970 billion rupees in 2023, its highest earnings, the government department said in a statement issued this week.",
    "\u201cAt the beginning of 2023, the Ministry of Finance set a revenue target of 1,217 billion rupees for Customs but this was revised to 893 billion because of the country\u2019s financial situation,\u201d Sri Lanka Customs Media Spokesman, Seevali Arukgoda, said.",
    "\u201cWe exceeded the revised target by 109 percent; it\u2019s 80 percent of the initial target.\u201d",
    "Arukgoda pointed out that Customs revenue was impacted due to the import restrictions on vehicles imposed by the government amidst the forex crisis.",
    "\u201cIn 2023, customs could only earn 10 billion rupees from the import of vehicles,\u201d Arukgoda said.",
    "The previous highest revenue earned by Sri Lanka Customs was in 2018 when it recorded 923 billion rupees. There were no import restrictions at the time. Customs earned 180 billion rupees from vehicle imports alone, Arukgoda said.",
    "\u201cIn 2022, the revenue target for Customs was 730 billion rupees of which it earned 708 billion rupees. So, compared to 2022, 2023 shows an income growth of about 138 percent.\u201d (Colombo/Jan3/2024)"
