    "He also asserted that during the Aragalaya, he faced criticism and accusations, but maintained that he diligently carried out his responsibilities for the Sri Lanka Police.",
    "\"During the 'Aragalaya' period, anyone could point a finger and accuse me, criticizing my conduct. However, I executed my duties to the best of my ability during that time for the Sri Lanka Police. The situation could have been vastly different today if we hadn't acted in the manner we did. As the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at that time, I merely fulfilled my duties to protect the country's democracy and national security,\" he said.",
