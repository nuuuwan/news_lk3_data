    "Dr. Kithsiri Edirisinghe, the CEO/Founder \u2013 IIHS, said: \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s education system has unique challenges, primarily due to funding discrepancies. This has led to a restrictive environment, especially for those in healthcare, where there is often a lack of inclusivity,\u201d further he explains. \u201cHistorically, there has been limited inclusion for healthcare professionals outside of the medical doctor field. While doctors have enjoyed some inclusion, nurses, midwives, public health inspectors (PHIs), dispensers, and mature nurses were often overlooked. We were the first to initiate inclusion by introducing bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and now even doctorate programmes in nursing.\u201d",
