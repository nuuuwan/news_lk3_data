    "Colombo, March\u00a0 14 (Daily Mirror) - The Railways Department has launched the process of train tickets and seat reservations only through the online system from today.",
    "The official launch of this programme was held this morning at the Colombo Fort Railway station with the participation of Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana.",
    "Accordingly, ticket reservations, seat reservations and train travel by reserved e-tickets were launched.",
    "Online ticket reservations will be made utilising an OTP code. Commuters can reserve their tickets and seats online through the link: http://seatreservation.railway.gov.lk/",
    "Due to this online system comuters need not stand in queues at railway stations and Government employees too can reserve their warrant tickets through the new system.",
    "But it is mandatory for the commuter to produce his or her identification at the railway station that has the facility of seat allotment within 7 days of making the particular seat allotment or 48 hours before the particular train journey, whichever comes first.",
    "A ticket obtained through the seat reservation system is no longer required to be printed, and the passenger's printed ticket or a soft copy of the ticket is sufficient.",
    "Earlier, seat reservations were made within 30 days prior to the journey and reservations started at 10 a.m. daily. But with the new online system the time for ticket reservations has been extended up to 07 p.m with effect from today."
