    "I first learned about the remarkable life of Prof. Mendis in an unlikely place. During a visit to the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa) in Kandy, I met my relative, C.W.

He spoke of a young man who grew up in Polonnaruwa under the influence of both Catholic priests and Buddhist monks\u2014a childhood that shaped his lifelong ability to bridge worlds. He also told me that he had been a mentor to this young man. I further learned that Prof. Mendis had given back early: in 1994, he established the annual Patrick Mendis Prize at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.",
