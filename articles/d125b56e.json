  "original_body_lines": [
    "Deep in Sri Lanka\u2019s south-western hills, where mist clings to ancient trees and streams tumble over mossy rocks, lies Sinharaja, a rainforest often described as the island\u2019s emerald heart. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1988, it is one of Asia\u2019s last remaining lowland rainforests\u2014a living relic of Gondwanaland. But this sanctuary is now under threat.",
    "An illegal road project cutting through the Ilumbakanda section has sparked outrage among environmentalists, who warn that the damage already caused is \u201cirreversible.\u201d Heavy machinery has entered this sensitive ecosystem, uprooting vegetation and compacting soil that has evolved over millennia.",
    "Environmental scientist Sajeewa Chamikara, speaking to The Island, said the construction represents a catastrophic failure of environmental governance.",
    "\u201cThis is not just a road; it\u2019s a permanent scar on Sri Lanka\u2019s most valuable natural asset,\u201d Chamikara said. \u201cSinharaja is irreplaceable. Every tree cut, every amphibian displaced, every meter of soil disturbed destroys a system that sustains life far beyond this forest.\u201d",
    "Spanning 11,187 hectares, Sinharaja is home to more than 50% of Sri Lanka\u2019s endemic species. A 2010 biodiversity survey estimated that out of over 38 amphibian species recorded here, at least 15 are found only in Sinharaja itself.",
    "The rainforest shelters rare and endangered species like the Pseudophilautus simba frog, Cnemaspis pulchra gecko, Cyrtodactylus crenscens lizard, and the purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus). The report identifies at least nine reptile species and 15 amphibians unique to this forest, making it one of the richest biodiversity hotspots in Asia.",
    "\u201cSinharaja is more than a forest,\u201d Chamikara said. \u201cIt\u2019s a biological treasure trove that holds genetic resources yet to be studied. Destroying it for a road is ecological vandalism.\u201d",
    "Beyond its biodiversity, Sinharaja is a watershed of national importance, feeding rivers such as the Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga that sustain agriculture and communities across the south-west. Conservationists fear that road-building activities will destabilize slopes, increase sedimentation, and heighten the risk of landslides in a region already prone to heavy rainfall.",
    "\u201cWhen you damage Sinharaja, you are not just harming wildlife,\u201d Chamikara explained. \u201cYou are threatening communities downstream that rely on this forest for water, farming, and even flood protection.\u201d",
    "The Ilumbakanda road project appears to have advanced without a mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), in violation of the National Environmental Act and Forest Ordinance. It also undermines Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations under the UNESCO World Heritage Convention.",
    "\u201cEvery safeguard has been ignored,\u201d Chamikara said. \u201cIf this is allowed to continue, no protected area in Sri Lanka will be safe. This is about accountability.\u201d",
    "Reports confirm that construction has already cleared portions of Sinharaja\u2019s buffer zone, raising fears of illegal logging, poaching, and further encroachment.",
    "Sinharaja has faced threats for decades, from illicit tea cultivation to land grabs. In 2011, authorities documented 364.7 hectares of encroachment around the forest. Conservationists say the Ilumbakanda road could mark a tipping point.",
    "\u201cRoads are ecological death sentences for rainforests,\u201d Chamikara warned. \u201cThey fragment habitats and open doors to exploitation. Recovery takes centuries, if it\u2019s even possible.\u201d",
    "\u201cSinharaja belongs not just to Sri Lanka but to the entire planet,\u201d Chamikara said. \u201cWe owe it to future generations to protect it.\u201d",
    "Once a haven of birdsong and tranquility, Sinharaja now echoes with engines and chainsaws. Whether Sri Lanka can stop this road and save its rainforest jewel may determine its environmental legacy for decades to come.",
