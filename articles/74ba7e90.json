    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has called for Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles to be replaced and for recent remarks on encouraging Police to shoot suspects to be withdrawn.",
    "Justice has to be dispensed by court after a fair trial and the minister\u2019s remarks are against the constitutional rights of the public, BASL said in a statement.",
    "According to media reports, the Minister asserted, \u2018Eliminating criminals from the country is not a sin. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the weapon in your hand for the right thing, and we stand by you.\u2019",
    "\u201cThe Minister\u2019s statement perpetuates a dangerous misconception that justice, sentencing, and punishment lie beyond the purview of the judiciary and can be administered arbitrarily, without adherence to due process,\u201d BASL said.",
    "Resolution passed by Bar Council calling for the Minister of Public Security to retract recent statement: and requesting his excellency the President to reassign the portfolio of Public Security",
    "At its council meeting held on April 27th, 2024, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka denounced the recent statement issued by the Minister responsible for Public Security at the Katukurunda STF training camp\u2019s passing out parade, which garnered widespread attention across various media platforms.",
    "According to media reports, the Minister asserted, \u2018Eliminating criminals from the country is not a sin. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the weapon in your hand for the right thing, and we stand by you.\u2019",
    "The BASL expresses grave concern over the aforementioned statement, deeming it in direct contradiction to the fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution and the established procedures governing the criminal justice system. The dispensation of justice, including the imposition of penalties upon wrongdoers, is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts as mandated by the Constitution. Such actions must adhere strictly to due process, including thorough investigations and fair trials conducted in accordance with the law.",
    "Given the alarming increase in extrajudicial killings, custodia aths, and incidents of torture perpetrated by law enforcement in recent times, the Minister\u2019s statement perpetuates a dangerous misconception that justice, sentencing, and punishment lie beyond the purview of the judiciary and can be administered arbitrarily, without adherence to due process.",
    "The recurring pattern of irresponsible, arbitrary, and misleading remarks by the Minister underscores the urgent need for corrective action. As a custodian of public security, the Minister is duty-bound to serve the interests of the populace. However, the repeated dissemination of such misguided messages not only undermines public trust but also misguides law enforcement personnel.",
    "Therefore, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka emphatically calls for the immediate retraction of the Minister\u2019s statement. The BASL calls upon His Excellency the President to forthwith remove Minister Tiran Alles from the portfolio of Public Security as he, by his repeated statements encouraging impunity and callous disregard for the rule of law, demonstrates that he is no longer suitable to hold that office. Furthermore, the BASL reaffirms the sacrosanct principle that the authority to mete out punishment must remain vested solely in the courts, operating within the bounds of established legal procedures.",
    "Additionally, the BASL reiterates the fundamental right of every individual accused of an offense to undergo a fair and diligent investigation and to receive a fair trial, as guaranteed by the law and international conventions adhered to by any civilized legal system."
