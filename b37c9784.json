    "These burials comprised of chambers; some circular and others rectangular, made of simple granite slabs. The chambers, some of which were covered with capstone, contained various sizes of earthen receptacles, big and small, 2-10 in numbers having ashes of the dead. The earthen receptacles of various sizes and shapes were of two types in red or black clay. In addition metal implements made of copper and iron, beads of different shapes and made of a variety of material were found within them.",
