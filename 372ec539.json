    "SJB MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar will present the adjournment motion",
    "Motion will highlight the suppression of the UN\u2019s efforts to mete out justice for Palestinians",
    "Stresses need for practical action instead of empty words to implement UN decisions",
    "The Sri Lankan Parliament will hold an adjournment debate today (18) on \u201cThe Difficulties Faced by the Palestinian People at Present\u201d following a request made by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Imthiaz\u00a0 Bakeer Markar will present the adjournment motion following which the debate will take place from 1.30 p.m. - 5.30 p.m.",
    "Bakeer Markar in his motion will highlight that all efforts made by the United Nations to mete out justice to the freedom struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate their lands have been suppressed by the occupying forces using veto power.",
    "\u201cThe inhumane, suppression and expansionism which continue to occupy the land by force, treating the Palestinian land as an open-air prison camp and depriving the true heirs of the motherland of the dignity of humanity, is an ineffable stain on the conscience of mankind,\u201d",
    "\u201cFor more than seven decades, despite world opinion, the territories reserved for a Palestinian state by the UN are being seized in a way that the civilised world can no longer tolerate, while forcibly taking away their cultivated land and even making them deprived of their waterways. The same forces are killing small children, sick people, elderly people and their families altogether, carrying out unacceptable attacks by air and land and even destroying the spaces to provide medical facilities to the people who have been victimised by these attacks,\u201d it will note.",
    "The motion will also highlight the need for a practical course of action instead of empty words to implement the decisions taken by the United Nations to immediately arrest the destruction of Palestinian land and provide an independent Palestinian state, as well as its associated world opinion.",
    "Bakeer Markar will also bring to focus the blatant violations of the resolutions adopted and decisions taken by the United Nations, including the proposals to deploy the peacekeeping troops at the borders, as well as the agreements for all peaceful negotiations and solutions.",
    "It will call on all the states of the world, as well as the United Nations to intervene immediately to arrest this unjust process, which is similar to the racist and genocide activities experienced in South Africa. The motion will urge them to strengthen small countries by giving them participation when decisions are made in such a way as to provide economic injustice to such small countries by preventing war, resolving conflicts peacefully, and maintaining peace and stability in the World."
