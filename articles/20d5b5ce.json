  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Railways plans to build small trains with three cars to operate on rural tracks where passenger demand is insufficient to run larger trains, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said.",
    "The cabinet of minister had given the nod to assemble the railcars locally which will be powered by a diesel engine in each compartment, and controlled by an electronic system.",
    "The small trains would be able to carry around 200 to 240 passengers.",
    "There were already some rail buses (a single compartment bus with wheels capable to running on rail tracks) but there were practical difficulties in running them with existing timetables (Colombo/Sept06/2025)"
