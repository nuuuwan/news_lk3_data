That integration gave Alumex the scale, expertise, and resources to expand beyond the local market. With more than 35 years of experience, we now hold a dominant share of the Sri Lankan aluminium extrusion market and are gaining recognition internationally. Our journey has been one of resilience, adaptability, and continuous innovation and Alumex\u2019s primary mission has always been to deliver greater value to its consumers",
