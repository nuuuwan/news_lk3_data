Its total number of gas stations ranks second place in the world. It ranked 5th on Fortune\u2019s Global 500 List in 2021.",
    "In June 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers had green-lighted the proposal to open up Sri Lanka\u2019s fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations.",
    "In October of the same year, the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill, paving the way for new suppliers to enter as importers, distributors and retail operators for petroleum products, was approved by the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Power and Energy.",
    "Later, in March 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted the approval to award licenses to China\u2019s Sinopec, Australia\u2019s United Petroleum and RM Parks of the USA, in collaboration with multinational oil and gas company - Shell PLC, to enter the fuel retail market in Sri Lanka."
