    "Lakdhas Wikkramasinha (1941 \u2013 1978) is one of the major Sri Lankan poets of the twentieth century. Fearlessly political, \u201cpowerful and angry\u201d (as Michael Ondaatje calls him in his memoir\u00a0Running in the Family), Wikkramasinha has influenced generations of writers in Sri Lanka. Yet his work, originally self-published in limited editions, has long been inaccessible.",
    "This new volume, edited by Aparna Halp\u00e9 and Ondaatje, is the first to offer a comprehensive selection of Wikkramasinha\u2019s English poetry, drawn from the original sources, most of which have never been reprinted. It is also the first to contain a representative selection of the poetry that Wikkramasinha composed in Sinhala, now translated into English by Udaya Meddegama.",
    "An accomplished bilingual writer, deeply engaged with Sanskrit and Sinhalese traditions, Wikkramasinha also reveals himself to be a modernist shaped by his reading of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Osip Mandelstam, bringing a lyric style of great rhythmic force and imagistic compression to bear on his postcolonial present, as well as on the colonial and precolonial past.",
    "Shanthini, then wife of Lakdhasa, will be visiting Sri Lanka and will donate copies of the book to the libraries of the University of Kelaniya and the Open University of SL.",
