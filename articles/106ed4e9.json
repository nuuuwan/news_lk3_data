  "original_title": "Public Sector Reform In Sri Lanka: The Battle To Dismantle The Predatory Syndicate",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u201cThe crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms appear\u201d \u2014Antonio Gramsci.",
    "The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has launched a decisive assault on Sri Lanka\u2019s dysfunctional public service, a cancerous system posing an existential threat to the NPP\u2019s reform agenda. Many conscientious public officials have courageously broken ranks and are earnestly working to dismantle the toxic culture. This transformation would have been impossible to imagine under other political parties, whose entourages were complicit in corrupt practices they could not escape without risking their political survival. The government inherited a morass of graft and finds itself forced to begin reforms alongside compromised bureaucrats with connections to terrified ex-politicos and complicit businesses seeking to escape accountability and justice.",
    "The regime\u2019s reform agenda treads a precarious tightrope: aggressive action risks catastrophic chaos and instability, yet excessive caution will undermine public confidence, potentially validating detractors\u2019 claims about incompetence and inviting the resurgence of the ousted cabal. There is no risk-free, resistance-free path to transformation. This toxic ecosystem resists reform because parasites have built careers on graft and desperately need the system to survive, further fueled by citizens who denounce corruption yet shamelessly exploit it to expedite tasks. This embedded habit of \u201cgetting things done\u201d through influence and power embodies the quintessential public sentiment: \u201cI want the system to change, but I do not want to change\u201d\u2014hypocrisy that will not disappear overnight. Stubborn inertia against change reflects a society-wide moral crisis.",
    "The window for systemic change, though wide open, narrows with each missed opportunity as forces interpret the government\u2019s reform efforts as revenge, its due process as weakness, and punishment as unpatriotic. At the same time, change is also learning and an adjustment for the NPP, which consists of diverse personalities with capabilities and expectations, because governance from the opposition is not the same as governance from the position of a ruling party, particularly in the context of deep cultural discomfort by the class that has ruled the country so far, of being governed by those whom they never thought would and never believed should. Impatience to recognize these realities makes one complicit with the interests of that class, which is increasingly becoming agitated with change",
    "No amount of political power alone can easily purge this entrenched system. Reforming the corrupt Public Service presents an enormous challenge: it operates as an interconnected web of private, public, and civil sectors, requiring the compromised public sector to lead its own transformation. Therefore, it must be treated as a malignant syndicate of multiple sectors and actors, contradictory yet firm ideologies, and deep-rooted vulnerabilities. The government inherited this morass of graft, where previous governments allowed the system to fester into a putrid pool\u2014politicizing and commodifying public service, with bureaucrats groveling before unscrupulous politicians, businesses, intellectuals, and religious authorities, selling their integrity and strangling the nation they are sworn to serve. Particularly after 1977, the Public Service rapidly metamorphosed from being the guardians of the public interest into mercenaries of power, their oath of service twisted into chains of political servitude. They lost their autonomy to use their intellect, imagination, and judgment according to rules, instead serving the dictates of politicians who crafted policies according to political rationality rather than public utility. Sanctimonious local and international actors demanding public sector reforms\u2014self-appointed guardians of good governance who are notorious for applying double standards to the global North and South\u2014may find themselves unwitting accomplices in perpetuating the very syndicates they claim to oppose.",
    "The pathology runs deep. Mafia-style businesses, ruthlessly determined to preserve their parasitic grip on the system, exploit politicians and public servants\u2014forming a syndicate for illegal concessions, approvals, access to public resources, and unlawful tax and customs duty reliefs, sustaining webs of corruption spanning public and private spheres. Money and power, not efficiency, sustained the syndicate.",
    "Bureaucrats rubber-stamp imports of substandard, lethal medicines\u2014knowing children will swallow poison and patients will die on hospital floors\u2014for blood money. They sign damned contracts with vulture suppliers offering MRI and CT scans at predatory prices, stripping away maintenance clauses until the machines\u2014overused, neglected, left to rot\u2014become worthless scrap in underfunded hospitals. Doctors and prison officials metamorphosed prisons into personal businesses, housing powerful inmates in comfort while producing bogus reports to tamper with court cases. Surgeons who operate on the mind\u2014those trusted with the most delicate procedures\u2014transformed public hospitals into money-making platforms, patronizing politicians who needed fraudulent medical reports that allowed equally powerful prison officials to provide comfortable accommodations to politically connected prisoners.",
    "The infection spreads everywhere. Obtaining pristine documents becomes effortless without site visits\u2014accreditations flow, inspections pass, and greedy hands easily stamp certifications of environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility, all when greased with bribes. Officials pass driving tests and deliver licenses to homes without following procedures\u2014so easily. Public officials rubber-stamp politicians buying their own houses and claiming public funds to rebuild them. They turn a blind eye when these same politicians squander public money attending personal events of their children and spouses, claiming these petty indulgences as sacred privileges.",
    "Public safety becomes a cruel joke. They amplify their masters\u2019 lies, screeching hysterics about fabricated national security threats, or worse, resurrecting the barbaric myth of Muslim doctors stealthily sterilizing Sinhalese women, feeding racist nationalism with expert sanction. Thus, they became complicit in how racist nationalism coexisted with an economy that rapidly collapsed into bankruptcy. Change does not automatically purge racialized public policies\u2014oh no, these venomous ideologies operate with exquisite subtlety, lying dormant like patient serpents until the perfect political moment arrives to strike.",
    "Public officials extend overseas trips to their kith and kin or cover private expenses during official visits with public funds, claiming them as privileges. The embassies pamper them, including entertainment and shopping. Corrupt foreign deals have bound the country in knots that the new government cannot easily untangle. Political appointees to top foreign missions\u2014unqualified, incompetent, and prized as trophies by narcissistic elites\u2014prioritize self-aggrandizement over diplomacy, bringing shame to the nation while sidelining seasoned career diplomats sworn to safeguard the country\u2019s global standing. This creates a shortage of competent diplomats.",
    "Bureaucracy, driven by terror or bribes, facilitates converting public property into personal assets for their cronies\u2019 businesses, then helps them dodge taxes entirely. This is the blood-soaked machinery of systematic plunder: people elect politicians who promise to meet their needs, then these representatives hand contracts for public projects to their loyal patronage networks. Mafia-like businesses compete for contracts based purely on influence and bribes rather than merit, while \u2018experts\u2019 provide official approval for these fraudulent transactions. The loot is shared from top to bottom\u2014a meticulously organized criminal distribution system\u2014with profits deposited in offshore banks or accounts under false names, erasing all opportunities for conscientious whistleblowers. Corrupt political-business alliances illegally exploit government subsidies, forcing public servants to provide official sanction for these schemes. This entrenched cycle runs governance, wasting resources, eroding trust, and turning governance into corruption.\u00a0 Each transaction feeds the beast, strengthening the chains that strangle the nation\u2019s soul.",
    "Export Development officials at the Divisional level systematically bleed small spice producers, steering them toward exploitative traders for personal kickbacks while national officials remain detached from realities on the ground. These parasitic bureaucrats jet off to international fairs with spice samples and hollow PowerPoint presentations, masquerading as industry representatives while actively sabotaging the value Sri Lanka could extract from its world-class spices. Their corruption doesn\u2019t just waste public resources\u2014it murders the livelihoods of farmers and destroys the nation\u2019s agricultural reputation on the global stage.",
    "Academics in public institutions sell their expertise as secret consultants for educational reforms, hiding their reports even from colleagues while pocketing blood money that compromises their professional integrity. Meanwhile, department chairs weaponize hiring processes, deliberately blocking talented candidates to reserve positions for their cronies returning from overseas or to appease their political puppet masters. These academic parasites don\u2019t just betray scholarly ethics\u2014they systematically destroy meritocracy, ensuring universities remain breeding grounds for mediocrity and political servitude rather than centers of genuine learning and research excellence.",
    "The biomedical industrial complex bribes doctors to prescribe drugs and exploits their positions in hospitals to funnel patients into lucrative private practices. These kickbacks come as cash, foreign trips, and luxury items. They fabricate false medical reports of surgeries to keep loyalists away from prison. This manipulation of records extends to covering up treatment failures and creating fabricated evidence of successful procedures to protect corrupt networks from legal scrutiny.",
    "Public servants with compromised integrity venture beyond their expertise in servitude to their political masters, regardless of the consequences to the country. Politicians heed their advice over real subject experts. For example, a prominent public services medical doctor advised a former president on an overnight organic farming revolution. The president heeded his false advice, which exposed the doctor\u2019s stupidity, destroyed farmers\u2019 livelihoods, and plunged the country into a severe food crisis.",
    "Agriculture experts, with a neoliberal mindset, in public institutions prostitute themselves as \u2018consultants\u2019 to the purely profit-minded agricultural industrial complex, hijacking the global demand for organic food while compromising national food security and farmer livelihoods. Their minds are colonized by the \u201cvisible hands\u201d of economists in the public sector who, imprisoned in failed and misleading economic doctrines, turn public institutions away from serving public purpose and conveniently blame political failures for the shortcomings of their own policy prescriptions. They wield enormous intellectual and political power over almost all public sector functions according to the dictates of neoliberal institutions, undermining the sovereignty of public policymaking. Their consultant reports are not even available to their own institutions or colleagues, but only to the institutions they serve, which impose power over the sovereignty of public institutions. The disproportionate emphasis on job-focused education in the education system and the relegation of history and ethics to mere electives will cripple public servants\u2019 ability to understand how the present came into being, and to recognize the oppressive power and discriminatory agendas embodied in policies and directives that masquerade as \u201cscientific,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d and \u201cpolitics-free\u201d knowledge imposed on them",
    "Efficient civic service depends fundamentally on accurate data and transparent information\u2014yet government data producers falsify official reports and mislead all governance stakeholders. They launder fraud into policy, and anoint theft with the seal of the state, sabotaging efficient policy decisions. Unscrupulous social media amplifies this dissemination of false data, creating echo chambers that normalize corruption and silence dissent. Those who resist are silenced, punished, or broken\u2014replaced by obedient puppets who enforce the will of their political overlords. This toxic anatomy is not incompetence; this is not governance; it is criminal syndication\u2014a culture of fear, complicity, and calculated betrayal strangling the last remnants of honesty in public service. It is collusion\u2014a cold, deliberate strangulation of the public good. The public itself sustains this syndicate when they celebrate their connections, influence, bribes, and transactional deals to bypass established procedures as evidence of their power and ingenuity\u2014many of these being the very same citizens who voted for the government to dismantle the syndicate. Sole Religious authorities invoke blessings and protection on syndicate leaders in return for \u201crighteous donations,\u201d challenging them as sacrilegious and unpatriotic. System change is a metaphysical challenge, meaning it requires what philosophers might call a \u201cmetamorphosis of consciousness,\u201d and that\u2019s terrifying for most people because change requires one to become comfortable enough to be comfortable with being uncomfortable with letting go of familiar ways of being.",
    "When business as usual is disrupted, the syndicate, powered by social media, builds an alternative narrative, framing the government\u2019s demand for accountability as vindictive revenge, following procedures and inevitable compromises as weakness, the slow pace of reforms as unpatriotic, and punishing government officials as government illegitimacy. Opposition politicians, terrified of accountability, feed on institutional decay, knowing bureaucratic rot works in their favor\u2014resistance to reform fuels public frustration, turning sentiment against the government. Yet these voices refuse to acknowledge their role in creating this monstrosity: a civil service poisoned by politicization, racial division, and corruption.",
    "The bureaucracy\u2019s resistance is not accidental; it is a silent coup motivated by self-preservation, and unless broken, it will strangle any chance of change. The public sector has morphed into democracy\u2019s most venomous weapon against itself. Some are paralyzed by fear, knowing former political masters could ruin them. Officials cling to lethargy, addicted to the perks of a broken system. A single phone call could blackmail them. Others, hardline loyalists, actively sabotage policy, wielding inertia as a weapon to protect allies. They fight reform not from principle, but from terror\u2014knowing transparency will drag their decades of plunder into the light and deliver the justice they have escaped.",
    "The consequences are a work culture devoid of accountability. Offices operate on a farcical rhythm\u2014late arrivals, extended tea breaks, card games masquerading as workdays, and early departures from the office\u2014all tacitly sanctioned by supervisors who themselves partake in the dysfunction. Office spaces resemble social clubs more than professional workplaces, with officers conducting personal business, entertaining visitors for hours, and treating public resources as personal conveniences. Files gather dust while officers engage in lengthy political discussions, personal phone calls, and elaborate lunches stretching into the afternoon.",
    "Sexual favors and illicit exchanges further entrench the corruption, making disciplinary action unthinkable. Ghost employees\u2014graduates secured through patronage\u2014treat government jobs as sinecures, vanishing into private ventures (tuition classes, driving Uber, and claiming overtime after leaving work early) while shielded by political ties. Their impunity demoralizes ethical officers, who risk reprisals for enforcing rules\u2014those attempting accountability face coordinated resistance. Maintaining the status quo becomes safer than pursuing excellence; mediocrity is rewarded while competence is punished, and professionalism is seen as rebellion.",
    "The bureaucracy remains packed with officials appointed by past regimes; their careers built on patronage. Now deprived of these spoils, their resistance manifests in deliberate delays and manufactured obstructions, sabotaging reforms to validate opposition critiques. Officers view systemic change as an existential threat\u2014not only to their corrupt practices but to their legacy, shaped by decades of patronage culture. Change represents the terrifying prospect of being evaluated on merit rather than connections, potentially exposing their professional inadequacies and rendering their political networks worthless. They deploy a sophisticated arsenal of obstructions: misplacing critical documents at crucial deadlines, giving incomplete and distorted briefings to new leadership, obstructing interdepartmental coordination, and spreading disinformation about policy impacts to create confusion and doubt. Such officials live in constant anxiety about exposure, banding together with political patrons, mafia businesses, social media, and even drug lords, their only hope of escaping accountability. Those officials willing to adapt to the new culture of governance that the government purports to cultivate are overwhelmed and burnt out with workloads.",
    "The entrenched hierarchical structure of Sri Lanka\u2019s public sector is a crippling obstacle to reform, fueled by narcissistic egos among senior officials who perpetuate a seniority cult that prioritizes tenure over competence. Power and legitimacy within these institutions are tied to rigid pecking orders, where leadership is less about competence and more about asserting dominance. Senior officers view their positions as personal entitlements, dismissing collaboration and treating juniors as threats rather than partners. This toxic culture, reinforced by corruption networks, creates a system where authority is brutally enforced rather than earned, and inclusive approaches are scorned as challenges to the established seniority cult. The hierarchy is reinforced by an economic system that ties salaries, perks, and influence to rank rather than performance, creating vicious self-interested resistance to change. Senior officers, conditioned by decades of authoritarian decision-making, equate flexibility with loss of control; thus, they ruthlessly suppress junior staff and dismiss merit-based contributions as challenges to their fragile authority.",
    "Credentialism weaponizes this dysfunction, transforming formal qualifications into instruments of control rather than markers of competence. When credentials become sources of gatekeeping power, they enable narcissistic leaders to justify their dominance while systematically strangling capable individuals who lack the \u201cright\u201d papers. Malignant credentialism, combined with the seniority cult, creates a double barrier to efficient public service where time served and degrees held matter more than actual performance or innovative thinking. With corruption pipelines now severed, many officials view reform as an existential threat, leading to desperate obstructionism. The effects are catastrophic: talented junior staff are marginalized, credential-obsessed gatekeepers reject innovative solutions, and the public suffers from poor services delivered by those who climbed hierarchies through tenure and papers rather than proven capability. Honest officers face suspicion as potential whistleblowers threatening the collective prosperity of corrupt colleagues. They never build new leadership, often leaving a vacuum when they retire.",
    "Political appointees, by serving partisan interests over the public good, result in policy incoherence and demoralization among competent career officers. This disrupts institutional memory and succession planning, creating a vacuum where short-term political gains override long-term governance. These appointees often lack the technical knowledge to lead complex institutions, yet their political connections make them untouchable, creating parallel power structures that undermine meritocratic governance. Many public servants view accountability measures, such as digitized identity and work-time logs and performance tracking, as threats to their comfort, leading to passive-aggressive sabotage, deliberate delays, and information hoarding and unjustifiable strikes.",
    "Many officials are holdovers from previous regimes\u2014beneficiaries of a patronage system that rewarded loyalty over competence. These networks extended beyond mere employment: relatives secured lucrative board positions in state enterprises, children gained access to higher education and jobs through connections rather than merit, and associates received government contracts worth millions without competitive bidding. The culture became so entrenched that entire ministries functioned as family businesses, with decision-making concentrated among connected clans who treated public resources as personal wealth. Now stripped of these perks, their resistance manifests as deliberate non-compliance",
    "For decades, subject-matter experts have been imprisoned in silos, making their professional judgment vulnerable to political and commercial interests and narcissistic territorial gatekeeping. Fear and bias stifle dissent, while fragmented departmental structures undermine interdisciplinary coordination\u2014creating dysfunctional mazes where no one grasps the bigger picture. These credentialed gatekeepers display arrogant contempt for knowledge from practitioners, community leaders, and field workers, falsely assuming their expertise exists in a political vacuum.",
    "Experts also resist democratic and inclusive consensus-based decision-making when they see it as an obstacle to career advancement. The revolving door between government agencies and private industry corrupts this system. Meanwhile, media outlets selectively platform compliant specialists driven by editorial politics, systematically silencing challenging voices to create echo chambers where credentialed authority becomes unquestionable dogma. This accountability vacuum ensures failed policies persist unchallenged, while the establishment dismisses innovative solutions from outside without consideration. This toxic nexus transforms public service into self-serving fiefdoms that suppress talent, crush innovation, and perpetuate systemic failures at public expense.",
    "The NPP inherited a situation where the economy was bound by the dictates of the IMF, World Bank, and WTO\u2014the unholy Trinity, subservient to foreign powers. Local bureaucrats became willing agents of these interests, prioritizing foreign approval over national needs. Past governments did not just mismanage the economy\u2014they systematically sold off sovereignty, binding public institutions through structural reforms, loan conditions, and \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d favoring creditors. Years of subservience gutted Sri Lanka\u2019s policy sovereignty, leaving a bureaucratic shell where foreign consultants hold more sway than elected leaders. Foreign actors have infiltrated institutions, allowing their agents to vet policies and establish shadow governance unaccountable to citizens.",
    "The unholy Trinity enforces doctrines of free markets and liberal democracy on poor countries, while remaining silent as its hegemonic patrons violate these principles with impunity\u2014a hypocrisy that underscores how such ideals have never been reality for the global majority. Their demands for \u201creform\u201d are often predatory schemes disguised as progress, concentrating power among a wealthy few who reap rewards while blocking real reform, which would be possible only with enlightened public servants willing to take calculated risks for change. They measure the success of policies by the most misleading indicator**\u2014GDP growth, which is predicated on the accumulation of wealth and power by the few through dispossessing the many and disrupting the sustainability of their ecosystem.",
    "The Fear of Freedom in Reform and Interregnum\u2019s Stark Choice",
    "The inherited culture has created a profound fear of change. Fear becomes a powerful catalyst for resistance, as uncertainty about new systems threatens the predictable comfort of familiar dysfunction. Paulo Freire\u2019s observation in Pedagogy of the Oppressed resonates here: \u201cThe oppressed, having internalized the image of the oppressor and adopted his guidelines, are fearful of freedom.\u201d This paradox defines Sri Lanka\u2019s bureaucratic resistance. Legacy officers clamored for the old regime\u2019s downfall, yet recoil from the autonomy reform demands\u2014because true freedom risks familiar hierarchies that guaranteed their safety. Like Freire\u2019s oppressed, they conflate liberation with chaos, clinging to the devil they know. Such resistance, motivated by apprehension, aligns effectively with the syndicate\u2019s objectives, hindering substantive progress under the guise of prudent deliberation.",
    "Reform is not just policy change\u2014it\u2019s a psychological revolution. Every call for accountability demands exemplary leadership and resolve to rebuild a public service crippled by inertia, fear, and decades of corrupted priorities. When top politicians lead by example\u2014demonstrating public service over self-enrichment\u2014the country takes crucial steps forward. Paralyzing fear\u2014the silent engine of stagnation\u2014must be broken, not indulged. Until leadership by example permeates the system, even visionary reforms will be sabotaged by those clinging to the gilded cages of the past over the uncertain promise of freedom. Breaking free from bureaucracy\u2019s psychological paralysis is half the battle; sustaining systemic change demands transforming public consciousness and radically redefining what citizens expect from power. Such change becomes possible when the country\u2019s educational system is not solely geared toward producing narrowly skilled labor\u2014the primary wish of the unholy Trinity.",
    "Antonio Gramsci\u2019s observation that \u201cthe old is dying and the new cannot be born\u201d captures Sri Lanka\u2019s paralyzed moment. The interregnum will not last forever. Yet the NPP government has an unprecedented opportunity to dismantle moribund conditions that stand against midwifing a socially and ecologically responsible civic ethos. The choice is stark: manage the transition now with courage, or face upheaval when a more entrenched and vindictive syndicate implodes."
