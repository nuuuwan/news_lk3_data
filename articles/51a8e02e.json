    "Colombo, March 21 (Daily Mirror) - The International Centre for Foreign Studies (ICFS) is set to host a special spot admissions program for students, especially in the North and East provinces, who aspire to pursue higher education opportunities in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany for the upcoming September 2024 intake.",
    "Chathurika Dissanayake, the CEO of ICFS Education Center said they plan to host a special two-day program called 'Project Education Yalpanan' on March 30 and 31 at the Jetwing Hotel in Jaffna, free of charge.",
    "\"There have been many overseas university representatives coming to Colombo, and there are numerous education events and exhibitions happening in and around Colombo. However, these types of events often do not reach Jaffna. We understand that there are many talented, qualified students in Jaffna who are capable of seeking these overseas opportunities,\" she said.",
    "The Spot Admissions program allows students to participate in a specialized event where they can secure their offer letters within 30 to 40 minutes.",
    "\"We have joined hands with York St John University in the UK, and we will be accompanied by the country manager, Mrs. Bhagya Perera on both days. Students seeking study opportunities in the UK can visit us on March 30 and 31 in Jaffna and leave with an offer letter in hand,\" Dissanayake said.",
    "\"Getting an offer letter from a university is usually a lengthy process, taking weeks or even months. However, during the program, we have arranged for students to receive an offer letter from York St. John University within a few minutes. All students need to do is bring their documents, including passport, academic records and service letters, to ensure they leave with an offer letter for the upcoming intake,\" she explained.",
    "She said Canada is also a preferred destination for many students in the North and East due to family ties. \"ICFS is delighted to introduce a loan opportunity for postgraduate students in Jaffna for the first time,\" she said.",
    "\"We are introducing a loan facility that covers the full cost of studies in Canada. This makes studying in Canada achievable without making it just a dream. The assessment for the loan will be based purely on academic criteria and employability after graduation. No guarantors or properties are required for security; it is purely based on academic achievements,\" the CEO said.",
    "ICFS has also identified Germany as a preferred destination for students. \"Germany offers scholarships for students with higher academic achievements. Even for university courses in Germany, students can make a minimum payment of 3000 euros and pay the balance in installments. We will have an information session dedicated to Germany as well,\" added Dissanayake.",
    "\"All students interested in studying in Germany, whether undergraduate or postgraduate, can meet us at Jetwing Jaffna on March 30 and 31 from 9 a.m. onwards,\" she said.",
    "She said that ICFS is committed to bringing more opportunities to the North and East under the education initiative 'Yalpanam.'"
