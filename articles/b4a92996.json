  "original_body_lines": [
    "The leader of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance, Gampaha District parliamentary candidate Dilith Jayaweera claims that the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has failed to fulfil its promises to the people as they lacked the proper understanding of how to fulfil them.",
    "He stated this while addressing a public meeting held in the Kandasurindugama area in Negombo last evening (06).",
    "Jayaweera said the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance is not engaging in politics based on promises and that their focus is on a type of politics that is about only speaking about what is definitely achievable.",
    "He highlighted that their wish is to provide guidance to the President and alleged that many of the President\u2019s promises have remained unfulfilled as they were never attainable.",
    "\u201cThey promised to reduce the electricity bills by 40%. It cannot be done. They said they\u2019ll slash petrol price to Rs. 200. But in the end, only Octane 95 which is used by the wealthy was reduced. You got nothing,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe can explain how a coconut went up to Rs. 140, and the way the egg prices increased. They are simple concepts of how the price of a product is formed. They are unaware of this. How can one know if they haven\u2019t visited a market?\u201d he questioned.",
    "The \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance leader said since a long time ago they have been speaking about nationalism and entrepreneurship and that today, even America\u2019s Donald Trump is also talking about nationalism and entrepreneurship.",
    "He further stated that he believes Sri Lankans will learn a valuable lesson from Trump\u2019s Presidential Election result."
