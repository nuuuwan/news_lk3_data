    "Discussions are in the final stages for a $5 billion road-and-rail link between India and Sri Lanka with India set to bear the cost of the stra\u00adtegic project, said the island-nation\u2019s environment secretary Prabath Chandrakeerthi.",
    "This is the first big bilat\u00aderal infra\u00adstruc\u00adture project announced by the island nation since the recent election of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake amid efforts by New Delhi to counter Chinese influence.",
    "India is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest trade partner and one of the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) contributors. Indian invest\u00adment in Sri Lanka amounted to about $142 mil\u00adlion in 2021.",
    "\u201cLast month I participated in one meeting with India in New Delhi, and we are going to establish the highway and railway line connectivity between Rameswaram in India and Trincomalee in Sri Lanka,\u201d B. K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi told Mint. \u201cThis is being planned as businessmen in both countries have to pay more and with the road and rail connectivity, both parties can get help because it will help in trade with European and other countries. Indian businessmen can also get some benefits from Sri Lanka as well,\u201d Chandrakeerthi added.",

    "The Sri Lankan government proposed a land bridge between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu of India and Talaimannar, a village in Mannar Island of Sri Lanka in 2002 and signed an agreement on it.",
    "As per the agree\u00adment, road and rail bridge links were to be developed, offer\u00ading eco\u00adnomic benefits to both sides of the Palk Strait. However, after the agreement was signed, the Tamil Nadu government opposed the construction of the land bridge.",
    "As per the agreement, road and rail bridge links were to be developed, offer\u00ading eco\u00adnomic bene\u00adfits to both sides of the Palk Strait. However, after the agreement was signed, the Tamil Nadu government opposed the construction of the land bridge.",
    "The talks resumed in 2015 when Indian asked the Asian Devel\u00adop\u00adment Bank to carry out pre-feasibility study for fin\u00adan\u00adcing a road and rail link between",
    "India\u2019s Rameswaram and Sri Lanka\u2019s Talaimannar. But it has been decided to build the rail and road link up to Trincomalee, the offi\u00adcial informed.",
    "There is no land connection between Sri Lanka and India through road or railway. The closest Indian town to Sri Lanka, Dhanushkodi, had a rail\u00adway sta\u00adtion but this was washed out in a cyc\u00adlone in 1964. A short boat ride till 1966 connected the rail\u00adway sta\u00adtions at Talaimannar in Sri Lanka and Dhanushkodi in India.",
    "\u201cThe cost of the project is still not final\u00adized. We have to have more dis\u00adcus\u00adsion about that, but I think it is estim\u00adated to be nearly $5 billion,\u201d the Lankan official said, and added: \u201cIt will entirely be borne by the Indian government. We have to get some approval for environmental clearance.\u201d",
    "He said the project may involve bridges and under\u00adwa\u00adter tun\u00adnels to allow unhindered movement of ships.",
    "Queries sent to the spokespeople and secretaries of Indian road transport and highways, ports, shipping and waterways, railways, external affairs and environment ministries remained unanswered at press time."
