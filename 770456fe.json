    "After failing to land a high-profile name for the chief selector\u2019s post for the past two tenures, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is all set to get its wishes. Former India pacer Ajit Agarkar is likely to become the new chairman of the BCCI Selection Committee. Agarkar had been the frontrunner the last two times. However, he pulled out of the race. This time, with Delhi Capitals unlikely to continue with a brigade of coaches, Agarkar will be free of IPL commitments and is eager for the high-pressure job. Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) will begin interviews on July 1 (Saturday).",
    "The chief selector\u2019s post has been vacant since Chetan Sharma stepped down following a TV sting. BCCI posted an advert last week. After two T20 World Cup and two WTC Final debacles, BCCI wants someone to challenge the team management\u2019s calls in case of differences as well as someone with T20 experience. With World Cup 2023 being the most crucial tournament, the BCCI wants to complete the formalities before the Asia Cup 2023 in August.",
    "Having played 26 Tests, 191 ODIs, and 4 T20Is, he is by far the most experienced candidate. In the current selection committee, the four members have a combined international experience of 55 international games. Agarkar has also played 42 IPL games."
