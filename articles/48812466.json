    "World-renowned British primatologist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall, best known for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees, has died at the age of 91. The Jane Goodall Institute announced her passing in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Oct. 1), stating that she died of natural causes in California while on a speaking tour in the United States.Born in London in 1934, Goodall developed a deep fascination with animals from an early age, encouraged by her mother. At 26, she began her pioneering research in what is now Gombe National Park, Tanzania, in 1960 \u2014 a journey that would revolutionize our understanding of primates.One of Goodall\u2019s most famous discoveries came early in her work: she observed a chimpanzee, whom she named David Greybeard, using grass stems to extract termites from a mound \u2014 the first recorded instance of tool use in non-human animals. This shattered the prevailing scientific belief that only humans were capable of making and using tools.Goodall's methodology was as revolutionary as her findings. She immersed herself in the chimpanzees' habitat and formed close observations over time, building trust with them. In contrast to the scientific norms of the era, she assigned names \u2014 not numbers \u2014 to the chimpanzees, a decision initially criticized by some researchers but later embraced as foundational to ethological studies.In 1977, Goodall co-founded the Jane Goodall Institute with Genevieve di San Faustino. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., with offices in 25 countries, the Institute has become a global leader in community-centered conservation and education, aiming to protect chimpanzees and other endangered species through science, public engagement, and policy advocacy.Throughout her career, Goodall received both critical acclaim and popular recognition. She inspired generations of scientists and conservationists, especially women. According to the Institute, the percentage of women in STEM fields rose from 7% in 1970 to 26% in 2011, in part due to her trailblazing influence.In 2002, Goodall was appointed a United Nations Messenger of Peace, further elevating her voice on global humanitarian and environmental issues. In her later decades, she became an indefatigable advocate for wildlife protection and climate action \u2014 balancing the urgency of planetary crises with a steadfast message of hope.According to Jane Goodall Institute Singapore, she traveled over 300 days a year, even into her 90s, speaking worldwide about the threats facing chimpanzees and their habitats, as well as broader environmental challenges.Her engagements spanned from school visits and media appearances to meetings with policymakers and donors. She remained committed to grassroots action, education, and youth involvement in conservation until the very end.Over the years, Goodall received numerous accolades. In 1995, she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her contributions to zoology, and she was promoted to Dame Commander in 2003. Other honors included the French Legion of Honor, Japan\u2019s Kyoto Prize, and the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.On the day of her passing, Goodall had been scheduled to meet with students and teachers to launch the planting of 5,000 trees in wildfire-affected areas of Los Angeles. Organizers learned of her death as the event began. After a moment of silence, the first tree was planted in her honor.In a tribute, nature broadcaster Chris Packham reflected on her lifelong dedication:\u201cIn many ways, Jane just died on the job \u2014 the job that her life became. And that was protecting life on Earth.\u201dThe United Nations also honored her legacy in a statement on social media:\u201cToday, the UN family mourns the loss of Dr. Jane Goodall. The scientist, conservationist and UN Messenger of Peace worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature.\u201dCourtesy: Al Jazeera, CNA, ABC News"
