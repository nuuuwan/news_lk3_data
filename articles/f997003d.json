    "PM says she won\u2019t tolerate a \u2018political insurgency\u2019 within the govt.",
    "Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
    "We next flew to Tibilisi-Georgia (in the USSR) on the same private plane, placed at our disposal. We had official appointments and discussions, but the program was kept light in order to afford some relaxation and sight-seeing, which included attending some cultural shows in the evening. They were uneven in quality, with some first rate items, and others fairly ordinary. They also tended to be too long, at least by our standards.",
    "We were to leave Tibilisi for home on November 16. The previous day we received a telephone call from the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Maithripala Senanayake regarding the defiance by the LSSP, an important constituent party of the government, of a ban on a public march and demonstration, which the Prime Minister had earlier decided on. This was to be a political demonstration critical of certain aspects of government, and reflected the degree to which alienation had occurred between the government and this party.",
    "Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike also spoke to the Prime Minister on the occasion. She gave strict orders that this defiance should not be permitted, and that if it became necessary curfew should be declared and the march banned. The Prime Minister also wanted it clearly conveyed to the LSSP Ministers, that if they went ahead with the demonstration, they would not be able to serve in the government any longer.",
    "This was a grave political crisis and we had to readjust our program in Tibilisi to deal with it. More calls from the two Senior Ministers followed and it appeared that there was a distinct possibility of the LSSP violating the Prime Minister\u2019s orders.",
    "The next day, November 16, we set out for Colombo. The Prime Minister had a specially screened-off section of the aircraft, with a sitting room area, which included a table. Shortly after take-off she sent for me and discussed the whole issue. She was quite clear that she was not willing to tolerate political insurgency within her government. She was determined to sack the LSSP in case of non-compliance with her decision.",
    "Under the circumstances, she wanted to discuss the formation of a Cabinet without the LSSP. For the next three hours or so, we carefully discussed Ministries; responsibilities; individual Ministers; their strengths and weaknesses; each one\u2019s suitability for a particular portfolio; issues of balance and so on. Eventually after chopping and changing, re-thinking and amending, we had finalized the complete list of Cabinet portfolios and the Ministers who would hold them.",
    "We worked through lunch at this. The Prime Minister was keen to have everything worked out by the time she landed in Colombo. She also wanted this kept confidential from everyone-else with no exceptions. When I got back into the general section of the plane, all were naturally curious to find out what was happening. I could only tell them, that we would all know in just a few hours. We landed at the Bandaranaike International Airport Katunayake, to a city under curfew.",
    "The LSSP march could not take place under curfew. The Senior SLFP Ministers present thought the best course would be to await the LSSP\u2019s reaction to this. \u201cWe have prevented their march and if they want to go, let them go,\u201d was the prevailing view. The Prime Minister agreed. More balanced counsel must have prevailed, for the LSSP did not react to the ban, and the whole thing blew over. But this was just another incident in an escalating series of misunderstanding, miscalculation and eroding trust. It was becoming clear that the coalition was unraveling.",
    "Within a few days of coming back from the USSR, I had to leave for Malaysia, along with the Cabinet Secretary Mr. Alif to attend a colloquium on \u201cPolicy Analysis and Development\u201d organized by the Asian Center for Development Administration with its headquarters in Kuala-Lumpur. Mr. Baku Mahadeva, my former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, was now heading this center. The invitation had come and had been accepted with the Prime Minister\u2019s concurrence some months before. We were to present papers at the colloquium, and mine was on \u201cLeadership Styles in Government.\u201d",
    "The visit to the USSR intervened, and it detracted somewhat from the reading and preparations necessary for such a high level colloquium. The colloquium itself which was to last three full days with a packed agenda was for Secretaries to Presidents; Secretaries to Prime Ministers; and Secretaries to Cabinets of Asian countries, with an emphasis on South and South East Asia.",
    "The center had also invited a panel of distinguished academics known for their research on the areas covered by the colloquium, as well as a few selected practitioners from outside Asia, notably from the American President\u2019s staff in the White House. Many countries, including India sent both its Prime Minister\u2019s Secretary and the Cabinet Secretary to participate.",
    "The colloquium was inaugurated by Tun Abdul Razak, the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the keynote address was given by Tun Sri Ghazali Shafie, the Home Minister. The gathering unanimously elected Tun Sri Kadir, the Chief Secretary and Cabinet Secretary of Malaysia to Chair the sessions. We all sat around a large oval table behind our national flags. But after the first session on the first day. it was felt that the presence of the flags was an impediment to the frank discussions and comments that the organizers wished to elicit from this distinguished and senior gathering working at the highest levels of government in their respective countries.",
    "The flags were therefore removed before the second session started after lunch. That really helped. Everyone became more informal and forthcoming. A lively discussion ensued. We were now not speaking for our countries, but for ourselves, and what we thought of things. We successfully jettisoned our role as representatives of government, and became an extended trade union, a family of practitioners who remarkably seemed to have very similar experiences and quite familiar problems.",
    "On one occasion, when things got a bit dull and too theoretical, I quoted the poet Louis Macneice and provoked them by saying that more was expected from us than \u201csitting at a desk for 30 years and scratching our backs with a pension,\u201d and went on to make some observations in a similar style. The Malaysian Home Minister who was so interested in the colloquium that he absented himself from Parliament, where the budget debate was going on, was present when I spoke, and later was so gracious as to say that he enjoyed my intervention immensely.",
    "Almost everybody sparkled. The standing and the high level of competence of the participants led to a wide-ranging deep and entertaining discussion over the days. When we reached our hotel rooms after the first day, there were several invitations awaiting us. One was from the Prime Minister of Malaysia inviting us for dinner, the following night. Under \u201cDress\u201d it said Batik. There was no other choice indicated. Most of us had packed suits, but had not taken along a batik shirt.",
    "The following morning, we brought this to the attention of our Chairman, the Chief Secretary of Malaysia. We inquired, whether we could come in a suit. He smiled and said that Batik was the formal attire in Malaysia, and he would see what could be done. When we resumed our discussions after lunch, the Chief Secretary announced that at the tea break we could inspect and select a batik shirt from a large number of sizes and colours which had been sent, courtesy of the Prime Minister.",
    "This was very thoughtful and most generous, particularly since we did not have the time to go out and buy shirts. That evening all of us decked out in gorgeous batik shirts were taken to the Prime Minister\u2019s official residence. where the dinner was held. I was among the first lot to be taken. and therefore had an opportunity to discuss with the Prime Minister, the working of his monitoring concept of the National Operations Room.",
    "Like most ideas, the concept worked very well in Malaysia because of the personal ownership of the idea and the relentless drive of Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak. The Development Plans of all Ministries with implementation targets and progress to date were reflected in large sliding panels in the National Operations Room. The Prime Minister personally periodically sat with each Minister and Senior officials and went into the details of financial expenditures and physical progress.",
    "We heard from Malaysian officials that these were dreaded meetings, where the Prime Minister relentlessly grilled the officials and would not tolerate any excuses. He also had helicopters ready, and there were times when he told the Ministers and officials, indicating to him that everything was fine in some important project that he would like to take them along and see the progress on the ground right away!",
    "There was therefore, no time for window dressing or camouflage. They immediately left by helicopter. The Prime Minister, we were told was quite harsh if the progress on the ground did not match the reports. We ourselves copied this concept and set up our own National Operations Room. But Mrs. Bandaranaike by temperament was no Tun Abdul Razak. Nor did we have many helicopters. The culture was different. Nevertheless, a great deal of useful work was done centred on the operations room for a fair period of time. Over the years it gradually faded into oblivion.",
