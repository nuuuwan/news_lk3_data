During the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture delivered by former president Ranil Wickremesinghe in India recently, he recalled that his first visit to India was as a young boy of 18 years to Chennai to sit for the London GCE A-level Examination — as was the practice in Sri Lanka at the time.

Referring to multiple interactions with Indian leaders over the decades which started in his role as an assistant to former president J.R. Jayawardene, he said,” When you have been in politics as long as I have, you end up knowing everyone – at some point or the other.”

“I have also been an eyewitness to the pivotal and sweeping economic metamorphosis of India from the late 1990s onwards.”

### Astonishing Levels Of Corruption

*2024-12-29 23:44:11* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/astonishing-levels-of-corruption/) · `en`

Unless the scourge of corruption is at least controlled, if not eliminated, our country is doomed. In the absence of genuine effort, no amount of big talk of “Yahapalanaya”, “Eradication of Beeshanaya and Dhooshanaya”, “Vistas of Splendour,” are all hollow deceptions, and an insult to our collective intelligence. Let us demand that the currently pledged ”System change” is truly meant, and will not merely join the lengthy queue of deceptive treachery.

There is much excitement that at long last, some action will be forthcoming. The early signs are very positive. May this continue as a sustained battle against grave injustice. The people deserve this; and are tired of hoodwinking slogans and pretended “Cleanliness”. Times and moods have changed and the “Aragalaya” was a mild fore taste of what determined and disciplined, massive public protests can do. All beware!

### Billions Of Tsunami Aid Disappeared Without A Trace; Corruption Even In Human Misery

Local media highlighted the twentieth anniversary of devastating Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004 and snatched way almost one percent of the Muslim population. However it failed to highlight how billions of tsunami aid disappeared without a trace.

According to reports, tsunami victims didn’t get any aid and they did not know where the aid money went. Some reports stated that money was feverishly transferred not only to government establishments, but also to accounts of individuals, companies and charity organizations.

Sri Lanka’s then deputy executive director of the anti-graft organization Rukshana Nanayakkara said: “It was almost impossible to find out what happened to the cash. According to an initial government audit only 13 percent of the aid was spent during the first year of reconstruction, but since then there has been no formal examination of accounts.”

### NPP needs to get serious about industrialisation to avoid another crisis

*2024-12-29 23:06:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/NPP-needs-to-get-serious-about-industrialisation-to-avoid-another-crisis/4-771128) · `en`

Speaking in Parliament on 18 December, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pledged that under the leadership of his party, “we will never allow a situation like 2022-23 to reoccur in our country”. If AKD and the National People’s Power (NPP) intend to keep this promise, they will have to get a lot more serious about industrialising an economy dependant on services and remittances.

It is regrettable that the President’s speech, while announcing welcome relief for the poor through tax cuts, allowances and subsidies, paid scant attention to increasing investment in the real economy. This is a deadly trap that centre-left governments often fall into. Naturally, the wretched conditions following economic collapse require immediate relief measures. However, long term increases in consumption can only be achieved through investment in the real economy.

### AKD and ETCA with India: Trap or opportunity?

ETCA is a way forward for Sri Lanka to harness the benefits of international trade for creating prosperity to Sri Lankans

According to the 34-point agreement which President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, AKD for short, had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi or simply Modi, the two countries have agreed to promote, among others, trade and investment between them1. There are three agreements that are strikingly prominent and promising. One is that they have agreed to continue discussion on economic and technological agreement, shortened as ETCA, which is now in an abortive state. Another is the direct use of Indian Rupee or INR and Sri Lanka Rupee or LKR for transactions thereby avoiding the intermediate exchange currency, the US dollar. The third is for India to invest in sectors that will increase Sri Lanka’s export potential. All these are interrelated and should naturally form the core of any ETCA to be negotiated.

The Government needs to submit a plan to encourage installation of solar power by individual homes and the industry, with reduced interest loans from commercial banks

The country has almost exhausted its cheapest power hydro-electricity. Only possibility is major movement towards solar power, especially by small and medium scale industries and house owners. Most convenient new solar users would be factories and offices, who normally work during day-light hours. Also, most schools have fans in the classrooms. They could install solar panels on the roofs, eliminating electricity bills. The parents who installed the fans in classrooms could also install solar panels

AKD and the NPP Government must stay objective and must resist undue interference of these third parties in making decisions which are in the best interest of the country

There is a continuation of policy at least in the short term. There is no immediate disruption. Trying to do too much in too short a time invariably leads to disaster. The NPP Government is the first in recent times to continue with the economic policies of the previous regime. All this, in my eyes, points to a desire on the Government’s part of putting the country first rather than blindly following an ideology. My advice to the Government is to focus on governance reform. The economy will take care of itself in the short term

The recently launched “Clean Sri Lanka” Program under the leadership of the President has generated significant attention. As someone deeply engaged in ocean sustainability efforts for nearly a decade, I commend this initiative as both timely and impactful. It represents an essential step toward fostering sustainable practices for a healthier ocean.

For the past eight years, we have demonstrated practical methods for creating and maintaining a sustainable ocean environment. However, a pressing issue that must be addressed is the prevention of plastic waste from entering our oceans. One effective solution we identified is the installation of “trash traps” to intercept plastic waste carried by water streams into the sea.

Addressing crowds gathered outside, Zourabichvili said she would leave the presidential palace but branded her successor illegitimate.

### ELEVATE Filmmakers: Building Confidence To Speak Up & Drive Change

In Sri Lanka, discussions surrounding Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) and Cyber Gender-Based Violence (CGBV) often remain shrouded in silence due to deep-seated cultural taboos. This silence is particularly prevalent in government universities, where many female students are hesitant to address these sensitive topics due to stigma and fear of backlash. The ELEVATE Project, launched by the Centre for Media and Information Literacy, sought to break this silence by empowering 50 young female undergraduates, giving them the tools and confidence to speak out and advocate for change.

Through creative expression in filmmaking, the ELEVATE Project has not only provided participants with valuable technical skills, but it has also played a critical role in elevating their confidence. These young women, once too shy to discuss SRHR and CGBV, have grown into outspoken advocates, using their films as powerful tools for social change.

Sri Lanka’s sensational skipper Chamari Athapaththu has been nominated for both ICC Women’s T20I Cricketer of the Year and ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year awards.

It wouldn’t be an overstatement to brand Chamari Athapaththu as the most prolific female cricketer from Sri Lanka of all-time given her stellar record for the island nation, but the southpaw managed to go one further in 2024.

Despite encountering an unexpected slump in the Women’s T20 World Cup, Athapaththu was the second-highest run-getter in a calendar year in women’s T20Is. Her 720 runs included two hundreds and four half-centuries, with 86 fours and 32 sixes to her name.

Apart from her exploits with the willow, Athapaththu also picked 21 wickets in the period. Her best with the bat and the ball in T20Is came in 2024.

Amidst a series of remarkable performances, including the two centuries in Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier, it was Athapaththu’s brilliant 61 against India in Dambulla on July 28 that stood out.

புதிய மருந்தகங்களை திறப்பதற்கான விண்ணப்பங்களின் எண்ணிக்கை அதிகரித்து வருகின்ற நிலையில் தகுதிவாய்ந்த மருந்தாளர்கள் இல்லாமல் மருந்தகங்கள் பதிவு செய்யப்பட வேண்டுமா என்று தேசிய மருந்துகள் ஒழுங்குபடுத்தும் அதிகார சபையின் தலைவர் வைத்தியர் ஆனந்த விஜேவிக்ரம கேள்வி எழுப்பியுள்ளார்.

மருந்தாளர்களுக்கு பயிற்சி அளிப்பதற்கு தேசிய மருந்துகள் ஒழுங்குபடுத்தும் அதிகார சபை பொறுப்பல்ல என்றும் அதன் தலைவர் வைத்தியர் ஆனந்த விஜேவிக்ரம சுட்டிக்காட்டினார்.

சில சந்தர்ப்பங்களில், மருந்தாளர்கள் போதுமான ஊதியம் இல்லாததால் மருந்தகங்களில் அவர்கள் பணியாற்றுவதில்லை. புதிய மருந்தகங்களை நிறுவுவதற்கு அடிக்கடி விண்ணப்பங்கள் வருவதற்கு இதுவே காரணமாக இருக்கின்றன.

தரநிலைகளைப் பராமரிக்கவும், பொதுப் பாதுகாப்பை உறுதி செய்யவும் மருந்தகங்கள் தகுதி வாய்ந்த நிபுணர்களைக் கொண்டிருப்பதை உறுதி செய்வது மிகவும் முக்கியமானதாகும் என்றார்.
