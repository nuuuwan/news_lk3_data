    "The text also \u201cwrongly legitimizes the false narratives benefiting Hamas, which have sadly found currency in this Council,\u201d she said.\u201dThis resolution also refuses to acknowledge and seeks to return to a failed system that has allowed Hamas to enrich and strengthen itself at the expense of civilians in need,\u201d she said.",
    "Palestinian and Arab representatives criticised Washington\u2019s veto. Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said the decision showed the Council\u2019s \u201csilence comes at a great cost for its credibility and authority,\u201d adding that the use of veto power \u201cshould not be allowed when atrocity crimes are at stake,\u201d",

    "\u201cWe want to see an immediate and lasting ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and the urgent lifting of all restrictions on humanitarian aid. We will continue to work for this for however many Council meetings it may take,\u201d Lassen said.",
    "Algeria\u2019s UN Ambassador Amar Bendjama said, \u201cPalestinian brothers, Palestinian sisters, forgive us. Forgive us, because the world speaks of rights but denies them to Palestinians. Forgive us because our sincere efforts shattered against this wall of rejection.\u201d",
