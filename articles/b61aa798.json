    "The T20 World Cup is being co-hosted by the United States and West Indies.",
    "\"Nepali player Sandeep Lamichhane will leave for the West Indies for the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup and join the Nepali national cricket team,\" association secretary Paras Khadka said in a statement.",
    "Spin bowler Lamichhane, 23, was once the poster boy for cricket in Nepal, but was convicted for raping a young woman in a Kathmandu hotel in 2022. That was quashed last month.",
    "\"I am now joining the national team for the last two matches in the West Indies and looking forward to fulfilling my dreams and the dream of all cricket lovers,\" Lamichhane posted on X, formerly Twitter.",
    "\"To all our cricket fans and people back home everywhere who prayed for me, I will forever be grateful for your blessings.\"",

    "He was dismissed as national captain and arrested, but Nepal lifted his playing ban when he was freed on bail.",

    "Cricket does not enjoy the same attention in Nepal as it does elsewhere in South Asia.",
    "But the sport has been growing in popularity, with Nepal given one-day international status by world governing body the ICC in 2018.",
    "Lamichhane was a major part of the rise as the most sought-after Nepali cricketer in lucrative T20 leagues around the world.",
