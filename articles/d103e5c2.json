    "The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) in association with the Stock Broker industry, will host the \u201cInvest Sri Lanka\u201d Capital Market Investor Forum on March 27th and 28th 2025, at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo. The event is aimed at promoting investment in the Sri Lankan capital market among institutional investors and fund managers based both locally and internationally.",
    "This flagship forum will bring together key stakeholders from Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market ecosystem to showcase the country\u2019s investment potential. It will highlight Sri Lanka as an attractive investment destination, especially in light of recent economic reforms and the latest upgrade from Fitch Ratings, which has raised Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating from Restricted Default (RD) to CCC+. This upgrade reflects the country\u2019s significant progress in stabilizing its economy and signals that the risk of imminent default has eased, fostering growing confidence in Sri Lanka\u2019s financial recovery. It is a crucial milestone in the country\u2019s efforts to rebuild credibility and regain investor trust, playing an essential role in attracting both domestic and international investors, particularly through debt restructuring efforts, fiscal reforms, and securing international support, such as the ongoing IMF program.",
    "This improvement is expected to provide an important boost to investor sentiment, as it demonstrates Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to addressing its economic challenges and taking necessary steps to ensure long-term fiscal stability.",
    "The \u2018Invest Sri Lanka\u2019 Capital Market Investor Forum 2025 will feature leaders in Government, financial and capital market sectors, including regulators, market intermediaries and listed companies to make a collective case for Sri Lanka as an attractive investment destination.",
    "The forum will provide networking opportunities, fostering meaningful connections and promoting synergies that highlight the investment potential within Sri Lanka\u2019s dynamic capital market. Pre-scheduled one-on-one discussions between international fund managers and Sri Lankan companies will facilitate further investment partnerships.",
