    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that true revolutions are not about violence or destruction, but about creating a foundation where people can advance with dignity.",
    "Pointing out that the \u201cUrumaya\u201d program has been able to create that background for the people of Sri Lanka, the President said that everyone should unite with the \u201cUrumaya\u201d program, which will popularize the genuine socialist ideals beyond partisan politics.",
    "The President made these remarks at the \u201cUrumaya\u201d freehold land deeds award ceremony held at Tambuttegama Mahaweli Stadium, where he symbolically awarded 47 freehold land deeds. Accordingly, 4,012 individuals across nine Mahaweli divisions in the Anuradhapura district received their freehold land rights.",
    "\u201cI visited Tambuttegama area 50 years ago, in 1974. At that time, there was a contention within the Bandaranaike family regarding who would step forward after the passing of Mr. Ratnamalana, a member of the Left Front who was active here.",
    "Anura Bandaranaike expressed his intention to take up the mantle. Opposition leader J.R. Jayawardena asked Mr. Jayawardena if he would lend his support, to which Mr. Jayawardena agreed. However, Mrs. Chandrika and Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga opposed this. Eventually, Mrs. Bandaranaike presented Mr. Ratnamalana\u2019s son. Mr. Adhikari from the United National Party arrived in this province for our interim election.",
    "During that period, there was no any development in these provinces. I returned to Tambuttegama in 1984, it\u2019s after a decade, during which time we had formed a government and appointed Mr. Adhikari as Deputy Minister under Minister Gamini Dissanayake. Mr. Gamini Dissanayake entrusted him with the Mahaweli H zone, and with the support of all of us, he worked towards its development.",
    "Mr. Gamini Dissanayake inaugurated Tambuttegama as the new main town of the Kalawewa area under the Mahaweli Development Program. On that day, Madhya Maha Vidyalaya, a new bus stand, a fully equipped hospital, the Deputy Governor\u2019s office, and shops were all inaugurated.",
    "I attended the event as the Minister of Education, alongside Mr. M.H. Mohammad, the Minister of Transport, and Mr. Ranjith Atapattu, the Minister of Health. Prior to this, at the request of Mr. Adhikari, I had arranged for Tambuttegama Maha Vidyalaya to receive advanced education facilities and a new building.",
    "Today, Tambuttegama has blossomed into a highly developed city. When I first visited the province in 1984, my friend MP Anura Dissanayake was a student at that school. Through our efforts to enhance its educational standards, he excelled in his exams and subsequently attended the University of Kelaniya, which we helped establish. Now, he has the privilege of working alongside us in Parliament.",
    "When the \u201cDhawala Pathrika\u201d was introduced, it faced significant opposition from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Today, I take pride in seeing one of its members emerge as a presidential candidate, a testament to the success of our education system.",
    "During my visit today, the principal mentioned that Tambuttegama College still lacks adequate resources. Therefore, plans are underway to construct a new building for the college. Our efforts have propelled significant advancements in these provinces. Several Irrigation Ministers and Mahaweli Ministers have originated from this province, reflecting our collective progress.",
    "While MP Anura Dissanayake and I collaborate in Parliament, our political affiliations differ. He recently affirmed this in Parliament, identifying Mahinda Rajapaksa as the key figure in his political stance. This divergence doesn\u2019t concern me; whether someone aligns with Rajapaksa or the United National Party or other parties, our imperative remains collaboration for the common good.",
    "I recall when Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike was there to give the presidency to Mr. Anura Bandaranaike when she gave up the office of President. At that moment, Mr. Anura Dissanayake courageously stepped forward and requested Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa to take up the opportunity, supporting him during the election. For me, their political affiliations are not an issue. Today, we stand united beyond political divides. Whether they are Rajapaksa supporters or United National Party supporters, our common goal is the recovery of our country. Recently, the United States acknowledged Sri Lanka\u2019s remarkable progress, urging other nations to follow suit.",
    "Two years ago, our political system faced a collapse. Which country faces a three-day search for a prime minister? Such disruptions are unheard of in politics. Moreover, in any country, a single-seat holder becoming president is unprecedented. Despite these challenges, through collaborative efforts devoid of political agendas, we have stabilized the country\u2019s economy. This achievement underscores the power of working together for the greater good.",
    "Before that, we experienced various political conflicts. However, during times of national crisis, we cannot afford division. If we do not unite, there will be no country left to govern. Over the past two years, we have focused on providing relief to the people. Instead of remaining in the depths of economic despair, we introduced a program three times larger than \u2018Samurdhi\u2019 called \u2018Aswesuma,\u2019 bringing comfort to the nation. Government employees received an allowance of Rs.10, 000. In 2015, following the salary increase I implemented as Prime Minister, this allowance was granted for the first time. We also bolstered agriculture by ensuring farmers had ample fertilizer.",
    "The economic crisis affected all citizens, but as we rebuild, we must not forget those who struggled. The farmers of this province have consistently yielded good harvests, which has bolstered our economic recovery. As a token of appreciation, we have initiated a ground-breaking program to grant freehold land rights, a move emblematic of true socialism in our democratic socialist nation. This echoes China\u2019s approach to developing its economy through traditional socialism, ensuring prosperity reaches the people.",
    "We have initiated a program aimed at establishing an export-driven economy in our nation. This endeavour ensures that people are empowered with rights\u2014a true testament to socialism and revolution. Unlike past upheavals involving violence and destruction, this is a peaceful and transformative revolution. Through the \u201cUrumaya\u201d program, 2 million people in our country will secure their land rights. I urge everyone to embrace this opportunity and advance with pride. This marks your liberation, freeing you from dependency on officials. Hence, I invite all to support and participate in this initiative without political divisions\u201d."
