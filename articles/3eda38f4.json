  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says NPP has found it challenging to reach elite circles which as a result lack understanding of NPP policies and ideologies",
    "Stresses party isn\u2019t against those who are rich but instead against those who misuse public funds or make undue gains",
    "Assures an NPP Govt. will not hamper private businesses or intend to monopolise all businesses as claimed by opponents",
    "Claims it will however dismantle market monopolies by attracting more competitors in sectors such as rice and tiles",
    "Says NPP opposed to privatisation of enterprises such as Sri Lanka Telecom, MILCO though admits some sectors should be divested from Govt. involvement in business",
    "Notes party advocates for a tax policy conducive to economic growth and is opposed to current tax regime which has constricted SL\u2019s economy",
    "Opposes PAYE tax, citing negative impact on consumer spending and economic activity",
    "One main misconception that the NPP is against the rich continues to be communicated...they lack an understanding of our vision and ideology. They are distant from us, rarely attending our meetings or engaging with us. Our explanations fail to resonate with them. Despite addressing their questions repeatedly, they remain unconvinced. We struggle to convey our ideology to them.",
    "The NPP has spoken about how certain corrupt individuals have obtained undue wealth. But that does not mean we are against the rich; instead, we are against those misusing public funds",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake seized the opportunity at the recent NPP Banking and Finance Sector Stakeholder Forum held in Colombo to address and clarify any misconceptions or false information circulating about the party, especially among those in the upper echelons in Sri Lankan society.",
    "Addressing the gathering Dissanayake highlighted that a significant obstacle encountered by the party in its endeavour to mobilise the populace for national transformation and attain governance is its limited access and inability to reach these elite circles.",
    "\u201cThey lack an understanding of our vision and ideology. They are distant from us, rarely attending our meetings or engaging with us. Our explanations fail to resonate with them. Despite addressing their questions repeatedly, they remain unconvinced,\u201d he expressed. \u201cWe struggle to convey our ideology to them,\u201d he added.",
    "Nevertheless, during the event, the NPP leader attempted to tackle the prevailing concerns within the group, aiming to dispel any misunderstandings.",
    "Addressing misconceptions about the NPP\u2019s stance on the wealthy, the party leader clarified, \u201cOne main misconception that the NPP is against the rich continues to be communicated. The NPP has spoken about how certain corrupt individuals have obtained undue wealth. But that does not mean we are against the rich; instead, we are against those misusing public funds.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut a false idea is disseminated that the NPP is against the rich and those with significant assets. For example, some rumours claim that under an NPP Government, a person cannot have more than two houses,\u201d he noted.",
    "\u201cClaims such as the NPP will not allow business to be conducted are disseminated to instil fear among the community,\u201d Dissanayake said.",
    "The NPP leader also highlighted that opponents have been spreading the notion that an NPP Government intends to monopolise all businesses, leaving no space for private enterprises.",
    "Clarifying the NPP\u2019s policies, Dissanayake said that the party believes the Government should remain involved in certain sectors for the public\u2019s benefit. \u201cThe Government has a mandate and social responsibility to fulfil certain needs of the people,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "Using State Banking institutions as an example, Dissanayake emphasised that the Government must retain its insignificant share in the sector, even if it incurs losses, to ensure the provision of banking services to rural villages. However, he clarified that this stance doesn\u2019t imply the NPP will prevent private financial institutions from operating; rather, it suggests advocating for the Government to maintain its presence in the sector for public benefit.",
    "According to Dissanayake, it is under the same premise that the NPP opposes the privatisation of certain Government enterprises such as MILCO and Sri Lanka Telecom.",
    "Opposing the sale of SLT, Dissanayake underscored its role in developing IT infrastructure critical for Sri Lanka\u2019s advancement in the sector. He cautioned that without SLT\u2019s involvement, the country might struggle to progress in the IT sector.",
    "With Sri Lanka\u2019s current $ 1.3 billion IT sector, he stressed the necessity of improving infrastructure to reach an IT market of $ 10 billion. Dissanayake urged viewing SLT not just as a telecommunications provider but also as an infrastructure provider. He questioned the consequences if SLT was sold to the private sector and infrastructure development didn\u2019t follow suit.",
    "As for the proposed sale of MILCO and the National Livestock Development Board, Dissanayake noted that the Indian Government\u2019s National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) is one stakeholder in the sale.",
    "\u201cMILCO and NLDB have the potential to provide the infrastructure needed to support Sri Lanka in becoming self-sufficient in milk which could also alleviate rural poverty,\u201d he noted.",
    "He said the sale of both agencies could lead to Sri Lanka losing this opportunity thus jeopardising future plans to alleviate rural poverty through the development of the dairy sector.",
    "However, Dissanayake also acknowledged that the NPP believes some sectors should be divested from Government involvement in business.",
    "Noting the existence of monopolies, industries such as rice and tiles industries, Dissanayake clarified that a future NPP Government wouldn\u2019t enter these businesses, as claimed by certain Government MPs. Instead, he said the party aims to dismantle these monopolies by attracting more competitors to these fields. He also addressed key issues facing the populace, highlighting unbearable taxes, high costs of essential services, and youth unemployment as primary concerns while noting that the key issue faced by the Government is the lack of revenue.",
    "Dissanayake presented the NPP\u2019s plans to boost revenue through Customs, Inland Revenue, Immigration, and the Excise Departments. He said urgent strategies to increase Sri Lanka\u2019s dollar reserves include leveraging tourism and remittances, while long-term goals involve exploring new markets like Africa or even Tamil Nadu and Kerala.",
    "Dissanayake also said the NPP opposes the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax, citing its negative impact on consumer spending and economic activity. He said instead, they advocate for a tax policy conducive to economic growth.",
    "\u201cThe taxation burden has hampered our economy\u2019s growth. Without loosening tax policies, our economy will remain stagnant. Sri Lanka stands out as the only nation with a contracted economic plan while others strive for expansion. Our strategy is clear: to foster economic growth. This growth must extend beyond Colombo to the grassroots, averting urban overcrowding.",
    "\u201cThe NPP staunchly opposes the PAYE tax, as it diminishes people\u2019s purchasing power, hindering economic activities. We must encourage economic dynamism while fostering development. A stagnant tax policy has crippled our economy, but we are determined to reverse this trend and spur growth,\u201d he said.",
    "He proposed local manufacturing to cut imports and emphasised decentralising economic activities, with the NPP aiming to expand the economy beyond Colombo to alleviate urban overcrowding and rural poverty.",
    "The NPP leader also urged the banking and finance stakeholders attending the forum to support the party to bridge the gap between the NPP and the upper echelons of society.",
    "Dissanayake during his speech emphasised the collapse of Sri Lanka\u2019s entire system, underscoring the need for a comprehensive transformation rather than focusing solely on individual sectors, pointing out that while other countries experienced a revival in the 20th century, Sri Lanka missed out on such opportunities, attributing the current crisis to this phenomenon.",
    "He highlighted the lack of a clear vision for the country post-independence in 1948, contrasting it with countries like India, Vietnam, China, and South Korea, which strategically planned their future paths.",
    "The NPP leader criticised Sri Lankan leaders for engaging in divisive politics instead of fostering national unity and innovation, leading to a stagnation stuck in past glories, contrasting this with India\u2019s forward-looking approach rooted in tradition.",
    "He said the NPP aims to modernise the economy stuck in traditional produce like tea, rubber, and coconut and emphasises the need for a genuine transformation rather than superficial changes, stressing that this responsibility transcends party politics and requires national commitment. He expressed the belief that ousting leaders representing the old system would ignite a sense of revival among the populace, urging people to take responsibility for the country\u2019s rejuvenation, emphasising the need for revitalisation across all sectors and a transformative political role by the NPP.",
    "At the forum Dr. Harshana Sooriyapperuma briefly outlined the economic plan of the NPP."
