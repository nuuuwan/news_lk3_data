    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) on Monday expressed serious concern over comments circulating on social media and other platforms relating to matters that fall under the purview of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and the judiciary, stressing that both are independent institutions that must remain free from outside interference.",
    "In a statement, the BASL noted that the Judicial Service Commission, comprising the Chief Justice and two senior Supreme Court judges, holds responsibility over the transfer of High Court judges as well as the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control, and dismissal of judicial officers and certain scheduled public officers.",
    "The BASL reiterated its long-standing position in safeguarding the independence of the judiciary, warning that social media posts, public statements, commentaries, or purported predictions by YouTubers on court case outcomes amount to attempts at outside influence. Such acts, it cautioned, undermine the rule of law, threaten due process, and risk eroding public confidence in the administration of justice.",
    "\u201cPerpetrators of such acts can be dealt with in terms of the Law,\u201d the BASL stated, drawing attention to Article 111(C) (1) and (2) of the Constitution, which contain penal provisions against interference with the judiciary.",
    "The BASL emphasised the need for all stakeholders, including law enforcement authorities, to ensure the protection of the rule of law, due process, and the rights and liberties of citizens at all times."
