    "Opposition MP Prof. Charitha Herath expresses serious concerns about the Economic Transformation Bill",
    "Argues against benchmarks and timelines dictated by current government\u2019s preferences",
    "Highlights Section 6 mandate, could restrict future Governments to adhere to the bill",

    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member and parliamentarian Prof. Charitha Herath expressed serious concerns about the Government\u2019s proposed Economic Transformation Bill, which is set to be tabled in parliament this week.",
    "Speaking at a press conference at the party headquarters, Herath criticised the government for attempting to enshrine the country\u2019s fiscal policy into law through the proposed legislation.",
    "\u201cNo democratic country would take such a step. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re turning an election manifesto into law,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP noted that Section 3 of the Act indicates the intention to formulate a National Policy on Economic Transformation. However, he pointed out that such matters are typically decided by each elected government. \u201cA policy cannot be made for eternity,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Herath, the provisions in the bill include benchmarks and timelines set according to the current government\u2019s preferences. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to include these in your own manifesto, but not to make them into law. The President or the Government has no right to do this,\u201d he said.",
    "The President is bringing these because he knows that there are around 100 MPs who vote yes to anything brought by the President.",
    "He noted that Section 3 (2) includes fiscal policy-related matters, such as achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and modernising and digitising agriculture. \u201cThese are just ideas that have come to his mind,\u201d Herath said in reference to President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "Herath also highlighted that Section 6 mandates that all policies, programs, circulars, and orders must adhere to this act. \u201cThis means future governments would have to rule the country according to the vision of the person who devised this. This approach is more suitable for communist countries,\u201d the MP remarked.",
    "Herath also criticised Section 10, which exempted Colombo Port City from the act\u2019s provisions. \u201cChaitiya Road has one set of laws on the left side and another on the right. Perhaps they believe Port City belongs to China. When a law is formulated, it must apply uniformly across the entire country. Is Port City not part of Sri Lanka?\u201d he questioned.",
    "He further observed that the bill appears to be hastily presented, as evidenced by its language, despite the serious nature of its content. The MP urged SLPP members not to vote in favour of the bill, stating that supporting such legislation would compromise their dignity.",
    "The MP emphasised the lack of mandate for both the President and Members of Parliament to enact such a law. He further criticised the incumbent President\u2019s actions, suggesting they exceed the boundaries of what a succeeding President should undertake. \u201cNotably, one such action includes the introduction of the Economic Transformation Bill,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP highlighted that while the current economic plan lacks approval of the people, future governments would be bound by legislation enacted by it. According to Herath, the proposed bill contradicts the fundamental principles of bill drafting."
