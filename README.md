### Zakath and poverty: Why the powerful tool falls short in Sri Lanka

*2025-09-25 02:07:30* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Zakath-and-poverty-Why-the-powerful-tool-falls-short-in-Sri-Lanka/4-782124) · `en`

Zakath is designed not merely to relieve poverty temporarily but to eradicate it by creating economic balance and social solidarity

Modern business enterprises are scientific, complex, and competitive. No project can succeed without rigorous planning — including feasibility studies, project appraisals, business models, and risk management strategies. Although zakath administrators and volunteers dedicate themselves selflessly, most lack the technical expertise required for such tasks. Many are unfamiliar with the importance of professional assessments, while others are hesitant to allocate funds for preliminary studies, considering them “wasteful.” This approach, however, contradicts both reason and revelation

The key thing about the first year of the AKD presidency is that its true character and core content were revealed through action and inaction; roads taken and not taken; choices made and options rejected. The AKD presidency revealed its reality in its first year. It showed its soul.

President AKD spoke at length about economics at the ceremony to kick-off construction of the Kadawatha-Mirigama segment of the Central Expressway project. This passage is key:

“…Even by today, the IMF, World Bank and rating agencies have given extremely important signals about our economy. I saw a report in which the World Bank has given us the recognition that in rebuilding broken-down states, the fastest speed has been registered by Sri Lanka. This is an extremely important factor. Therefore, we are proceeding on our journey with great steadiness and stability…”

TV news showed JVP chief theoretician Bimal Rathnayake leading the cheers as Anura paused, having enunciated this wisdom.

### Tariffs and conflict causing major volatility in shipping industry, says UN trade agency

The shipping industry is experiencing major volatility amid rising geopolitical tensions and disruptions caused by a wave of new tariffs, according to a report published on Wednesday by the U.N. Trade and Development agency.

Due to an increasingly complex and uncertain global trade environment, subdued industrial activity in major economies and weak Chinese demand for bulk commodities, UNCTAD has revised down its maritime trade growth forecast for 2025.

It now projects overall maritime trade volume to expand 0.5 per cent annually, with containerized trade growing slightly faster at 1.4 per cent.

“Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” NCA Deputy Director Paul Foster said.

It remained unclear which criminal group was behind last week’s hack. An NCA spokesperson declined to provide further details.

Ransomware gangs routinely publicise attacks and leak stolen data on dark web “leak sites” but websites that monitor those portals had not, as of Wednesday, detected any group claiming the hack.

### Japan PM says Palestine state recognition ‘when not if’

Japan’s prime minister told the United Nations on Tuesday (Sep 23) that Tokyo’s recognition of the State of Palestine was only a question of time, saying he was “indignant” at recent comments by Israeli officials.

Nearly 80 per cent of UN members recognise the State of Palestine, with a string of countries including Britain, Canada and France adding their names this week after nearly two years of war in Gaza.

“I feel strongly indignant at the statements made by senior Israeli government officials that appear to categorically reject the very notion of Palestinian state-building,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.

“For our country, the question is not whether to recognise a Palestinian state, but when. The continued unilateral actions by the government of Israel can never be accepted,” he said.

“I must state clearly that if further actions are taken that obstruct the realisation of a two-state solution, Japan will be compelled to take new measures in response,” he added.
