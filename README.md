### Can any candidate achieve 50%+1 at presidential polls - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-03 00:35:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Can-any-candidate-achieve-50-1-at-presidential-polls-EDITORIAL/172-283932) · `en`

All political parties are in election mode. Presidential elections are scheduled to be held between September and October this year. However, reaching the magical 50%+1 seems like a distant dream for the candidates in the running.

In the first presidential election in October 1982, President Jayewardene’s main rival Mrs.Sirimavo Bandaranaike was banned from contesting. Jayewardene was able to collect only 52.91 percent of the votes.

The 1988 election saw several election violence-related actions. That election was won by Ranasinghe Premadasa who received 50.4 percent of the votes. Voter turnout was low-around 55.3 percent, the lowest for a presidential election.

### McDonald’s secret: Shares rise while food sales decline

The  Official Poverty Measure, according to which the official US  poverty rate in 2022 was 11.5 percent, with 37.9 million people in  poverty

It’s hard to believe, but McDonald’s is losing customers in the US because they can no longer afford McDonald’s prices.

Americans spend eleven per cent of their earnings on food. Eating out is a major pastime. But, those in the median income groups (including sections of the middle class) are feeling squeezed as they need to spend more on almost everything, including rents, mortgages, cars and transport. Unemployment is on the rise, with Silicon Valley and Amazon among the earliest to begin layoffs.

Those earning $45,000 or less are less and less able to eat out, and McDonald’s outlets are favourite havens for that.

A meeting between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the IMF team at the Finance Ministry in March 2024

Even as Sri Lanka prepares for elections, laws are being rushed through a parliament without legitimacy. Among those many draft laws– the President in his Budget Speech in November 2023 said he wants to create or amend sixty new laws–one of the most notorious so far is the Economic Transformation Bill. If the citizenry is being devastated by the severe austerity measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this new bill seeks to legislate the very conditionalities and targets set by the IMF.

### Iran’s ex-President Ahmadinejad to run again: state TV

(Reuters) - Iran’s hardline former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered to run for president in the country’s June 28 election, organized after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month, Iran’s state television reported on Sunday.

However he could be barred from the race: the country’s cleric-led Guardian Council will vet candidates, and publish the list of qualified ones on June 11.

Ahmadinejad, a former member of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, was first elected as Iran’s president in 2005 and stepped down because of term limits in 2013.

He was barred from standing in the 2017 election by the Guardian Council, a year after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned him that entering was “not in his interest and that of the country”.

A rift developed between the two after Ahmadinejad explicitly advocated checks on Khamenei’s ultimate authority.

In 2018, in rare criticism directed at Khamenei, Ahmadinejad wrote to him calling for “free” elections.
