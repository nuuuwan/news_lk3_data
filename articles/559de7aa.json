  "original_body_lines": [
    "The citizenry vote for political leaders in the hope that \u2018this time\u2019 there will be change for the better; and the electorate is disappointed time and again",
    "Ah \u2013 yes, the old lie: that the hope of a nation resides in the chamber where chairs are thrown at critics and chillies are employed to evict policemen keen on restoring law and order.",
    "And a major reason for the electorate in general and political pundits in particular being so cynical about the assembly we unmindfully describe as being august is in both the character and performance of the legislators we elected \u2013 lest we forget, let us remember and chide ourselves!",
    "As a senior journalist observed in these columns not many moons ago: \u201cSri Lanka has chronically elected crooks, charlatans, the incompetent, the corrupt, and the utterly unrepentant of their litany of crimes.\u201d",
    "The same editorialist added that \u201cto add insult to injury, these aspirants still have the gumption to stand for public office as if their ambition for the House is for it to be in the order they say they want the Nation to be in\u201d.",
    "As other political analysts and electoral commentators have also observed, the citizenry vote for political leaders in the hope that \u2018this time\u2019 there will be change for the better; and the electorate is disappointed time and again.",
    "Although \u2018next time\u2019 round too, the voting population opts to invest their faith in the electoral system \u2013 to say nothing of essentially the same political leadership figures albeit with a few new faces \u2013 all over again.",
    "As a brace of Colombo University academics observe: \u201cThere is also a growing dissatisfaction with, and a lowering of trust in, the functioning of political parties. This has led to a paradoxical situation. People feel that the political parties are essential to the functioning of democracy but do not seem to trust them for making democracy work...\u201d",
    "What price change, then? Well, for starters, \u2018the past is prologue\u2019. The adrenaline of one election result tends to flow in voters\u2019 veins. Especially in an electorate where citizens suspect that their politicos are losers en masse, but are always on the lookout for a dark horse of better breeding to back. A sitting president now might recall for the benefit of his coalition that yearns for an NPP landslide to capture the legislature his words on the campaign trail of many studied and strategic years.",
    "Then \u2018AKD\u2019 expressed the hope that following his putative presidential victory, parliament \u2013 nay, a people grown weary of the lot of them sitting there in the lap of luxury and lacklustre lawmaking tainted by lacunae in personal probity \u2013 would be fully relieved of two-thirds of MPs in the House.",
    "However where this deluge of votes would come from could be a moot point in a polity traditionally cautious about granting newcomers the golden sceptre of sovereign power. However willing electorates may have been in the past to bow before benevolent tyrants, political messiahs and saviours of the nation from the enemy at the gate \u2013 we have learned our lessons the hard way about trusting in \u2018the Great Man theory\u2019 of political leadership.",
    "Of course, Anura Kumara Dissanayake is charismatic in his way without being populist and authoritative sans a hint of autocracy yet. But it is his humility in accepting that even sweepingly elected presidents have feet of clay and need to rely on expert advice, savvy counsellors and a professional bureaucracy that may spare him the punishment for the hubris that nemesis extracted on his predecessors. I suspect though that although the JVP-led NPP is counting on AKD\u2019s shrewd positioning of himself as the man of the people who senses their pain and more than empathises is not going to be sufficient to grant the Left-leaning (at best), Marxist-Leninist (at worst) or socialist (being neutral) camp the flood it seeks.",
    "There is a \u2018still more excellent way\u2019. And that may be for the president with the potential to sweep the Augean stables of government clean of the stain and stench of corruption to have to yoke his executive oxen to a legislative team comprising a myriad of more experienced ploughing engines. Of course, only recently having inherited the mantle, it would be a pity if AKD comes to be hamstrung by one of \u2018the usual suspects\u2019 as his prime minister.",
    "This is not a plea for the redoubtable Harini to become ensconced as PM. Stalwart though she may be, it might be to the detriment of a nation on the cusp of redeeming itself from more than sovereign debt default to have a brace of socialists at best at the helm of the state. However incorruptible the JVP may have been while in office post its reformation from militancy to achieve its ends, and no matter that the NPP has in its rank some stellar (albeit untested) professionals and intellectuals, the ship of state may founder in the choppy waters of enforced economic performance sailing an IMF keel if the rudder doesn\u2019t come under steadier control than \u201cwe didn\u2019t bankrupt the country\u201d as a mantra to ward off charges of",
    "Not to teach a once starving mother and her sickly, unschooled child how to suck eggs...",
    "But wouldn\u2019t it be in Sri Lanka\u2019s best interests to have a visionary president being ably supported by a capable prime minister from another party with a proven track record?"
