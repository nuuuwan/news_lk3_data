    "Western Province (North) Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Nishantha Soysa has been named Acting DIG Colombo on Monday after Udith Liyanage was arrested for allegedly trying to block the detention of his wife, who was among eight suspects held in connection with an alleged treasure-hunting incident in Anuradhapura. Liyanage was remanded until 1 September on accusations that he pressured local Police to release her.",
    "Soysa has previously said he was threatened with death by former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Thennakoon while Soysa, as DIG Matara, investigated a shooting at a Weligama hotel. Thennakoon is accused of orchestrating that incident, which involved officers from the Colombo Crime Division (CCD), Weligama Police, and the Special Task Force, and left one CCD officer dead and another injured.",
    "Thennakoon was arrested earlier this month by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) over the May 2022 assault on \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 demonstrators at Colombo\u2019s Galle Face Green. Prosecutors told the Court he had instructed officers not to intervene as armed groups attacked unarmed protesters. He was ordered to be held until 27 August.",
    "Separately, lawmakers voted 177-0, with one abstention, to remove Thennakoon from his post. It was the first time Parliament had dismissed a sitting Police Chief. A three-member inquiry committee found him guilty of 19 of 23 charges, including abuse of power and misuse of authority. The resolution was passed after a five-hour debate and required an absolute majority under the Removal of Officers (Procedure) Act."
