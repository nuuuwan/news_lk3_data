    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman stated that the National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB) faced critical challenges, and the increase in water tariff was necessary to solve those challenges and ensure that all Sri Lankans would continue to have access to clean drinking water.",
    "The President's Media Division said that the increase was driven by several factors, including the surge in electricity tariffs, which contribute significantly to the cost of water production.",
    "Additionally, the burden of debt (due to past capital expenditure to expand water infrastructure), compounded by currency depreciation and interest rate hikes, together with the exponential increase in the cost of raw materials required to treat water, added to the financial strain on the NWSDB, he said.",
    "The minister expressed these views on Tuesday (18) during a press conference themed \u2018Collective Path to a Stable Country\u2019 held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC).",
