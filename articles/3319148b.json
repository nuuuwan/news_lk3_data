    "The members of the Essential Food Commodities and Traders Association yesterday raised concerns with Trade Minister Nalin Fernando about alleged frauds in getting approval by the Agriculture Ministry authorities to import items such as green gram, black gram, Kurakkan, maize and cowpea, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "Sri Lanka imposed a ban on imports earlier in a move to boost local cultivation of these food crops. Later, the ban was lifted allowing such imports into the country subjected to a levy of Rs.300 a kilo and approval from the Agriculture Ministry. President Ranil Wickremesinghe issued the gazette notification in this regard on February 19, 2024. However, an informed source said that obtaining approval from the Ministry for import permits had become fraudulent.",
    "\u201cIn an open market economy, it is natural to have fraud when imports are allowed under licensing procedures. These items are consumed by ordinary people. If we are allowed to import, these items will cost less than Rs.300 a kilo,\u201d the source said.",
    "According to the source, these items are also smuggled into the country denying the government revenue in terms of taxes.",
    "The demand for items such as green gram and black gram normally surges during the April New Year time because people use them to prepare sweetmeats and other food items."
