The main opposition has also slammed the unsolicited deal with VFS Global, a private contractor, as being bigger than a central bank linked bondscam in 2015.

“This is three or four times bigger than the bondscam,” opposition legislator Rauff Hakeem told parliament.

“I am bringing to the attention of this house this massive fraud (visharler wanchawak).

The deal came despite procurement requirements and anti-corruption roadmap required in an International Monetary Fund deal, following a ‘governance diagnostic assessment’.

“Having pledged all those new measures, and agreed to the IMF conditions, what does the government do?,” Hakeem asked in parliament.

The votes from the Tamil and Muslim communities may determine who the 2024 Presidential hustings victor is likely to be

This is the fourth article in a series focusing on Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his evolving strategy to contest the forthcoming 2024 Presidential Elections. In a political climate where deliberate attempts are being made to mislead people about Wickremesinghe’s Presidential Election plans and prospects, the objective of this series is to analyse in detail the  game plan and stratagems adopted by Wickremesinghe to face the 2024 Presidential hustings. Since Wickremesinghe is the incumbent President, priority is being given to him. However, after this series is concluded, I do intend to write about other presidential aspirants and their election campaigns also in the future.

In a situation where the Sinhala vote is trifurcated, the Tamil and Muslim votes, if delivered en bloc, may determine who the 2024 Presidential hustings victor is likely to be

### Israel has lost its moral compass and conscience

A former IDF soldier, interviewed on another channel, admits that some of the IDF actions he witnessed in Gaza could amount to war crimes.

Most Israelis simply do not care about what happens to Arabs and Palestinians

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reflects this cynical insularity of the Israeli public

Protests against Israeli excesses in conducting its war against Hamas in Gaza are widening in scope daily. This is not a war against Hamas; it’s a total war against the Palestinians designed to drive them out of ‘Greater Israel.’

These protests are almost exclusively in the West. It isn’t that the rest of the world is deaf and blind to what’s going on. But this is a Western problem, because of the West’s troubled historical relationships with the Jews, culminating in a great deal of sympathy for Israel after its creation (essentially a Western creation because of British Middle Eastern politics after WWII).

Oh dear, oh dear, a British citizen and non-Sri Lankan, MP Diana (not to be mistaken for Britain’s Princess Diana) has been unseated as a Member of our Parliament. O tempora, o mores we are once again being made the laughing stock of the world. A British citizen is not only a member of our Parliament, she is also a State Minister of this country.

The 60-year-old was (according to media reports) appointed a National List MP by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in return for the transferring of control of the Ape Jathika Peramuna (AJP) to the SJB.

Ever-popular past Commissioner of Elections Mahinda Deshapriya -respected for his nonpartisan rulings during election controversies- and an expert on election practices, speaking to this newspaper days ago said: “Sri Lankan law only prevents a non-citizen from becoming a Member of Parliament, to contest an election, while the law also prohibits a non-citizen to vote in an election...”.

Indian High Commissioner Santos Jha, in an interview with a select group of journalists, discusses the current status of bilateral ties and the future direction particularly with emphasis on connectivity.

Q  It has been a little over four months since you assumed duties as High Commissioner here. What are your initial impressions?

Coming to Sri Lanka as India’s High Commissioner was in some way a homecoming for me - in a role with greater responsibility. I was here from 2007-10 as Counsellor. Sri Lanka has always been close to my heart with many memories and several friends who will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Since December, I’ve had an action-packed 4-4.5 months. I’ve travelled the length and breadth of the country, met people across spheres - political, business, media, academia and so on - and everywhere I have experienced a sense of filial warmth.

His journey described in his book *”Asuwe Parapuren Sannaddawa”* speaks of his unwavering determination and dedication to his ideals.  Although I am sad that I missed the book launch, I am proud to know that our 83 logo was represented there, along with notable figures like Keerthi, Panduka and Malinda Seneviratne, who started his  political journey with Bandula and Patali  Champika Ranawaka .

### Some ministers seem determined to promote immorality through Diana Gamage’s programs

Colombo, May 12 (Daily Mirror) - It is clear that some Ministers seem determined to promote immorality and erode morality by perpetuating the illegal and immoral programmes initiated by former State Minister Diana Gamage, Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said.

Addressing the media, the thera said that Diana Gamage does not seem to have done anything for the country.

"The only thing that was done was that she raised her voice about the promotion of ganja and the promotion of immorality," he said.

The conspiratorial act she tried to do by developing immorality in the country, destroying morals and showing the illusion of economic development has now stopped due to the court decision. But some Ministers want to continue those programmes, he added.

According to the court decision, the role of Diana Gama has been rejected. That character does not suit social leadership at all. Finally, since she is not a Sri Lankan, she has no right to engage in politics in this country, the thera said.

Economic growth and national security are complementary to each other

When States fail to observe the Rule of Law and maintain the Law and Order, markets will start disintegrating themselves leading to a collapse of the same. Collapsed markets will stunt economic growth and stunted growth, as we have explained earlier, will reduce national security. Consequently, the resources spent on national security is not a waste but an essential cost to ensure the smooth operation of all the needed economic activities. Hence, no nation should compromise the national security on the ground of saving resources. It will cause the nations to sacrifice all their gains on all the economic fronts

The desperation in western capitals is more than palpable. The looming defeat in Ukraine – the fulcrum of Washington’s strategy to dominate Eurasia – has all but sealed the fate of the Neo-Conservatives’ Project for the New American Century to bring about a virtually endless global US domination. The rise of China, a resurgent Russia and the emerging BRICS are trashing NeoCon Francis Y. Fukuyama’s absurd ahistorical notion. Following the collapse of the USSR, he imagined an irrational hegemony of almost endless universal capitalist Liberal-Democracy, centred in the US, as the epitome of human political evolution in his “The End of History and the Last Man”.

*2024-05-12 19:48:14* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/reflections-on-the-life-achievements-of-dr-n-ethirveerasingam-an-exceptional-tamil-hailed-from-sri-lanka/) · `en`

The Global Tamil Forum (GTF) is deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam, affectionately known to colleagues as Ethir, on 18 April 2024 in the USA. He was 89 years old. We express our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends and the many whose lives were enriched by his selfless actions.

Ethir was one of the exceptional individuals to hail from Jaffna, indeed Sri Lanka, in the last century. With his multi-faceted interests and accomplishments – whether in sports, academics, politics, or social services – he rose to the top making his mark against many odds while maintaining his down-to-earth nature, humbleness, and humanity. He identified with the sufferings of the Tamil people and contributed to their economic, social, and political wellbeing with an unwavering passion that set an exceptional precedent.
