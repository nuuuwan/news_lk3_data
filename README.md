With Israel’s ongoing genocidal assault on Gaza, there is indeed an even more pervasive sense that foreign policy can no longer be separated from domestic politics, as Western protestors have made clear

Recently, the Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman wrote a piece titled “America Breaks Global Rules as It Defends the Free World.” He argued that the collective West must revamp the way it understands its project, not as an attempt to defend a ‘rules-based’ international order but rather the ‘free world’. The distinction is telling.

### Are we ready for the parate party to come to an end?

This is a kind reminder for us in the industry to start getting ready now itself, and start negotiating with banks

We know very well that for the last four years the construction industry has been suffering due to delayed/non-payments, stoppage of projects, high interest rates, etc. So, many of us perished. Banks and contractors became enemies, with banks making extreme decisions such as seizing assets, with no relief. Parate became a very attractive idea for us.

However, the GoSL and Central Bank directed banks to provide relief to industries like construction, leisure and agriculture and become flexible. So banks established separate units specifically for restructuring non-performing loans (NPL) because banks were also suffering from abnormal NPLs, which threatened their stability. Thus under the Central Bank guidance, many banks made case-by-case analyses and restructured NPLs.

Sri Lanka being called upon by Adani to pay about $ 1,200 million extra over the next 20 years, requires more explanation than quoting tweets

I write with reference to the article in Daily FT of 7 June 2024, titled “Adani sets the record straight” (https://www.ft.lk/front-page/Adani-sets-record-straight-on-wind-power-project-in-Sri-Lanka/44-762766).

Adani would have thought Sri Lanka has no energy economists or power system engineers, or would have wrongly assumed that all Sri Lankan professionals were as mediocre as the politicians or the handful of administrators and engineers in the power sector and its two regulatory institutions they directly deal with.

The infusion of private capital and expertise presents a unique opportunity to address longstanding issues and set the airline on a path to sustainable growth

The Sri Lankan Government is considering a transformative move by privatising SriLankan Airlines, the nation’s beleaguered flag carrier.

This analytical piece explores the potential outcomes of privatisation, the possible benefits, and the strategic roadmap that could be implemented by new private management.

The Coconut Development Authority (CDA) announced yesterday that there is no justifiable reason for the recent spike in coconut oil prices in the market.

CDA Chairman Prof. Roshan Perera citing an analysis of current market conditions, stated that there have been no recent tax increases on imported coconut oil.

He revealed that as of May this year, 42,000 tons of coconut oil have been imported into Sri Lanka, marking a twofold increase compared to the previous year.

“The significant increase in coconut oil imports ensures that there is sufficient supply to meet the country’s consumption needs. Therefore, any increase in the price of coconut oil is unjustifiable and unacceptable,” the Chairman said.

The announcement follows public outcry and claims from various consumer and industry groups about the unfair rise in coconut oil prices, which has contributed to the soaring cost of living.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament raised a point of order that the Supreme Court determination on Gender Equality Bill violates the powers of the House and a Parliamentary select Committee must be appointed to look into the matter.

“First and foremost the bill says, what the national policy on gender equality and empowerment of women is referred to in this bill. At the least it’s hard to find out. It’s not specific as there is no reference in the bill. There has been a national policy on women’s empowerment and gender equality since 2011. These are obligations of the Government under the Sustainable Development Goals 5 and a number of women’s conventions and agreements that we have signed.

The Supreme Court cannot in any way go and make any ruling on this. Then they are contravening and coming into our area.

Secondly, there’s a large number of cases which have been given on the question of equality and equality of women.

Addressing Parliament, Herath emphasised that while the President becomes a member of the House through a unique process, he is not part of the Legislature but rather the Executive. He argued that the President, as the leader of the Executive, should not comment on judicial determinations from within the Legislature, as it breaches established tradition. “The benefits accorded to the Legislature are being indirectly utilised by the Executive,” Herath asserted.

### Thailand to become first Southeast Asian nation to legalise same-sex marriage

*2024-06-19 04:24:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Thailand-to-become-first-Southeast-Asian-nation-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage/56-763215) · `en`

CNN – Thailand will become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage after the Kingdom’s Senate approved a Marriage Equality Bill on Tuesday, with supporters calling it a “monumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights.”

The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favour of passing the bill following a final reading, with 130 senators voting in favour. Only four members opposed the bill. The bill still requires endorsement from the King before marriage equality can become a reality in Thailand, but this process is considered a formality. The law will then come into effect 120 days after it is published in the Royal Gazette.

The result of the vote means that Thailand will become only the third place in Asia to allow for marriage equality after Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in 2019 and Nepal in 2023.

### Tax tax on high income earners

*2024-06-19 02:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186413) · `ta`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced a proposed rental tax targeting high-income individuals, excluding 90% of homeowners from its scope. He assured that this measure does not threaten the safety of homes for the majority. The focus is on wealthier individuals, including billionaires, indicating a targeted approach rather than a broad impact on ordinary income earners.

🟩

The first property earners will be released from the proposed rent line. This tax will be levied on those who earn more income. So you do not have to be afraid in a house, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

He said this in a briefing on the proposed rental tax on Tuesday (18) in Parliament.

As I am not in Parliament when the financial issues were discussed, I would like to inform parliament about the rental income tax.

There is a very high income limit. This is not applicable to 90 percent homes in the country. So you don't have to be afraid in a house. Your home is safe. Most people in this country don't have to be afraid of their homes

But we have to implement the wealth line. I know that united people's power is upset. I think the reason is that this line affects the billionaires with them.

The first property earners will be released from the proposed rent line. He said the tax would be levied on those who earn more income, not ordinary income.

In the tripartite democratic structure of our country, all three institutions, the Executive Officer, the Law and the Justice Department, have been restricted and the sharing of power among them..

Wimal Weerawansa criticized the High Court's decision on strengthening women's rights, calling it a "trick" due to its complexity. He also questioned the court's effectiveness, suggesting it might be closed if it continues to make such decisions.

🟩

Wimal Weerawansa, who accused the president of being a tricky challenge to court, said that if the High Court could challenge the High Court, it was not worth it.

Weerawansa said this while addressing the president's speech on Tuesday (18) in Parliament.

The president is bowling in a very sophisticated manner. The President's opinion is challenging the resolution issued by the High Court regarding the Bill to strengthen women as the first bowling.. It can be said to be a trick because of sophistication.

Next, he threw the controversy over the burial of the dead body of the Muslims during the Kovit period.

As well as threw a third bet on tax related to rental houses. The first of these is to challenge the court. He tricks the other balls.

Meanwhile. It is correct to strengthen biological women. But in that blanket it cannot allow the gender change business to accommodate. It is wrong to challenge the High Court resolution.
