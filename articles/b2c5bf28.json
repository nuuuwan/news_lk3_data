  "original_body_lines": [
    "Approves to double salary allocations from Rs. 354 m to Rs. 777 m",
    "Expansion plan increases staff from 489 to 967, establishes regional offices countrywide",
    "CoPF Chair MP Dr. Harsha de Silva urges phased funding tied to recruitment milestones to avoid inefficiencies",
    "CIABOC Director-General Ranga Dissanayake defends full allocation, citing legal mandate and December 2026 deadline",
    "CoPF calls for stronger oversight, financial autonomy for CIABOC and judicially benchmarked salaries",
    "\u200bThe Parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) has approved the 2026 Budget estimates for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), despite concerns over a steep increase in salary allocations.",
    "During last Thursday\u2019s (11) meeting, chaired by CoPF Chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva, members questioned the rationale for nearly doubling the CIABOC\u2019s budgeted salaries from Rs. 354 million to Rs. 777 million. The increase reflected plans to expand staffing from 489 to 967 and to establish regional offices nationwide.",
    "Dr. de Silva cautioned against committing large sums upfront without matching operational readiness. \u201cAllocations should reflect real operational needs, not just projected growth,\u201d he said, suggesting that phased funding tied to recruitment milestones would be more efficient.",
    "Treasury officials supported this approach, warning that releasing the full allocation at once risked inefficiencies and the possibility of unused funds being returned.",
    "CIABOC Director-General Ranga Dissanayake defended the request, stressing that the expansion is essential to implement under Section 26 of the Anti-Corruption Act.",
    "He explained new staff must be recruited and trained so the Commission is fully operational by December 2026, in line with its Strategic Action Plan.",
    "Dissanayake also noted that existing Police officers attached to the Vommission cannot legally assume duties till formally appointed under the new framework.",
    "Despite these concerns, the CoPF granted approval for the proposed Budget, while also highlighting the need for stronger oversight of disbursements.",
    "Dr. de Silva further argued that financial autonomy should be extended to key institutions such as the CIABOC and the Auditor General\u2019s Department, similar to the Central Bank, to safeguard independence from political interference.",
    "He said the Committee would formally inform the President, who also serves as Finance Minister, of this recommendation.",
    "The Committee also addressed remuneration, with Dr. de Silva stating that the salaries of the CIABOC\u2019s Chairman, Director-General, and members should be aligned with those of the President of the Court of Appeal, and automatically adjusted as those judicial salaries are revised.",
    "MPs Ravi Karunanayake, Harshana Rajakaruna, Dr. Kaushalya Ariyaratne, Wijesiri Basnayake, Sunil Rajapaksha, Nimal Palihena, Thilina Samarakoon, and Nishantha Jayaweera participated in the meeting."
