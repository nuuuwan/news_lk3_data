Sri Lanka’s economy is projected to see moderate growth of 2.2% in 2024, showing signs of stabilization, following the severe economic downturn of 2022. But, the country still faces elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labor market concerns, says the World Bank’s latest bi-annual update.

Released today, the Sri Lanka Development Update, Bridge to Recovery, highlights that Sri Lanka saw declining inflation, higher revenues on the back of the implementation of new fiscal policies, and a current account surplus for the first time in nearly five decades, buoyed by increased remittances and a rebound in tourism.

However, poverty rates continued to rise for the fourth year in a row, with an estimated 25.9% of Sri Lankans living below the poverty line in 2023. Labor force participation has also seen a decline, particularly among women and in urban areas, exacerbated by the closure of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

"Therefore, the requirement of importing vehicles essential for enhancing the industry has been recognized considering the contribution to the tourist industry within the economic revival process of Sri Lanka.

Following the economic crisis, a senior industry representative said the use of Sri Lanka's monthly milk, which has been reduced by almost half of the price rise, has seen a slight increase.

Consumption of 7,000 metric tonnes of milk powder in the last three years has declined to 3,000 metric tonnes in the last three years due to the rise in US dollar prices, milk prices in the world market and government tax hikes.

However, with the slightest improvement of economic conditions, more than one million families have returned to the market, although the overall consumption is less than the previous level, said Ravi Jayawardena, CEO of the Maliban Group.

He shared his views while addressing a group debate by the Kabital Alliance Limited, which examines the current trends of Sri Lankan consumer spending and the post -crisis view.

According to Jayawardena, the domestic dairy industry will take at least two years to return to Kovit's previous consumption.
