    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that through the \u201cUrumaya\u201d program, the government\u2019s intent is to express gratitude to farmers who have supplied rice to the country despite not owning the land.",
    "He also emphasized that the current government aims to provide both knowledge and rights to the people, akin to how C.W.W. Kannangara promoted education through free schooling.",
    "President Wickremesinghe made these remarks at a ceremony held this morning (17) at the Embilipitiya Mahaweli Stadium. The event was for the awarding of freehold land deeds to 1,524 out of 45,253 eligible settlers in the Mahaweli Walawa region as part of the national \u201cUrumaya\u201d program to provide 02 million freehold land deeds. The President participated in the Urumaya ceremony and the symbolic distribution of land deeds.",
    "\u201cI have instructed all relevant authorities to issue freehold land deeds within the next two months. District Secretaries, the Land Commissioner General, and the surveyors\u2019 office will collaborate to expedite the delivery of these land deeds. Local government officials will also contribute, ensuring the efficient implementation of this program.",
    "For the past 75 years, people have been given land without freehold rights. The \u201cUrumaya\u201d program was introduced to grant these legal land rights, marking a significant change. During difficult times, everyone shared the burden. Now that the economy is improving, everyone should benefit, especially the farmers who provide rice to the nation.",
    "In addition to granting free land rights to farmers, we are working to provide housing rights to 250,000 low-income residents living in the Colombo flats. This program aims to ensure that every citizen owns land, a house, or a vehicle. Just as C.W.W. Kannangara provided free education in 1944, this government is committed to providing both knowledge and rights to the people.",
    "Farmers in this area have been growing crops and harvesting without owning the land, preventing them from obtaining bank loans. This problem has persisted for three generations. To address this, the government implemented the \u201cUrumaya\u201d program to grant them land rights as a gesture of gratitude to the farmers of this country.",
    "When we assumed office, the country was in crisis, with no electricity, and a lack of fuel and medicines. To recover, we prioritized increasing production. Paddy production rose during the 2022 and 2023 seasons, thanks to the farmers\u2019 efforts. The government provided necessary support, including fertilizer.",
    "Our support for farmers goes beyond land ownership. To eliminate rural poverty, we must carry out an agricultural revolution. The agricultural modernization program is designed to increase farmers\u2019 incomes alongside land ownership.",
    "We urge everyone to participate in this program, which will begin next year with prompt funding. The government also plans to modernize and restructure the agricultural service centers.",
    "I extend my gratitude to the farmers of this area for their service over three generations without land rights.\u201d",
    "\u201cToday marks the historic achievement of receiving land rights after generations of deprivation. The suffering endured without these rights has been immense. Today, the President has taken decisive steps to fulfill the fundamental needs of our people: land, housing, and food.",
    "The joy experienced by families through owning freehold land is invaluable. This initiative, led by the President, is seen as a transformative revolution aimed at empowering and bringing immense joy to your families.",
    "A significant revolution is underway as 02 million families are granted freehold deeds, providing them with long-awaited land rights.",
    "In addition, the President aims to launch the agricultural modernization program. Equipping farmers with modern technology cannot be achieved alone, which is why the initiative to provide modern agricultural equipment has begun with support from the Asian Development Bank.",
    "Development initiatives in schools, hospitals, and infrastructure across the country are progressing steadily. Today, under the President\u2019s astute leadership, the nation has achieved remarkable development. We cannot afford further experimentation; therefore, your support is crucial for sustaining this program.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere was a time in our country when disputes over land led to tragic conflicts, even within families. Land issues remain a significant cause of police complaints and public grievances that we, as public representatives, frequently encounter.",
    "Today, you have received a freehold title deed, marking President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s largest privatization effort. He is committed to allocating millions of acres of land to the people. Despite the country facing immense challenges, the President stepped up to lead, yet some criticize instead of offering support. Under his leadership, farmers protesting were returned to their fields, ensuring our nation\u2019s rice needs were met locally, not imported.\u201d",
    "State Minister of Plantation Industries and Mahaweli Development Lohan Ratwatte,",
    "\u201cThe Mahaweli Authority oversees a significant portion of the country\u2019s land, and under President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s vision, numerous families have received freehold land deeds through the Urumaya program. President Wickremesinghe has steered the country with a well-structured program, rescuing it from dire circumstances.",
    "As various candidates vie for the presidency and social media buzzes with campaigns, it is crucial that the President\u2019s initiatives continue for another five years. It is imperative for all of us to prioritize the nation\u2019s interests and collaborate towards its progress. Failure to do so risks plunging the country into turmoil once more.",
    "The event was attended by the Maha Sangha of the province, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa, State Ministers Janaka Wakkambura, Shashindra Rajapaksa, Jagath Pushpakumara, Lohan Ratwatte, Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Chairman Kanchana Jayaratne, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation Saman Darshana Padikorala, Mahaweli Authority Director General M. L. D. C. M. Abeywardena, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Chandra Herath and numerous government officials and policymakers.\u201d"
