Sri Lanka is close to finalising a debt treatment plan with India and the Paris Club, sources familiar with the negotiations said, pointing to a likely moratorium of up to six years and a reduced interest rate during the repayment period.

“The discussions are at an advanced stage. A formal agreement on the terms can be expected very soon,” the Colombo-based source told The Hindu on Thursday, after a recent discussion among members of the Official Creditor Committee [OCC].

As many as 17 countries that have extended loans to Sri Lanka formed the Committee last year for ease of debt restructuring negotiations. China opted to stay out of the platform, but has been attending its meetings as an observer. Meanwhile, Colombo has repeatedly assured the OCC that it would negotiate repayment of Chinese loans on comparable terms.

Nirmalanathan argued against police anarchy, while Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse defended the decision, stating the issue was resolved within two hours.

🟩

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan questioned whether the police could hold the Buddhist Poson Day in the daytime, as the police say to hold the Hindus Shivaratri in the daytime.

He said this while addressing the third day debate on the no -confidence motion against the Speaker held in Parliament on Thursday (21).

The police refused permission even when the court had allowed the Hindus to observe Shivaratri at the Adilingeswarar Temple at the Attukkunnarimalai.

If the rituals are damaged, the police must have seen the damage to them without being damaged if they are damaged.. As well as the Shiva Temple. So the Hindus will not damage their temple.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, who intervened, said that when you brought this issue to Parliament, we settled within two hours.

So why are you talking about again.

Charles Nirmalanathan, who got up again, said that such a police anarchy should not happen again.
