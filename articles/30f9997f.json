    "It appears that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition and SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and JVP/NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake are taking part in a promise-making competition, as it were, in the North and the East in a desperate bid to secure the support of the TNA and other Tamil political parties for their presidential election campaigns. They have been stumping those parts of the country aggressively during the past few weeks.",
    "Besides offering to implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution fully and enhance devolution, Wickremesinghe and Premadasa are providing material assistance to the public in the North and the East obviously with an eye to the upcoming presidential election. The President has been allocating public funds with a generous hand for developing the North and the East as if he were spending his own money for that purpose. Dissanayake has sought to trump his opponents\u2019 bid to woo the TNA and others; in what could be considered a major about-turn on the part of the JVP, he has reportedly offered to go beyond the 13th Amendment in resolving ethnic issues in case of his victory in the upcoming presidential race. He has provided grist to his political opponents\u2019 mill.",
    "The TNA has been wise enough to urge the \u2018promising\u2019 presidential candidates from the South to sound the majority community out on their pledges. It has adopted a pragmatic approach; devolution is a contentious issue, and political solutions based thereon require the backing of the majority community to reach fruition. Southern politicians have earned notoriety for reneging on their election promises to all Sri Lankans, and it is only natural that nobody takes them seriously.",
    "There has been a mixed reaction to Dissanayake\u2019s U-turn on devolution. The JVP plunged the country into a protracted bloodbath in a bid to scuttle the Indo-Lanka Accord, the 13th Amendment, and the establishment of the Provincial Councils (PCs) in the late 1980s. It brutally gunned down those who tirelessly campaigned for evolving a political solution to the ethnic problem through devolution. They included Vijaya Kumaratunga and many other leftists. The sea change in the JVP\u2019s policy has been welcomed by the proponents of devolution, as a positive change, but the JVP/NPP will have its work cut out to convince the public that it is not driven by Machiavellian duplicity.",
    "Interestingly, in 2000, the UNP and the JVP jointly torpedoed President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga\u2019s constitutional reforms Bill aimed at establishing regional councils besides restoring the parliamentary system of government. Kumaratunga said the UNP had pledged its support for the Bill. The Opposition MPs literally set the Bill on fire in the House, claiming that Kumaratunga had inserted some transitional provisions without their consent. If she had done so, they could have sorted out that issue through talks without burning the Bill. It was clear that they shot down her constitutional reform package for political expediency.\u2008Now, they are offering to devolve more powers!",
    "It is a supreme irony that President Wickremesinghe, Premadasa and Dissanayake have, at discussions with the TNA, undertaken to hold the much-delayed PC polls. All of them were instrumental in postponing the PC elections in 2017. The UNP with Premadasa as its Deputy Leader at the time, the JVP and the TNA together passed an amendment to the PC Elections Act to put off the PC polls indefinitely. The PCs have been functioning without elected representatives for the last seven years or so. They are currently under Provincial Governors appointed by the President, who also controls the dissolved local government institutions through the Governors. Thus, he has all three tiers of government\u2014Parliament, the PC and the local government authorities under him. He is running a one-man show. Shouldn\u2019t the UNP, its offshoot, the SJB, the JVP and the TNA apologise to the people for what they have done to the PCs?",
    "The JVP finds itself in a contradiction, a huge one at that. Having played a pivotal role in mobilising the masses to oust popularly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over his economic crimes, which sent the country reeling, the JVP, which has committed far worse crimes, such as countless murders and destruction of public assets worth billions of rupees, in the name of an ill-conceived mission to defeat Indian expansionism, abort the 13th Amendment and sabotage the PC system, is now asking the public to buy into its untested claims and elect its leader as the President! This, it is doing without ever so much as tendering an apology for its criminal past!",
