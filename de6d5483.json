    "In the retail market top seven companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; Melstacope Rs 77.8 million (840,000 shares traded), Associated Motor Finance Rs 68 million (3.3 million shares traded), JKH Rs 56.1 million (296,000 shares traded), Chevron Lubricants Rs 36.1 million (381,000 shares traded), Expolanka Holdings Rs 31.5 million (222,000 shares traded), Lanka IOC Rs 28.9 million (277,000 shares traded) and Alumex Rs 28.11 million (3.3 million shares traded).
