    "The opposition handed over a no-confidence motion against Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena yesterday.",
    "The motion signed by 45 MPs in the opposition was handed over by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara. SJB MPs Nalin Bandara and Dr. Kavinda Jayawardena was also present at the event.\u00a0 \u00a0The SJB began collecting signatures for the motion on Thursday. Last week, the opposition declared its intention to bring forth a no-confidence motion against Rambukwella following a series of controversial patient fatalities in state hospitals and alarming allegations concerning the importation of substandard drugs. The SJB has levelled accusations against Rambukwella, claiming that he has failed to address the critical shortage of medicines and medical supplies in Sri Lanka. Additionally, they have alleged that several deaths in recent times are attributed to the administration of substandard medication at various hospitals across the country."
