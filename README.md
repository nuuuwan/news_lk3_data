### Walter Stace in British Ceylon, 1910-1932

*2024-11-17 01:25:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/walter-stace-in-british-ceylon-1910-1932/) · `en`

Walter T. Stace was a British citizen born in 1886 and educated in private schools in Wales and Scotland before completing his undergraduate degree at Trinity College, Dublin. He was therefore of middle-upper class background. His philosophical leanings did not deter him from signing up for the Colonial Service. He was sent to Ceylon – reaching the island with his wife … and being posted to the town of Galle in 1910.

He wrote his autobiography at some point and the Sri Lankan chapters have been printed as a book entitled FOOTPRINTS ON WATER under the editorial direction of Bernd Pflug by the Sailfish firm in Colombo marketed by the Perera Hussein Publishing House in a 218-page booklet bearing the ISBN 978-624-5993-02=4

*2024-11-17 01:06:41* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/on-experts-expertise-expatriates/) · `en`

The inability of Sri Lankan citizens, academics and scholars included, to engage properly with critical issues on time presents a risk to society. It also presents a challenge to the new GOSL. I’ve said this before – sadly, the country ended up in its current, precarious state due to a financial crisis brought about by wicked and corrupt politicians, some of whom have amassed vast wealth in just 15 years after the terrorist war ended. But corrupt and stupid politicians didn’t do it alone.

### An Open Letter To President AKD: Make Religious Freedom Or Belief A priority

*2024-11-17 00:58:04* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/an-open-letter-to-president-akd-make-religious-freedom-or-belief-a-priority/) · `en`

Dear Mr. President, I write to you not only as a concerned citizen but as someone who is deeply invested in the international standing and reputation of Sri Lanka. Just a few months ago, I was among those who voiced their skepticism about your ascent to the presidency, questioning whether your promises of eradicating corruption and prioritizing the welfare of the people would blossom into genuine change.

Yet, today, I reach across the chasm of our political differences to appeal to a shared hope: a united and harmonious Sri Lanka – ensuring religious freedom or belief to all. As you have articulated in your speeches, Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads—we either repeat divisive politics or create an opportunity to build a nation that values the rich diversity of its people.

### The Downplaying of Our National Languages: the Advantages of English

*2024-11-16 23:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-downplaying-of-our-national-languages-the-advantages-of-english/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Falling Leaves, an anthology of autobiographical stories by LC Arulpragasam)

I recognized the advantages that we had inherited from the British through our knowledge of the English language. But I also began to realize that we had so exalted our knowledge of English that it had been at the expense of the neglect of our national languages. For example in India, although the members of its upper/middle classes spoke impeccable English, they conversed at home in Hindi or in their regional languages, whereas in Ceylon the middle class usually spoke English at home, with the local languages being reserved only for the servants.

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

It was also during this period that I received a rather curt letter from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue stating that his department had received information that I had come in for a legacy of a house and several acres of land. He directed that this be declared forthwith so that the department could assess the tax and any penalties to be paid. This was a bit too much. I was extremely busy and had no time for tomfoolery. I called the stenographer and dictated the following reply:-

I was delighted to receive your letter dated …. I shall be most grateful if you could please provide me very early, all particulars regarding this legacy, with addresses, etc., so that I may be enabled to enter upon it without any delay. I am anxiously looking forward to this. Please rest assured that I would be prepared to gladly pay any tax you may levy on it and any penalties you may decide on.

Ven. Seelarathana Thero also criticized the National People’s Power (NPP) party, accusing them of hypocrisy. He claimed that despite their campaign emphasis on seeking votes for the party rather than individual candidates, internal disputes over preferential votes have surfaced.

“I neither believe nor accept this preference vote results. It’s astonishing how some individuals have seen their preferential votes skyrocket from one lakh to six, seven, or even eight lakhs. Where did such numbers come from?”, he questioned.

Last week’s presidential election was doubtless one of the most consequential in US history. Though the outcome was not predictable – most polls showed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump – with the benefit of hindsight one can say that the Democrats should have seen it coming. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be a slew of analyses and diagnoses claiming to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. Yet as Sri Lankan political analyst Rajni Gamage rightly put it in a recent tweet, such diagnoses are themselves problematic, and point to the biases of those making them.

His long hair partially covered his face, which had a few pimples. I thought he was in his early twenties. He wore a salwar kameez and a colourful Sindhi cap decorated with beads and threads. He looked like a polio victim as his right leg was about two inches shorter than his left leg.

For too long, they have been trapped within certain limitations, but now that those barriers have been broken, we can expect a new wave of leadership emerging from the hill country and from other districts,” she added.
