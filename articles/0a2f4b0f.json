    "Protesters rallied Saturday in the Thai capital to demand the resignation of court-suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and in support of the armed forces following a violent border dispute with Cambodia that killed more than three dozen people and displaced over 260,000.",
    "Gathered at Bangkok\u2019s Victory Monument despite soaring temperatures, many sang patriotic songs and listened to speeches denouncing Paetongtarn and her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister, and voiced their backing of the country\u2019s army, which has always retained substantial power in the Southeast Asian country. Police said there were about 2,000 protesters by mid-afternoon, though more were expected to join as the temperature cooled.",
    "Some locals accuse Paetongtarn and her family of allowing the conflict \u2014 which stretches back decades with both sides claiming pockets of land near the shared border \u2014 to escalate due to their close ties with Cambodia\u2019s former prime minister, Hun Sen.",
    "A court suspended Paetongtarn last month after Hun Sen, still a major power in his own country, leaked a phone call in which she she called him \u201cuncle\u201d and appeared to denigrate a Thai general, angering many.",
    "\u201cUng Ing, you need to leave,\u201d said one well-known conservative columnist and protester, Jittakorn Bussaba, using Paetongtarn \u2018s nickname. \u201cBecause there\u2019s blood on your hands. People have died because of you,\u201d he said from the stage to general applause.",
    "\u201c\u2060Ung Ing has damaged the country. Everyone needs to help out,\u201d said 58-year-old Ammorn Khunthong. \u201cThaksin and his family should not run or command this country anymore.\u201d",
    "There were many familiar faces from a conservative, pro-royalist group once known as the Yellow Shirts, longtime foes of Paetongtarn\u2019s father, who was toppled in a military coup in 2006. Thaksin, a billionaire tycoon, entered politics by founding his own political party and buying the loyalty of local political bosses nationwide. He was often accused of bullying critics and not separating his business dealings from those of the government.",
    "Yellow Shirts rallies also helped oust the elected government of Thaksin\u2019s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, in a 2014 coup.",
    "The army in Thailand plays a major role in politics and has staged 13 successful coups since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932."
