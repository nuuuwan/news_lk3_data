    "The Court of Appeal on Friday (Nov.24) yet again decided to postpone the further consideration of the case filed pertaining to the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee.",
    "Accordingly, the case is now fixed to be taken up for further consideration before the Appeals Court on November 27, making this the fourth consecutive time the matter was deferred.",
    "The petition, filed by SLC President Shammi Silva, was called before the Appeals Court bench comprising Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and D.N. Samarakoon this morning.",
    "This judge bench was named by Appeals Court president, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne after the previous bench recused themselves. Thus far, three Judges, including Justice Neil Iddawela, have withdrawn themselves from the consideration of the petition.",

    "The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President challenging the Sports Minister\u2019s move.",
    "Later, on November 13, Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order."
