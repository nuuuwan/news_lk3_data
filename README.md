### NPP’s Political Culture Change Project: A Path Forward For Sri Lanka?

Sri Lanka has long been a country grappling with political instability, entrenched corruption, and cyclical economic crises. In 2024, National People’s Power (NPP) emerged as a beacon of hope for many Sri Lankans seeking a new political paradigm. Representing a coalition of left-leaning political entities, academics, and civil society members, the NPP captured public attention by promising reforms and transparency, emphasizing a government accountable to the people. Amid record-high inflation of around 50% in 2022 and a significant GDP contraction of 7.8%, Sri Lankans sought leadership that could prioritize economic stability and integrity, marking a shift away from personality-driven politics. However, the question remains whether the NPP can truly transform the nation’s political culture and deliver a meaningful economic recovery.

On 23 October 2024, the American Embassy in Sri Lanka issued a statement restricting all embassy personnel from travelling to Arugam Bay, a popular beach town in southeastern Sri Lanka. One piece of information central to this designation of an escapist, surf-oriented, foreign-friendly, beach town as “high-risk” is the fact that Arugam Bay has recently witnessed a large influx of Israeli tourists. Although there was a brief dip in the number of Israeli tourists surfing, partying, digital working, or downward-dogging on the coast after 7 October 2023, these numbers have picked up, and, outside of peak season, Israelis are the largest demographic of holidaymakers in Arugam Bay.
