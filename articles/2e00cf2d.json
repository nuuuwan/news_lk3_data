    "Bollywood heartthrob Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s cancelled trip to Sri Lanka has certainly shattered the dreams of many Sri Lankans who were eagerly looking forward to catching a glimpse of their idol, on 2nd August, in Colombo.",
    "Yes, SRK is in the States but, according to reports, it has nothing to do with any current health issues, or injuries sustained on the set of \u2018King\u2019.",
    "Initially it was stated that he wasn\u2019t coming due to unforeseen and unavoidable personal reasons, beyond his control.",
    "According to NDTV (described as India\u2019s most trusted news broadcaster), and as reported in the \u2018Times of India\u2019, recent rumours of Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s injury on the set of \u2018King\u2019 and subsequent relocation plans are false.",
    "The report went on to say that while SRK has had past injuries and travels to the US for treatment, his recent trip in July is routine.",
    "They say he left for America in the second week of this month (July) and is due to return at the end of the month.",
    "Obviously, one would like to know why he chose July for his routine treatment and care in the States when he was scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on 2nd August!",
    "However, it\u2019s a fact that SRK\u2019s journey, especially in the film world, has been marked by a series of significant physical and medical struggles.",
    "During the shooting of \u2018Ra One\u2019, the actor suffered a shoulder injury but he ignored it and went on to shoot for Rohit Shetty\u2019s \u2018Chennai Express\u2019. His injury got aggravated as he tried to perform his own stunts. He also fractured his toe on the sets of the film.",
    "On the sets of the movie \u2018Happy New Year\u2019, the actor suffered a knee injury. He was shooting for a song when a door fell on him and he hurt his face and head. He was rushed to hospital immediately.",
    "During the promotions of \u2018Dilwale\u2019, SRK was suffering from a knee injury which occurred while shooting for \u2018Fan\u2019. However, due to back-to-back shoots for \u2018Raees\u2019 and \u2018Dilwale\u2019, he delayed his knee surgery.",
    "Months before the release of the movie, \u2018My Name Is Khan\u2019, SRK underwent a shoulder surgery. The causes of the injury were attributed to an old accident that occurred during the shooting of \u2018Dulha Mil Gaya\u2019, as well as a possible shoulder dislocation while filming a fight scene for \u2018Don 2\u2019.",
    "The actor, they say, has also had a long history of back problems, and has suffered from severe back pain that sometimes made it difficult for him to stand or walk \u2013 a prolapsed disc in his spine.",
    "After trying remedies, which made things worse, the actor underwent a major spinal surgery in 2003 to correct this. It was a critical operation, and the recovery process was long and challenging.",

    "Wonder how many of his fans are aware that their superstar suffered from depression in 2010?",
    "Shah Rukh Khan suffered from depression after his shoulder surgery in 2010 and, at that point in time, said: \u201cDue to the shoulder injury and the suffering, I had got into a depression mode but now I am out of it. I feel happy and boosted with energy. I feel so much healthier and refreshed from within.\u201d",
