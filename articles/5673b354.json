    "The Sunday Times on 19 May carried the Foreign Ministry\u2019s reactions on the OHCHR report on \u2018enforced disappearances\u2019 in Sri Lanka (https://www.sundaytimes.lk/240519/news/lanka-strongly-rejects-un-report-questions-its-mandate-and-timing-557860.html). It says Sri Lanka is rejecting the report.",
    "This may be one more in the long line of rejections since the days of Gotabaya Presidency.",
    "Interestingly, questions have been raised about the authority or mandate of the High Commissioner to issue such a report. But in their heady rush to reject the report, they may not have consulted important resolutions including the UNGA resolution establishing the post of High Commissioner.",
    "These resolutions particularly stress the importance of the role of the High Commissioner as the voice of humanity on gross or grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, how the High Commissioner should express that voice and what format or method should be followed is left open.",
    "So, the High Commissioner seems to have identified, pursuant to this authority or mandate, the topic of \u2018enforced disappearance\u2019 in view, perhaps, of the yet-to-be-accounted-for alleged incidents of enforced disappearance in Sri Lanka.",
    "When it comes to SL, sections of the international human rights community do not appear to be swayed by Sri Lanka\u2019s arguments about the allegations made, pertaining to isolated incidents of disappearance or killing.",
    "What remained Government\u2019s once-formidable, but now-threadbare defence in human rights forums calling alleged violations, \u201caberrations\u201d, not pattern, failed to hold water after 2009 (especially following Dayan J-led \u2018victory resolution\u2019 at UNHCHR).",
    "Since 2009, such incidents as well as other incidents reported to have occurred thereafter were all considered as stemming from a culture of human rights violations or as revealing a pattern of serious violations, not \u2018aberrations\u2019.\u00a0 According to this line of thinking, the culture of human rights violations is symbiotically linked to a \u2018culture of impunity\u2019 reportedly still prevalent in the country.\u00a0 It is clear therefore, that when one is convinced (however justifiable, is another matter) of the prevalence of a culture or a pattern as far as alleged violations of human rights are concerned, one cannot logically focus on the already-obsolete concept of \u201caberrations\u201d.",
    "It is perhaps from this conviction that the UNHRC\u2019s report, in highlighting the alleged practice of enforced disappearance, goes as far back as 1971. It thus begins with post-independent Sri Lanka\u2019s first reported incidents of \u2018enforced disappearance\u2019.",
    "On the question of why the High Commissioner has chosen to issue a report on \u2018enforced disappearance\u2019 in Sri Lanka, it may perhaps be that he has formed the opinion that a consistent thread running through the alleged culture or pattern of human rights in Sri Lanka, or in the alleged culture of impunity is \u2018enforced disappearance.\u2019",
    "He is not unaware that hundreds of women are still demanding to know the fate of \u2018missing\u2019 members of their families for many years. Maybe he has chosen to be their voice this time."
