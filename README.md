Kenyan senators have voted to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office despite his failure to testify at his impeachment trial after his lawyer said he had been taken to hospital.

In one of the most dramatic days in Kenya’s recent political history, Gachagua had been due to appear in the Senate after lunch to defend himself, a day after he had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges.

However, Gachagua, popularly known as Riggy G, did not show up and his lawyer requested a postponement saying his client was suffering from chest pains and was being treated by doctors at The Karen Hospital.

Senators chose to continue the trial without him, prompting the defence team to leave the chamber.

The senators’ refusal to delay proceedings until Saturday - as long as would have been legally allowed - shows how determined they were to get rid of Gachagua, several months after he fell out with President William Ruto.

There are a multitude of agencies running from President downwards to Provincial, District, Local Authority, Divisional Secretary and Grama Niladhari Division level

Before the Presidential election, there were ramifications, speculations and cautions expressed by several learned people who were not ready to adjust their mindset for a change. They casted doubts as to what a future AKD-led Government would do, if elected. The most repeated question was how would the Government find money to keep the pledges. The second question was how would the Government deal with the IMF. The third cynical question was how Thambuttegama Ranbanda’s Kolla would manage international affairs without competency in English.

As financial services become increasingly digital, so do the methods employed by cyber criminals and fraudsters.

These schemes exploit the public’s lack of awareness and in some cases, desperation during economic hardships. While the exact scale is difficult to gauge, the prevalence of such incidents in media paints a concerning picture. This has raised the need for financial institutions to step up their security measures and educate the public.

This article explores recent fraud incidents, the importance of user education, and how financial organisations can protect their customers while ensuring convenience and minimising service disruption.

Globally, cybercriminals are exploiting the popularity of social media to launch sophisticated scams.

### Eliminating Ethnic-Based Politics In Sri Lanka: A Path Toward National Unity

*2024-10-17 22:28:01* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/eliminating-ethnic-based-politics-in-sri-lanka-a-path-toward-national-unity/) · `en`

Sri Lanka, with its rich diversity of ethnicities, religions, and cultures, has long faced the challenge of balancing these identities in its political landscape. Ethnic-based politics, which has shaped much of the country’s history, continues to be a divisive force that hinders national unity, sustainable development, and long-term peace. Eliminating ethnic-based politics is essential for Sri Lanka’s progress toward a truly united, prosperous, and peaceful society.

Ethnic politics in Sri Lanka can be traced back to the colonial period, when the British promoted communal identities for administrative convenience. After independence in 1948, political parties began to align themselves along ethnic lines, leading to an entrenched system of division. The Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities were often pitted against one another as political elites manipulated ethnic tensions for electoral gains.

Targeting Dr. Harsha de Silva by senior SJB members began a couple of years ago when he started gaining recognition as a potential future leader. The brilliant economist faced criticism a few months ago after securing state funding for development work in Kotte.

During a TV chat show explaining the process, Harsha made the remark, “Mama Ambalangoda kollekk” (I am a man from Ambalangoda), which some within the party used to undermine him. Party members close to the leadership reportedly conspired to push him out of the Colombo district, seeking to move him to Galle’s nomination list, his hometown. This would free up a prime slot in Colombo for a former Hela Urumaya member, and an apparent attempt to sideline Harsha and diminish his influence within the party.
