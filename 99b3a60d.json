    "The VAT registration threshold was reduced to 80 million rupees per year from 300 million rupees.",
    "Unlike value added tax, where the coercive state takes money from citizens before growth generating investments or consumption takes place, VAT is taken after a gainful economic choice is made by a free people and given to the elected ruling class of bureaucrats to spend.",

    "\u201cGovernments that have significantlydeviated from these norms in the past have typically faced electoral punishment.\u201d",
    "The size of the state should then be limited to accommodate the ability of the people to pay. (Colombo/Nov17/2023)"
