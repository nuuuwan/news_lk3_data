*2025-09-27 22:03:58* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-importance-of-education-in-emergencies-for-eliminating-the-dependency-mindset/) · `en`

In such contexts, the education system often collapses, leaving children and communities vulnerable to a “dependency mindset.” This mindset is characterized by reliance on external aid rather than building self-reliance and sustainable solutions.

Education plays a critical role in preventing and eliminating this dependency. By continuing learning even during crises, education nurtures resilience, independence, and problem-solving capabilities, enabling individuals and communities to rebuild their futures

The dependency mindset refers to a psychological and social state where individuals or communities rely excessively on external aid rather than developing internal capacities to solve their own problems.

### The Hypocrisy Of The Scalpel: Is Sri Lanka’s Medical Watchdog Controlled By A Union?

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Sri Lanka’s powerful doctors’ trade union, is currently making headlines for urging the Minister of Health to appoint a President to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) who possesses “the highest stature, qualifications, and credentials,” is free from any conflicts of interest, and has no “commitments which may interfere” with their duties.

It’s an admirable demand—but the entire medical profession and the public are left asking: Is this the ultimate act of hypocrisy?

The GMOA’s call for unimpeachable integrity at the top is directly contradicted by serious allegations regarding its own actions within the SLMC, the very body mandated to regulate and discipline doctors for the public good.

### In Defence Of The Diaspora: Why Sri Lanka Should Embrace Expat Voting

*2025-09-27 16:58:03* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/in-defence-of-the-diaspora-why-sri-lanka-should-embrace-expat-voting/) · `en`

The proposal to grant digital voting rights to Sri Lankan expatriates has provoked fierce opposition from some quarters. In “South Asian Spring: Why Expats Should Not Get Digital Vote in Sri Lanka” the author argues that enfranchising expats is a threat to sovereignty, opens the door to external interference, and undermines the integrity of domestic governance. While these are serious concerns in principle, a closer look reveals that many of them rest upon dubious assumptions, selective history, and fear of change rather than evidence. Below, while contesting the major claims by the author, it will be shown that extending voting rights abroad is not only defensible but aligns with democratic norms worldwide.

The author claims: Granting expats voting rights is a gamble with sovereignty, giving the ballot to people who do not live under Sri Lankan laws, do not face its burdens, and do not pay its taxes.
