    "The U.S. may be giving tax evaders and illicit networks across developing economies a powerful new tool.",
    "In his influential analysis of the macroeconomic and financial stability risks posed by US dollar\u2013backed stablecoins, Professor Kenneth Rogoff cautions that their widespread adoption in emerging markets could undermine monetary sovereignty, erode tax bases, and facilitate capital flight. While his work primarily addresses global vulnerabilities, the implications for South Asia\u2014where financial systems are unevenly developed, and external sector pressures are recurrent\u2014are particularly acute. For India, with its growing fintech ecosystem and global capital linkages, and Sri Lanka, with its fragile reserves position and ongoing macroeconomic adjustments, Rogoff\u2019s warning underscores the urgent need for coordinated regulatory frameworks, robust technological monitoring tools, and cross-border cooperation to safeguard policy autonomy and financial stability. The United States\u2019 landmark cryptocurrency legislation has been hailed domestically as a bold step towards bringing order to the \u201cwild west\u201d of digital finance. But for South Asia \u2014 a region grappling with vast informal economies, volatile currencies, and regulatory capacity gaps \u2014 Washington\u2019s move could unleash far-reaching consequences that policymakers are not yet ready to contain.",
    "The law\u2019s centerpiece is the formal recognition and regulation of dollar-backed stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged one-to-one to the US dollar, supposedly backed by safe, liquid assets such as US Treasury bills and insured bank deposits. While the framework includes safeguards to limit instability, it leaves open a critical vulnerability: stablecoin transactions will remain far less traceable than credit or debit card payments.",
    "In theory, blockchain transactions are public. In practice, pseudonymous wallets and the ability to hold multiple identities allow users to move funds across borders with a level of anonymity nearly equivalent to physical cash. For South Asia, this creates an attractive channel for tax evasion, capital flight, and illicit financing \u2014 problems already endemic in the region.",
    "The underground economy in many South Asian nations is far larger than in advanced economies. According to World Bank estimates, it accounts for over 30% of GDP in developing countries, often fuelled by cash transactions. Stablecoins \u2014 especially those backed by the US dollar and issued under light-touch US regulations \u2014 could quickly displace cash as the preferred medium for illicit transactions.",
    "Governments in South Asia already face difficulties policing unregulated remittance channels, hawala networks, and money laundering through shell companies. Now, with stablecoins accessible via smartphones and lightly regulated offshore exchanges, financial flows could move even further beyond the reach of tax authorities and financial intelligence units.",
    "India\u2019s large digital payments ecosystem (UPI, RuPay, Paytm) has helped formalise transactions, but it has also created a tech-savvy population capable of quickly adopting stablecoins for cross-border trade, freelance payments, and even real estate deals.",
    "India maintains strict foreign exchange regulations under FEMA. Dollar-backed stablecoins could become a backdoor for moving wealth abroad without Reserve Bank of India oversight.",
    "With a sizable portion of GDP coming from the informal sector, stablecoins could make GST and income tax collection harder.",
    "Terrorist financing and illicit arms procurement could become harder to detect, especially if wallets are created and traded outside India\u2019s jurisdiction.",
    "While the RBI has shown interest in its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), its rollout is still in early stages. In the meantime, unregulated foreign stablecoins could undercut both monetary policy and currency stability.",
    "For Sri Lanka, still recovering from a severe debt crisis and IMF-led restructuring, the stakes are different but equally urgent:",
    "Widespread use of dollar-backed stablecoins could accelerate the partial dollarisation of the economy, undermining confidence in the rupee.",
    "With limited foreign reserves and tight import controls, stablecoins offer a discreet way to move dollars offshore.",
    "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka lacks the manpower and technical infrastructure to monitor decentralised blockchain transactions effectively.",
    "Given Sri Lanka\u2019s reliance on tourism, remittances, and aid flows, the widespread use of US-issued stablecoins could weaken exchange rate stability and make monetary policy less effective.",
    "If the US becomes the \u201cSwitzerland of crypto\u201d, as some critics suggest, South Asian countries will face a dilemma:",
    "= Either adopt and regulate stablecoins aggressively, investing heavily in compliance infrastructure,",
    "= Or restrict and ban their use \u2014 a move that risks pushing them underground, just as happened with hawala networks and unlicensed moneylenders.",
    "What is clear is that regulation-lite stablecoins from the US could function as a form of \u201csuper cash\u201d \u2014 offering all the convenience of mobile payments with the anonymity of banknotes, but in a form that transcends borders.",
    "For South Asia, the challenge is urgent: craft a coordinated regulatory strategy, invest in blockchain analytic and consider region-wide frameworks under SAARC or BIMSTEC. Otherwise, the benefits of crypto innovation may be outweighed by an erosion of tax revenues, financial sovereignty, and monetary control. (See Figure 1",
    "= Sri Lanka scores higher on monetary policy impact, capital flight, and weaker mitigation capacity \u2014 meaning it\u2019s more vulnerable to harm from US stablecoins.",
    "=India\u2019s main vulnerabilities are capital flight and tax erosion. too, but stronger regulatory capacity and faster CBDC work reduce overall risk somewhat.",
    "= Both countries face meaningful risks on tax erosion and illicit finance; policy coordination and investment in blockchain analytics are essential for both.",
    "In sum, the accelerating rise of US dollar\u2013backed stablecoins presents both an innovation challenge and a sovereignty risk for South Asia. As Professor Rogoff\u2019s framework highlights, without proactive policy action, these instruments could bypass local currencies, destabilise monetary policy, and erode fiscal control\u2014effects likely to be more acute in smaller, open economies like Sri Lanka and, to a lesser but still significant degree, in India. By enacting targeted regulations, investing in blockchain analytics and digital currency infrastructure, and engaging in regional information-sharing on cross-border flows, both nations can mitigate vulnerabilities while preserving the benefits of financial innovation. The lesson is clear: waiting until stablecoins achieve deep market penetration will make corrective measures costlier and less effective\u2014strategic readiness today is the surest safeguard for economic resilience tomorrow.",
