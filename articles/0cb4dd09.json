    "The Government of Australia will partner with UN Women and national civil society organisation Chrysalis on a new five-year program to advance gender equality in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cTHRIVE \u2013 Together for Her: Resilience-building, Inclusivity, and Voices for Equality in Sri Lanka\u201d will economically and socially empower women, working with their families and communities to address persistent and harmful social norms that perpetuate issues such as gender-based violence.",
    "Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Paul Stephens said: \u201cAustralia has an enduring partnership with Sri Lanka and a steadfast commitment to promoting gender equality in our region. No country can meet its development goals without ensuring everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential. By challenging harmful social norms and investing in women\u2019s leadership and livelihoods, we want to support a future where all Sri Lankans can thrive.\u201d",
    "THRIVE will focus on communities in Badulla, Colombo, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Monaragala and Nuwara Eliya, where multi-dimensional poverty continues to be a significant challenge. To ensure sustainability of the programme, public sector officials at both the national and sub-national levels will receive capacity-building on gender planning and budgeting processes.",

    "\u201cThe partnership of the Government of Australia, national stakeholders in Sri Lanka and UN Women on gender-transformative approaches is crucial to support the country\u2019s national vision for economic and social growth. UN Women thanks the Government of Australia for its continued commitment to gender equality and its long-term partnership in Sri Lanka and region-wide,\u201d added Arab.",
    "The announcement of THRIVE coincides with 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence (GBV) as the project aims to transform social norms and promote behaviour change to prevent GBV.",
    "Additionally, the project will take a holistic approach to building women\u2019s resilience and agency \u2013 supporting over 1,950 women-led enterprises to expand their businesses and better withstand climate related impacts. THRIVE aims to integrate social norms change with families and communities and support local women\u2019s political participation.",
    "Chrysalis CEO Ashika Gunasena noted: \u201cBy offering capacity-building opportunities, economic resources, and climate-resilient assets, this initiative will create sustainable pathways for women to become leaders in their communities. We look forward to working on this important initiative to uplift the lives of women in Sri Lanka.\u201d"
