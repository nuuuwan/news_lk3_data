    "The Geneva Association announces the winner of its 2024 Women in Insurance Award: Chathuri Munaweera, CEO of AIA Sri Lanka.",
    "The award selection committee \u2013 comprised of Pauline Leclerc-Glorieux, CEO, BNP Paribas Cardif; Lee Yuan Siong, Group Chief Executive and President, AIA; and Charles F. Lowrey, Chairman & CEO, Prudential Financial \u2013 selected Chathuri Munaweera for her outstanding leadership of AIA\u2019s Sri Lanka business, particularly through the unprecedented post-COVID economic crisis in Sri Lanka.",
    "Chathuri\u2019s appointment as CEO in 2022 coincided with the beginning of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst economic, political and societal turmoil since its independence in 1948. Chathuri\u2019s comprehensive response, including prioritising food security for employees and agents, enabled AIA Sri Lanka to emerge from the crisis financially stable and as a leading insurance provider in the country. A staunch champion of gender equity, inclusivity and sustainability, Chathuri has increased the female workforce at AIA Sri Lanka from 41% to 48% since 2022, introduced women-centric insurance products, and strengthened financial inclusion through bancassurance partnerships.",

We are thrilled to recognise Chathuri\u2019s achievements with the 2024 Women in Insurance Award. We hope that as an outstanding role model, she will inspire the next generation of insurance leaders.\u201d",
    "Charles F. Lowrey, Chairman & CEO of Prudential Financial, said: \u201cI want to congratulate Chathuri Munaweera on winning the Geneva Association\u2019s 2024 award and for her",
