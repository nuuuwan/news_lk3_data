    "Above is the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) USA Weather Radar live forecast for 1st\u00a0August 2023. These forecasts are extremely accurate and accessible to all and sundry.",
    "The red colour depicts the potential of clouds to produce rain. Now if these types of cloud could be seeded with Silver Iodide and Salt, without delay when observed, the intensity of rain can be enhanced in the Samanala Wewa/Udawalawe Area. The farmers in Embilipitiya are already protesting that they have no water for their fields. Every extra drop of water will count. It will be a win/win situation for both Electricity and Agriculture, if it works.",
    "If only the three stooges in charge of Power/Energy, Agriculture and Irrigation get off their butts and seek help from India, without being confined to their own silos for the general good of all, the case might be different.",
    "India has been seeding clouds for years. They possess the true expertise. They could base a few aircraft and equipment at Koggala, Mattala or Weerawilla. Since the prevalent winds are South Westerly, they can easily make rain to fall in copious amounts in the Samanala Wewa area by cloud seeding. By the way, the wind direction is defined from where it blows and not to where it goes!",
    "Perhaps the SLAF personnel could be trained in these techniques as well. I am sure our Airmen will gather the basics in no time.",
