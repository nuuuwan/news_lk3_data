    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved the selection of a consultancy agency, through the procurement process, to conduct a detailed feasibility study aimed at easing severe congestion at the Lotus Roundabout in Colombo.",
    "The study will focus on developing a sustainable solution to improve connectivity with the city\u2019s main corridors, while addressing bottlenecks at the Lotus Roundabout.",
    "\u201cThe Lotus Road roundabout area in Colombo has turned out to be a high traffic congestion place, especially during peak hours and it has been observed that this has led to traffic congestion in the urban transport network,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "He said it has been found that this issue will be further aggravated with the completion of the Colombo Port City and the Port Access Road, and the completion of major development works currently underway in the capital.",
    "Responding to questions by journalists on whether such considerations had been ignored by the officials at the planning stage, Dr. Jayatissa said this was characteristic of the previous administration.",
    "\u201cYou all know how projects were done by the previous regimes. We are now taking steps to explore and ensure projects are properly integrated and deliver their intended benefits,\u201d he explained."
