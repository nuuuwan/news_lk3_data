Acting as a platform for industry leaders to collaborate and connect with professionals from around the world, FACETS hopes to contribute to driving the industry towards its goal of achieving $ 1 billion in exports.",
    "The event will not only highlight the brilliance of Sri Lankan sapphires and coloured gemstones but will act as a window into Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse culture and shared heritage. FACETS 2025 will truly be an opportunity to cement Sri Lanka\u2019s status a global gem and jewellery hub, as well as stimulate innovation and international collaboration throughout the gemstone and tourism industries.\u00a0 This year\u2019s event is set to offer visitors unparalleled opportunities for networking and collaboration.
