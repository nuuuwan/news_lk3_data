    "AIA Insurance partners with HelpAge Sri Lanka reinforcing our commitment to improving the lives of those in need. This donation has sponsored 10 cataract surgeries for underprivileged patients, offering them the precious gift of sight. Cataract surgery is a life-changing procedure that not only restores vision but also enhances the quality of life, enabling individuals to regain their independence and continue contributing to their families and communities.",
    "AIA Insurance made this donation as a meaningful way to extend the positive impact of its AIA Piyavara Pooja, Sri Lanka\u2019s first crowdsourced digital thorana (pandol) held during Vesak. This innovative initiative encouraged Sri Lankans to pledge healthier living habits, such as walking, while also contributing to a greater cause. Each pledge made during the event directly supported HelpAge Sri Lanka, resulting in the donation towards cataract surgeries. By connecting the act of promoting personal health with social responsibility, AIA reinforced its commitment to not only improving the wellbeing of individuals but also uplifting the lives of those in need.",
    "At AIA, we believe that true success is measured by the positive impact we have on the lives of others. By partnering with HelpAge Sri Lanka, we are able to extend our support beyond financial assistance, directly touching the lives of those who need it most. This initiative is a reflection of our ongoing mission to help Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives, and we are honoured to play a role in this important cause.",
