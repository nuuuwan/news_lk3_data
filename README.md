### රශීඩ්ගෙන් ආයාචනයක්

*2024-12-04 22:11:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/204046) · `si`

තලේබාන් සංවිධානය විසින් එරට කාන්තාවන්ට වෛද්‍ය පුහුණුව තහනම් කිරීමට ගත් තීරණය පිළිබඳ නැවත සලකාබලන මෙන් ඇෆ්ගනිස්තානයේ සුපිරි ක්‍රිකට් ක්‍රීඩක රෂීඩ් ඛාන් තලේබාන් රජයෙන් ඉල්ලීමක් කර තිබේ.

ඇෆ්ගනිස්තාන කාන්තාවන්ට වෛද්‍ය පුහුණුව ලැබීම හා අර්ධ වෘත්තීය පුහුණුව ලැබීම තහනම් කරමින් තලේබාන් නායක හිබතුල්ලා අකුන්සාඩා පසුගිය සඳුදා නියෝගයක් නිකුත් කළේය.

ඔහුගේ එම නියෝගයට ප්‍රතිචාර දක්වමින් රශීඩ් සිය 'X'ගිණුම හරහා මෙම ඉල්ලීම කර තිබේ.

තලේබාන් සංවිධානය 2021 වසරේ ඇෆ්ගනිස්තනයේ බලය ලබාගැනීමත් සමග එරට කාන්තාවන්ට දැඩි සීමා පැනවීය.

වැඩිදුරට අධ්‍යාපනය ලැබීම මෙන්ම ක්‍රීඩා තහනම් කිරීම ඒ අතර  ප්‍රධාන විය.

කෙසේ නමුත් එළෙස සීමා පැනවුවත් මේ දක්වා ඇෆ්ගනිස්තාන කාන්තාවන්ට වෛද්‍ය පුහුණුව ලැබීමට තහනමක් නොතිබුණි.

එය එරට කාන්තාවන්ට උසස් අධ්‍යාපනය ලැබීම සඳහා ඉතිරිව තිබූ අවසානම විකල්පය විය.

තලේබාන් රජය 2022 වසරේදී කාන්තාවන්ට පාසල් තහනම් කළ අතර, ඊට පෙර ඔවුන් 6වන ශ්‍රේණියෙන් පසු ගැහැණු ළමයින්ට ද්විතීයික අධ්‍යාපනය තහනම් කර තිබුණි.
