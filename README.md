British police said on Wednesday a man had been arrested as part of an investigation into a ransomware attack against Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX , which knocked check-in systems at airports offline and caused widespread travel disruption across Europe.

The National Crime Agency said in a statement that the man, in his 40s, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act and had since been released on conditional bail.

“Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” NCA Deputy Director Paul Foster said.

It remained unclear which criminal group was behind last week’s hack. An NCA spokesperson declined to provide further details.

Ransomware gangs routinely publicise attacks and leak stolen data on dark web “leak sites” but websites that monitor those portals had not, as of Wednesday, detected any group claiming the hack.

Japan’s prime minister told the United Nations on Tuesday (Sep 23) that Tokyo’s recognition of the State of Palestine was only a question of time, saying he was “indignant” at recent comments by Israeli officials.

Nearly 80 per cent of UN members recognise the State of Palestine, with a string of countries including Britain, Canada and France adding their names this week after nearly two years of war in Gaza.

“I feel strongly indignant at the statements made by senior Israeli government officials that appear to categorically reject the very notion of Palestinian state-building,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.

“For our country, the question is not whether to recognise a Palestinian state, but when. The continued unilateral actions by the government of Israel can never be accepted,” he said.

“I must state clearly that if further actions are taken that obstruct the realisation of a two-state solution, Japan will be compelled to take new measures in response,” he added.

### X-Press Pearl disaster: Ship’s agent pays $1 mln out of $1 bln damages to Sri Lanka

A Singapore-registered ship’s Sri Lanka agent paid US$1 million out of US$1 billion damages awarded for causing the island’s worst pollution, a litigant told AFP on Wednesday (Sep 24).

The Sea Consortium (Private) Limited made the token payment in “good faith” as it did not have the financial capacity to fully cover the damages.

A petitioner who brought action against the MV X-Press Pearl, which sank off Colombo Port in June 2021, said he had been officially informed of the payment.

“I was given a copy of the affidavit of Sea Consortium (to the court) after it paid 300 million rupees (US$1 million) to the Treasury,” environmental activist Hemantha Withanage told AFP.

“They have done this because the court held them responsible for any non-compliance by the Singapore owners.”

The move came as the owners of the X-Press Pearl told AFP in Singapore that they would refuse to pay the massive damages.
