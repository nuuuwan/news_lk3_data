    "Solo travellers are getting older and are increasingly drawn to Asian destinations \u2013 with Sri Lanka securing the most popular spot for 2025, says new data from Flash Pack.",
    "Flash Pack\u2019s latest trends report reveals Sri Lanka has claimed the top spot for solo travel in 2025, advancing from fourth place in 2024.",
    "The appeal is clear, says Flash Pack: \u201cSri Lanka packs in all the punch of India \u2013 only on a smaller, more accessible scale, and delivered at a much slower pace.\u201d The company highlights diverse experiences from \u201cincense-swirled cities, buzzing with tuk tuks\u201d to \u201cmisty highlands steeped in tea plantations\u201d and dramatic coastlines.",
    "\u201cBut where Sri Lanka really comes into its own,\u201d the company adds, \u201cis its easy-going balance of beaches, spoiling hotels and restorative, delicately spiced food.\u201d",
    "The data also shows that the average age of Flash Pack\u2019s solo travellers has increased from 36 to 39 since the pandemic, reflecting a maturing market for independent adventure tourism. This shift coincides with a boom in \u201csocial travel\u201d \u2013 a trend that fostered over 160,000 new friendships, including 50,000 in 2024 alone.",
    "Asia dominates the solo travel landscape, securing five of the top ten most popular destinations for 2025. Following Sri Lanka in the rankings are Bali and Mexico, highlighting a diverse mix of cultural experiences sought by modern travellers.",
    "Holiday period bookings have seen remarkable growth, with Easter reservations up 70% and Christmas bookings doubling, suggesting a strong appetite for festive season adventures.",
    "Lee Thompson, Flash Pack\u2019s co-founder and CMO, provided the analysis based on internal booking data and industry insights, painting a picture of an evolving solo travel market increasingly focused on social connections and Asian experiences."
