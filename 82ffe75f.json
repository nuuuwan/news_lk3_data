  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government is paying close attention to certain parties\u2019 attempts to satisfy their political needs by giving the \u2018Aswasuma\u2019 program, which was created to aid those in need of economic stability, a political fa\u00e7ade, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "However, the Government assures that any shortcomings in the process of selecting the relevant candidates will be rectified immediately and plans are being made to discuss this with the district secretaries, divisional secretaries, and other parties involved in the program in the coming week.",
    "Accordingly, these payments will be distributed among four social categories, namely transitional, vulnerable, poor, and extremely poor. Additionally, the usual allowances for the differently-abled, elderly, and kidney patients will also be provided, the PMD said.",
    "6728 officers were employed in the data collection process for the information survey of the program to identify those who are eligible for welfare benefit payments, covering all the divisional secretariats across the island. It included 3190 development officers, 494 economic development officers, 205 Grama Niladhari officers, 1127 other officers and 1712 temporary recruits.",
    "At the regional office level, a three-member selection committee will monitor the data and, after approval by the district secretary, the deserving candidates will be selected, it added.",
    "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena as the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister announced this morning (25) that the time period given to those who have been wronged in the selection of the beneficiaries of the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 welfare benefit payment program to hand over appeals and objections has been extended until July 10, as some parties have alleged that there have been shortcomings in the process.",
    "The necessary work is also being carried out in this regard by Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe and Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, according to the PMD.",
    "Accordingly, if an individual or family in need of economic stability has lost this benefit, there is an opportunity to correct it by making inquiries through the Divisional Secretariats during the relevant period.",
    "The Government emphasizes that the basic requirement of the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 program is to provide the necessary contribution to the people who need economic stability, and not to meet the needs of various parties based on a mere political process.",
    "The Government advises against panicking as a result of yielding to political instigation or external influences if your name is not on the currently published list or if the name of an ineligible individual is on it. Instead, make any pertinent queries through the Divisional Secretariat Offices.",
    "The Government further informs the applicants that they can contact the Divisional Secretary for assistance with any issues that may have developed with regard to their applications, it said.",
    "Earlier today, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe stated that the Welfare Benefit Board would intervene if any injustice is observed in the beneficiary selection process.",
    "Taking into Twitter, he also notified that the relevant officials have been informed so that the people can hand over appeals and objections under the \u2018Aswasuma\u2019 welfare benefits program personally at the Divisional Secretariats across the island.",
    "For any further inquiries, the general public can contact the hotline number 1924 which is operational on weekdays from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m., according to the minister."
