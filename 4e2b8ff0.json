    "Rev. Fr. Jude Chrysantha has accused Public Security Minister Tiran Alles of making false accusations regarding an alleged appeal made to the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) on behalf of Fr. Cyril Gamini after a road accident.",
    "Convening a special press conference on Friday (22 Dec.) in his capacity as the Director of the Archdiocesan Commission for Social Communications, Fr. Chrysantha said that no such plea for help was made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith to Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon.",
    "Speaking to the media in this regard, Fr. Chrysantha disclosed that the Cardinal had become aware of the incident only the following morning, suggesting that it was impossible for him to have contacted Tennakoon the night before seeking assistance.",
    "Minister Tiran Alles had recently claimed that the Cardinal appealed to Tennakoon for help following a road accident involving Fr. Gamini, who was subsequently taken to the police station. The lawmaker alleged that Fr. Cyril Gamini personally thanked the Acting IGP for his assistance.",
    "\u201cAt the time of the incident, Fr. Cyril Gamini had no idea that someone would alert the Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon of the matter, because by then he, [Fr. Cyril Gamini], had already agreed to a settlement of sorts with the aggrieved party. Minister Tiran Alles claims, however, that the Father called the Acting IGP the next day, and thanked him. We urge Minister Tiran Alles to refrain from spreading such falsehoods\u201d, Fr. Jude Chrysantha charged, challenging the Minister to prove evidence, if any, with regards to the latter incident.",
    "Fr. Jude Chrysantha further pointed out that the Cardinal too, remains baffled as to who may have made the appeal on his behalf, as he [the Cardinal] has not vested any such powers within any individual or party.",
