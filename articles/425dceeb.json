    "These measures have been developed with the Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association and are in line with the Working Committee on Recovery of Loans under the Special Provisions Amendment Act No. 26 of 2024.",
    "According to the new relief measures, loans provided to SMEs that have become non-performing loans will be rescheduled based on the borrower\u2019s ability to repay and an acceptable business revival plan.",
    "The CBSL stated that all rescheduling agreements must be finalized by June 15, 2025.",
    "\u2022SMEs with loan balances below Rs. 25 million must begin repayment by December 31, 2025.",

    "\u2022A 65% waiver for loans between Rs. 5 million and Rs. 10 million if the interest is settled within 6 months.",
    "\u2022A 50% waiver for the same category if settled within 12 months.",
    "\u2022A 40% waiver if the interest is settled between 1 to 5 years.",
    "The CBSL further stated that banks should not reject new loan applications solely based on adverse CRIB records.",
    "It added that if relief is denied, borrowers should be informed of the reasons and given the option to appeal to the Director of the Financial Consumer Relations Department at the Central Bank.",
    "These relief measures will apply to SME borrowers whose loans became Stage 3 non-performing loans after April 1, 2019.",
    "Additionally, the CBSL emphasized that SMEs must engage with their bank\u2019s Business Revival Units by March 31, 2025, and submit the required documents to be eligible for the relief."
