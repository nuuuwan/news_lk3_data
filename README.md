The mini-overhead bridge (over the railway line) connecting Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha (Drieberg‚Äôs Avenue) and Sri Vajiragnana Road (Dematagoda Road) has become a garbage dumping site with all sorts of garbage thrown all over (vide photographs attached) and in a very much dilapidated state. This bridge provides easy access to Rajapokuna Mawatha, Maligawatta through Qurashana Mowlana Lane from Dematagoda.

Some of the overhead bridges have become public toilets ‚Äì smelling of urine and human excreta. Overhead has also become make-shift homes for beggars, trade stalls for hawkers to sell their merchandise, etc.

Most of these bridges require renovation and/or regular maintenance as there is growth of weeds here and there, railings are corroded requiring painting, floor surface is broken, cracks on the steps and being ill-lit making it unsafe for the users during night time and moreover, making it more conducive for nefarious activities!

### Rethinking Central Bank independence in Sri Lanka‚Äôs development journey

*2024-11-06 05:38:36* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rethinking-Central-Bank-independence-in-Sri-Lanka-s-development-journey/4-768873) ¬∑ `en`

Although an independent CBSL is intended to operate free from political interference, it remains heavily influenced by IMF directives, fostering dependency on IMF guidance

In September 2023, after 73 years, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) gained formal independence with the enactment of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act (Act 16 of 2023), replacing the Monetary Law Act. This step towards autonomy, largely influenced by conditions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aims to shield the CBSL from political influence. The rationale is straightforward: an independent central bank prevents political leaders from manipulating monetary policy, especially during election cycles, to boost short-term economic growth and re-election chances. However, the implications of this shift warrant deeper analysis as it could lead to unintended economic consequences for Sri Lanka.

### Strategic focus and agility in unpredictable markets

*2024-11-06 05:31:18* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Strategic-focus-and-agility-in-unpredictable-markets/4-768871) ¬∑ `en`

One of the greatest challenges for commercial leaders is balancing immediate needs with long-term growth strategies

Commercial leaders today are tasked with steering their organisations through increasingly unpredictable markets. Maintaining strategic focus while being agile is crucial for weathering sudden disruptions. Leaders must balance the long-term vision with the need to adapt swiftly to unforeseen challenges, requiring a deep understanding of market factors like consumer behaviour, competitor activity, and regulatory shifts. Regular reassessment of strategic objectives is key, and when market conditions change, quick pivots are critical.

Agility doesn‚Äôt mean losing sight of the long-term strategy; it enhances execution by empowering teams to make informed, real-time decisions. Scenario planning is essential for staying aligned with core goals while adjusting to evolving conditions. This blend of focus and agility helps organisations remain proactive and adaptable.

Trump‚Äôs campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected.

In the past, the current president has made impossible pledges on many platforms in the past but that the salaries of plantation workers will be increased significantly for plantation workers at a meeting in Nuwara Eliya on Sunday, 3rd, but the Ceylon Workers Congress and Nuwelia District Candidate Jeevan Thondaman said.

He was speaking at a speech at the election campaign meeting held on Monday 4 in the Diyagamam area.

Over the past 4 years, we have faced many humiliations and problems and promised to get a salary increase for plantation workers. We have now fulfilled that promise.

We are a land -free society. Land rights should be certain if the land is entrusted to the people. 90 % of the people will automatically build houses. Only a few readers in the garden are only a few people in the garden.There is no doubt that we are still fighting for land rights.

### There is no political institution that represents the public today because the elections are not held in a timely manner - KD Lalkantha

*2024-11-05 13:45:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197924) ¬∑ `ta`

No political institution represents public due to delayed elections - KD Lalkantha. He advocates for timely polls to establish parliament, provincial councils, and local governments. This opportunity allows Tamil, Muslim, and female representation in Sri Lanka's political landscape.

üü©

KD Lalgantha, the primary candidate of the Kandy District National People's Power, said that no political organization representing the public today is due to the lack of elections in a timely manner.

He was speaking at an election campaign meeting in Kumbukkandura, Teldeniya.

In Sri Lanka, many people's representation organizations were running when they held elections to a people's representation agency.

But now there are no parliament, provincial council or local government organizations that can manage the country. So you have to create them.

This means that the provincial council or local councils are present during the parliamentary elections. Or there will be a provincial council or parliament when elections are held for local councils.

This is a significant opportunity in the history of Sri Lanka because in the past, there is no election in the past.
