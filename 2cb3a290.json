By championing ethical business practices, ICC emphasises the need for businesses to operate responsibly, considering the well-being of societies and the environment. Ease of international trade is very significant to the world economy as it not only results in increased efficiency but also allows countries to participate in a global economy, encouraging the opportunity for foreign direct investment (FDI).
