"My brother Prabhakaran and his entire family have passed away, achieving martyrdom. It is crucial to acknowledge this truth. I urge you not to be deceived by these fraudsters posing as my brother's family. They are manipulating your sentiments and exploiting my brother's legacy for their own benefit," stated Manoharan, cautioning against falling victim to such fraudulent schemes.

Manoharan told the Jaffna Monitor magazine’s latest issue that he was stating this to end what he said was a huge scam perpetrated by a section of the Tamil diaspora to cheat money from unsuspecting Tamils by insisting that Prabhakaran and some of his family members were still alive.

### Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union – Workers’ Tribunal from 7 to 8 June

*2024-06-06 05:35:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Ceylon-Workers-Red-Flag-Union-Workers-Tribunal-from-7-to-8-June/56-762693) · `en`

The Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union has brought together workers from the plantation sector to organise the first ever Workers’ Tribunal from 7 to 8 June, at the BMICH, Colombo. In this Tribunal several other unions will also be giving their testimonies.

Organisers said it has been 200 years since workers in the plantations have been enabling Sri Lanka’s growth with their sweat and blood. The situation of the workers remain dire and unchanged. The long-standing mobilisation by workers demanding an increase in the basic wages to Rs. 1,000/- began in 2010 and gained momentum in 2018. In this context, the Wages Board increased the workers’ wages to Rs. 1,000/- per day in 2019. The intervention of the Wages Board in this matter has been unacceptable to the companies and the legal battle is still ongoing. Therefore, since 2018, the conditions of workers’ rights have only become worse.

### Sri Lanka urgently needs green power on ground and not paper

Sri Lanka has set an ambitious goal of achieving 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2050. To put this in perspective, for FY24, fossil fuel-based power plants met 54% of total power generated in the country, and under 8% came from solar or wind, with hydro contributing 31%. In terms of installed capacity, as on 31 March 2024, of SL’s generation capacity of 5,012 MW, ex of hydro, REs contributed barely 1093 MW, which is about a fifth of the total installed capacity. With limited scope of adding large-scale hydro projects in the future, it is the wind and solar projects which will have to do the heavy lifting for SL to meet its RE generation goals.

### Ministry of Finance: Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted

A recent press statement issued by the Ministry of Finance dated 27/05/2024, appears to be a belated focus possibly due to an intervention initiated by an external authority. It pronounces a scheme designed for the implementation of reforms for State Owned Banks.

The diagnosed defects to be addressed are in summary form as follows;

SOBs have faced significant stress during the recent economic crisis,

SOB lending practices have deteriorated due to inadequate risk mitigation and weak governance

SOB balance sheets have absorbed losses of SOEs and help large fiscal deficits of those SOEs

These have led to delays in reforms which contributed to the economic crisis

It is not a fight between two equal states but between an occupier and those that they have occupied

“When IRA was bombing people in England, we did not drop 2000 lbs bombs on Belfast” was a chilling note with utter disgust from the ardent pro-Israeli Broadcaster/Journalist Piers Morgan. This was following the attack on the Rafah refugee tents killing 45 and injuring 250 already displaced civilians on 26 May. The silly claim of Netanyahu’s was, “there were two Hamas operatives.”

### An assessment of China growing ties with the Arab world

*2024-06-06 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/An-assessment-of-China-growing-ties-with-the-Arab-world/172-284189) · `en`

Against the backdrop of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing on May 30, significant meetings took place between Chinese President and a number of top Arab leaders

China’s real aim was to further strengthen its economic ties with the Arab world, which are already strong

Another advantage that the Chinese have in the Arab world is that they do not point to human rights violations in the Arab countries; and the Arab countries in turn remain silent about the persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang

China’s strengths in the Arab world are its economic heft, willingness to take up expensive infrastructure projects, non-interference in internal affairs, and the declining political credibility of the US in the Middle East. But the impediments in China’s way are the West’s technological superiority, the unassailable position of the dollar, and transparency characteristic of Western systems.

### Lifestyles of politicians and the life of an artist

Sri Lankans are easily attracted to the lifestyle of successful individuals, but rarely do they wish to put in long hours to emulate those feats. Here some fishermen are seen engaging in the perplexing task of checking their nets; an activity which is a must to ensure a large catch at sea

Few common factors are found when analysing careers of politicians and artistes; the present generation engaged in these two professions are all out to earn maximum money during their careers

There are so many performing artistes who took to politics; some of them were in parliament till very recently, but most of them failed to make any impact in the field of politics

A politician’s ‘life’ is often hectic. It has to be; because he has to serve the people who elected him to office. But we also see the ‘lifestyles’ they live and often envy them. Talk about our lawmakers having hectic lives, there are some who are the opposite, are lazy and not worth the salaries they earn.

Devastating cricket fans across the country, South Africa beat Sri Lanka by six wickets at the T20 World Cup, on Monday (3).

It may be a cliche in the scorebook, but a famous saying lasts a lifetime. It goes like this: “For when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, He writes, not that you won or lost, but how you played the Game.” Though often quoted, Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ also applies to what we learn and what we should become through sports. Kipling’s poem goes like this:

In Sri Lanka, cricket is not only popular but an obsession among the people especially after the versatile Arjuna Ranatunga led us to victory in the world cup of 1996.

### Should The Economic Transformation Bill Proceed?

*2024-06-05 22:56:24* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/should-the-economic-transformation-bill-proceed/) · `en`

Given the pivotal role of debt restructuring in the Economic Transformation Bill (ETB), the debt-to-GDP ratio may not remain below 95% by 2032 and reach an optimal level of 60% by 2048. This uncertainty also extends to the gross financing needs, which may not stay below 13%. While a 5% increase by 2027 seems feasible regarding GDP growth, it is uncertain if it will continue to exceed 5% after 2027. The ETB does not clearly outline the necessary economic growth to achieve Advanced Economic Status by 2048. This is a crucial factor in determining investment and welfare and, ultimately, improving the well-being of the people. A clear and comprehensive economic policy framework is necessary, rather than relying on arbitrary targets or a legal framework.  Based on the current US$ 4000 per capita income in Sri Lanka, achieving Advanced Economic Status by 2048 without such a framework seems highly improbable.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has requested Maldives to revisit the limit imposed in foreign remittances sent by the island nation’s migrant workers in a move to ease the restriction and increase the inflow into the country.

The Bank of Maldives (BML) has announced a new limit for foreign transactions which has been between $250-$300 monthly to prevent large dollar outflow from the country with an aim to prevent a forex shortage.

A large number of Sri Lankans work in the Maldives in high executive jobs in the hospitality sector in other categories including and labourers and housemaids. Some of them earn around $3,000 worth salary monthly, paid in Maldivian rufiyaa.

It’s unimaginable now what must have been going through my aunt’s mind as she sat in the car with us, making our way to Palali airport in the dead of night. My brother and I, just fourteen at the time, couldn’t comprehend the gravity of the situation. We never had the chance to discuss it further with her, as our time together was cut short. Soon after we left the country, despite her illness, Akila threw herself fully into the local administrative work under the control of the LTTE. At times, she worked with Thamilselvan, the leader of LTTE’s political wing, who was killed by the Sri Lankan army in 2007 in a targeted airstrike. Akila also succumbed to her illness, which deteriorated mainly due to the demands of her work, requiring extensive travel across the North.

There is a shortage of teachers in the Beruwalai constituency in the Kalutara Education Zone alone. That is, there are no 36 people where there should be a hundred.

Mathematics and Science Graduate Teacher Vacancies are found in the Beruwalai constituency. This teacher has been in shortage for 10, 12 years. If so, how can these students face exams?I urge the Minister to search for this.

### “More Digital-Readers” Is A Consequence Of “Less Thinkers”

The article aims to clarify the relationship between reading and critical thinking. While reading is undoubtedly a valuable habit, globalization has provided us with countless reading options, leading to a decline in critical thinking. Here are my arguments to support this claim.

Digitalization has created a convenient space for people in the 21st century. As a result, many people are choosing to read online, which is especially beneficial for distance learning courses and online public lectures. Importantly, readers can access materials from the comfort of their homes without the need to travel or have massive bookshelves. In my academic career, both as a student and a lecturer, I have always relied on books and the basic support of digital resources. However, I have consistently preferred printed books over online reading because I believe that having a physical library with printed books offers unique advantages that online reading cannot fully satisfy.
