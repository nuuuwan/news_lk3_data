We request the authorities to be close to the hearts of these suffering people and mete out justice to them.",

Let us get away from sin and love one another and invite Jesus to live among us,\" the statement signed by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka President Bishop Harold Anthony Perera and General Secretary Bishop J.D.
