    "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe will need to remain in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Colombo National Hospital for approximately two more days, as recommended by specialist doctors, according to the Deputy Director, Dr. Rukshan Bellana.",
    "Speaking at a media briefing held this morning (27), Dr. Bellana stated that the former president is no longer a detainee, and therefore, he is free to consult his private physician or seek treatment at a private hospital if desired.",
    "Dr. Bellana further noted that the former President\u2019s severe dehydration, which was a major concern upon admission, is now gradually subsiding with medical treatment.",
    "He also emphasized that the National Hospital provides equal service to all patients, stating: \u201cEveryone who comes to the hospital is treated the same, regardless of their background or status.\u201d",
    "Commenting on concerns about the former President\u2019s health assessment, Dr. Bellana explained that a committee was appointed by the Director General of the National Hospital to evaluate Wickremesinghe\u2019s condition, and he himself is not personally involved in that process.",
    "\u201cAccording to reports released yesterday, three out of four of his coronary arteries are blocked. I said he would need further treatment, and that it should be done quickly for his own benefit. Since he has now been granted bail, he is completely free to obtain care from a private hospital. According to the specialists, he will likely need to stay in the ICU for another one to two days.",
    "While the acute issue\u2014dehydration\u2014is improving, other diagnosed conditions will also require prompt treatment. It\u2019s difficult to recover from such a serious condition without immediate care. If treatment is delayed, there\u2019s a definite risk.\u201d"
