    "Former US President Donald Trump has claimed that he is expecting to be indicted in relation to an investigation into the riots at the Capitol on 6 January 2021.",
    "In a rambling post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Mr Trump said his lawyers had given him the \u201chorrifying news\u201d on Sunday night.",
    "He claimed that Jack Smith, special counsel for the Justice Department (DoJ), sent his lawyers a letter stating that he was a \u201ctarget\u201d in the investigation, \u201cwhich almost always means an Arrest and Indictment\u201d.",
    "In his two-page statement, Mr Trump, who is running for the Republican nomination to contest the 2024 US Presidential election, alleged that it was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, \u201celection interference\u201d, and \u201ctotal political weaponisation of law enforcement\u201d.",
    "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened in our Country before, or even close,\u201d he wrote.",
    "The former US President has already been indicted twice this year: in April on charges of falsifying business records relating to a cover-up of potentially damaging stories over hush money payments to a porn star during his initial run for president in 2016, and again in June on dozens of charges over allegations he illegally hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort.",
    "\u201cA probable fourth\u201d indictment \u201ccoming from Atlanta\u201d was possible too, Mr Trump said.",
    "Throughout the statement he repeated previous claims that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d by the Democrats with \u201cmassive fraud\u201d taking place.",
    "He went on to call Mr Smith a \u201cbiased and obsessed Trump Hater\u201d.",
    "Criminal charges for Mr Trump in relation to 6 January 2021 Capital riot were previously recommended by Congress\u2019 January 6th Committee, which was established in the wake of the riot to investigate the attack.",
    "That recommendation, in December 2022, did not mean Mr Trump would face charges as it was ultimately a decision for the DoJ. It was made after an 18-month inquiry that saw more than 1,000 witness interviewed and 10 public hearings.",
    "Upon the committee making the recommendation, its vice chair, Republican Representative Liz Cheney, said:",
    "\u201cAmong the most shameful of this committee\u2019s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television. For hours, he would not issue a public statement instructing his supporters to disperse. Despite urgent please from his White House staff and others to do so.",
    "\u201cMembers of his family, his White House lawyers, virtually all those around him knew that this simple act was critical. For hours, he would not do it.\u201d",
    "Committee chair Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, said the committee had \u201cevery confidence\u201d their work would \u201chelp provide a roadmap to justice\u201d.",
    "In relation to the committee\u2019s recommendation, Mr Trump at that time said people coming after him \u201cstrengthens\u201d him. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill me makes me stronger.\u201d"
