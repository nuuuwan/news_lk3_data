    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka and Indonesia will put in a joint application for their apparel exports to better benefit from the United Kingdom\u2019s tariff scheme for developing countries, Minister Vijitha Herath said.",
    "After the UK left the European Union, the UK Global Tariff (UKGT) and UK Generalized Scheme of Preferences (UK GSP) replaced the GSP.",
    "In order for apparel products in Sri Lanka to get the benefits of the relevant selective system, the finished garment should be produced using locally knitted or woven fabrics as raw materials.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s garment manufacturers have not been able to optimally tap into the benefits of the UK\u2019s trade scheme due to insufficient production of locally knitted or woven fabrics.",
    "However, according to the criteria of the Import Scheme for Developing Countries, when inputs produced in a country of one regional group with preferential benefits are incorporated into a product produced by a country of another regional group with similar preferential benefits, this enables exporters of both countries to claim benefits, according to a cabinet statement.",
    "According to that arrangement, both the ASEAN region (Regional Group 1) and the SAARC region (Regional Group II) are two regions that have the above preferential benefits.",
    "Sri Lanka and Indonesia will jointly submit an application using the provisions of inter-regional cumulation and take necessary steps to obtain preferential benefits for both countries by procuring the fabrics/raw materials required for the garment industry from Indonesia and exporting Sri Lankan ready-made garments to the United Kingdom. (Colombo/Oct29/2024)"
