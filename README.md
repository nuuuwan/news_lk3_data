### Sri Lanka to promote sea cucumber hatcheries due to demand: Minister

*2024-06-11 19:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-promote-sea-cucumber-hatcheries-due-to-demand-minister-167502/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will establish more sea cucumber hatcheries to accommodate growing demand for the marine animal in the export market, Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda said.

“There are three hatcheries established in Jaffna peninsula. Very soon we will establish in the other areas,” Devananda told reporters on Tuesday.

“They are like black gold,” Devananda said. There are “a lot of farms, especially in the Northern Province. We are getting foreign exchange too.”

The invertebrate found on the sea floor is not commonly consumed by Sri Lankans, so they are being exported to countries like China, Devananda said.

“Sea cucumber, especially our people, they are not eating, it is in China, they are eating.”

Last year the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources told EconomyNext that a kilo of sea cucumber is valued at 20,000-30,000 rupees.

Devananda proposed the establishment of hatcheries as an alternative to catching wild sea cucumbers. (Colombo/Jun11/2024)

*2024-06-11 17:25:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185846) · `ta`

Ranil Wickremesinghe may extend his term and Parliament's lifespan by one year due to a constitutional loophole not addressed since the 19th Amendment in 2015 aimed at democratic reforms. Despite amendments reducing terms to five years, Article 83(D) allows him to extend it without parliamentary approval for extensions over six years, enabling an 11-month extension without constitutional violation. Political analysts suggest he deserves more time as the country isn't ready for elections.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued his term of office and the lifetime of parliament for a further year, according to the Emanami Next website said

Ranil Wickremesinghe may use a mistake of the political system that has not been paid since the 19th Amendment in 2015.

The 19th Amendment sought to ensure democratic reforms and to ensure the nation and reduce the term of the parliament and the president.

Although all the references to the six -year term of the Parliament and the President of the Parliament, in accordance with the 19th Amendment have been changed to five years, Article 83 (D) has given President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure.

Any Bill to extend the five -year tenure of the President or Parliament must be approved by a two -thirds majority in Parliament.

However, under Section 83 (D), the universities are only needed if they are extended for more than six (6) years, not five (5) years

ECONOMYNEXT – India and its Southern Tamil Nadu state should take strict actions against their fishermen who encroach into and involved in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan seas with the usage of banned bottom trawler methods, the island nation’s Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said.

Sri Lanka has seen bottom trawling by Indian fishermen during the peak fishing season in Sri Lanka’s northern waters off Jaffna. Bottom trawling is banned by Sri Lanka and is a punishable offense, which has led to arrest of a raft of Indian fishermen along with their bottom trawlers.

Depletion of fish resources in the Northern sea in the face of continuous Indian bottom trawling, a method of banned fishing that involves dragging heavy weighted nets across the sea floor, has pushed some Northern fishermen to take up Chinese funded sea cucumber farming.

Sri Lanka’s North is just 27 km from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

*2024-06-11 16:46:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185837) · `ta`

The 19th Amendment limits the president's term to five years, preventing extensions beyond this duration.

It's crucial to hold elections promptly to adhere to democratic norms.

🟩

### Risk of diarrhea, viral infection with increased flies

*2024-06-11 15:53:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185824) · `ta`

Floods in Sri Lanka have led to a fly infestation, exacerbating the spread of diarrhea and viral infections due to the presence of organic matter in flood waters. Flies mature quickly and proliferate, spreading pathogens from feces and contaminated surfaces. This increases the risk of diseases like diarrhea and viral fever, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, and fever. To combat this, it's crucial to use covered containers, manage waste, ensure clean water, and seek immediate medical attention to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

🟩

Deepal Perera, a specialist on the children's disease of the Children's Hospital in Colombo, said that the floodwaters in the country are increasing the proliferation of flies and the spread of diarrhea and viral infection.

The presence of a large number of organic substances in flooded areas accelerates the maturity of the eggs and leads to the rapid increase in the number of flies when flooding is reduced.

These newly fried flies, searching for food resources, often go to feces, debris and contaminated surfaces and further enhance the health crisis.

He pointed out that the effects of increasing flies are scary and that flies bring pathogens, including diarrhea and viral fever, etc.

"If you eat contaminated food and water, you can lead to many symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and relaxed feces," he said.

He also said that the risk of viral infection, characterized by symptoms such as fever, headaches and nausea, also increases in areas where flies are high.

### Constitutional Error Could Give Ranil and Parliament Another Year

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s constitution could allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by almost a year due to a mistake in the constitution that has been overlooked since the 19th Amendment in April 2015.

The sweeping 19th Amendment sought to establish democratic reforms, ensure good governance, and shorten the terms of both the president and parliament to five years. However, it neglected to ensure consistency regarding tenure.

While all references to the six-year terms of both the president and parliament were changed to five years in line with the 19th Amendment, Article 83(b) was overlooked and left unchanged, giving President Wickremesinghe a loophole to extend his term.

Any bill to extend the five-year term of the president or parliament requires approval in parliament with a two-thirds majority, followed by endorsement at a referendum.

*2024-06-11 15:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185830) · `ta`

Sri Lanka faces significant economic challenges, including a rising international debt exceeding $100 billion, with unpaid loan interests surpassing $6.4 billion. The country's economic growth shrank by 7.3% in 2022 and is projected to grow by only 2% in 2023, with revenue levels lower than two years ago. Political instability, particularly regarding upcoming elections, further complicates the situation. Despite efforts to restructure debt with the IMF, the burden on citizens is expected to worsen. The government's handling of the economic crisis and the necessity of fair and timely elections are crucial for restoring confidence and addressing the nation's pressing issues.

🟩

People do not wait for long rows of gas in petrol or gas. But the economic statistics are worrisome. The country's international debt is continuously increasing as it was before the economic downturn.

Sri Lanka's international debt was about US $ 80 billion in the event of an economic crisis two years ago. According to news reports, amid the slight development of some major economic activities, such as Sri Lanka's credit marriage, has now exceeded $ 100 billion.. At the same time, the first interest and interest of some of the unpaid loans has exceeded $ 6.4 billion.
