  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, commonly known as Pillayan, visited the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday to provide a statement regarding ongoing investigations into claims made in a Channel 4 documentary related to the 2019 Easter Sunday terrorist attacks. This marks his second appearance before the CID in connection with the case.",
    "Pillayan, who had first appeared on 20 November, provided a five-hour statement but had requested to give his statement in Tamil as well. As a result, the CID arranged for translation services, and he was asked to return to complete the process on 22 November.",
    "The investigation stems from a controversial Channel 4 video aired on 8 June 2023, which featured an interview with Hanzeer Azad Maulana, the former media spokesperson for the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) party, led by Pillayan. Maulana, now residing in Switzerland, claims he met with the bombers responsible for the 2019 attacks while he was imprisoned on charges related to the murder of a political rival. In the 50-minute interview, Maulana names Pillayan, military intelligence head Major General Suresh Salley, and the Rajapaksa family as the masterminds behind the bombings, which killed 269 people across six churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on 21 April 2019.",
    "These allegations prompted a complaint filed by Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) Executive Director Reverend Father Rohan Silva, leading the Ministry of Public Security to initiate an investigation. Subsequently, the CID began its inquiry into the contents of the Channel 4 video.",
    "Pillayan had originally been summoned to the CID on 12 November but failed to appear, requesting an alternative date through his legal team. The CID rescheduled his appearance for 20 November, during which he arrived at approximately 9:30 a.m. to provide his statement.",
    "Before his appearance, Pillayan addressed the media and criticised the Sri Lankan Government for not taking action against his former media secretary, Azad Maulana. He called on the authorities to repatriate Maulana back to Sri Lanka for an independent investigation into the attacks.",
    "\u201cIt is surprising how the CID is assisting Azad Maulana in maintaining his personal lifestyle abroad,\u201d Pillayan remarked. \u201cIt is completely wrong to associate my name with the Easter attack. If I am proven guilty, I am ready to hang myself,\u201d he said.",
    "The CID\u2019s investigation into the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks continues as it seeks to gather further information from persons linked to the case."
