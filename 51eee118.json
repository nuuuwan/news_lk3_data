    "Working parents in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka can now access high-quality early childhood development and childcare options with the opening of St Mary\u2019s Montessori House of Children and Day Care Centre, supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), government of Australia, Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC) and Sarvodaya.",
    "Developed under the Women in Work program, a partnership between IFC and the Australian government, this pilot project \u2013 initiated in response to an IFC study \u2013 is centred around designing a scalable business approach to childcare that can be replicated and adapted across the country. The 2022 IFC study among 1,000 employees from 37 companies across Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts found that companies lost 99 million Sri Lankan Rupees annually in productivity due to employee absenteeism, distractions, and delays. Almost two-thirds of parents surveyed reported dissatisfaction with their existing childcare arrangements. Over half of parents said they would make use of a childcare service if one were available.",
    "\u201cAddressing childcare stands as a critical hurdle for working women, often impeding or halting their substantial contributions to the economy. As an organization dedicated to sustainability and inclusivity, Commercial Bank is proud to collaborate with IFC, DFAT, and Sarvodaya to establish the first early childhood Centre under this initiative,\u201d said Commercial Bank Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Sanath Manatunge. \u201cIn today\u2019s socio-economic landscape, we firmly believe this initiative will serve as a crucial support system, empowering families\u2014especially working women\u2014to sustain their economic engagements with assurance.\u201d",
    "The opening of the Centre is a continuation of IFC\u2019s work in advancing women\u2019s employment opportunities in Sri Lanka by tackling childcare. This initiative also presents childcare sector as a significant untapped opportunity for women entrepreneurs to venture into, creating new jobs while also providing much needed options for childcare.",
    "\u201cWomen\u2019s economic empowerment goes beyond achieving economic growth for a country. When women are empowered, they make meaningful decisions that benefit themselves, their households and communities \u2013 a win-win for everyone. Expanding access to quality, affordable childcare means freeing up more mothers to enter or remain in the workforce. For Sri Lanka, this is crucial for an inclusive, resilient recovery,\u201d said IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives Alejandro Alvarez de la Campa. \u201cThe opening of the new early childhood development Centre not only symbolizes our collective commitment to creating a supportive environment for working parents, but also sends a strong signal to women entrepreneurs who can explore childcare as a thriving new business opportunity.\u201d",
    "The facility, which can accommodate up to 50 children from ages 6 months to 10 years, will provide infant care, early childhood education, pre-school and pre-kindergarten services as well as nutritious meals and after school care options. As the local implementing partner, Sarvodaya spearheaded the renovations of the facility to provide children with the suitable setting to foster growth and development.",
    "\u201cChild wellbeing and women empowerment have been core areas of Sarvodaya\u2019s community development work for over six decades. We are very pleased to partner with IFC, DFAT, and CBC in this unique project which promotes an entrepreneurial approach to women empowerment by establishing modern childcare and development facilities in the Eastern Province. This project addresses a major impediment to women labor participation and Sarvodaya is committed to promote this model throughout the country,\u201d said Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement President Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne.",
    "IFC\u2019s study across the three Eastern districts in Sri Lanka highlights that women lose on average 30 working days per year compared to 27 days by men. Aside from its impacts on women\u2019s labor force participation, the absence of accessible childcare has also created difficulties for Sri Lankan employers in recruiting and retaining skilled workers, along with high absenteeism, low maternity return rates and inadequate leadership diversity.",
    "\u201cAustralia is proud to have supported the establishment of a new childcare centre in Batticaloa through our Women in Work Program,\u201d said Australian High Commissioner for Sri Lanka Paul Stephens. \u201cWe know Sri Lankan women, especially those residing outside of Colombo, need more support to encourage them back to the workforce after they start a family. We hope this pilot project will inspire other providers to invest in quality childcare services for women across the country.\u201d",
    "IFC plans to roll out the second phase of this initiative in Ampara and raise awareness among local communities to promote the uptake in investing in childcare, specifically on the business opportunities it provides for women entrepreneurs."
