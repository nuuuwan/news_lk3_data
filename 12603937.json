    "3. Economic confidence | negative (-) 43.8 | Multiple choice questions on the condition and trajectory of the economy were used to generate an economic confidence score. The score can range from negative (-) 100 to positive (+) 100. A score above zero means more people see the economic conditions positively rather than negatively. If everyone thinks that the economy is in poor condition (instead of good or excellent), and everyone also thinks it is getting worse (rather than better), then the score will be a (-) 100.",

The poll is conducted as a part of the syndicated survey instrument by Verit\u00e9 Research. This instrument also provides other organisations the opportunity to survey the sentiments of Sri Lanka."
