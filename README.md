The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has strongly refuted recent claims regarding the revision of electricity tariffs.

Addressing the controversy, the CEB clarified its position on a proposal submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on October 24, 2024, which recommended a reduction in electricity tariffs by a range of 6% to 11%.

Issuing a statement, the CEB said that this proposal was based on projected expenses for the final quarter of 2024, revenue data from the second and third quarters, and the repayment of loans incurred during 2014–2022.

The submission was made following the current tariff calculation methodology, it added, noting that however, the ‘electricity sector regulator’ rejected the proposal, citing the need to implement any tariff revisions considering the first six months of 2025, rather than the last quarter of 2024.
