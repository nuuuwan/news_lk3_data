  "original_body_lines": [
    "Some 110 million people have had to flee their homes because of conflict, persecution, or human rights violations, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says. The war in Sudan, which has displaced nearly 2 million people since April, is but the latest in a long list of crises that has led to the record-breaking figure.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s quite an indictment on the state of our world,\u201d Filippo Grandi, who leads the U.N. refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva ahead of the publication Wednesday of UNHCR\u2019s Global Trends Report for 2022.",
    "Last year alone, an additional 19 million people were forcibly displaced including more than 11 million who fled Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in what became the fastest and largest displacement of people since World War II.",
    "\u201cWe are constantly confronted with emergencies,\u201d Grandi said. Last year the agency recorded 35 emergencies, three to four times more than in previous years. \u201cVery few make your headlines,\u201d Grandi added, arguing that the war in Sudan fell off most front pages after Western citizens were evacuated.",
    "Conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Myanmar were also responsible for displacing more than 1 million people within each country in 2022.",
    "The majority of the displaced globally have sought refuge within their nation\u2019s borders. One-third of them - 35 million - have fled to other countries, making them refugees, according to the UNHCR report. Most refugees are hosted by low to middle-income countries in Asia and Africa, not rich countries in Europe or North America, Grandi said.",
    "Turkey currently hosts the most refugees with 3.8 million people, mostly Syrians who fled the civil war, followed by Iran with 3.4 million refugees, mostly Afghans. But there are also 5.7 million Ukrainian refugees scattered across countries in Europe and beyond. The number of stateless people has also risen in 2022 to 4.4 million, according to UNHCR data, but this is believed to be an underestimate.",
    "Regarding asylum claims, the U.S. was the country to receive the most new applications in 2022 with 730,400 claims. It\u2019s also the nation with the largest backlog in its asylum system, Grandi said.",
    "\u201cOne of the things that needs to be done is reforming that asylum system so that it becomes more rapid, more efficient,\u201d he said.",
    "The United States, Spain and Canada recently announced plans to create asylum processing centers in Latin America with the goal of reducing the number of people who trek their way north to the Mexico-U.S. border.",
    "As the number of asylum-seekers grows, so have the challenges facing them. \u201cWe see pushbacks. We see tougher and tougher immigration or refugee admission rules. We see in many countries the criminalization of immigrants and refugees, blaming them for everything that has happened,\u201d Grandi said.",
    "Last week European leaders renewed financial promises to North African nations in the hopes of stemming migration across the Mediterranean while the British government insists on a so-far failed plan to ship asylum-seekers to Rwanda, something UNHCR is opposed to. But there were also some wins, Grandi said, pointing to what he described as a positive sign in the European Union\u2019s negotiations for a new migration and asylum pact, despite criticism from human rights groups.",
    "Grandi also celebrated the fact that the number of refugees resettled in 2022 doubled to 114,000 from the previous year. But he admitted this was \u201cstill a drop in the ocean.\u201d"
