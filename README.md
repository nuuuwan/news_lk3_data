Maithripala Sirisena's potential move to the United People's Power is viewed positively by Vijayadasa Rajapaksa, a presidential candidate from the National Democratic Front. Rajapaksa expressed his support for Sirisena's decision during a press conference after filing his nomination for the upcoming presidential election. He criticized the lack of discipline among some candidates and their supporters, urging the Election Commission to maintain order. Rajapaksa also highlighted concerns over the perception of Sri Lanka's political climate by international observers.

🟩

I heard that Maithripala Sirisena, who supported me, was going to join the United People's Power. "I think it is very good if he does so," said Vijayadasa Rajapaksa, the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Front. "

He was speaking to the media after filing a nomination for the presidential election at the Elections Secretariat in Rajagiriya on Thursday.

In the filing of nominations, the discipline has not been seen so far. A few candidates have been very moral within the Election Commission with their supporters and are seen as groups in groups as they act in villages.

What do you think of our country when international countries see such activities?We are worried when international countries see us about us. This is because the countries of the world are looking at how the people who are trying to become the first part of the country are acting.

### Sri Lanka to breach inflation target till 2025 first quarter: Central Bank

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation is expected to be below 3 percent up to the first quarter of 2025 the central bank said, after maintaining inflation around the same levels in the past several months, breaching the lower level of a 5 percent inflation target.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has proposed a 5 percent inflation target, plus or minus two percent to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has apparently accepted it without question.

The agency now projects inflation, giving baseline forecasts and probable projected inflation.

“Given that the quarterly average inflation recorded during Q2-2024 was also below the target by more than 2 percentage points, the projections imply a possible breach of the inflation target, as stipulated in Section 26(5) of the CBA, on the downside in Q3-2024 for the first time, as inflation would have been below the target by more than 2 percentage points during two consecutive quarters,” the central bank said.

*2024-08-16 03:22:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191183) · `ta`

CV Vigneswaran urges TNA to swiftly decide on Tamil candidate, emphasizing the importance of unity among Tamils for the upcoming elections. He highlights the need for a clear stance without party conflicts, advocating for all Tamils to support P. Ariyaderan, seen as a symbol of the Tamil people. Despite majority support within the Sri Lanka Tamil National Party, a decision remains pending due to objections from minority parties.

🟩

All Tamils ​​have to vote for the Tamil people who are the symbol of the Tamil people.

"I am humbled by the Tamil People's Alliance (TNA) leader and Member of Parliament CV Vigneswaran," he said.

He was speaking to the media after the nomination papers held on Thursday (15) at the Elections Commission.

Tamil general candidate P. Ariyaderan is contesting in the Sangu symbol. The presidential election should be thought of on behalf of the Tamil people without thinking. This is a must.

To make a decision about the future of the Tamil people without being conflicted with the party. 89 party parties have chosen PA Ariendran as a symbol of the Tamil people. It is no longer necessary to talk about him or his party.

All the Tamil people should vote for Ariyaderan, who is a symbol of the Tamil people. It is sad that the Sri Lankan TNA does not make a firm decision on the Tamil candidate issue.

### Harry Jayawardena: Hardnosed businessman with the softest heartbeat

*2024-08-16 02:49:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Harry-Jayawardena-Hardnosed-businessman-with-the-softest-heartbeat/4-765609) · `en`

Almost 20 years ago, I received a call from Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena. Of course, at the time I knew him as ‘Harry Jayawardena’ as did many SriLankans, especially in business circles. I was in England, veritably forced into exile by political circumstances which included the abduction and torture of the deputy editor of ‘The Nation,’ a newspaper published by Rivira Media Corporation, of which I was at the time the Managing Director, and a brutal attack on Upali Tennakoon, the editor of our sister newspaper in Sinhala. These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickrematunge implored me to leave the countryand not too long before he himself was killed.

It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didn’t give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didn’t count Harry among them.

### Elections, regime shift, and transformation of the State

The resulting battles will thus to a large degree continue to determine the ultimate significance of any regime that emerges in the immediate aftermath of the election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Elections offer an opportunity to measure the re-composition of social forces. New coalitions are tested, new alliances become possible, and ultimately there is a period of policy convergence. Under ideal circumstances, this process results in the consolidation of a new regime capable of governing over the long run. In a parliamentary democratic system, such a hegemonic bloc can accommodate the rotation of parties in and out of power. The clearest examples in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history, of course, are the ‘intermediate regime’ from 1956 to 1977 and the neoliberal ‘open economy’ that has characterised policy making from 1977 up to the present.

An Australian Federal Court judge has slammed the Home Affairs Department for failing to properly scrutinise a Sri Lankan diplomat who confiscated a staffer’s passport and gave her just two days leave in three years, Australian media reported today.

Sri Lanka’s former deputy high commissioner to Australia has been ordered to pay $543,000 in unpaid wages and interest to a domestic worker and now faces a large fine for breaches of employment laws.

Himalee Arunatilaka, who served in Canberra from 2015 to 2018, denied her employee, Priyanka Danaratna, minimum pay and conditions during time in Australia, the court found.

Justice Elizabeth Raper found Ms Danaratna worked from 6am to 10pm, seven days a week and was only allowed two days off in that time after she burnt her hand with cooking oil.

The Sri Lanka Missions in Yangon and Bangkok worked to ensure their safe release, and they are now in Mae Sot, Thailand, the ministry said in a statement.

“All the rescued Sri Lankans are in good health, and Thai authorities are facilitating Consular assistance,” the ministry said.

The Sri Lankan Embassy in Bangkok is coordinating with Thai authorities to repatriate them.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urges the public to be cautious and to adhere to the proper procedures when pursuing employment opportunities abroad, so as not to fall victim to human trafficking.”
