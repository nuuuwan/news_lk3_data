### Biden warns Netanyahu US policy depends on Gaza civilian protection

President Joe Biden warned Israel of a sharp shift in his policy over the Gaza war Thursday amid growing frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu and mounting domestic pressure in a US election year.

A tense phone call between the two leaders appeared to yield at least some results, as Netanyahu’s office announced within hours it would temporarily allow more aid to flow into Gaza.

Biden has stood solidly behind Israel and its prime minister since Hamas’s October 7 attacks, and his criticism of civilian deaths in Gaza has not stopped Washington from supplying military hardware to its key ally.

But the Democrat faces spiraling anger from Muslim and younger voters over his support for Israel, and political allies have been pressing him to make the aid conditional on changed Israeli behavior.

In a 30-minute call with Netanyahu after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers from US-based charity World Central Kitchen, Biden hinted at doing just that.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is looking to establish a public private partnership at the National Ayurveda Teaching Hospital located at Cotta Road, Borella due to a lack of funds, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody, has said.

“We have 180 rooms in Borella and we wish to go for a private-public partnership. However, there is a political party – trade union that does not let us sign such an agreement,” Jayakody said on Thursday.

In the past, staff have protested saying the understaffing made it almost impossible to function. They also said the hospital lacked funds to provide medicines, and meals for patients who were admitted there.

“There are a lot of shortages. This is why we want to have paying wards,” Jayakody said. “Sick people are willing to pay.”

Jayakody said that Western medical services receive the majority of government funding with Ayurveda medicine receiving only 2 percent of funding. (Colombo/Apr5/2024)

### Political coalitions purely in pursuit of power will aggravate political immorality and unethical behavior

It appears that there is unanimity in the public perception of an overwhelming number of Sri Lankans that Sri Lanka has gone beyond the point of resurrection when it comes to immorality, unethical behaviour, corruption, lack of law and order and poor governance

“Political ethics requires leaders to meet higher standards than would be necessary for private life. They may have less of a right to privacy than ordinary citizens do, or no right to use their office for personal profit. Personal or private morality and political morality are often viewed as a conflict of interest” – Andrew Stark, Conflict of Interest in American Public Life. (Harvard University Press, 2003)

### Can the IMF program be renegotiated by a future government?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chairs a meeting with the IMF in Colombo – File photo

In my opinion, the IMF program Sri Lanka has got now is lenient when you compare it with many other countries. The 17th IMF program may not be enough even if implemented fully. Therefore, there is very little space to make changes in the broader program targets.

1.Achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

2.Bring annual foreign currency debt service from 9.4% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP during 2027-2032. Reduce the government’s gross financial needs which was at 35% of GDP in 2022 down to below 13% from 2027-2032.

3.Public debt, which was 128% to GDP, should be reduced to 95% by 2032.

If there were to be any renegotiations of the IMF deal by a future government, it will have to change one or all of the above. Let me go through them one by one.

Target 1 - Primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

### Open letter to President on rapid transformation of SL

The Presidential Media Division and the Daily News released press releases and media news items titled “Country set for rapid transformation into an export economy” quoting remarks made by you at the inauguration ceremony of a historic temple in Kegalle.

As a caring citizen I said, “three cheers”, happily thinking that at last, the country was on the correct governance path focusing on the creation of new strategic leadership options and policy changes to encourage present and new investors to produce tradable goods and engage in external services. I was delighted that the statement began with a reference that Sri Lanka can no longer continue to rely on borrowings (presumably external?) to address the imbalance between imports and exports, which if pursued will inevitably lead to another economic crisis within a decade.

In almost all sectors and occupations, women tend to earn, on average, less than men, despite generally having higher educational attainments – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Wage disparities between men and women remain significant in Sri Lanka and have not significantly closed in the last decade. Renewed policy efforts can close this persistent yet remediable gender gap to promote a more inclusive economic recovery

In most countries around the world, women earn substantially less than men. At the global level, the gender pay gap is estimated at 20%. This issue concerns countries across all geographical regions, regardless of their stage of economic development.

Growth is the fundamental focal point behind any business decision. However, whether businesses achieve meaningful growth is the big question today. For the growth to be meaningful it has to come at a decreasing marginal cost. Meaningful growth happens only where businesses build with scalable DNA.

### Sustainability in business – or corporate greenwash

*2024-04-05 04:50:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sustainability-in-business-or-corporate-greenwash/4-760321) · `en`

‘Sustain’ is derived from Latin and it means hold up or support. Its etymology suggests endurance without yielding; continuity without downfall. Sustainability, by extension, may well be the capability of sustaining, but in common speech and in commercial jargon it has become a vague and abused term, laying claim to a plethora of definitions. What then does sustainability mean, and what should it mean in business? What ought we sustain, and does sustenance suffice?

The need to address sustainability in business arose because irresponsibility in commerce and industry have led inter alia to scarcity of clean water, drain of natural resources, ill health of communities, strained employees and landfills of unsold produce – not only when mistakes have occurred, but even when operating as designed and being economically profitable.

Says statement and lack of accountability raises concerns about security lapses that led to these attacks

Stresses it is deeply concerned by nonchalance surrounding investigation into Easter Sunday attacks

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed concern regarding the recent statement by former President Maithripala Sirisena concerning his knowledge of the mastermind behind the terror attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019.

This statement, coupled with the ongoing lack of accountability for these heinous acts, raises serious questions about potential security lapses that led to the death of innocent civilians.

The BASL reiterated its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for the victims.

“In this spirit, the BASL filed a Fundamental Rights application, against the former President, other members of the leadership, and senior officials for their failure to discharge their fundamental duties towards the people of our country,” the organisation said.

### A face-off that promises a surprise ending - EDITORIAL

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and his camp received a positive response from the National People’s Power (NPP) for a debate on the country’s economy. It’s a bit strange for the NPP to have agreed to a face-off with Premadasa because the JVP-led alliance prefers staging debates in an environment where experts speak on topics where analysis, statistics, reasoning and logic shape the direction of the ‘conversation’.

We all know that ‘conversation’ might not be the most appropriate word to use in the context of a debate. Debates where Sri Lankan lawmakers feature in are hostile and very seldom do parties at loggerheads accept shortcomings and agree on a compromise. But this time around things might be different, according to reports reaching us from reliable sources.

The April 1 attack by Israel on the Iranian consular office in the Syrian capital of Damascus, killing several people including a senior Revolutionary Guard general and diplomats, is a potential trigger for a regional war. Let the entire world suffer and let millions of people die in such a war, which will have a devastating effect on developing countries. Israel will not stop until it conquers the world.

This is not a dark prophecy. Israel is well on the path to achieving its ambitions. With the West, the Arab world, and one-time Non-Aligned Movement stars paying obeisance to Israel, the Zionist state believes it is special and above the law. It believes international human rights laws, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and myriad United Nations mechanisms for a rules-based world order are only for nations other than Israel.

I hold Narendra Modi in high regard due to his remarkable leadership skills and rapid political growth. He has not continued the Ayodhya temple issue, prevented its ramifications from significantly affecting India’s political landscape. Moreover, his diplomatic efforts to elevate India’s global standing are commendable.

I have closely observed Modi’s evolving ideologies, particularly in his approach towards fostering strong business growth in India. While acknowledging India’s shift towards an open and liberal economy under Modi’s leadership, it’s notable that he seldom acknowledges the pivotal role played by Manmohan Singh, a Congress member, in spearheading this transformation.
