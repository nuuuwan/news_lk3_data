    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Former Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna MP Premnath Dolawatte said the objective of the MPs that supported former President Ranil Wickremesinghe is not to form a government but to form a strong opposition.",
    "Speaking to reporters following a meeting between SLPP and other ex MPs who backed Wickremesinghe during the presidential election, Dolawatte said they do not intend to sabotage the new Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP) government.",
    "\u201cAt this time, we wish to respect the people\u2019s choice. The people will give the JVP the ability to govern. We must form a strong opposition. We don\u2019t want to grab government power so that President Dissanayake finds it difficult to work. That\u2019s not our aim. Our goal is to build a strong opposition and support the good things the government does and criticise the bad,\u201d the former MP said.",
    "\u201cThere are talks. It\u2019s not about them coming here to join the gas cylinder. There are talks on forming a broad opposition,\u201d he said when asked about reported attempts at a reconciliation between Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) and rival presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).",
    "Premadasa, who has been named as the SJB\u2019s prime ministerial \u201ccandidate\u201d for the parliamentary election scheduled for November 14, has insisted that he does not wish to work with Wickremesinghe, which would effectively rule out a reunification of the old UNP. The SJB is a splinter group of the UNP that broke off leading up to the 2020 parliamentary polls.",
    "Wickremesinghe, for his part, has said he does not wish to contest future elections in keeping with a UNP tradition, according to several party spokesmen who spoke to the media on Tuesday.",
    "UNP deputy leader Ruwan Wijewardene said on Tuesday that the party has invited senior members of the SJB for discussions on a possible alliance targeting the next parliamentary election which will likely be held in December 2024 following a widely anticipated dissolution of parliament by newly sworn-in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
