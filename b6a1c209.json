    "Says Govt. plans on creating manufacturing economy to ensure prosperous future for all",
    "Affirms commitment to providing welfare benefits to all deserving groups",
    "Urges youth not to let politically minded people derail DDO program",
    "Chief Presidential Staff and Senior Adviser on National Security to President Sagala Ratnayake emphasised that the Government\u2019s priority is setting the nation on the right path rather than engaging in political manoeuvring.",
    "Speaking to the Young Professionals Organisation (YPO) in Colombo, he reiterated the commitment to deliver on key policies and ensure a prosperous future for the people of the country.",
    "Ratnayake stated that the Government\u2019s policy is focused on developing a robust manufacturing industry to secure a bright future for the nation\u2019s youth. To provide ample opportunities within the country, the Government seeks to prevent the exodus of the youth seeking employment overseas.",
    "\u201cThe youth need a future. We can\u2019t have all of them going overseas,\u201d he said.",
    "He also stressed the importance of building a strong domestic economy supported by education, a thriving tourism sector, and backing for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), whilst recognising the immense contribution from young expatriate workers for nation building activities.",
    "He highlighted the Government\u2019s commitment to ensuring welfare benefits reach those who genuinely deserve them. He clarified that these benefits are funded by taxpayers\u2019 money and will be allocated to those in need.",
    "Refuting misinformation surrounding the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) program, Ratnayake addressed unfounded claims that the banks would collapse, deposits would be seized, and the EPF capital would be taken over.",
    "He reassured the youth that none of these scenarios occurred, and in fact, the banks have grown stronger, whilst the EPF remains intact. The purpose of the DDO is to optimise the country\u2019s domestic debt management and maintain the interest rate at an appropriate level for the EPF fund. In the event the interest rate falls below the specified percentage, the Government has pledged to step in and ensure the promised returns.",
    "\u201cWe want you to take this message around because you can deliver it to other professionals who, in turn, can take it to the people in general,\u201d Ratnayake urged the young professionals.",
    "He encouraged them to combat misinformation and false narratives that may discourage people from understanding the true story and path of the country\u2019s development.",
    "\u201cSo, don\u2019t let the evil people, the politically minded people, derail this program. You should all stand together. You help those who find it difficult to understand and may tend to go believe the stories that are being told instead of understanding the real story. This way the country can continue to go on this path and have a future for its younger generation. We want you to take this message around because you can deliver it to other professionals who in turn can take it to the people in general,\u201d he added."
