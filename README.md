### Trump and AKD: the vital differences

*2024-11-18 14:27:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/trump-and-akd-the-vital-differences/) ┬╖ `en`

The people of the United States of America elected that countryтАЩs 47th president on November 5, 2024. Donald Trump, who had served as the 45th president and was defeated by Joe Biden, made an unprecedented comeback, securing 312 votes of the electoral college. It left those who backed his main opponent, Democratic Party candidate and serving Vice President, Kamala Harris, in shock. After all, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York and is currently facing charges of fraud, election subversion, and obstruction.

How on earth did he even get on the ballot? How on earth did he win? Are those who voted for him ignorant of his criminal record? Have they forgotten how he covered himself in ignominy in the aftermath of losing the 2020 election? These are the questions that his detractors ask.

TrumpтАЩs proposed cabinet appointments short on quality, long on slavish loyalty

Last week, in the despair I felt in the aftermath of the election to the US presidency of the most evil man in the United States, I wrote that I will take a break to lick my wounds and get over my distress at the apparent catastrophe that has befallen my second home. Then I realized that this is not the end of the world, though it sure felt like it on the morning after the election.

I learned that I was not alone in these feelings of despair. TrumpтАЩs win had sparked off an unprecedented increase in Google searches reflecting a growing interest among Americans in relocating to foreign countries, New Zealand heading the list with an astonishing 7,600% increase! The next most popular Google search was тАЬthe least painful way to kill yourselfтАЭ.

Last weekтАЩs presidential election was doubtless one of the most consequential in US history. Though the outcome was not predictable тАУ most polls showed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump тАУ with the benefit of hindsight one can say that the Democrats should have seen it coming. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be a slew of analyses and diagnoses claiming to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. Yet as Sri Lankan political analyst Rajni Gamage rightly put it in a recent tweet, such diagnoses are themselves problematic, and point to the biases of those making them.

ЁЯЯй

Geetanath Kasilingam, Chief Organizer of the Jaffna District of Sri Lanka PA, said that the concession on the concession of the newly elected National People's Power from the Jaffna District Ilangumaran is commanding.

He made the allegation in a press release issued on Monday (18) on the comments of MP Ilangumaran that he would not get any concessions for MPs.

Geetanath said that this claim is one of the clowns. The government's offer and allowances are aimed at serving the people.

Avoiding these privileges in any way, the country's economy or income is not going to be raised.

So use these offers and allowances to serve people. Although it is your choice to get and avoid these concessions, the people of Jaffna Kilinochchi Election District have elected you as a Member of Parliament by your confidence in your confidence.. People expect the problems and needs of the people to recognize that responsibility and provide them with a solution.
