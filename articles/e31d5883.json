    "Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam yesterday said the hartal in the North and East was called off by noon the same day after Government assurances to investigate the death of a 32-year-old in Mullaitivu caused by the military.",
    "\u201cThe hartal called by the ITAK was a resounding success. Following (Sunday\u2019s) press briefing by the Cabinet Spokesperson, and based on assurances given regarding the investigation and steps being taken towards the removal of Army camps, we decided to limit the hartal until 12 p.m.,\u201d he said on \u2018X.\u2019",
    "\u201cI also strongly condemn the actions of National People\u2019s Power (NPP) members in the North and East who have reportedly threatened shop owners to keep their businesses open or face legal consequences \u2014 such intimidation is a clear violation of the people\u2019s democratic right to protest,\u201d he added.\u00a0 However, it was reported that most shops in Jaffna were open, while shops in Kilinochchi stayed shut till about 10:30 a.m. and business and other day-to-day activities in Vavuniya were carried out as usual.",
    "Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa on Sunday said that investigations were underway. \u201cThree Army personnel have already been arrested and handed over to the Court,\u201d Dr. Jayatissa said.",
