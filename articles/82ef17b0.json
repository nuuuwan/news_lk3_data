  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The International Monetary fund said it will discuss the timing of the next review of the program and looked forward to working with the new President.",
    "\u201cWe look forward to working together with President Dissanayake and his team towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery since entering one of its worst economic crises in 2022,\u201d an IMF spokesperson said.",
    "\u201cWe will discuss the timing of the third review of the IMF-supported program with the new administration as soon as practicable.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has reached key quantity targets in the program including foreign reserves and the Asian Development Bank has already disbursed funds on structural benchmarks linked to its policy loans.",
    "Sri Lanka however has to reach a new staff level agreement on the next phase of the IMF program and also compile a budget in line with program targets, analysts say.",
    "The review of the IMF program on June data, was due in October. Following the presidential election in September, general elections are also expected around November.",
    "Sri Lanka has run into forex shortages ever since a central bank was set up in 1950 triggering inflation, trade controls, and also social unrest and multiple IMF programs from the mid 1960s.",
    "From around 1978 Sri Lanka lost a credible anchor for money, after the IMF second amendment of its articles, and macro-economists started to depreciate the currency and the country and started to suffer greater inflation than the Great Inflation and heightened social unrest.",
    "At the time the country did not have large volumes of commercial debt to suddenly lose market access.",
    "Since the end of a civil war in 2009 Sri Lanka started aggressive open market operations to target the average weighted call money rate including with excess liquidity despite operating a reserve collecting central bank and denied protection of a policy corridor to the nation.",
    "Monetary stability was denied in all years after the civil war other than in 2010, 2013, 2017 and 2019, leading to a rise in foreign debt and eventual default.",
    "In every other year inflationary open market operations to narrowly target the policy rate led to balance of payments deficits (forex shortages) and excessive OMO refinanced credit, losing ability to settle outflows with current inflows, analysts have said.",
    "To finance external outflows with current inflows (squeezing current outflows), domestic credit and investments have to be reduced (or crowded out) at an appropriate interest rate, linked to balance of payments developments in a country with a reserve collecting central bank.",
    "The injections of money led to reserve run-downs as well as the inability to repay maturing foreign debt and oil imports with current flows, which were financed by new foreign debt including for oil despite market pricing in 2018.",
    "The oil import debt has also been absorbed by the central government.",
    "Since the third quarter of 2022 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has run broadly deflationary operations, keeping the balance of payments in surplus and reducing current outflows. (Colombo/Aug24/2024)"
