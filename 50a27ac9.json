    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will provide early retirement to a 34,000 strong civil defence force that protected villages from Tamil Tigers during a civil war, state minister for defence Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon said.",
    "Sri Lanka was spending 20 billion rupees a year to maintain the force now.",
    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said there was a plan to pay compensation of 3 million rupees for early retirement of a civil protection force member. Premadasa said that was not enough.",
    "There are about 34,000 personnel in the civil defence force, State Minister Tennakoon said.",
    "According to Tennakoon about 4,500 are in temples, 5,000 are involved in the ali weta (elephant fence), and some are outside their work domain.",
    "\u201cSome are at home while earning a salary, and have to give them paddy kilos. I don\u2019t know how we can sustain a department running like this,\u201d Tennakoon said.",
    "\u201cWe have to fix the system. We can\u2019t ascertain if they are working on the ali weta, we don\u2019t have information on what they do in temples, they are in the same place for 10-15 years.\u201d",
    "The minister said there were requests for a voluntary retirement scheme.",
    "\u201cSome want to work only where they live. This is a big problem. For a year we have to allocate 20 billion for the civil defence force.\u201d",
    "The civil defence force was made up of many farmers. Now they were allowed to go back to villages and had to bring back some paddy, but that was not a proper way to run a system, Tennakoon said."
