எல்லோருக்கும் பிரான்ஸ் அல்லது பாரிஸ் என்றதும் கம்பீரமாக நிற்கும் ஈபிள் கோபுரம் தான் சட்டென கண்முன் வந்து செல்லும். உலக அளவில் அனைவரும் அறிந்த அடையாள சின்னமாக இருக்கும் ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தை நாள்தோறும் உள்நாடு மற்றும் வெளிநாடு என சுமார் 25,000 மக்கள் பார்வையிடுவது வழக்கம். இந்த சூழலில் தான் அதில் தீ விபத்து ஏற்பட்டது.

ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தில் உள்ள லிப்ட் ஷாஃப்டின் கேபிளில் ஏற்பட்ட அதீத வெப்பம் தான் தீ விபத்துக்கு காரணம் என்ற தகவல் வெளியாகி உள்ளது. தீப்பற்றியதை அடுத்து சுற்றுலா பயணிகள் வெளியேற்றப்பட்டனர். தொடர்ந்து தீயணைப்பு படை வீரர்கள் போராடி தீயை அணைத்தனர். இதற்கு முன்னர் கடந்த 1956-ல் ஈபிள் கோபுரத்தில் தீ விபத்து ஏற்பட்டுள்ளது. அப்போது ஏற்பட்ட பாதிப்புகளை சீர் செய்ய ஓராண்டு காலம் பிடித்தது குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.

ISIS LTTE threaten Mahinda Rajapakse security concerns withdrawal soldiers police protection insufficient

🟩

Former President Mahinda Rajapakse has been threatened with murder from ISIS terrorists and LTTE groups, said Manoj Kamage, Vice President of the Sri Lanka PA (SLPP) Lawyers Association.

He told the media about the security concerns following the withdrawal of soldiers from Rajapakse's security forces.

Kamage criticized the resolution of the Public Security Ministry to appoint police officers for the protection of the former president's protection, replacing the remaining armed soldiers, saying that this was not sufficient to consider the severity of the threats.

He further expressed concern that the replacement of police officers to the former president's safety would be abandoned amid these crisis threats.

"விரும்பத்தகாத விளைவு நேரப்போகிறது என்பதற்கான முன்னறிவிப்பு " (The Writing on the Wall) என்பது பைபிளின் பழைய ஏற்பாட்டில் டானியலின் கதையில் இருந்து வந்த ஒரு உருவகமான மொழிநடையாகும். பாபிலோனிய சாம்ராச்சியத்தின் மன்னர் பெல்ஷாசாரும் அவரது நண்பர்கள் பரிவாரமும் உண்டுகுடித்து கும்மாளம் அடித்துக்கொண்டிருந்தவேளையில், வியக்கத்தக்க முறையில் கையொன்று தோன்றி அங்கிருந்த சுவரில் சில வரிகளை எழுதியதைப் பற்றி டானியல் பற்றிய நூலின் ஐந்தாவது அத்தியாயம் கூறுகிறது.

அச்சமடைந்த மன்னராலும் நண்பர்களினாலும் அந்த கை எழுதியதை வாசித்து விளங்கக்கூடியதாக இருக்கவில்லை. அறிவுக்கும் ஞானத்துக்கும் பிரபல்யமான டானியலை அழைத்துவர மன்னர் ஆளை அனுப்பினார். டானியல் வந்து சுவரில் எழுதியிருப்பதை வாசித்துவிட்டு மன்னரின் நாட்களை கடவுள் எண்ணியிருக்கிறார் என்றும் இராச்சியம் வேறு ஒருவரிடம் கையளிக்கப்படப் போகிறது என்று கூறினார்.சுவரில் எழுதியிருந்த வரிகளை பற்றிய டானியலின் வியாக்கியானம் இறுதியில் உண்மையாக மாறியது.பெல்ஷாசார் அன்றிரவே கொல்லப்பட்டு இராச்சியம் டேறியஸினால் கைப்பற்றப்பட்டது.

In a landmark decision, the Australian Federal Court has fined Himalee Arunatilaka, Sri Lanka’s current Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, over AUD 117,000 for exploiting a domestic worker during her tenure as Deputy High Commissioner in Canberra.

From 2015 to 2018, Priyanka Danaratna, a Sri Lankan national, was employed by Arunatilaka in Canberra. During this period, Danaratna worked extensive hours, often from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., performing household duties without adequate compensation. She was paid less than 65 Australian cents per hour, totaling approximately AUD 11,212 over three years, a stark violation of Australian labor laws.

Danaratna’s working conditions were restrictive; her passport was confiscated, limiting her freedom of movement. She was rarely permitted to leave the residence unaccompanied, effectively placing her in a situation akin to modern slavery.

### The boy who lived: ‘Baby 81’, a survivor of the devastating Sri Lanka tsunami in 2004

*2024-12-25 09:10:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104483/the-boy-who-lived-baby-81-a-survivor-of-the-devastating-sri-lanka-tsunami-in-2004) · `en`

Pulled from the mud as an infant after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and reunited with his parents following an emotional court battle, the boy once known as “Baby 81” is now a 20-year-old dreaming of higher education.

Jayarasa Abilash’s story symbolised that of the families torn apart by one of the worst natural calamities in modern history, but it also offered hope. More than 35,000 people in Sri Lanka were killed, with others missing.

The 2-month-old baby was washed away by the tsunami in eastern Sri Lanka and found some distance from home by rescuers. At the hospital, he was No. 81 on the admissions registry.

His father, Murugupillai Jayarasa, spent three days searching for his scattered family, with little left to his name in those early hours but a pair of shorts.

First he found his mother, then his wife. But their infant son was missing. A nurse had taken the baby from the hospital, but returned him after hearing that his family was alive.
