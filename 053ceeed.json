  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says NPP will mobilise the people against the decision and organise a series of protests",
    "Calls the recent water tariff hike unreasonable given the other economic challenges faced by the people",
    "Claims the economic crisis and related stress are taking a toll on the health of citizens",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake over the weekend disclosed that his party members would promptly initiate mobilisation efforts in response to the excessive increase in water tariffs.",
    "Dissanayake asserted that the party would orchestrate a series of protests and public awareness campaigns to voice their opposition against the recent tariff increase imposed by the Government.",
    "He expressed that the current economic pressures and the prevailing medicinal drugs crisis have exerted a profound impact on the populace, leading to a surge in health-related issues among the people.",
    "\u201cThe prices of goods and services have experienced a substantial rise due to the government\u2019s excessive taxation. Simultaneously, the economy\u2019s collapse has resulted in a staggering number of people facing unemployment, with hundreds of thousands left jobless. As the citizens grapple with the challenges of purchasing fuel, electricity, and other essential commodities, they find themselves confronted with an alarming situation where the fees for water, the most vital necessity, have been unreasonably hiked,\u201d the NPP leader noted.",
    "\u201cThe government\u2019s pursuit of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s objectives has led to significant oppression of the people. In response to these mounting pressures, we stand prepared to launch a substantial campaign demanding the right to live, advocating for the well-being of our citizens against these challenges,\u201d he said.",
    "The NPP leader said the party will first commence a public awareness campaign and mobilise the people against the Government.",
    "\u201cThe people are enduring severe mental strain amidst the grave economic crisis, and this distress is taking a toll on their health. It is disheartening that the government seems to overlook these critical matters,\u201d he added."
