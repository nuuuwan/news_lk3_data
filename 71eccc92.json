    "Exchanging of the MoU at the BASL office: BASL Environmental Law Committee Member/Secretary Savanthi Ponnamperuma AAL, BASL Environmental Law Committee Chairman Ravindranath Dabare, WNPS Past President Sriyan De Silva Wijeratne, WNPS Immediate Past President Spencer Manuelpillai, WNPS Vice President Graham Marshall, BASL Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi, WNPS Legal Subcommittee Chairman and BASL Environmental Law Committee Deputy Chairman Revan Weerasinghe, and BASL Environmental Law Committee Convenor Charaka Jayaratne",
    "In an era where countless environmental offences and crimes are often overlooked or go unpunished, the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) has entered an MoU spanning a period of three years with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL). The partnership\u2019s primary purpose is to ensure greater levels of enforcement of environmental law in Sri Lanka, thereby supporting the conservation of natural resources for the generations to come.",
    "The agreement\u2019s objectives are threefold and comprise joint and collaborative projects between the two parties aimed at 1) increasing awareness and education among lawyers with respect to environmental law in Sri Lanka, 2) increasing the interest in environmental law among lawyers in  Sri Lanka, 3) increasing awareness among lawyers to environmental issues prevalent in the country.",
    "Accordingly, the parties have shortlisted several projects to be conducted during the term of the agreement, including the establishment of a contact list of BASL environmental lawyers for WNPS District Representatives to liaise with in order to obtain the necessary legal expertise and guidance to initiate action in their respective areas. The BASL has further pledged to offer support to the WNPS with respect to any litigations on any critical national issues, as and when the need arises.",
    "Due to a low rate of expertise, knowledge and appreciation on environmental issues, the two parties will conduct an orientation programme with the support of senior environmentalists and resources from the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). The programme will further be conducted on a district basis under the guidance of the BASL. These activities will further be reinforced by webinars conducted for BASL members on environmental issues.",
    "\u201cIn the wake of numerous violations of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance reported daily, we believe that this integral partnership between the WNPS and the BASL addresses a pressing need by supporting the enforcement of environmental law in the country, and upholding justice for the voiceless,\u201d stated BASL Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi.",
    "A regional training program titled \u201cKnow your environmental rights\u201d, for DWC staff, WNPS",
    "District Representatives, and school environmental organisations will be conducted to disseminate essential knowledge and expertise among those serving on the frontlines of environmental conservation.",
    "\u201cWe anticipate that by building knowledge, awareness and interest among key stakeholders, we will be able to safeguard and sustain these essential resources, and protect our nation\u2019s valuable ecosystems in the years to come,\u201d stated WNPS President Jehan CanagaRetna."
