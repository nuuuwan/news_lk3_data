    "Sri Lanka\u2019s creative and craft sector has marked a landmark moment with the launch of SEVA, a transdisciplinary cultural diplomacy project uniting international artistry with Sri Lankan heritage. Beyond its artistic merit, SEVA showcases the untapped trade potential of Sri Lanka\u2019s artisan economy, an area poised to grow into a high-value export sector and attract new investment.",
    "An outcome of the EU\u2013Sri Lanka Matchmaking Program, delivered with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), supported by the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, the Cultural Relations Platform (CRP), with the University of the Arts London (UAL) and the British Council as knowledge partners, and The Institute of Future Creations (TIFC) as program leader, SEVA has also received the backing of the Italian Embassy in Colombo.",
    "Led by Italian visual artist Caterina Roppo, SEVA explores the intersection of art, mental health, and post-traumatic resilience, with a focus on marginalised artisanal communities. Earlier this year, Roppo worked in residency with Sonali Dharmawardena, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most celebrated textile artists, merging contemporary art practice with the country\u2019s textile heritage.",
    "In July 2025, SEVA premiered a short documentary at the Italian Terrae International Film Festival, marking the first time Sri Lankan batik and textile craftsmanship have been presented in this way to an international film audience. It was a world first for Sri Lankan batik to be showcased on the global stage through the medium of film, reaching new audiences and elevating the craft to an international platform. This is more than cultural exposure and awareness. It is a strategic first step toward positioning Sri Lanka\u2019s craft sector in high-value export markets.",
    "The SEVA documentary has also been officially selected to be presented at the III Sal\u00f3n de Videoarte Textil in Buenos Aires, Argentina, further cementing its recognition as a pioneering showcase of Sri Lankan batik and textile artistry on the international stage.",
    "Globally, craft and textiles are becoming increasingly recognised as premium cultural assets with strong market demand. India\u2019s textile and apparel industry, valued at $ 222 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $ 350 billion by 2030, has shown how combining heritage skills with design innovation, branding, and trade agreements can unlock unprecedented export growth. Partnerships like the Chanakya School of Craft\u2019s collaborations with Christian Dior, Gucci, and other luxury brands have turned traditional embroidery and weaving into centrepieces of global fashion weeks.",
    "Sri Lanka stands at a similar inflection point. Rich in diverse crafts, from batik and handloom to lace-making, wood carving, and metalwork, it has the cultural depth to compete in the $ 700+ billion global creative economy, but has yet to fully position itself for scale. By moving craft upstream into the luxury and premium market segment, the country could significantly increase export earnings while creating skilled employment for women and youth in rural areas.",
    "EU/EDB program Project Lead and TIFC Co-Founder Robert Meeder said, \u201cThis project has been about building trust and shared understanding. SEVA proves that Sri Lanka\u2019s creative sector can deliver world-class, socially engaged work with commercial potential, building a foundation for sustainable trade.\u201d",
    "Caterina Roppo said, \u201cSEVA is about creating spaces where vulnerability becomes a source of strength and renewal. My time in Sri Lanka was not only an artistic exchange but also an exploration of how heritage and creativity can connect to market opportunities, ensuring the craft sector thrives both culturally and economically.\u201d",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s craft sector has always had extraordinary talent,\u201d said UAL International Development Manager Hannah Middleton. \u201cSEVA demonstrates how our program supports projects that create meaningful social and cultural impact while building the international visibility needed for long-term commercial success.\u201d",
    "\u201cWorking with Caterina was a journey of mutual discovery,\u201d said Sonali Dharmawardena. \u201cSEVA has shown how collaborations can honour local craftsmanship while opening it to new forms of expression, recognition, and trade pathways. The demand for authentic, high-quality artisanal products is growing year on year in the global marketplace, and projects like this can channel that demand directly to the communities that need it most. By creating premium market opportunities, we can fuel sustainable income growth, preserve heritage skills, and empower women and youth in rural areas to see craft as a viable and rewarding profession.\u201d",
    "Earlier in the year, Caterina was welcomed by the Italian Embassy in Colombo, where she engaged in cultural exchanges highlighting the value of textile arts in diplomacy and economic cooperation.",
    "The message is clear. With targeted design partnerships, market positioning, and investment in creative capacity, Sri Lanka\u2019s craft sector can follow the path of global leaders, creating jobs, driving exports, and securing its place in the world\u2019s most dynamic cultural and commercial markets."
