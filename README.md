The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to prioritise and enact critical legal reforms to strengthen the rule of law in Sri Lanka.

In a written appeal, AHRC Policy and Programs Director Basil Fernando highlighted significant shortcomings in the country’s legal and judicial systems that require immediate attention. The organisation outlined three key areas for reform to ensure justice, transparency, and accountability.

The AHRC called for the daily hearing of serious criminal cases in High Courts to address judicial delays and expedite justice delivery. This, it argued, would significantly improve the efficiency of the judiciary.

Second, the organisation stressed the urgency of introducing comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. Such reforms are essential, the AHRC said, to rebuild public trust in governance and ensure greater accountability across all levels of Government.

### Sri Lanka’s IMF deal: Turning point, but caution is key

*2024-12-23 01:50:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-IMF-deal-Turning-point-but-caution-is-key/4-770896) · `en`

The IMF deal marks the beginning, not the end, of its journey

While Sri Lanka’s IMF deal offers hope, the risks are real. Political instability could derail reforms, as vested interests resist change. Reform fatigue, too, is a genuine concern—if the public does not see tangible benefits soon, support for the program could waver. Globally, external shocks—rising interest rates, slowing trade, or geopolitical tensions—could further complicate the recovery. The Government must proceed with caution. An IMF deal is not a panacea; it is a foundation on which Sri Lanka must build its recovery. Strong institutions, consistent policies, and effective communication will be critical in navigating these risks

School holidays & festivals increase child illness from unsafe food. Parents: Provide healthy meals, avoid oily foods. Diarrhea treatment: Lemon juice, rice porridge, juices, bananas. Dehydration control crucial. Seek doctor if diarrhea persists. Be cautious in water activities. Fire safety during celebrations.

🟩

Deepal Perera, a specialist on the Children's Hospital of the Colombo Child Hospital, said that children who go to tourism and to the outputs during the school holidays and festive season can cause food and snacks at other restaurants.

He said this in response to Kesari on Sunday (23) regarding the protection of the disease during the festive season.

Currently, school holidays have been increased and the boys are traveling for tourism for the festive season.. It is customary for tourists to buy food and snacks in restaurants and shops that see in the eyes.

Thus, when buying food items and drinks in publications, you should act with care. Consuming contaminated foods can lead to diseases such as diarrhea and typhide fever. Therefore, parents should provide healthy food and drinks affected by the children.

### Rumpus about campus qualifications

*2024-12-22 23:52:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rumpus-about-campus-qualifications/4-770884) · `en`

A highly qualified politician without integrity or empathy can cause more harm than an unqualified but ethical leader

Sri Lanka’s Parliament is ablaze with a fiery debate over questionable campus qualifications, with the spotlight now on the JVP/NPP. Since voters placed their trust in the party as champions of honesty, integrity, and anti-corruption, the party now finds itself entangled in a web of controversy. Their rise to power on a platform of transparency has hit a stumbling block, as allegations of fabricated academic credentials leave them scrambling for cover, raising eyebrows and questions about their credibility.

It is important to emphasise that in past governments, such questions and investigations were often curtailed immediately, sometimes with verbal and physical threats. Therefore, citizens must welcome this change. However, the ability to question alone should not be considered a success.

Fear not, Mr. President, you may not speak the language of the King but you speak the language of the heart

Firstly, a very Merry Christmas to you and yours. This year it must be a very different Christmas for you. You seem to have been a good boy and Santa came early for you. All your Christmases came at once. It is good to see that now you are playing Santa Claus and distributing goodies all around. Some are gleefully dreaming of their bright and shiny new cars in the near future! Hopefully you are making sure that all those naughty little boys and girls who brought our country down to the lowest ebb will also receive their just desserts in due course.

### Central Bank, NGO Secretariat and weaponisation of Financial Action Task Force

As FATF has pointed out, blanket and arbitrary measures can drive financial flows underground, thereby undermining the entire purpose of the FATF standards and instead increase terror financing risks

Two entities play a visible and critical role in State attempts to place repressive controls on CSOs; the NGO Secretariat and the CBSL. The third entity that is the driver of these attempts but has largely operated in the shadows is the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The issuance of the 12 December instructions by the NGO Secretariat, indicates the MOD is slowly becoming visible and its role in State attempts to control CSOs/NGOs is being legitimised

Any policy that cannot be sustained or justified in view of  strengthening the macroeconomic environment of the country is usually treated as a bad policy.
