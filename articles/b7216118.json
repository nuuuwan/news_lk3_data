    "Chaitra V., another senior state official, told broadcaster India Today that people may have lost their footing as they sought water in the heat.",
    "\u201cThere was wet mud at one place where people may have slipped. Also because of the heat, people may have made their way to the spot where water was kept and that could have caused the incident as well,\u201d she said.",
