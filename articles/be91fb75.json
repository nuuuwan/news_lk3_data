    "The University of East London (UEL) has cemented its relationship with Sri Lanka as a key market, reaffirming its commitment to providing transformative educational experiences to aspiring students in the region.",
    "In a highly anticipated virtual event, Stephanie Walton, Director of Equipment and Admissions at UEL, addressed more than 100 partners and agents gathered by Infinite Group, announcing plans to expand the university\u2019s presence in Sri Lanka, at an event held at the Ramada, Monday night.",
    "The evening, which was hailed as a success by attendees, featured presentations on the UEL\u2019s academic programs, its global reputation and plans for deepening partnerships across South Asia. Walton\u2019s keynote speech reflected UEL\u2019s determination to strengthen ties with the Sri Lankan market through its trusted partner, Infinite Group.",
    "\u201cSo, I think that\u2019s really, really important when students are leaving their home country, that they are coming to a destination that\u2019s open and welcoming and we will support them to make sure that they start with us, they stay on their studies, and they succeed and graduate successfully for such an objective. In terms of our location, like I said, London is number one, Walton added.",
    "UEL, known for its modern and industry-oriented programs, has been expanding its global reach, and Sri Lanka has become a significant focus. Abhishek, the Country Head UK at Infinite Group, said the university is keen on attracting Sri Lankan students, citing their quality and commitment to higher education. This interest has led to an exclusive partnership between Infinite Group and UEL to streamline recruitment in the region.",
    "During the event, Abhishek shared how the University of East London has significantly improved its application process for Sri Lankan students. What once took weeks for UK universities to issue offer letters is now a 24-hour turnaround. This efficiency, combined with the introduction of pre-screening calls handled by Infinite Group\u2019s local office, has made the process smoother for students. The calls, aimed at verifying student details and intentions, have contributed to an increased conversion rate of applications\u2014from 15% to 37%.",
    "The recruitment push for the January intake, which features around 130-150 courses, primarily at the postgraduate level, has become a top priority. Abhishek also addressed the importance of early applications and ensuring students complete the necessary steps, such as paying an initial deposit and preparing for a pre-CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) interview, which further assures their readiness for the UK visa process.",
    "Sri Lanka-based recruitment efforts are now being led by Anjali Kalubowila, Regional Marketing Manager, who will be working closely with students and recruitment partners to ensure the success of this intake. Her local presence and commitment to student support were warmly received by the attendees, further strengthening the recruitment network in Sri Lanka.",
    "With the University of East London\u2019s streamlined processes and Infinite Group\u2019s local support, the partnership aims to bring more Sri Lankan students to the UK, providing them with the opportunity to study in one of the most dynamic academic environments in East London. The event concluded with optimism about the future of this collaboration, as both parties anticipate a significant increase in the number of students enrolling for the January intake.",
