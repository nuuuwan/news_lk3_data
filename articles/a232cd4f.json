    "Importers of automobiles and electronic equipment expressed their full support for the Government\u2019s economic development program, led by President Anura Kumara Disanayake.",
    "Vehicle importers noted that the sector has expanded due to recent Government decisions regarding vehicle imports and they presented several productive proposals for consideration in the upcoming Budget.",
    "The challenges encountered by importers of products related to electronic equipment in the industry were also addressed. Stakeholders highlighted market imbalances and reduced product quality caused by unregulated imports of electronic goods brought into the country illegally, often bypassing tax payments by organised groups. Importers emphasised that such practices result in significant revenue loss for the Government and raise concerns about product standards for consumers, urging prompt Government action to address these issues.",

    "The Minister confirmed that laws would be strictly enforced against organised groups importing goods through illegal channels.",
    "Senior Additional Secretary to the President Kapila Janaka Bandara, Sri Lanka Export Development Board Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe, officials from the Finance Ministry, and representatives from the automobile and electronic equipment import sectors also participated in the discussion."
