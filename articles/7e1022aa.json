  "original_body_lines": [
    "Three years after its controversial entry into the Indian Ocean, China\u2019s Yuan Wang 5 \u2014 a vessel officially designated as a \u2018research ship\u2019 but widely recognised as a sophisticated intelligence-gathering platform \u2014 has once again been tracked near the region, sparking fresh concerns in India\u2019s security establishment.",
    "According to Indian and Bangladeshi naval sources, the ship was located at 11.0288 S and 100.9873\u00b0 E at 02:38 UTC (around 8:10 pm IST) on Saturday through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The vessel has been under close watch since it left Indonesia about 36 hours earlier, with Bangladeshi naval officers noting its likely trajectory toward the Bay of Bengal.",
    "While Dhaka has been openly monitoring the ship\u2019s movements, Indian authorities have remained tight-lipped. However, sources in the national security and intelligence agencies have admitted that the vessel\u2019s entry is being taken \u201cvery seriously\u201d given its advanced space-tracking and surveillance capabilities.",
    "This marks the second time in three years that the Yuan Wang 5 has sailed into waters close to India. In August 2022, the ship docked at Sri Lanka\u2019s Hambantota Port despite strong objections from New Delhi. At the time, Beijing defended the deployment as \u201cmarine scientific research\u201d consistent with international law, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin asserting that the vessel\u2019s movements \u201cshould not be obstructed by any third party.\u201d",
    "The Yuan Wang 5 belongs to China\u2019s latest generation of space-tracking ships, used to monitor satellite launches, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Its presence so close to the Indian Ocean littoral has long been interpreted by defence analysts as part of Beijing\u2019s expanding military footprint in the region.",
    "The timing of its return has added to strategic unease in India, coinciding with the just-concluded US-Bangladesh joint exercise Pacific Angel-2025 in Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar. Around 120 officers from the United States Air Force (USAF) participated in the drill with Bangladesh Army and Air Force personnel, departing the country on Saturday, September 20.",
    "Analysts in New Delhi caution that the renewed presence of the Yuan Wang 5 may not only be aimed at satellite-tracking but could also provide Beijing with valuable intelligence on regional military activities \u2014 particularly as India and the United States deepen security cooperation in South Asia."
