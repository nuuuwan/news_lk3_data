  "original_body_lines": [
    "Oil prices climbed more than 2% on Wednesday on rising concerns that Middle East tensions could escalate, potentially disrupting crude output from the region, following Iran\u2019s biggest ever military blow against Israel.",
    "Brent futures leapt $1.63, or 2.2%, to $75.19 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude spiked $1.70, or 2.4%, to $71.53 at 0755 GMT. WTI had earlier risen more than $2.",
    "Both crude benchmarks on Tuesday surged more than 5% before closing around 2.5% higher.",
    "Iran said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was over barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to strike back against Tehran as fears of a wider war intensified.",
    "\u201cThis could include damaging or obliterating Iran\u2019s oil facilities,\u201d said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.",
    "Tehran said any Israeli response to the attack, which Israel said involved more than 180 ballistic missiles, would be met with \u201cvast destruction\u201d.",
    "Varga noted Iran\u2019s or its allies\u2019 retaliation could strike Saudi oil facilities like in 2019 or see the closure of the Strait of Hormuz. \u201cAny of these events would irretrievably send oil prices considerably higher,\u201d he said.",
    "In another escalation of the conflict, the Israeli military on Wednesday sent regular infantry and armoured units to join ground operations in southern Lebanon against Iran-backed Hezbollah.",
    "The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.",
    "Iran\u2019s oil output rose to a six-year high of 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, ANZ analysts said.",
    "\u201cA major escalation by Iran risks bringing the U.S. into the war,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note. \u201cIran accounts for about 4% of global oil output, but an important consideration will be whether Saudi Arabia increases production if Iranian supplies were disrupted.\u201d",
    "A panel of ministers from OPEC+, which includes Russia, meets later on Wednesday to review the market, with no policy change expected. The group is set to raise output from December by 180,000 bpd monthly.",
    "\u201cAny suggestion that production hikes will proceed could offset concerns of supply disruptions in the Middle East,\u201d ANZ analysts said.",
    "However, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister said that oil prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if OPEC+ members do not stick to agreed-upon production limits, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday citing delegates from the oil producers group."
