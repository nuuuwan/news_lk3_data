### Strategy To Deflate Systemic Debt & To Support Growth

Deflating systemic debt means reducing debt burden in the economy by design. Sometimes debt deflation takes place by accident. Let us discuss this subject within Sri Lankan context.

Sri Lanka printed money during the presidency of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and prior to that. They printed money without limit. This was bad and this habit was changed on the strict advice of the IMF. Now, CBSL insists that “with the introduction of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 of 2023, which came into effect in September 2023, the CBSL is now prohibited from printing money through the purchase of government securities in the primary market to fund the government” (CBSL Press Release on Oct. 29, 2024). However, this is a gross violation of our monetary sovereignty which refers to the authority and capacity of our country to control our own currency and monetary policy. Why does a country need monetary sovereignty?

### Sri Lanka kerosene use rockets amid subsidies

*2024-11-05 08:18:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-kerosene-use-rockets-amid-subsidies-186075/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s kerosene use has rocketed 65 percent up to August 2024, official data showed, amid subsidized pricing that has given incentives to use the aviation-like fuel for industrial and ground transport.

Kerosene sales rose 87.4 percent to 90,000 metric tonnes up to August 2024, with August volumes up 65.4 percent to 13,000 metric tonnes.

In Sri Lanka kerosene, which is similar to Jet-A1 and is most of the more expensive to import than diesel (petrol is the cheapest fuel) has been mis-priced along with diesel, discouraging the use of cheaper and cleaner petrol.

At the moment (in November) diesel is priced at 283 rupees a litre, petrol 311 and kerosene 183 rupees.

As a result, some bus owners use kerosene breaking the rule for diesel driven engines.

Analysts say the government mis-pricing is driving up demand for kerosene as well as contributing to a collapse of personal integrity of the public by tempting them with wrong prices.
