The White House plans to rush billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, sources said on Wednesday, hoping to shore up the government in Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.

“The administration plans to push forward ... to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible” a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity, before its term ends in January.

Trump has been critical of Biden’s assistance for Ukraine, fueling concern about the future of support for President Volodomyr Zelenskiy’s government under a Republican-controlled White House, Senate and possibly the House of Representatives.

The House has been narrowly controlled by Republicans since January 2023, and it was not clear by Wednesday afternoon whether the party had won enough seats in Tuesday’s elections to keep Democrats from winning a slim majority.

### Rice shortage, price surge fueled by increased beer production?

The Small and Medium Scale Rice Mill Owners’ Association stresses that the growing rice shortage in the market is caused by the increased use of raw rice for beer production.

According to the association, diverting more rice for brewing has impacted the availability of rice for consumers, leading to rising prices.

Chairman of the association U.K. Semasinghe explained that the raw rice used in beer production is sourced from ‘Nadu’ paddy.

“Raw rice is essential for beer production, but it comes from ‘Nadu’ paddy. When a greater portion of this paddy is allocated to the production of beer, the supply of paddy for regular Nadu rice production diminishes,” he noted.

Against this backdrop, farmers’ organizations have echoed similar concerns, urging the government to intervene and stabilize rice prices.

Many shopkeepers report difficulty in obtaining rice at the government-controlled price, further straining the market.

The story of Sri Lanka’s recent turmoil is both a cautionary tale of authoritarianism gone awry and a narrative of resilience. The Rajapaksa dynasty, spearheaded by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, came to symbolize the very forces that pushed Sri Lanka to the brink—corruption, nepotism, and reckless economic policies. Gotabaya’s tenure left the nation reeling from financial mismanagement, stoked ethnic divisions, and silenced dissent. Yet, from this dark chapter emerged a new leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, whose values and vision offer Sri Lankans a renewed sense of hope. This article traces the disastrous decisions of Gotabaya’s administration and examines how Dissanayake and the National People’s Power (NPP) party are paving a path toward unity, accountability, and economic recovery.

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) denounces this legislation, which represents an inhumane ban on vital humanitarian aid. The Knesset’s vote is propelling Palestinians towards an even deeper humanitarian crisis. It is imperative that the world acts to safeguard Palestinians’ fundamental rights. Immediate international intervention is needed to pressure Israel to allow unhindered access to humanitarian aid, implement a ceasefire and bring to an end the current campaign of destruction in Gaza.

JR’s words from 1956 are a wake-up call for us today. As a politician who lost his parliamentary seat, where the powerful UNP was reduced to 8 seats by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s M.E.P and its wave of Sinhala nationalism, JR’s speech was a warning of the dangers of a powerful Government without strong opposition

The prerequisite of our political life is the alternation of political teams in office. Indeed, what we think of as “democracy” is intimately bound up with this system of alternation, as our main liberties coincide with those necessary for the “outs” to rally support and oust the “ins.”

The above writing by the French philosopher and author Bertrand de Jouvenel is quoted by JR in a speech titled “Role of the Opposition in a Parliamentary Democracy” on 7 September 1956, the year of the UNP’s most humiliating defeat to S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (M.E.P). The defeat of 2020 cannot be counted, as the SJB is ideologically the UNP by another name.

The argument that Sri Lanka is self-sufficient in rice does not hold water. Therefore, since the current shortfalls have a bearing on market prices which in turn have a bearing on health, poverty and malnutrition, price variations should be avoided. It is therefore imperative that rice production be increased and stocks monitored regularly to ensure that sufficient stocks are available at any time because shortfalls are often the cause to justify increasing market prices

‘“We aim to leave power only once we have successfully rebuilt this nation” Dissanayake pledged, addressing a rally in Nuwara Eliya…’

Throughout 2024 I consistently urged that the choice be either Sajith or Anura (or vice versa) -- and never Ranil-- to effect a generational tectonic-shift. Given the primary challenge of managing the economic crisis, I thought Sajith Premadasa would make a better President.

Noting that we have two national elections, the presidential and the parliamentary/prime ministerial, I observed that we can always accommodate both young leaders, one in each post.

At the Presidential election most Sri Lankan voters voted quite understandably with their heart and an Aragalaya attitude, for the greatest degree of change, the most progressive and radical they thought possible. A break with the Establishment, voting for Anura was a step forward.

How the demand for value-added coconut products can catapult the industry as the number one export and foreign exchange generator for Sri Lanka, surpassing tea

Any traveller landing in Katunayake Airport during the day can’t help but notice and marvel at the lush greenery one sees especially the thick groves of coconut trees all along the beautiful beaches and the beautiful coastline from the sky. You would then easily believe that coconuts must be a key part of Sri Lankan people’s palette, livelihoods and contributor to the economy.

But the crop that has always been the biggest economic contributor, until now, is tea.

Tea is numero uno in Sri Lanka. The famed ‘Ceylon Tea’ fetches Sri Lanka nearly $ 1.3 billion and employs over a million people. Alongside garments, tourism and worker remittances, they form the base of Sri Lanka’s economy and provide the foreign currency needed to import many essentials, like fuel and medicine.

### Historic deflation in 29 years  and impact on business and people

*2024-11-06 22:54:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Historic-deflation-in-29-years-and-impact-on-business-and-people/14-768908) · `en`

In a striking economic turnaround, Sri Lanka has recorded its first deflation in 29 years, with the inflation rate dipping to -0.5% in September.

The Central Bank (CBSL) attributes this significant decline in general price levels to administrative price adjustments that brought down key cost drivers, including food, fuel, and revisions in water and electricity tariffs. According to the CPI, prices deflated for food and non-alcoholic beverages to -0.3%, while housing and utilities fell further to -8.4% from -6.8% in August. Although prices rebounded in other sectors such as footwear and clothing to 0.1% from -0.4% for instance, major reductions in electricity and water tariffs have lowered utility costs, driving down inflation.

### Getting rid of Blackheads…

*2024-11-06 22:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/getting-rid-of-blackheads/) · `en`

Who doesn’t like to have a clean and clear skin? But blackheads are a common type of skin condition that everyone usually faces at some point in their lives. Blackheads are a common skin condition that primarily affects the face, neck, back, and chest. There are several causes, including too much oil on your skin and irritation of your hair follicles.

Blackheads are most common in adolescents, but they can occur at any age, so this week I’ve worked on a remedy that should be of benefit to the readers of my column.

You will need 01 tablespoon of lemon juice and 01 tablespoon of egg white.

In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice and egg white. Whisk them together until well mixed and slightly frothy.

Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat it dry and apply the mask, using clean fingers, or a brush. Apply the mixture to areas with blackheads. Be careful to avoid your eyes.

Allow the mask to sit for about 15-20 minutes, or until you feel it’s dry.
