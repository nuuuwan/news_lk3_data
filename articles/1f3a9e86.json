    "Public Securities Minister says only \u2018first come, first served\u2019 basis in operation from today; suspends prior appointment system",
    "Department of Immigration and Emigration announces passport issuance restricted amid shortage of blank passports",
    "Passport applicants highlight misplaced priorities in Govt. and failure to address national interests",
    "A growing number of citizens yesterday expressed frustration over delays in obtaining passports, urging the Government to take immediate action to address the issue.",
    "This plea follows an announcement by the Public Security Minister Tiran Alles that from today (28), the existing passport application system requires prior appointments being suspended and the Department of Immigration and Emigration announcing that the issuance of passports would be limited due to a shortage of blank passport booklets.",
    "As per the Minister, instead of the existing appointment system, a \u2018first come, first served\u2019 approach will be adopted from today.",
    "On Monday, DIE Controller General Harsha Ilukpitiya issuing a statement noted that the Government has initiated steps to introduce new electronic passports and has also awarded a tender to a foreign company for their supply through an international bidding process.",
    "\u201cIn response to the current shortage, the department has arranged to procure 50,000 standard passports from the same company that is supplying the electronic passports. This batch is expected to arrive in the country by the end of October or earlier. Therefore, the public is requested to apply for passports only for essential reasons until the new stock of blank passports becomes available,\u201d it reads.",
    "The Controller General noted that the Department regrets the inconvenience caused to the public due to the delay in issuing passports.",
    "The public voiced concerns that, while there seem to be no shortage of paper and materials for Government\u2019s hoarding and election posters, but essential resources for passports are lacking.",
    "\u201cThe Government\u2019s excuses are not acceptable,\u201d said one citizen who had been waiting in the queue to obtain a passport for days, highlighting what they perceive as misplaced priorities that fail to address national interests.",
    "The frustrated people said that each applicant pays Rs. 20,000 for a passport and that the Government could generate significant revenue from the high demand for passports if only the necessary materials were available.",
    "The public\u2019s anger was also directed at the lack of accountability, with complaints that neither the Minister nor the Controller General has taken responsibility for the delays.",
    "\u201cGenerally, a one-day service is available for passport issuance, but now it takes at least three days,\u201d they lamented.",
    "This delay has led to long queues and frustration among those needing passports for work, education, travel and other urgent purposes.",
    "According to the department\u2019s reports, only 23% of passport holders who were issued passports last year have travelled abroad."
