    "Sri Lankans are trapped in a triangular matrix of three Big Lies:",
    "(I) \u2018The Aragalaya was mainly for system-change\u2019. If true, almost a million people who flooded Colombo on July 9th 2022 morning couldn\u2019t have shrunk to about 15,000 by nightfall after they\u2019d successfully evicted Gotabaya. The numbers never reassembled but returned only to explore and picnic outside occupied/liberated buildings. The Aragalaya was specific and concrete, mainly about limited and legitimate \u2018regime-change\u2019, not \u2018system-change\u2019: sending Gota home, just as in the Philippines in 1986 it was about deposing Marcos.",
    "(II) \u2018We suffer from bankruptcy and economic crisis because of corruption by our successive rulers.\u2019 The truth is that we are in a foreign debt trap, as are a great many countries of the Global South. Since the mid-1980s to 2024 there have been many international conferences (convened by the UN, Fidel Castro, Pope Francis) about the problem-- because it wasn\u2019t/isn\u2019t an issue of corruption by local rulers (still less in local currency). Corruption has been as a result, not the root cause of the debt trap. Combating corruption is good, but of entirely secondary significance and isn\u2019t the structural solution.",
    "(III) \u2018The unprecedented spike in lethal shootings is a symptom of political Godfathers panicking about exposure and prosecution\u2019. The truth is that in the USA the mafia was brought down by the FBI, cartels by the DEA; around the world, armed criminal gangs are busted by specialised, experienced Police investigatory units. But in AKD\u2019s Sri Lanka, the CID has been diverted to the task of investigating politicians and (former) officials for non-lethal, non-violent \u2018white collar crimes\u2019, recording their statements and petitions about them. Exploiting the opening, there are more criminal shootings daily, including a record of four in one day, after the spectacular capture and return of gangland bosses than there were before.",
    "Every country, especially every small country, needs every bit of space it can get in the international system. Even as Ceylon, Sri Lanka engaged in a strategy of international participation. This enhances our bargaining power and autonomy.",
    "Whoever the leader and whatever the ideological bent, Ceylon/Sri Lanka never forfeited the chance to be represented and participate globally. Sir John Kotelawela blundered in Bandung in 1955, but he was there. Madam Bandaranaike was at the founding on the Nonaligned Conference in Belgrade in 1961. When JR Jayewardene, nicknamed Yankee Dicky won the 1977 General Election and inherited the chairmanship of the Nonaligned Movement, he was under pressure either to absent himself from the Havana summit or take an adversarial stand towards Fidel Castro and Cuba. Instead, he went to Cuba, addressed the conference, complimented Fidel and emerged firm, lifelong friends with him.",
    "I was there when President Maithripala Sirisena attended the 5th Summit Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia CICA) in Dushanbe, Tajikistan in June 2019 with Presidents Putin, Xi Jinping, Tayyip Erdogan, Hassan Rouhani et al. At short notice I arranged the bilateral meeting with President Putin.",
    "President Anura Dissanayake chose not to attend the BRICS Plus summit he was personally invited for. Neither the PM nor the Foreign Minister represented him. Now he\u2019s outdone himself by failing to attend the enormously successful 25th Conference of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Tianjin, China, which was followed by the spectacular military parade in Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of China\u2019s victory in WWII.",
    "The SCO summit, the in-gathering hosted and powered by China in August 2025 marked an inflection point in world affairs. As important as the Bandung summit 70 years ago and potentially even more so, it revealed Eurasia rising.",
    "If Anura Dissanayake, Tilvin Silva and Bimal Rathnayake had (actually) studied Lenin, they\u2019d know that in his very last essay he had identified the decisive importance of the Eurasian core --Russia, India, China-- in determining world history:",
    "\u201c...In the last analysis, the outcome of the struggle will be determined by the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., account for the overwhelming majority of the population of the globe. And during the past few years it is this majority that has been drawn into the struggle for emancipation with extraordinary rapidity, so that in this respect there cannot be the slightest doubt what the final outcome of the world struggle will be...\u201d (VI Lenin, \u2018Better Fewer, But Better\u2019, March 1923, Collected Works Vol 33).",
    "Sri Lanka could have been there, part of Eurasia rising, but wasn\u2019t because President Anura Dissanayake chose to be absent.",
    "The event was prominently covered for days by every reputed international TV station and the optics made a dramatic impact on the world scene. The warm interaction between Prime Minister Modi and Presidents Putin and Xi was a particular highlight. Of the 26 leaders who attended the event, only 10 were full members of the SCO. The others were Partners\u2014with Indonesia and Turkey being far-flung examples.",
    "Sri Lanka became an SCO Dialogue Partner in 2009, during the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency. The SCO, like BRICS, has expanded, but AKD avoided them both, and therefore Sri Lanka missed excellent opportunities for networking at the highest levels.",
    "When questioned by the media, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa said \u201cwe could have attended, but as you know\u2026\u201d It was about AKD\u2019s forthcoming busy schedule, obviously too busy for the SCO and meeting the leaders who would be there. Social media shared a classic snort: \u201chow privileged we Sri Lankans are to have Anura, a leader who is busier and works harder than Xi, Putin and Modi!\u201d",
    "When a journalist claimed that a Foreign Ministry source said we hadn\u2019t got an invitation, Dr Nalinda Jayatissa snapped back \u201cyou should ask the Foreign Ministry!\u201d. If China hadn\u2019t invited Sri Lanka, the JVP-NPP leadership should wonder why. Knowing diplomacy and the Chinese, I doubt they\u2019d have failed to invite an SCO Partner country when so many were present at Tianjin.",
    "That leaves one other hypothesis: Sri Lanka did receive the invitation, but President Anura Dissanayake decided not to go, and not to send his Prime Minister either.",
    "Continued economic and trade globalisation, but the kind of globalisation that is more inclusive and equitable.",
    "Rejection of bullying and unilateralism, and the practice instead of multilateralism and defence of the UN.",
    "President Xi\u2019s vision of the world articulated in this speech is exceedingly congruent with Sri Lanka\u2019s vital national interests. However, President AKD chose not to be there to endorse or be seen to subscribe to these ideals; be part of this historic project.",
    "Was there any tangible economic benefit that could have been reaped down the road by AKD\u2019s participation?",
    "\u2018Xi\u2019s plans include an SCO Development Bank that would lend in currencies other than the US dollar\u2026Beijing also pledged 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in loans to an SCO banking consortium.\u2019 (https://www.gzeromedia.com/news/analysis/chinas-plans-for-the-new-world-order)",
    "There is a BRICS bank-- the New Development Bank-- based in Shanghai. Even so, AKD dodged the BRICS summit.",
    "Sri Lanka should never be part of any bloc of states against any other, but we must know which space in the world arena we belong to, and is our extended family. The BRICS Plus and SCO Plus are certainly part of that space. President Dissanayake and the JVP-NPP government have no identification with it.",
    "The AKD administration is regressive (even) in our external relations and foreign policy, in comparison with all its predecessors. Pre-1956 Ceylon signed the Rubber-Rice Pact with China and faced US sanctions (the Hickenlooper amendment). AKD just wouldn\u2019t have had the guts.",
    "\u200bA grotesque relationship with the genocidal state of Israel, which includes visa-free access for its citizens, and visits by personnel of State institutions to the rampaging predatory Zionist state while it wages war with over 80% of casualties being children and women, the highest ever recorded.",
    "While Sri Lanka\u2019s President stays away from BRICS and the SCO, the degeneration of Sri Lanka\u2019s external relations under the JVP-NPP Government is best evidenced by the disgraceful role played by the Sri Lankan authorities is allowing personnel from State institutions (Rupavahini, KDU etc.) to be taken to Israel on a study tour while there is an ongoing genocidal destruction of Gaza and enslavement of the West Bank.",
    "Worse still is the open involvement of Sri Lanka\u2019s diplomats, i.e., official representatives of the Sri Lankan state coming under the authority of the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister and senior JVPer Vijitha Herath, in this morally atrocious exercise. The discourse of the Sri Lankan ambassador to Israel is alarmingly enthusiastic. He seems unaware or uncaring that the number of journalists killed by the IDF is the highest in any war in recorded history.",
    "\u2018A group of 16 Sri Lankan journalists has arrived in Israel on a five-day study program aimed at providing foreign media and policymakers with a clearer understanding of the country\u2019s current situation, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Israel Nimal Bandara said.",
    "Bandara noted that the visit, organised by the Israeli Embassy in New Delhi, would give the delegation opportunities to meet senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. \u201cOur journalists will also observe humanitarian aid operations in the Gaza Strip, which is an important part of understanding Israel\u2019s realities on the ground,\u201d he said.",
    "The Ambassador hosted the delegation at a dinner, which was also attended by Israel\u2019s Consul General in Sri Lanka, Dinesh Rodrigo, Honorary Consul of Sri Lanka in Northern Israel Dr. Annette Bernstein Reich, and Deputy Head of Mission Hemantha Ekanayake. (Newswire)\u2019 (Israel takes Sri Lankan journalists on study tour to educate on current situation - Newswire)",
    "This reflects the relationship that Sri Lanka under the \u2018non-elite\u2019, \u2018left-populist\u2019 Anura Dissanayaka presidency and the JVP-NPP Government has with a state widely condemned as genocidal, conducting a morally damnable, brutal and barbaric war; a state more evil than the South African apartheid regime that Sri Lanka boycotted.",
    "Sri Lanka of the now fashionably vilified \u201876 years\u2019 and \u2018elite rule\u2019 quite rightly banned Bandula Warnapura, Tony Opatha et al from representing our country in cricket because they played apartheid South Africa (for Kerry Packer\u2019s money). That was \u2018The Way We Were\u2019.",
    "Instead of pledging Provincial Council elections, President AKD pledges to withdraw the military from as much land as possible in the North and East. He says the military was in occupation of them because previous governments had been consumed with the mentality of war and preventing the next one\u2014which he guarantees will never take place.",
    "He must ask himself why the \u2018forts\u2019 established in America\u2019s Wild West frontier became over time, permanent, massive military complexes (still named \u2018Fort\u2019). It is not because successive American presidents or military chiefs thought the Native American tribes would rise up again and attack them. It is because these forts were located at strategically vital points. Similarly, why did the US retain the bases in Germany and Japan, dating from WWII? Did they expect the defeated Nazis or Japanese to resurrect? Again, no\u2014it was because of the strategic value and utility of those locations.",
    "So also, with Sri Lankan military establishments in the North and East. They should be retrenched ONLY after a stringent assessment of strategic and tactical value. In a small island, the tactical is often also the strategic.",
    "President AKD guarantees that there will never be another war in the North-- but how? Wars are not always the product of purely domestic decisions and dynamics, but even if they were, Anura can give guarantees only for the years he will hold office\u2014unless he is immortal.",
    "History reveals that this island has experienced invasions and occupations not because of purely domestic decisions, still less those emanating from the Southern two-thirds, but dynamics and decisions taken outside our shores, be it by neighbouring kingdoms, or contending Western colonial powers oceans away. Sometimes territories are invaded to deny them to a perceived rival.",
    "Why does Anura Dissanayake think that Trincomalee was bombed by the Japanese in WWII, and their repulsion by the RAF, regarded as a decisive moment in that great war?",
    "War could arrive in Sri Lanka\u2019s North and East again in the context of Great Power rivalry between the US and China, or India\u2019s role in it, or due to domestic dynamics within India and aggression on the part of elements in Tamil Nadu who may launch over-the-horizon drone warfare.",
    "Strategists have to plan for all scenarios, and if the worst-case scenario comes true, Sri Lanka will find that President Anura Dissanayake had dismantled the military presence in the North and East.",
    "What AKD seems not to grasp is that our North and East constitutes a vulnerable, potentially porous border, across which there is a landmass of co-ethnics who have a history of hostile incursions including the establishment of kingdoms on our soil. Therefore, there cannot and should not be security insufficiency leading to security vulnerability, still less a security vacuum in the North-Eastern periphery.",
    "President AKD visited Kachchatheevu. Theatrics apart, can he enlighten us how we are going to defend Kachchatheevu from a hostile Tamil Nadu someday, once he has given India a huge footprint in the Trincomalee area? How can we defend either our Northern frontline or even our South, with an Indian wedge in Trincomalee granted by AKD?",
    "\u201c\u2026A decision has been taken to establish an Independent Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d announced Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath at the UNHRC Geneva.",
    "The NPP administration is determined to ensure accountability for disappearances in Sri Lanka\u2019s civil wars going back before year 2000. So far, the effort seems to be headed in only one direction. Let me illustrate with just a single example. In October 1987 the LTTE burned alive a Rupavahini crew filming in post-Accord, supposedly peacetime Jaffna. Who is going to ensure accountability for that atrocity and so many others, including sleeping babies hacked to death in \u2018border villages\u2019 by LTTE raiding parties?",
    "What is being waged now is a \u2018Memory War\u2019, aimed at depicting Sri Lanka\u2019s war of self-defence and territorial reunification as a quasi-genocidal war. The Independent Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office will be the inquisitorial device which legitimises the reign of LTTE terror and delegitimises the war of reunification and the military and democratic leadership which liberated us.",
    "In his critique of my article on Ranil\u2019s arrest Dr JB Adikari writes: \u201c\u2026But accountability, properly understood\u2026is the lifeblood of democracy\u201d. Later he says \u201cAccountability\u2026is the republic\u2019s backbone\u201d. (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Accountability-is-not-petty-Response-to-Dr-Dayan-Jayatilleka/4-781081)",
    "Wherever Dr Adikari got his definition of \u2018accountability as the lifeblood of democracy\u2019 and \u2018the republic\u2019s backbone\u2019 from, my modest study of politics leads me to insist that:",
    "The \u2018lifeblood of democracy\u2019 isn\u2019t accountability but representation, i.e., the freedom to choose one\u2019s representatives to lead one\u2019s political community. Lincoln\u2019s definition is immortal: \u2018Government of the people, for the people, by the people\u2019."
