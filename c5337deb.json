    "Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Hospital Director Dr. Mihiri Priyangani said the person was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal distension and fever on July 10 where he had been administered 14 separate doses of the antibiotic, Ceftriaxone.",
    "\u201cHowever, he had developed an allergic reaction on July 17 due to the antibiotic and was transferred to the ICU as he was suffering from other chronic diseases as well. The patient died the following day (18),\u201d Dr. Priyangani said.",
    "\u201cSince the patient was suffering from other chronic diseases, the cause of death cannot be directly attributed to the allergic reaction. Nevertheless, the doctors suspect that the allergic reaction could have been a contributing effect to the death,\u201d she added.",
