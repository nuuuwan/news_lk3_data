  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga\u2019s comments on BCCI secretary Jay Shah \u201crunning\u201d Sri Lankan cricket has caused a major storm across the cricketing world, especially in cricket-mad India which happens to be a superpower of the sport.",
    "The comments have caused uproar to the point that Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself offered an apology",
    "In an exclusive conversation with Firstpost\u2019s Palki Sharma, President Wickremesinghe revealed that he has since had a conversation with Shah on the matter.",
    "\u201cNo, Jay Shah doesn\u2019t run Sri Lankan cricket. They think that Jay Shah is supporting the cricket board. But I spoke to Jay Shah and felt sorry that his name had been dragged in and apologized.",
    "\u201cHe said, \u2018My position is, whoever is the legal body, I will back. If this lot is the legal body I will back them. If the other lot is the legal body, I will back them. If there\u2019s a third group that\u2019s the legal body, I will back them. That\u2019s not decided by me, that\u2019s decided by ICC,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Ranatunga had made the comments a day after the ICC\u2019s suspension of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), the richest sporting body in the crisis-stricken island nation, due to political interference.",
    "\u201cBecause of the connection between SLC officials and Jay Shah, they (the BCCI) are under the impression that they can trample and control SLC.",
    "\u201cJay Shah is running Sri Lanka Cricket. SLC is being ruined because of pressure from Jay Shah. One man in India is ruining Sri Lankan cricket. He is only powerful because of his father, who is India\u2019s home minister,\u201d Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to their only ICC World Cup triumph in 1996, was quoted as saying by Sri Lankan media.",
    "The unrest in Sri Lankan cricket began after its 302-run mauling at the hands of India in Mumbai\u2019s Wankhede Stadium. The manner in which the Kusal Mendis-led side had been outplayed, getting bowled out for 55, led to Sri Lanka sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe sacking the entire SLC board shortly after and naming an interim committee with Ranatunga as the head.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Court of Appeals, however, stayed Ranasinghe\u2019s decision and allowed the Shammi Silva-led board to continue with their daily functioning. It is widely believed that the SLC itself had approached ICC to recommend its suspension due to government interference.",
    "The Sri Lankan parliament has\u00a0unanimously passed a resolution moved by chief opposition leader Sajith Premadasa calling for the entire board to resign.",
    "The ICC confirmed its suspension of SLC following its meeting in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, and consequently shifted the 2024 U-19 World Cup out of the country and to South Africa.",
    "Reacting to the ICC\u2019s decision, President Wickremesinghe added he knew the country\u2019s board was going to get suspended.",
    "\u201cThe opposition has said that the Board of Control has written to the ICC and has said to suspend Sri Lanka. The leader of the opposition gave me a set of letters, I haven\u2019t looked at it. But ICC was going to suspend Sri Lanka, I knew that.",
    "\u201cWe were trying to save the U-19 matches, we were going to have tourism, but that didn\u2019t work out so we lost on all that. I am waiting to see the outcome or the decision of the courts in regard to the interim committee. Once that is done, we\u2019ll have to start talking with the ICC to ensure that Sri Lanka can host matches again.",
    "\u201cAs far as the cricket board is concerned, there is a committee of ministers that are going to it, which will recommend legislation. They\u2019ve spoken to the board members as well as to the interim committee members, but I want to bring legislation which will take away the power of the minister to intervene and interfere in politics,\u201d Wickremesinghe added."
