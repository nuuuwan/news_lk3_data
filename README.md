The talks come after Hamas agreed to some parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including freeing hostages and handing over Gaza governance to Palestinian technocrats, but is seeking negotiations on other issues.

The group’s response did not mention the key demands of its disarmament and playing no future role in Gaza’s governance.

Writing on social media that talks had been “very successful”, Trump said: “I am told the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to move fast.”

The US president added that “time is of the essence or massive bloodshed will follow”.

Speaking to reporters earlier, Trump said he thought the hostages would start to be freed “very soon”.

Former President Mahinda Rajapakse said that the greatest joy a leader can enjoy is from spending time with people.

In a post on his official Facebook page, Rajapakse pointed out that the bond between a leader and the public was beyond politics and it was rooted in confidence and mutual respect.

"I have been well aware of their love because they spent most of my life. This love with no profit motives is worthless. It is not only a political relationship, but a heartfelt bond, it is difficult to break it. Efforts to undermine it will still strengthen it, ”he said.

Throughout the public, he said that he had experienced "the greatest happiness that could be a leader" and that he thanked everyone for his respect.
