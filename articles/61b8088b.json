    "Speaking to the media at the courts premises, Abeyratne said: \"I was not in hiding. Damitha is not someone who can hide in this country; she is a woman who fought against the corrupt system that garnered 69 lakh votes. Today, I surrender to the court. I will also celebrate the New Year in prison.\"",
