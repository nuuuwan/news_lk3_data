We are only giving Triposha on the basis of nutrition. Stopping it will have to face a massive nutritional problem in the future.

1.6 million Triposha Package is distributed per month in our country. It was 70 percent in the year 2015. However, when I became the Minister of Health in 2016, I took steps to expand the Triposha project with the help of UNICEF. With this, I took steps to increase production by 100 percent.
