    "In a significant move for Sri Lanka\u2019s educational landscape, the Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Paul Stephens, officially launched Curtin University Colombo, marking a milestone in the growing partnership between Australia and Sri Lanka in higher education.",
    "The event was held on Monday at the Curtin University in Colombo, with dignitaries, educators, and students in attendance.",
    "Curtin University Colombo, an extension of Curtin University\u2019s global network, now becomes the fifth world-campus for the Australian institution, further strengthening the ties between the two nations, the Australian High Commissioner said.",
    "The launch represents the culmination of years of collaboration and shared vision between Curtin University and the Sri Lankan Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). This partnership, which began in 2001, has produced over 3,000 graduates and is seen as a crucial step in the further development of Sri Lanka\u2019s educational infrastructure.",
    "The Australian High Commissioner stressed the importance of the Curtin University Colombo campus as a testament to Australia\u2019s ongoing commitment to Sri Lanka\u2019s education sector.",
    "He said that more than 30 Australian educational institutions currently operate in Sri Lanka, with Australia being the leading destination for Sri Lankan students. Some 18,000 Sri Lankan students are currently studying in Australia, a number expected to rise in the coming years.",
    "Stephens added: \u201cCurtin University Colombo\u2019s establishment represents our belief in Sri Lanka\u2019s future.",
    "\u201cDespite the challenges Sri Lanka has faced in recent years, the optimism surrounding this project reflects a shared vision for a peaceful, prosperous, and united future.",
    "\u201cThere is strong support from the Sri Lankan government for the country\u2019s education sector, particularly in enhancing employability and access to quality education. This initiative aligns with Sri Lanka\u2019s goals for long-term sustainable growth, especially in sectors like engineering, business, and IT\u2014areas in which Curtin University has established a global reputation for producing industry-ready graduates.",
    "\u201cThe partnership between Curtin University and SLIIT was further solidified in 2020 with the establishment of a Curtin Colombo campus, offering fully-franchised undergraduate programs in engineering and business. With the new Curtin University Colombo campus, students will now have access to a world-class education right in their home country, with the added benefit of an internationally recognized Australian qualification.\u201d",
    "Stephens praised the collaborative efforts that led to this achievement, acknowledging the hard work and commitment of all involved in the creation of Curtin University Colombo.",
    "He also encouraged students and prospective students to seize the opportunity to study at the new campus, which is poised to play a key role in Sri Lanka\u2019s educational and economic development.",
    "\u201cBy equipping the next generation with the necessary skills, we can help Sri Lanka achieve its goal of becoming a more agile, export-oriented economy,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cThe graduates of Curtin University Colombo will possess the skills necessary to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing global market.\u201d",
    "Curtin University, ranked among the top universities globally, has been recognized for its research, strong industry partnerships, and focus on producing graduates who are well-prepared for the workforce. With more than 50,000 students and partnerships with over 80 institutions worldwide, Curtin\u2019s global network continues to grow.",
    "In an engaging speech that chronicled the remarkable evolution of the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), Professor Lalith Gamage, chairman of Curtin Colombo and Vice Chancellor and CEO of SLIIT, reflected on the institution\u2019s growth from its humble beginnings in 1999 to becoming one of the top-ranking universities in Sri Lanka today.",
    "The story began in the late 1990s when Sri Lanka\u2019s burgeoning IT industry faced a significant shortage of skilled professionals. In response to this challenge, Professor Gamage, alongside a group of visionary educators, founded SLIIT with the aim of bridging this gap. At the time, the University of Moratuwa\u2019s Computer Science Department could only accommodate a small number of students, enrolling just 16, later increasing to 25. However, he said the demand from the IT industry was far greater \u2013 calling for thousands of trained professionals to drive the sector\u2019s growth.",
    "He said that recognizing the need to create an educational institution that could cater to this demand, SLIIT was established as an independent entity, separate from the University of Moratuwa, without degree-awarding status. The response from prospective students was overwhelming, with over 3,150 applications flooding in for a diploma in Information Technology. Despite initially planning to enroll only 150 students, the institution expanded its capacity to accommodate 400.",
    "By 2000, the institution\u2019s ambitions grew. Professor Gamage sought international partnerships to offer degree programs, reaching out to his friend, a professor at Curtin University in Australia. What started as a hopeful collaboration eventually led to a franchising agreement between Curtin University and SLIIT, allowing the latter to offer degrees and expand its offerings in IT. This partnership not only bolstered SLIIT\u2019s academic credentials but also contributed significantly to the rapid growth of Sri Lanka\u2019s IT industry, which saw annual growth of 25% and became the fifth-largest export sector in the country.",
    "The partnership with Curtin University became a cornerstone of SLIIT\u2019s development, bringing world-class curricula and faculty to Sri Lanka. Curtin University staff helped improve SLIIT\u2019s academic programs, and SLIIT faculty were given the opportunity to study at Curtin, bringing back invaluable knowledge and experience to enhance the institution\u2019s teaching standards. Over time, more than 15 staff members completed their PhDs through this collaboration, further strengthening SLIIT\u2019s position in the higher education landscape.",
    "Professor Gamage is confident in generating an economic contribution of USD 1 billion to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy within the next three years, positioning the country as a leader in higher education in the region. The long-term goal is to build upon the momentum of the IT industry\u2019s growth, which began in the early 2000s, and expand the impact of higher education on Sri Lanka\u2019s economy.",
