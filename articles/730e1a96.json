    "The University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) has announced that university non-academic employees will continue their trade union action.",
    "K.L.D.G. Richmond, the co-secretary of the Inter-University Trade Union Federation, stated that the discussion with the State Minister of Higher Education, Dr Suren Raghavan regarding their demands and other professional issues ended without a solution.",
    "\u201cProposals were presented to provide solutions from the side of the government. But hopefully, as a last resort, we need something in writing for this. We hope to end the strike as soon as that circular is given. Until this is granted, the strike will continue. The strike has been going on for 34 days now,\u201d said Richmond."
