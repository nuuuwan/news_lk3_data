### AKD and JVP-NPP’s mega-mandate: Re-founding the nation

*2024-11-21 02:48:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/AKD-and-JVP-NPP-s-mega-mandate-Re-founding-the-nation/4-769507) · `en`

There were two classic works on Sri Lanka after 1956. “Ceylon: Dilemmas of a New Nation” (Princeton 1960) by Howard Wriggins (he acknowledges with thanks the input of Mervyn de Silva--aged 30 at the time) and “The Emerging Elite: A Study of Political Leadership in Ceylon” by Marshall Singer (MIT, 1964).

Political theory holds that the ‘circulation of elites’ is imperative for the health of the body politic and society. The composition of the President Anura Dissanayake’s new JVP-NPP Cabinet, as that of the new Parliament, signals that a new elite has emerged and acceded to power and rulership. It faces the old dilemmas.

Over a decade, Sri Lanka’s politics has displayed extreme electoral volatility manifested in swings of increasing amplitude. These began with 2015 when the voters swung against the Rajapaksa regime and elected the liberal-reformist Yahapalanaya (‘Good Governance’) government of Maithripala Sirisena as President and Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM.

The stunning electoral sweep of the National People’s Power (NPP) led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is “an earthquake in Sri Lankan politics”, says Erik Solheim, the former Norwegian peace facilitator in the island nation.

The former diplomat also feels that the strong showing by the NPP in areas populated by Tamils, particularly in the north, marked “a very strong call for a new start in ethnic relations in Sri Lanka”.

Solheim, who has interacted closely with many Sri Lankan leaders, however, warned that while the NPP’s inner core “is for sure non-corrupt, eradicating corruption is a huge task”.

Solheim, now a committed green activist, piloted the Western-backed peace process which led to a historic pact between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in early 2002.

### Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay Challenge

*2024-11-20 19:59:16* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lankas-arugam-bay-challenge/) · `en`

Tisaranee Gunasekara’s usually excellent writings are informed by a strong moral compass. In her recent examination of the Arugam Bay controversy (Daily FT, 6 Nov. 2024), however, that compass wobbles to the point of fracture.

Some preliminaries. Her account of the often gruesome atrocities meted out by the Israeli IDF to civilians in Gaza, and now Lebanon, is both accurate and sobering. And in this context it’s also good to see that she highlights opposition to the Israeli war both from within Israel itself, the Jewish American community – and, as she could have added, global Jewry. Thus, opposition to the war is not the issue in focus here. Rather, the key questions raised by her article relate solidly to Sri Lanka-directed realities and concerns.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will import 70,000 metric tonnes of rice to address a shortfall in the market, Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Wasantha Samarasinghe said.

“Even though there was a surplus rice production in the country this year, when you go to the market there is no rice,” Samarasinghe told reporters.

“The best decision we can take in this situation is to import rice to meet the demand.”

The rice will be imported by two state agencies, Sathosa and the State Trading Corporation Samarasinghe said.

Sri Lanka ran out short of parboiled rice (nadu) amid price controls which kept it at the same price as red rice, discouraging growing the variety according to demand, analysts say.
