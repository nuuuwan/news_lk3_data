It added that the navy had told the vessels to change course as they were “approaching an active combat zone”.

“They will attack a peaceful civilian mission because the success of humanitarian aid means the failure of their siege.”

### Fitch confirms Sri Lanka CCC+ sovereign rating

*2025-10-01 22:14:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/fitch-confirms-sri-lanka-ccc-sovereign-rating-242525/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka’s CCC+ sovereign rating saying external finances are stable, and growth is resuming despite US tariffs.

“We expect full-year growth at 4.4 percent, with 3.8 percent in 2026 and 3.6 percent in 2027,” the rating agency said.

“US tariffs will be a growth headwind, but the revised reciprocal tariff rate of 20 percent is now in line with peers, reducing risks to exports.

“We see low average inflation, but to rise gradually to 5 percent in 2027, in line with the CBSL’s inflation target.”

Sri Lanka’s macro-economists created a series of currency crises with its 5 percent inflation target, ousted two elected administrations and triggered a sovereign default using inflationary open market operations and buy-sell swaps to inject money, critics have said.

Actor-politician Vijay’s party, TVK, has suspended his statewide tour for two weeks after a stampede in Tamil Nadu’s Karur claimed 41 lives and triggered massive outrage.

The TVK announced the decision to suspend Vijay’s tour through its official X handle. “In this situation where we are in pain and sorrow over the loss of our loved ones, the public meeting programme of our party leader for the next two weeks is being temporarily postponed. New details regarding these public meetings will be announced later,” a post read.

This was expected as Vijay is yet to meet the families of the 41 victims, although he announced a relief of Rs. 2 million for each family. Yesterday, in a recorded video, Vijay said he would meet the families soon. The stampede has also triggered a sense of fear among the party cadre and the public. The police, too, would look at the venues more closely, and a lot needs to be done by both sides to restore public confidence.

When Kesavi went home with her children on school holidays, Meera cooked food for Achuthan, who was alone.

"Sister go to town and take a week to arrive. Do not eat in the store until then, ”he said.

My son was attending a birthday party at the Colombo Swimming Association.

We did not answer the questions asked by the doctors as to how much time the son was given and when the ambulance came.

This is because the authorities of the Colombo Swimming Corporation did not provide us with the right information regarding the incident. They have no CCTV cameras.

The negligence of the Colombo Swimming Association is responsible for the brain damage to my son.

Therefore, the father said in the complaint that I would like to ask the police to conduct a proper investigation into the matter.
