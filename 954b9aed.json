    "A Greater flamingo egg has hatched in the Birds Park in Hambantota producing a chick for the first time in Sri Lanka, an official said yesterday.",
    "Chief Curator of the Birds Park Suranga Bandara told Daily Mirror flamingos are otherwise visible in Sri Lanka only as migratory birds. He said it is a unique bird species because chicks are fed by milk produced by both parents.",
    "According to him, both parents regurgitate a type of liquid called 'crop milk' into the mouths of their newborns. It is a type of protein- rich milk bright red in colour.",
    "\u201cIn the animal world, only females produce milk to be fed to their newborns. As for flamingos, male birds also produce what is called \u2018crop milk\u2019 to be fed to chicks,\u201d he said.",
    "He said the newborn flamingo chick is expected to be fed by its parents for at least for three months. (Kelum Bandara)"
