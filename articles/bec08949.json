    "Catalina, global pioneers of shopper activation for over 40 years, has embarked on a comprehensive campaign lifecycle management (CLM) process review assignment with MTI Consulting in the UK. The independent review by MTI will enable Catalina Marketing UK to better serve the campaign needs of their retail customers.",
    "The scope of the assignment involves detailed campaign lifecycle-related process documentation review, one-on-one sessions, supplemented with domain research and subject matter expertise on grocery retail. Based on these detailed insights and inputs, the MTI team is developing clear and actionable recommendations for Catalina UK, including campaign management process improvements which will be evaluated internally and implemented in line with business goals.",
    "Commenting on the assignment, MTI Consulting CEO Hilmy Cader said: \u201cThe dynamic nature of the retail industry demands retailers today to be highly reactive when it comes to their promotional campaigns, so it\u2019s important that Catalina UK has the right process in place to operate as one client serving organisation. We also witnessed first-hand how Catalina\u2019s coupon at till is optimised as a unique promotional tool, especially in the UK where coupons remain integral to the on and off-line shopper experience.\u201d",
    "\u201cOur multi-channel, personalised shopper activation solutions continue to drive incremental sales, enhance customer loyalty and improve marketing performance (ROI) for our key retail clients. As a customer-first organisation, we are excited to undertake this timely CLM review with MTI Consulting to understand how we can improve our campaign lifecycle management process to better serve our customers with more agility, speed and flexibility\u201d stated Catalina UK Vice President and Managing Director Premal Patel."
