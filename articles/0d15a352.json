    "We flew to Paris on the 20th, of August. The Ambassador happened to be in Sri Lanka, and we were met by helpful officials. On our drive from Charles De Gaulle Airport to the city centre, one of the senior Embassy officials accompanying me, rather apologetically said that he had booked us at a small hotel, since Paris hotels were very expensive and our allowances inadequate for better accommodation. I said it was alright, although as mentioned in an earlier chapter, experienced senior officials had advised me very early in my career, that if you were travelling in a representative capacity, it was most important to stay at an appropriate and decent address.",
    "Here, I was by now a Senior Secretary, leading a senior delegation. I was prepared nevertheless to abide by the arrangements made. But the hotel was a shocker. The reception area was the size of a very small room. When we entered, a casually dressed young man was viewing a football match on T.V. There were no others. He was a one man front desk. He checked us in, with much assistance from our Embassy staff after which some of us were pointed to a rickety old wooden lift.",
    "By now, we were looking at each other in dismay, but didn\u2019t say much. We were tired and also far too surprised. We entered the lift which went up creaking and groaning. I got out at my floor carrying my baggage to total darkness. It was quite disorienting. When the eyes got used to the darkness, I saw what looked like a light switch and pressed it. The corridor lit up. But before I could locate my room, the lights went off. Apparently, the corridor lights were timed to last only a minute! Eventually, I found my room and got in. Here was another set of problems.",
    "The bedroom was very small, and the bed far too large for the room. When I put the baggage down on the floor, I found that I had to jump over it to reach the bed. There was no other place to keep it. There was the prospect of breaking my neck in case I wanted to reach the bathroom during the night. The bathroom itself was pleasingly spacious. But the pleasure of this was only momentary. I opened one of the wash basin taps. Icy cold water. Opened the other tap. Icy cold water. Tried the shower. Icy cold water. By now I was getting angry. I heard the telephone ringing in my room and cautiously stepped over my bags to reach it.",
    "It was Mr. Pulendiran, Senior Deputy Food Commissioner. \u201cSir, do you have hot water in your room?\u201d he inquired. So the absence of hot water in my room was not a problem confined to my room. A moment later Mr. Kathiravellupillai rang. He said that he had been put in some garret of an outhouse, with a shared toilet, which he could reach only by Going outside into the garden! This meant that while I was faced with the prospect of breaking my neck, he was faced with the possibility of freezing to death or contracting galloping pneumonia as a merciful alternative. We had a discussion. It was too late to do much, given the lateness of the hour. But we were certainly not going to stay in this miserable garret found for us. We telephoned our Embassy friends.",
    "I was quite irritated, but kept my irritation in check not without some difficulty. The Secretary to the Treasury was Dr. W. M. Tillakaratna. I asked the Embassy official concerned where he stayed when he comes to Paris on official business. The name of a hotel was mentioned. I said, \u201cTomorrow morning, I want myself and my delegation booked into that same hotel. I want the Embassy to advance any extra funds needed, and I will deal with the Treasury, when I get back home.\u201d This was apologetically agreed to.",
    "The following morning we checked out, not to the hotel I had indicated for that was full, but to a hotel of the same class, close to the Embassy. This was the interesting and eventful beginning to the first visit to Paris, for all of us. In particular, as far as I was concerned, I moved out just in time, because that same afternoon there had been an inquiry from the office of the French Under Secretary for Co-operation and Bi-lateral Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture. They had wanted to know where I was staying, in order to fix an appointment for the Under Secretary and me to meet. One shuddered to think what the reaction would have been if the earlier address was given.",
    "This episode leads me to a short digression about travel. Secretaries at this time travelled economy class on airlines. This was however not the practice in many countries, including our neighbouring countries in South Asia. A secretary was the administrative head of a Ministry responsible for the supervision of several departments and other agencies coming within the purview of the Ministry. He was responsible to his Minister and the government for the efficient performance of the Ministry and departments.",
    "He was responsible, as \u201cChief Accounting Officer\u201d to the Minister of Finance and Parliament for due diligence in the financial administration of all his agencies. A Secretary was also regarded as not only a Secretary to a particular Ministry, but also as a Secretary to the government as a whole. Therefore, in the case of Sri Lanka, a Secretary was required to participate in the discussion of almost all the matters inscribed on the agenda of the Committee of Secretaries and not only on matters pertaining to his own Ministry. He was also involved in the activities of important inter-Ministerial Committees and Cabinet Sub-Committees. Individual Ministers sometimes rang him up in order to obtain a point of view on some relevant matter.",
    "Liaison and important discussions with foreign agencies, both bi-laterally and multilaterally were also part of his responsibilities, as well as briefing his Minister on a wide range of issues. Above all, he was required to give direction and leadership to his officers, many of whom were both senior and experienced, and provide them with advice, guidance, encouragement, and when necessary orders. Therefore, given the importance of the post of Secretary, many countries required that Secretaries travel first class.",
    "We got to that position somewhere in 1981 when the government took the decision. But prior to that I am aware, that many Secretaries had to undergo embarrassing situations. I myself faced several awkward situations. On one occasion I was travelling to Pakistan on official business, and I was introduced at Katunayake by the Pakistan Ambassador, to one of the Pakistan Government\u2019s head of departments who was taking the same flight after a visit to Sri Lanka. He was not a Secretary, but a head of department. During the, course of our conversation, I discovered that he was travelling first class. \u201cWe shall continue our conversation on the plane,\u201d he said. He must have been quite puzzled by my non-presence, for I was travelling \u201ceconomy.\u201d",
    "On another official visit to a country, I saw some cars driving up to the main gangway at the entrance to the plane, which I later discovered were to pick me up. Senior officials had arrived to pick me up and take me to the VIP lounge. On the visit to Egypt I had referred to in some of the previous paragraphs, we were accommodated in the VIP lounge for both arrival and departure. Arrival was no problem. Nobody looked at your ticket. But departure was an embarrassment. The night we left, the VIP lounge was closed, due to the high security measures taken because of the departure of the Minister of War and a senior delegation of generals.",
    "We were told that all applications to use the lounge were turned down that night, the only exception being us. This was an indication of the excellent relations between our two countries. I still remember the look of surprise on the face of the Egyptian protocol officer who came to collect our tickets, when he looked at my ticket. The members of my delegation were more upset than I was, saying that we should not travel at all unless it was possible to follow proper protocol.",
    "Later, in addition to first class travel, the VIP lounge at Katunayake was opened to Secretaries for arrival and departure. Tome, that was not that important. When you come and go, in and out of your own country, a little inconvenience does not matter. In fact on many occasions I did not use these facilities, and went through the normal departure lounge. But if we deal with the world, it is important not to devalue ourselves. India and Pakistan in particular are very strict about these matters, both in regard to travel and accommodation.",
