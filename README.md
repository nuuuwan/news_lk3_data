Monthly milk powder consumption dropped from 7000 MT to 3000 MT over last few years

Sri Lanka’s monthly milk powder consumption, which almost halved following the economic crisis, due to the price escalation, is witnessing a slight increase, a senior industry representative said.

The monthly milk powder consumption, which was about 7,000 MT pre-Covid, dropped to about 3,000 MT over the last three years, due to the price increases caused by the increase in the US dollar, an increase in global market milk prices and a hike in government taxes.

However, with the economic conditions slightly improving, over one million households have returned to the market, although the overall consumption remains lower than the pre-COVID levels, Maliban Group Chief Executive Officer Ravi Jayawardena said. He shared his views while addressing a panel discussion hosted by Capital Alliance Limited, which delved into the current trends in consumer spending and post-crisis outlook in Sri Lanka.

As businesses navigate complex challenges and pursue growth opportunities in a turbulent environment, it is imperative to recognise that the true engine driving success lies in effectively harnessing and optimising human resources. It is people who drive all other resources, thus becoming the central force. Gone are the days when success was solely measured by financial metrics or technological competence. While money, machinery, and markets undoubtedly play crucial roles, they are merely tools in the hands of people.

🟩

Rajasthan Royals won by 6 wickets in the 14th match of the 17th Indian Premier League chapter held on Monday (01) at the Vankade Playing in Mumbai.

The accurate bowling of Yuswendra Sahal and Trent Bolt, the excellent field of players, and the unbearable half -century of Ryan Barak have made a lighter victory for Rajasthan Royals.

Mumbai Indians have lost all three matches in the 17th IPL chapter five times and the team is the only team that has not won so much.

Rajasthan Royals lost 4 wickets in 15.3 overs, scoring 127 runs in response to the goal of the 126 -run victory for the Mumbai Indians.

Yaswvi Jaiswal, who scored 10 runs off 5 balls in the first over of the first over of the 17 -year -old young fast bowler, Kwana Mafaka, lost the last ball.

### Taxation and the social contract: Thatcherites holding Sri Lanka back

The UNP has always operated on a centre-right economic policy maxim, remaining on a continuum of Thatcherite or Reaganite low tax, small government, pro-business, pro-market foundations

Peter Breuer of the IMF’s visiting delegation made some interesting comments specifically related to alternatives or alterations to the current program. He stated that any alternative proposals must be realistic before repeating the urgency for improving revenue and meeting Intended Targets (ITs) and noting the “commitment in the (IMF) program to not grant any more tax concessions. Tax concessions are a missing component of tax revenues”.

The given graphs extracted from ADB and IMF reports reiterate Breuer’s point that Sri Lanka’s tax revenues are inadequate in terms of value and imbalanced in terms of revenue source.

*2024-04-02 00:12:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83845) · `en`

The course of war  between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) and the Sri Lankan armed forces was drastically altered by the  2004 eastern  revolt headed by former tiger commander of the Batticaloa and Amparai districts Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias “Col”Karuna. The LTTE was split vertically and horizontally as a result and gradually weakened. By 2007 the LTTE ceased  having territorial control in the Eastern province.

This article is the third in a series about the intra-tiger split of 2004 and the fratricidal war that followed. In the first article published on 16 March 2024 the background and reasons for the Eastern Tiger revolt were discussed in detail. In the  second article  published on 23 March 2024 the course of events leading to the  conflict in the aftermath of “Col”Karuna’s rebellion were recounted.  This third article relates  details of the Tiger vs Tiger confrontation that  commenced 20 years ago on Good Friday.

A stable government is imperative for garnering the confidence of FDI and engaging with international financial institutions

Pre-electoral alliances and post-election coalitions among political parties have emerged as significant features in contemporary politics.

An examination of this political phenomenon is crucial for understanding election dynamics and the processes of government formation and sustainability. It is heartening to observe a relative increase in studies dedicated to alliances and coalitions over the past decade.

Speaking at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh,(around 2232 Kms away from Chennai) on Monday, Indian Premier Narendra Modi suddenly found fault with Indira Gandhi for signing an agreement with Sri Lanka relinquishing Indian claims to the island of Katchchatheevu.

Yes, you guessed it. It is election time in India and the BJP has never come to power in Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state in India.

S. Ramanujam, a retired former Senior Administrative Officer of the Indian government at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research reveals that Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Indian National Congress in the 1950s and up to 1966. In 1967 DMK under the leadership of late C.N. Annadurai came to power. Thereafter, only the DMK and AIADMK have ruled Tamil Nadu (TN).

Board of Investment (BOI) and Port City Economic Commission Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody in this interview responds to some of the questions posed covering the investment challenges facing the country.

Q: Why does Sri Lanka get less FDI than most regional neighbours?

A: According to most credible surveys carried out, the main drivers of investment decisions are political and macroeconomic stability and the country’s regulatory and business environment. Excluding the civil conflict and the pandemic, policy inconsistency has impacted Sri Lanka’s investment climate significantly. Even prior to the recent economic crisis, Sri Lanka had a tendency of changing key policies. This has resulted in investors facing practical difficulties in running their businesses, especially with respect to the tax regime of the country.

### Sri Lanka exporters protest rupee appreciation, forced conversion rules

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s export associations have protested the recent sharp appreciation of the rupee saying forex conversion rules have been forced on them and some costs are not falling in line with rupee gains, leading to a loss of cost competitiveness.

Sri Lanka’s central bank is operating a de facto pegged exchange rate where the agency’s domestic assets are being reduced against dollar purchases (reversing ‘money printing’), triggering a balance of payments surplus, allowing the exchange rate to be appreciated if the agency wishes, analysts have shown.

There is however a widespread belief that suspending debt repayments have helped appreciate the rupee, though the financial account turned into a deficit in the last quarter of 2022, just as monetary stability was restored allowing out payments to be made and reserves to be collected.
