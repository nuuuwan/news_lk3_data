    "Ampara, Feb 12 (Daily Mirror) - Herds of wild elephants from Buddhangala sanctuary in Ampara roaming into the paddy fields after harvest to feast on crop stubble is a usual sight in Dighawapi and Allkadu areas.",
    "It is customary for them to spend hours in wallowing in the Walathapitiya tank. However, the farmers have fenced out the fields to guard them against marauding herds until the harvest is over by the end of this month. They would allow the jumbos to feed on the stubble after the harvest.",
    "However, the wildlife conservators from Walathapitiya Wildlife Office are exercising supervision round the clock to provide protection to the villages."
