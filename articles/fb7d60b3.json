    "The JVP-led NPP government is quite upbeat about President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s India visit. However, if the joint statement Dissanayake and Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued on Monday (16 Dec.) is anything to go by, the NPP administration has endorsed what its leaders used to flay President Ranil Wickremesinghe for having undertaken to do at the behest of India, much to the interests of Sri Lanka\u2019s interests. Wickremesinghe has thanked Dissanayake for endorsing the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) to be signed between India and Sri Lanka. This can be considered a backhanded compliment.",
    "As for the projects of strategic importance mentioned in the joint statement, PM Modi has said nothing new; he has only reiterated what he expected the previous Sri Lankan governments to do. He has highlighted his government\u2019s desire to see the completion of some vital projects such as the supply of LNG to Sri Lanka, a high-capacity grid connection between the two countries, a petroleum pipeline from India to Sri Lanka, and the further development of the Trincomalee oil tank farm. It is a case of Hobson\u2019s choice for Sri Lanka.",
    "The joint statement also mentions some benefits to Sri Lanka in areas such as energy development, education and technology and agriculture.",
    "PM Modi and President Dissanayake have agreed to continue discussions on the development of airports in Sri Lanka. One can only hope that Sri Lanka will not come under Indian pressure to award contracts for airport development to the Adani Group, which is under a cloud. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi has accused the Modi government of \u2018tweaking rules\u2019 regarding India\u2019s airport privatisation programme in favour of the Adani Group.",
    "Meanwhile, PM Modi said at a joint press conference with President Dissanayake on Monday that they had discussed reconstruction and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, and he hoped that the Sri Lankan government would fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people and its commitment to implementing the Constitution of Sri Lanka (read the 13th Amendment) fully, and conduct the Provincial Council elections. PM Modi also said he and Dissanayaka were in full agreement that \u2018our security interests are interconnected\u2019, his message being that Sri Lanka has to be mindful of India\u2019s security concerns.",
    "The biggest challenge before the NPP government is to justify the numerous about-turns of its main constituent, the JVP, which signals left but turns right erratically, and provides grist to the Opposition\u2019s mill, in the process. JVP leaders are doing exactly the opposite of what they advocated as regards some crucial issues during their opposition days; their policy contradictions are legion. They have made U-turns on the IMF bailout programme, rice imports, taxes, tariffs, petroleum prices, the MPs\u2019 perks and privileges, and a host of other issues.",
    "Addressing a seminar under the theme, \u2018Trading, Sacrifice and ETCA\u2019, in Colombo in Sept. 2016, JVP leader Dissanayake said the agreement, if signed, would pave the way for an influx of \u2018low-grade Indian IT professionals\u2019 here at the expense of the Sri Lankan youth. According to a report published on the JVP\u2019s official website (23 Feb. 2016), Dissanayake had this to say about ETCA, at the first of a series of seminars held under the theme \u2018Denounce ETCA that sacrifices our economy to India!\u2019: \u201cThere is a political gamble here. India is trying to intervene in politics in our country. Already, there are many RAW spies in Jaffna. Before our country is made a political playground India wants to gobble our economy. Already India has a monopoly in the vehicle, medicine and construction sectors. Already, they are controlling our economy. Through that they manipulate politics in our country. It is this political need that jumps out of Ranil\u2019s mouth. We would never allow this agreement to be signed.\u201d",
    "The question is what those \u2018RAW spies\u2019 in Sri Lanka were doing during this year\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections.",
    "In a video (dated 19 September 2023) doing the rounds on the Internet these days, Dissanayake opposes the Indo-Lanka connectivity project; he says the proposed projects such as the grid connection, the petroleum pipeline, etc., are detrimental to Sri Lanka\u2019s independence.",
    "It will be interesting to see what the opponents of ETCA, especially the professionals, who backed the NPP to the hilt in the presidential and parliamentary elections this year, have got to say about the incumbent government\u2019s about-turns and acquiescence to India\u2019s demands.",
    "Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath is heard speaking of \u2018bondages\u2019 between India and Sri Lanka, during a brief television interview in New Delhi. Was it a mere lapsus linguae or a Freudian slip reflecting the JVP leaders\u2019 subconscious antipathy towards what they once perceived as India\u2019s suzerainty or hegemonistic interests?",
