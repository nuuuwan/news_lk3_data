    "Lured by promises of IT jobs in a Thai supermarket, one Sri Lankan victim found himself transported to a remote camp, far from the promised comfort.",
    "His description paints a chilling picture of a digital sweatshop, where captives like him were forced to impersonate women on social media to ensnare wealthy victims in elaborate online schemes.",
    "\"We act like women through Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tik Tok,\" he recounted, his voice raw with trauma. \"We target people from rich countries, America, Netherlands, Australia. Then, when it comes to video calls, we switch faces with hired women.\"",
    "According to him, failure to secure a \"customer\" within nine grueling hours resulted in the denial of basic necessities like food and water.",

    "While being transported to Laos to be sold to another terrorist group, these five Sri Lankans saw a window of opportunity and seized it.",
    "\"There is a location close to the Thai-Laos border, and we were sold to a group based over there. Four males, along with myself, and another Sri Lankan woman were transported in two separate vans. I was in one with two others, and the girl was in the other van with another Sri Lankan,\" he recounted.",
    "With around Rs. 100,000/- in had, he had attempted to bribe the driver of the van to secure their freedom.",
    "However, the driver had not accepted the money and refused to release them.",

    "In a split second, he lunged forward, flinging the fiery dust into the driver's face to momentarily incapacitate their guard.",
    "This created a window for the others to fight back, overpowering their captor and gaining control of the vehicle.",
    "A fierce struggle ensued, fueled by years of suppressed hope and the adrenaline of a potential escape.",
    "\"We pulled out the driver and beat him mercilessly,\" said one of the Sri Lankans.",

    "One young man from Chilaw, a fishing town in Sri Lanka, who had been deceived into traveling to Myanmar, faced harrowing mistreatment at the hands of the suspected terrorist group. He endured brutal torture involving electric shocks.",
    "\"We were auctioned off and then forced to work for a company that demanded we find three Facebook profiles per day,\" he said revealing how he was trapped by deception.",
    "\"Failure to obey meant brutal beatings from their dedicated military unit, a humiliating spectacle meant to cow everyone into submission. The first beating I received involved four poles being broken over my body. They then took me to a prison-like facility where beatings and electrocution continued, all aimed at forcing me to participate in their online scams. After enduring this prolonged torture, I believe I was sold to another group. During transport, I seized my chance and escaped, running for miles until I found a monk who helped me return to Sri Lanka.\"",
    "The man's escape was fueled not just by desperation, but by a profound sense of guilt. He reveals the tragic aftermath of one scam: \"A person I was forced to target took their own life after losing everything. This haunted me and fueled my determination to break free.\"",
    "His story also sheds light on the broader reach of this operation: \"There are Sri Lankan girls trapped in Bangkok jails, held there because they fear escaping and exposing the truth.\"",
    "The Department of Immigration and Emigration of Sri Lanka has launched an investigation into the human smuggling ring, while the Sri Lankan Embassy in Myanmar is working on rescuing the remaining 56 Sri Lankans reportedly held captive by terrorists.",
    "However, the embassy faces challenges due to the camp's location in an unliberated area under military rule in Myanmar. This underscores the complexities involved in dismantling such illicit operations and freeing vulnerable individuals caught in their clutches.",
    "This incident brings to light the chilling reality of cyber slavery, where young people are lured into fraudulent jobs and then forced to engage in online scams and financial fraud against global targets.

    "Internet users worldwide are facing a growing threat from organized criminal groups operating across Southeast Asia.",

    "A June 2023 report by the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) sheds light on this concerning trend.",
    "Pushed out of China, these criminal groups have found fertile ground in Southeast Asia, establishing havens like Shwe Kokko, a newly built town in Myanmar bordering Thailand.",
    "This town, initially developed by a Chinese crime ring, now serves as a hub for illegal gambling and a base for vast online fraud operations.",
    "The scams employed by these groups are diverse and often cruel. One particularly insidious method, dubbed \"pig butchering,\" involves building long-term online relationships with victims, often of a romantic nature, before \"slaughtering\" them financially.",
    "This elaborate con targets not only Chinese nationals but also individuals from countries around the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan.",
    "The report paints a grim picture of the human cost behind these online scams.",
    "Hundreds of thousands of people, including men, women, and even adolescents, are reportedly trafficked into these operations and forced to work under inhumane conditions.",
