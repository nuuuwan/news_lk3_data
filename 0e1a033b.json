    "COLOMBO (News 1st); 28 rights groups are urging Sri Lanka to put an end to the 'Yukthiya' Anti-Drug Operation which they term as abusive, and release those who have been arbitrarily detained.",
    "These rights groups include Amnesty International (Global), Human Rights Watch (Global), International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC) (Global) and Africa Network of People Who Use Drugs (AfricaNPUD) (Africa).",
    "A statement from these rights groups notes that the operation is unfolding in a context of already severe repression against persons who use or are suspected of using drugs, who suffer discrimination and stigma within the Sri Lankan criminal justice system and society.",
    "Alleged arbitrary arrests, primarily against individuals from marginalised socio-economic communities; searches conducted without warrants or reasonable suspicion; and, degrading treatment including strip searches in public as well as cavity searches are highlighted by the rights groups as violations.",
    "They call to immediately cease operation \u201cYukthiya\u201d and release persons who have been arrested without evidence or reasonable suspicion. The government should ensure that those arrested who do not have access to legal representation are provided legal aid.",
