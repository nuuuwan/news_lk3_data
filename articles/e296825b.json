  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the respondents in the X-Press Pearl disaster to pay 1 billion US dollars as compensation for the harm caused to marine and coastal environment, and the significant losses suffered by the island nation and the fishing industry, the verdict said.",
    "The MV X-Press Pearl disaster stands as Sri Lanka\u2019s worst marine environmental catastrophe. On May 20, 2021, the Singapore-flagged container ship caught fire off the coast of Colombo while carrying a cargo that included 25 tons of nitric acid, other hazardous chemicals, and over 1,500 containers.",
    "Despite efforts to douse the fire, the vessel burned for nearly two weeks before sinking on June 2, 2021. The incident led to the spillage of harmful chemicals and billions of plastic pellets (nurdles) into the Indian Ocean, polluting vast stretches of Sri Lanka\u2019s western coastline.",
    "\u201cOn a detailed consideration of the pollution caused and the several claims presented by the Petitioners, it is the view of this Court that the first requirement to be imposed on the Non-State party Respondents (MV X-Press Pearl group of companies who have been cited as Respondents to the several Applications) is for the payment of an initial sum of USD 1 billion (approximately Rs. 297,980,000,000.00, as per the exchange rate of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka prevalent on 22nd July 2025 which is Rs. 297.98 per 1 United States Dollar),\u201d the Supreme Court said in its verdict.",
    "\u201cThis Court has arrived at this figure on a detailed consideration of the multitude of factors contained in the several Reports presented to this Court regarding the harm caused to the marine and coastal environment, and the significant losses suffered by persons who were dependent on fishing and the fishing industry and by other indirect victims.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis Court also notes that while the Non-State party Respondents have conceded that the events relating to MV X-Press Pearl resulted in significant environmental harm and the incident resulted in certain losses to the fishing communities, they did not present their own quantification of the loss caused in financial terms.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the X-Press Pearl group of Respondents did was to merely engage in a critiquing of the several claims presented by the Petitioners.\u201d",
    "\u201cFurthermore, even such critiquing was not founded upon counter expert opinion. In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that, requiring the polluter to pay in the first instance approximately one sixth the amount claimed by a majority of the Petitioners is just and equitable.\u201d",
    "The environmental and economic fallout of the disaster was immense.",
    "Toxic substances and plastic waste devastated marine ecosystems, killed countless marine animals, and severely affected the livelihoods of thousands of coastal fishermen.",
    "Beaches were blanketed with nurdles, while dead turtles, dolphins, and fish washed ashore in alarming numbers.",
    "The disaster also exposed significant gaps in Sri Lanka\u2019s maritime disaster preparedness and raised serious concerns about environmental accountability, international shipping safety protocols, and compensation mechanisms. (Colombo/July 24/2025)"
