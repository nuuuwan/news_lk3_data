    "China is dealing with an outbreak of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), five years after the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "Reports and social media posts suggest that the virus is spreading rapidly, with some claiming that hospitals and crematories are overwhelmed. Videos shared online show crowded hospitals, with some users saying that multiple viruses, including influenza A, HMPV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Covid-19, are circulating.",
    "There are even claims that China has declared a state of emergency, though this has not been confirmed. HMPV is known to cause flu-like symptoms and can also present symptoms similar to Covid-19. Health officials are closely monitoring the situation as the virus spreads.",
    "A social media post by an X handle known as \u2018SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19)\u2019 wrote in a post: \u201cChina is facing a surge in multiple viruses, including Influenza A, HMPV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Covid-19, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums. Children\u2019s hospitals are particularly strained by rising pneumonia and \u201cwhite lung\u201d cases.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, a news report by Reuters has said that China\u2019s disease control authority said on Friday that it was piloting a monitoring system for pneumonia of unknown origin, with cases of some respiratory diseases expected to rise through the winter.",
    "The move to establish a dedicated system is aimed at helping authorities set up protocols to handle unknown pathogens, in contrast to the lower level of preparedness five years ago when the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 first emerged.",
    "The National Disease Control and Prevention Administration will establish a procedure for laboratories to report and for disease control and prevention agencies to verify and handle cases, state broadcaster CCTV reported, quoting an administration official at a news conference.",
    "Data for acute respiratory diseases showed an upward trend in overall infections in the week of December 16 to 22, according to an official statement released on Thursday.",
    "China is likely to be affected by various respiratory infectious diseases in winter and spring, Kan Biao, another official, said at the news conference. He said without elaborating that the overall number of cases this year would be smaller than last year.",
    "Recent cases detected include pathogens such as the rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, with cases of the human metapneumovirus among people under the age of 14 showing an upward trend, especially in northern provinces.",
    "In a recent interview with the state-backed National Business Daily, a respiratory expert at a Shanghai hospital warned the public against blindly using antiviral drugs to fight human metapneumovirus, for which there is no vaccine but whose symptoms resemble those of a cold."
