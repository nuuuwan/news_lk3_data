    "LOLC Holdings Chief Operating Officer Kithsiri Gunawardena (right) with South Africa ecologist, researcher, and conservationist Dr. Jeannine McManus",
    "In celebration of National Leopard Day on 1 August, LOLC Holdings PLC has launched several new initiatives to further its ongoing commitment to the conservation of the Sri Lankan leopard, in partnership with the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS).",
    "The Sri Lankan leopard, an apex predator and a key component of the island\u2019s rich biodiversity, faces escalating threats from unplanned land use, wildlife crimes, inadequate penalties, and limited ecological understanding. With rough estimates suggesting fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the country, the conservation of this endemic subspecies has become increasingly vital.",
    "As part of this expanded effort, LOLC has introduced a new logo under the theme \u2018Save the Sri Lankan Leopard\u2019, designed to raise awareness and foster public engagement. Resonating with both conservationists and the general public, the logo features a clean and powerful image of the leopard, emphasising the importance of protecting the Sri Lankan leopard and its habitat, aiming to inspire pride and support for conservation efforts.",
    "Since February 2022, LOLC and the WNPS have been implementing a comprehensive five-year project to address the myriad challenges faced by the Sri Lankan leopard. This initiative involves establishing a network of research centres across key locations in Sri Lanka to monitor leopard populations, enhance habitat suitability, and develop strategies for mitigating human-leopard conflicts. By integrating findings from past and ongoing research and facilitating data sharing, the project aims to create a robust, science-driven conservation strategy.",
    "The project established six research stations in Panama, Morningside, Kilinochchi, Belihuloya, Nallathanniya, and Ritigala. These centres use camera traps and surveys to monitor leopards, collaborate with local wildlife and forest officers, and serve as educational hubs to raise awareness and develop strategies for mitigating human-leopard conflicts. This initiative addresses the rising number of leopard deaths due to snares in human-dominated landscapes and aims to enhance habitat suitability through improved forest cover, patch size, connectivity, and landscape protection.",
    "LOLC Holdings PLC Chief Operating Officer Kithsiri Gunawardena said: \u201cLOLC has always been a group that comes forward in times of need. During times of financial stress, protecting and investing in biodiversity and environmental knowledge becomes challenging, yet crucial, for any government. We chose the Sri Lankan leopard, a charismatic and endemic animal, as our conservation icon. Protecting an apex predator like the leopard results in preserving the habitat for a much larger community of species which forms its prey base and an entire ecosystem, as these predators play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their habitats. Moreover, any effective conservation measure begins with thorough research and knowledge.\u201d",
    "\u201cDespite general awareness of leopards in Sri Lanka, our understanding of their population numbers and ecological needs remains speculative. Comprehensive data on leopard density, behaviour, and their interactions with human-dominated environments is lacking. To address these critical gaps, we have partnered with the WNPS on a five-year project. As a leading conglomerate and major employer, LOLC\u2019s involvement in this project is designed to raise awareness and inspire action among our stakeholders. By spearheading this comprehensive study, we aim to develop effective conservation strategies that ensure a sustainable future for the Sri Lankan leopard, a species vital to both our biodiversity and tourism industry,\u201d Gunawardena added.",
    "Dr. Jeannine McManus, who has been actively involved in \u2018Human-Leopard Coexistence\u2019 forums across international platforms including Sri Lanka, admired the project for its innovative approach to conservation. She noted: \u201cThis project is groundbreaking in addressing the challenges of coexisting with leopards in a densely populated island. With fewer than 1,000 leopards remaining in the wilds of this island, a science-based conservation strategy is essential for understanding their distribution and ecology. During an era in which corporate responsibility plays a crucial role in conservation, initiatives like LOLC\u2019s are essential for fostering ecological literacy and driving positive change. Their commitment to integrating ecological value into their business practices sets a powerful example.\u201d",
    "The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), the island\u2019s apex mammalian predator, has lost more than 60% of its former range in the country and is now found mostly in the remaining forested areas in the dry zone, low country wet zones, and cloud forests of the hill country.",
    "By uniting researchers, conservationists, and the community, LOLC and the WNPS are driving forward a comprehensive conservation strategy that aims to ensure the long-term survival of the Sri Lankan leopard and enhance the island\u2019s rich biodiversity."
