    "Specifically, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation and various local civil society organisations extended their technical support and expertise in enhancing policy reforms, migrant services, skills development and recognition, awareness campaigns, and the promotion of fair and ethical recruitment practices. The program contributed to the National Policy and Action Plan on Migration for Employment (2023-2027), which received Cabinet approval in 2023 and includes expanded measures for migrant worker protection.",
    "A Swiss delegation will arrive in Colombo for a special handover ceremony to officially transfer the project to the Government of Sri Lanka.

Ambassador Christian Frutiger, Assistant Director General of the SDC and Head of Thematic Cooperation Division, representing Switzerland will formally transfer the SLMP management of the project to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. This handover marks Switzerland\u2019s longstanding partnership with Sri Lanka in creating sustainable policies and frameworks for labour migration.",
