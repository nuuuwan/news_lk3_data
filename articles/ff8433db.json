    "The SAARC Development Fund (SDF), in partnership with leading national institutions and technical government agencies of the five SAARC member countries, officially launched the AquaLivelihood Project in Colombo, Sri Lanka.",
    "Graced by Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar as the Chief Guest, the launch marks a pivotal regional effort to uplift smallholder fish farmers and improve nutrition security across the region.",
    "The three-year regional initiative represents a total investment of $ 3.97 million, including a $ 3.23 million grant from the SDF and $ 739,109 in in-kind co-financing. The project will directly benefit over 120,000 rural households, 30% of whom are women, across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.",
    "Titled \u201cLivelihood Enhancement of Small-Scale Fish Farmers and Nutrition Security of Rural Masses in the SAARC Region through Aquaculture Development,\u201d the project \u2013 known as AquaLivelihood \u2013 is spearheaded by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research-Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (ICAR-CIFA), in close collaboration with government agencies from each participating country: Department of Fisheries in Bangladesh, National Research and Development Centre for Aquaculture in Bhutan, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, India, Central Fisheries Promotion and Conservation Centre in Nepal, and the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka.",
    "AquaLivelihood responds to two critical regional priorities: Strengthening the livelihoods of small-scale aquaculture farmers and addressing malnutrition through sustainable fish production systems.",
    "nSurvey and technology identification \u2013 Mapping aquaculture inputs, feed, seed, and promoting inclusive practices",
    "nInfrastructure development \u2013 Establishing pilot-scale feed mills and fish hatcheries to enhance local production",
    "nCapacity building and knowledge sharing \u2013 Conducting cross-border stakeholders\u2019 training and on-farm demonstrations with a strong focus on gender equity and knowledge exchange",
    "At the launch, Minister Chandrasekar underscored the critical role of the AquaLivelihood initiative in transforming the aquaculture sector and bolstering regional food and nutrition security. He stated that AquaLivelihood is not merely a project, but a timely and transformative journey towards a more resilient future for small-scale farmers.",
    "\u201cAs our nations emerge from the shadows of the pandemic and ongoing economic challenges, this initiative serves as a unifying force by bringing together Member States, governments, researchers, and communities to uplift livelihoods, enhance nutrition, and drive collective progress,\u201d the Fisheries Minister said.",
    "Echoing this sentiment, SDF Officer-in-Charge Irosha Cooray said: \u201cThis project exemplifies the power of regional collaboration in addressing shared challenges. By empowering small-scale fish farmers, particularly women, and fostering knowledge exchange, AquaLivelihood strengthens the foundations of food security, sustainable development, and regional solidarity in our region.\u201d She said that the initiative is fully aligned with the SAARC Charter, SAARC Social Charter, and the SDF\u2019s mission to promote poverty alleviation, women empowerment, and regional integration.",
    "With its strong emphasis on scientific innovation, inclusive development, and policy synergy, AquaLivelihood is set to become a flagship regional initiative driving equitable growth, resilient food systems, and long-term prosperity across the region.",
    "Fish remains a key protein source in South Asia, sharing over 60% of animal protein supply in countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Aquaculture has shown significant growth in the region, with 11% in Nepal, 5.4% in Bangladesh, and 6-8% in India over the past decade. The fisheries sector is also a major economic driver, contributing 24% of agricultural GDP in Bangladesh and supporting the livelihoods of millions.",
    "ICAR Deputy Director General (Fisheries Science) Dr. Joykrushna Jena said: \u201cAs the lead country, India is proud to partner with Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka in this SDF-supported initiative aimed at strengthening livelihoods and nutrition through sustainable aquaculture. This project reflects our shared commitment to regional cooperation, policy alignment, and inclusive growth in the fisheries sector across South Asia.\u201d",
    "Project Coordinator and ICAR-CIFA Fish Nutrition and Physiology Division Head Dr. Shiba Shankar Giri reflected on the project\u2019s origins: \u201cThe policy dialogues and nine policy briefs we developed during the COVID-19 pandemic laid the groundwork for what has now become the AquaLivelihood Project. Seeing this vision realised is deeply rewarding. It is a collective regional commitment to transforming rural aquaculture into a vehicle for sustainable livelihoods and nutrition.\u201d",
    "National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka (NAQDA) Director General Dr. J.M. Asoka said that the AquaLivelihood Project represents a timely and strategic intervention for the South Asian region. By focusing on small-scale aquaculture, it not only enhances income opportunities for rural communities but also supports national and regional goals for food and nutrition security. \u201cFor Sri Lanka, this project complements our vision and strengthens our collaboration with neighbouring countries to build a more resilient and inclusive aquaculture sector,\u201d she said.",
    "The AquaLivelihood Project will be implemented in selected locations across five SAARC Member States: Bangladesh (Mymensingh, Narsingdi, Bogura, Bagerhat, Satkhira), Bhutan (Lhamoizhingkha, Chekiling, and selected areas in Sarpang, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Pemagatsel districts), India (Odisha, West Bengal, Punjab, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu), Nepal (Janakpur, Bhairahwa, Chitwan, Morang, Jhapa, Sunsari), and Sri Lanka (North Central and North Western Provinces).",
    "The launch of this regional project will be followed by a two-day inception workshop with implementing partners from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka to establish a shared understanding of project goals, align implementation strategies, and ensure a coordinated and impactful rollout across the region."
