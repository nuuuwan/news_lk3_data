Global inflation went up after economic bureaucrats in the US, UK, Europe and many other countries printed money and states also expanded spending during Coronavirus, using some of the printed money.

### Lawyers’ Collective speaks out on 22nd Amendment to the Constitution Bill

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution Bill, the legal effect of which would be that a Bill that seeks to extend the term of office of the President or the duration of Parliament to over five years would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the People at a Referendum. The Bill seeks to amend present Article 83(b), according to which the maximum period to which such term or duration can be extended without a Referendum is six years. Article 83 also states that any Bill that seeks to amend Article 83 itself would require a two-thirds majority and approval at a Referendum. Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the proposed Bill will require a two-thirds majority and a Referendum.

The 1983 July violence was the worst ever violence perpetuated against a section of the community which remains the darkest era of Sri Lanka’s history

Extracted from my memoirs “Pinnacle of five decades of banking – a journey beyond”

It was during the rough and tumble of the difficult environment which prevailed in the country as a whole, I had to perform my responsibilities in a branch far away from my residence, most importantly away from my family.

It was this routine and without any exaggeration to say my commitment and dedication to my responsibilities which took me to Nawalapitiya on that fateful day of “Black July” of Monday 25 July, 1983 which remains as Sri Lanka’s darkest era.

The revival program recently initiated by CBSL is a big opportunity for the banks to reduce their non-performing balance via rehabilitating the distressed customers while contributing to the national economy of Sri Lanka

A credit decision of a bank is inextricably associated with credit risk due to the micro and macroeconomic conditions which are beyond the control of the customer. Hence, the repayment capacity of the borrower can be affected by unpredictable circumstances; subsequently the liabilities of the bank will be transferred to non-performing category. These borrowers cannot be treated as wilful defaulters, and should be immediately remedied out by different tools and techniques like Restructuring, Rescheduling and Revival with Rehabilitation

### 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in Russia in 2 months!Ministry of Defense of British Defense

*2024-07-16 22:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188613) · `ta`

In the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Britain's Defense Ministry reports significant casualties among Russian forces, estimating 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in just two months. The report details heavy losses, particularly in attempts to seize Ukraine's Karkiv region, with daily fatalities exceeding 1,000 in May and June. Despite capturing territory in eastern Ukraine, Russia's inability to sustain tactical victories and the poor training of its troops are highlighted as key factors contributing to these losses. Western analysts suggest that while small-scale attack tactics offer minor gains, they do not facilitate broader operational successes, indicating a high cost-benefit ratio for Russia's military strategy.

### If Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe thinks he could win because he salvaged the economy from a free fall, he might be overly optimistic. Perhaps he has to rethink his campaign message to make it more palatable to the grassroots. Possibly, he can ask Mahinda Rajapaksa how to do that!

*2024-07-16 18:18:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84393) · `en`

When the country ran out of foreign reserves and fuel queues sprang up, Sri Lankans stormed the President’s House and ousted Gotabaya Rajapaksa. That may be an extreme case, but that was not the first time the street protestors toppled governments when the going got tough.

Dudley Senanayake, the second prime minister, was the first victim of the populist outrage after he increased the price of a measure of rice’ from subsidised 25 cents to 70 cents when it transpired rice subsidy was consuming one-third of all government revenue. Senanayake resigned after the police firing killed a couple of rioters during a mass hartal organised by the left.

However, do Sri Lankans also reward the governments that deliver, or at least make a conscious effort to generate, higher economic growth? History tells no.
