    "The Ministry of Defence has informed former MPs, former Provincial Councillors, political party leaders and political organizations, as well as officers who held executive appointments in the government to surrender the firearms and ammunition issued to them at various periods, before December 30, 2024.",
    "Issuing a statement, the Ministry of Defence said it has observed that the Sri Lanka Police and Sri Lanka Army have issued a significant number of pistols, revolvers and other firearms for the protection of Members of Parliament, Provincial Council members, political party leaders and political organizations as well as officers who held executive appointments in the government.",
    "The Ministry of Defence informs the concerned individuals, parties and organizations to hand over these firearms to the nearest police station before December 30, 2024.",
    "Further, it said that the Sri Lanka Police maintain a list of individuals who have been issued firearms and have directed Officers in Charge of all Police Stations to contact these individuals and acquire the firearms into police custody.",
    "Therefore, the Ministry of Defence requests the concerned individuals to cooperate with the police during these inquiries to maintain law and order. Additionally, individuals are requested to support this effort by providing documents confirming that they have returned firearms to the government, if they have already done so.",
    "In pursuant to Ministry of Defence press release on 06 October 2024, all licensees were informed to return their firearms and ammunition, issued for personal protection, to the Commercial Explosive Firearms and Ammunition Procurement Unit (CEFAP) at the Sri Lanka Navy camp in Welisara before 07 November 2024.",
    "However, in response to requests from various parties, including licensees currently abroad and due to insufficient time to notify all licensees through formal letters, the Ministry of Defence had decided to extend the deadline for the return of firearms and ammunition to 21 November 2024."
