    "When Charmalee asked me if I could write an appreciation of her father, K H J Wijayadasa, to mark his second death anniversary, I readily agreed, not because I am much of a writer but due to my very\u00a0 enjoyable and enriching association with him for well over 40 years.",
    "An outstanding product of the then prestigious Ceylon Civil Service, Wijayadasa \u00a0was small in size and huge in stature. Although not a flamboyant character in the Civil Service like Shirley Amarasinghe or Sarath Amunugama for that matter, he was an outstanding public servant throughout his career. His razor-sharp mind was remarkable. His wit and sense of humor were irrepressible.",
    "Wijayadasa was indeed an example of super-efficient leadership in public service. He was always prepared and always organized even after taking on far more than others and making it all work efficiently.",
    "During his tenure, holding the highest positions in public service, he could not be pressured to do the wrong thing or persuaded to protect wrongdoers.",
    "Wije \u00a0was the Government Agent in Polonnaruwa in 1970 when the UNP, led by Dudley Senanayake, lost the general election. Dudley had publicly acknowledged that Wije was the best Government Agent in the country, working tirelessly to make the food drive a success.",
    "Within 48 hours of the United Front\u2019s victory and the formation of the government with Sirimavo Bandaranaike as Prime Minister, party supporters ran berserk, thrashing UNP supporters and illegally acquiring and forcibly occupying state land including forest and tank reservations. The first thing Wije did was to appeal to the two new MPs, in Polonnaruwa and Minneriya, to help him bring this chaotic situation under control. His appeals fell on deaf ears. Disappointed, he nevertheless sprang into action using the full powers vested in the office of the Government Agent.",
    "He mobilized the police, officials of the Land Commission and Kachcheri, and duly evicted all squatters, much to the chagrin of the two new MPs Ratne Deshapriya Senanayake and Leelaratne Wijesinghe, the latter who had defeated the formidable C P de Silva. The result was Government Agent Wijayadasa being moved out of Polonnaruwa and sent to the pool, also known as the Siberia of public service. He was rescued from here by his contemporary in the university and colleague in the civil service Leel Gunasekara, the then Cabinet Secretary.",
    "In 1970, the same fate befell on two other jewels in the civil service crown, namely Bradman Weerakoon and Neville Jayaweera. Bradman was sent to Ampara and Neville driven to Vavuniya.",
    "Whenever governments change, from the UNP to the SLFP or vice versa, the powers that be willfully and typically misconstrued the efficiency of a public servant serving the government and the people diligently as sycophancy.",
    "This was Wije\u2019s fate whenever governments changed. In 1977, when the UNP returned to power, Wije was the Chairman of the Land Reform Commission in addition to several other hats he wore. Just a few days after the formation of the J R Jayewardene government, Wilhelm Bogtstra, a close friend of the new Minister of Lands and Agriculture, E L Senanayake, walked into Wije\u2019s room. Big, burly Bogtstra, requested that Wije release 50 acres of coconut land to his wife in addition to the 50 acres he had already got under land reform, \u00a0which he was entitled to. Wije, in his unassuming way, showed him the relevant clause of the Land Reform Act and asserted that he could not accede to his request unless the law is amended.",
    "Bogtstra, irritated, then handed Wije a letter from the minister which was in fact a directive to comply with this request. Wije politely told him that it was an illegal order and that he would explain to the minister. \u00a0In 24 hours Wije was sent to the pool. This time around he was rescued by the Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction, R Premadasa.",
    "Premadasa had known Wijayadasa as a resourceful and competent bureaucrat when he was the Government Agent, Polonnaruwa. He took him on as Additional Secretary to his ministry. This was the beginning of Wije\u2019s long, challenging, eventful and arduous journey with Premadasa.",
    "Very soon and as usual, in addition to his position of Additional Secretary, he had to wear several other hats in the form of chairmanships of the Central Environmental Authority, State Engineering Corporation, Road Development Authority etc. And, as if this was not enough, he was also made the Secretary to the Ministry of Highways. He was, needless to say, back in his element.",
    "In 1978, when Premadasa became Prime Minister, he chose Wije to be his secretary. \u00a0The same followed when Premadasa won the presidency.",
    "Premadasa was a visionary and a doer. He was ruthlessly efficient. He never took \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. The deadlines he set for his ambitious programs were deadly. Sometimes his demands led to extreme and awkward situations such as his insistence on taking his own teleprompter to the UN when he addressed the General Assembly, which was not allowed by UN housekeeping. On such occasions the tactician in Wijayadasa came alive. He painstakingly cultivated his own method of working with President Premadasa who could be quite unconventional and idiosyncratic in his methods.",
    "Be it Janasaviya, the one million housing program or 200 garment factories, Wije was one of the key players along with colleagues like Susil Siriwardhana and \u00a0Ailapperuma \u00a0in realizing Premadasa\u2019s vision. He was in fact a modern version of \u2018Purohitha\u2019 in Premadasa\u2019s court. \u00a0Wise counsel was readily available to President Premadasa, especially when at times he was irrational and stubborn on critical issues such as relations with India.",
    "I was fortunate to have a ringside view to all this as I was often consulted on matters relating to communications by President Premadasa. I was indeed fortunate to have served on several committees appointed by President Premadasa and headed by Wijayadasa such as the National Information Strategy and Coordinating Committee (NISAC), Committee to Formulate Guidelines on Publications by State Sector Institutions, Committee on Optimum Utilization of State-Owned Video Units and several other ad hoc committees. \u00a0Very often Wije would commence proceedings (except NISAC, where the Chairman was Neville Jayaweera) with a joke and conclude with an anecdote.",
    "Personally, I think, Wije\u2019s most fulfilling years in public service were in provincial administration as GA Ampara, Polonnaruwa and Kegalle. He toured his districts extensively, visited remote villages regularly, interacted with villagers cordially and found solutions to their problems instantly. An easygoing Government Agent, Wije endeared himself to all those poor people to whose problems he brought some relief through quick decisions and practical solutions. \u00a0He had great empathy for rural folk, being himself a \u2018Gamiya\u2019 as he would often say.",
    "Wije always safeguarded the highest traditions in public service and never tolerated any interference in or intrusion into this domain.",
    "When D B Wijetunga was accidentally catapulted into the presidency following Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s assassination, a one-time powerful secretary and diplomat \u2013 a very affable person \u2013 simultaneously ascended to a position of power in the Presidential Secretariat as an advisor to the new president. A maverick himself, \u00a0he minded his own business pretty well, for the most part, but also had a tendency to poke into other people\u2019s business which sometimes landed him in trouble.",
    "During this time, it became clear that the UNP would field Gamini Dissanayake as the presidential candidate. One day, a new adviser to the President walked into Wije\u2019s room and told him that the presidential campaign should begin from the Presidential Secretariat and that he should summon all the officers for a meeting. \u00a0Taken by surprise and angered, Wijayadasa got up from his seat like lightning and told him in a raised voice, \u2018as long as I am the Secretary I will not allow any political activity in this place; this is not a party campaign office,\u2019 and started walking towards the Presidential adviser who made a \u00a0hasty retreat.",
    "Upon his retirement from public service Wije\u2019s expertise was sought by \u00a0numerous UN agencies. He undertook significant assignments with far reaching impacts. However, one voluntary role he cherished was serving as the Chairman of the Sri Maha Bodhi Ran Vata Fund , established to erect a gold plated fence around the sacred Sri Maha Bodhiya. This brought immense joy to Buddists in Sri Lanka.",
