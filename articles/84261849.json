    "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $200 million loan equivalent to enhance\u00a0low-carbon transition investments and climate-resilient development in industrial parks in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).",
    "The total project cost is $602.25 million equivalent and is expected to be completed in 2031.",
    "\u201cADB continues to support the PRC and its climate change commitments by catalyzing financing and strengthening institutional capacity for low-carbon transitions in carbon-intensive sectors,\u201d said ADB Country Director for the PRC Safdar Parvez. \u201cThe project will benefit 1.5 million people working and living in industrial parks through reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality.\u201d",
    "Industrial\u00a0parks,\u00a0which are\u00a0designated\u00a0zones\u00a0for\u00a0industrial\u00a0use\u00a0and\u00a0factories,\u00a0are significant sources\u00a0of carbon emissions in the PRC, as industrial\u00a0 processing and activities\u00a0are highly energy intensive and depend\u00a0on\u00a0fossil\u00a0fuels.\u00a0In\u00a02020, industrial\u00a0 parks consumed one-third of the country\u2019s energy, accounting for 31% of greenhouse gas emissions.",
