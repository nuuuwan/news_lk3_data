    "World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-Zervos has commended Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts thus far with regards to finding solutions for the island\u2019s economic crisis.",
    "Speaking at an event held in Colombo on Tuesday (18 July), Faris highlighted the importance of maintaining the ongoing programme, and the need for the people of the country to be informed in this regard.",
    "\u201cThe journey\u2019s been travelled quite a bit, we a long way to go, but also there\u2019s been good progress\u201d, he said.",
    "He further noted that while Sri Lanka is currently in the phase of economic recovery, there still lie a few difficult decisions that need to be made on the path ahead.",
    "\u201cSome of have been made, but it\u2019s now the time to do it, and do it right, so we don\u2019t have to do it again\u201d, Faris said with regard to the said \u2018difficult decisions\u2019.",
    "He also noted that Sri Lanka requires \u2018deep governance reforms\u2019 that would address certain core issues in order to prevent another crisis from occurring.",
    "Highlighting the need for transformation of economic governance, Faris said, \u201cWhat happened in Sri Lanka was not a result of one to two years, one cycle to two cycles, this was years and years of build-up of policies that were not conducive to Sri Lanka\u2019s strengths\u201d.",
    "The World Bank Country Director also revealed that a new four-year strategy was recently approved by the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors last week, while USD 700 million was also approved for the island for the year 2023, with USD 500 million being given towards budget support and reforms, and USD 200 million going towards social protection systems.",
    "\u201cWe expect to extend more resources this year to help in the financial sector, but that\u2019s a very good step, and that\u2019s based on some of the key reforms that have already been taken\u201d, he said in this regard.",
    "Speaking in regard to the recently approved Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) strategy, Faris urged that the process would happen as soon as possible, explaining that prolonging the process is only likely to further increase the risk."
