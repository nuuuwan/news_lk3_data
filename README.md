### கண்டனமாக மாறிய ​கொண்டம்

*2025-09-09 10:18:23* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/சிந்தனை-சித்திரம்/பாதுகாப்பிலிருந்து-கண்டனம்-வரை-ஊழியங்களின்-மோதல்/62-364249) · `ta`

இந்த கார்ட்டூன், ஒரு வார்த்தையை எழுதி மீண்டும் எழுதும் எளிய செயல் மூலம் பொதுக் கொள்கையில் ஒரு பயங்கரமான முரண்பாட்டை அம்பலப்படுத்துகிறது.

இடதுபுறத்தில், சுகாதார அமைச்சகம் "CONDOM" என்ற சொல்லை, நீல நிற எழுத்துக்களில் எழுதுகின்றது. இதன் குறியீடு தெளிவாக உள்ளது: ஆணுறைகள் பாதுகாப்பு கருவிகளாகக் கருதப்படுகின்றன, HIV, STDகள் மற்றும் திட்டமிடப்படாத கர்ப்பங்களுக்கு எதிரான பொது சுகாதார பிரச்சாரங்களுக்கு மையமாக உள்ளன. செய்தி நடைமுறை மற்றும் தடுப்பு - தீர்ப்புக்கு முன் சுகாதாரம்.

இருப்பினும், வலதுபுறத்தில், கல்வி அமைச்சகம் அதே வார்த்தையை எடுத்துக்கொண்டு அதை "CONDEMN" என்று மாற்றுகிறது. ஒரு சிவப்பு நிற பேனாவுடன், அமைச்சகம் கதையை திறம்பட மீண்டும் எழுதுகிறது, பாதுகாப்பு செய்தியை தார்மீக நிராகரிப்புடன் மாற்றுகிறது. கீழே அமர்ந்திருக்கும் மாணவர் தெளிவாக குழப்பமடைந்து காணப்படுகிறார் - சமூகத்தின் இளைஞர்களுக்கான ஒரு நிலைப்பாடு, அவர்களை வழிநடத்த வேண்டிய நிறுவனங்களின் சமிக்ஞைகளுக்கு இடையில் சிக்கிக் கொள்கின்றனர்.

The government had claimed the ban was needed to clamp down on fake news and hate speech and accused the companies of failing to register.

Laughs sources said that huge financial muscle was needed to rescue the company. “Someone had to exit to pave the way for an investor. It was a difficult decision. But I am happy the brand will survive, company sources said. Laugfs Gas and Laugfs Power are listed companies.

### French govt collapses after Prime Minister Bayrou loses confidence vote

*2025-09-08 23:06:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112301/french-govt-collapses-after-prime-minister-bayrou-loses-confidence-vote) · `en`

French lawmakers voted to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou Monday, plunging the country into a new political crisis and leaving it without a government at a time of increasing economic strain and geopolitical tensions.

A total of 364 MPs voted against Bayrou and 194 voted for him after he called the vote in a bid to push through an unpopular €44 billion ($51 billion) savings plan that included scrapping two public holidays and freezing government spending. The 364 votes against Bayrou were well above the 280-vote threshold needed to topple the government.

Bayrou will now be forced to step down after just nine months in office, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Michel Barnier, who lost a no-confidence vote last December.

Bayrou is expected to submit his resignation to French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday morning, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The prime minister’s departure leaves Macron with few palatable options.

### Double standards in Geneva: Sri Lanka’s journey and Core Group’s contradictions

Selectivity weakens not only resolutions on Sri Lanka but the credibility of the entire multilateral system

More than 15 years have passed since Sri Lanka’s armed conflict ended in May 2009. The years since have been difficult, but also marked by important progress. Successive Governments have pursued policies of reconciliation and accountability. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), appointed in 2010, produced a comprehensive report in 2011 with recommendations on governance, reconciliation, and human rights. In 2016, Parliament established the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) to trace thousands unaccounted for during the war, and in 2018 the Office for Reparations was created to address the needs of victims and their families.

### Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power faces legacy of civil war

President Anura Kumara Disanayake and his National People’s Power Government are struggling to build a more stable, inclusive political culture in Sri Lanka. A mix of bold action and political skill will be needed. Support from the UN Human Rights Council can help.

The election of President Anura Kumara Disanayake in September 2024, and the landslide parliamentary victory of his National People’s Power (NPP) alliance two months later, have ignited hope throughout Sri Lanka. Elected on a mandate to eliminate the widely reported large-scale corruption, nepotism and abuse of power that contributed to the country’s economic collapse in 2022, the NPP appealed to voters in large part because it lacked experience in office and was distant from the elite-dominated parties that had ruled Sri Lanka since independence in 1948. Among their more soaring goals, Disanayake and the NPP pledged to fight impunity and establish a “new political culture”.

### Sustainable Intelligence: Data & AI For A Resilient Future

*2025-09-08 19:54:04* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sustainable-intelligence-data-ai-for-a-resilient-future/) · `en`

In the 21st century, intelligence is no longer the sole preserve of human wisdom. It now includes the vast realms of data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Yet intelligence on its own is not enough. The same brilliance that split the atom also created fear of annihilation. The same ingenuity that mapped every corner of the Earth has failed to safeguard it.

The urgent challenge before us is to align intelligence with sustainability — intelligence that respects ecological limits, empowers communities, and ensures resilience for future generations.

Sustainable intelligence goes beyond being “smart.” It is about being wise. We can see this progression in three layers:

Nature itself models this. In a forest, trees process carbon, exchange nutrients, and even “communicate” underground. They do not optimize for growth alone but for the survival of the entire ecosystem. That is sustainable intelligence.
