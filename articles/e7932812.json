    "Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - As scorching temperatures continue to sweep across Sri Lanka, the Vets in Sri Lanka have issued a stark call to action, urging public to provide water access to animals especially birds.",
    "Speaking to Daily Mirror, Sri Lanka Veterinary Association Secretary Dr. Desika Jayasinghe said animals, much like humans are susceptible to a range of heat-related ailments including heatstroke, rashes, sunburns, diseases and parasite attacks.",
    "\"Dehydration is the main challenge that both wild animals and pets face this season,\" stated Dr. Jayasinghe. \"High temperatures exacerbate water loss in animals through sweating or panting, leading to dehydration\u2014a condition where the body loses more fluid than it takes in.\" she added.",
    "\u201cThe consequences of dehydration can be dire, ranging from lethargy and weakness to organ failure or death in severe cases. Recognizing the signs of dehydration\u2014such as sunken eyes, dry mouth, and rapid heartbeat\u2014is crucial for pet owners to intervene promptly,\u201d she explained.",
    "Further, Dr Jayasinghe said special attention must be given to vulnerable animals such as cubs, as well as those who are sick or elderly,",
    "\u201cThe key to mitigating heat stress in animals epically birds lies in providing them with access to essential resources. This includes ensuring they have constant access to clean water, as well as creating shaded areas where they can seek respite from the relentless sun,\u201d she pointed out.",
    "Furthermore, owners are advised to refrain from engaging animals in strenuous activities during the hottest parts of the day, while also offering opportunities for them to cool off through methods like swimming or wetting their fur."
