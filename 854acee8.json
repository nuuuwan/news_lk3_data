    "Colombo News 1st: Today (23) is a day that brings back the memories of one of the darkest days in Sri Lankan History.",
    "Today (23) marks 40 years since \"Black July\" a day on which Sri Lankans who had been living in peace and harmony for thousands of years were divided and pitted against each other, all for the selfish political goals of a few.",
    "The violence that gripped Sri Lanka on a day like today, 40 years ago split our society in half and changed the course of our nation forever.",
    "The violence on that day claimed the lives of many of our brothers and sisters and the destruction to property on that day was immeasurable.",
    "The events that led up to this bloodshed are written in Sri Lanka's history books and one thing that is clear is that this day of violence was not an isolated incident.",
    "This bloodshed was the result of the political decisions of Sri Lanka's post-independence leaders, which divided and shattered Sri Lanka's society.",
    "These political decisions were made to serve the selfish political aspirations of a few and not for the greater good of Sri Lanka.",
    "The rulers consolidated their power while their families' places in Sri Lanka's political sphere were assured.",
    "The people were divided while the economy was in tatters. Thousands of innocent people lost their lives. While this incident was a direct result of the selfish political aspirations of a few, we must not forget the brave Sri Lankans who worked against this violence and bloodshed.",
    "While a few in power worked to sow the seeds of hatred, there were those who protected their fellow citizens at great risk of their own safety.",
    "The story of those who risked their lives to protect their fellow brothers and sisters amidst the chaos speaks volumes of what true Sri Lankan patriotism and brotherhood should be.",
    "Sri Lanka is a stark example of what happens to a nation divided on religious and racial grounds.",
    "The only hope for a better Sri Lanka is to move forward as one people, united in our ambition to become a developed nation."
