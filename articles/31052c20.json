    "Geometry Global, a strategic business unit of the Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka, has achieved a significant milestone as Sri Lanka\u2019s only agency to be recognised at the prestigious Epica Awards 2024.",
    "The agency secured a Bronze in the \u2018Public Interest \u2013 Social Advocacy\u2019 category for its meaningful \u2018Books that Keep on Giving\u2019 campaign for ProMate (Printxcel), a leading stationery manufacturer in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Epica Awards are the only global creative awards judged by journalists from the marketing and communications industry, with the 2024 winners being evaluated in Paris by a jury of editors and media personnel from across Europe and the United States.",
    "Geometry Global\u2019s Books that Keep on Giving initiative for ProMate Sri Lanka addresses the critical social need of supporting visually impaired students\u2019 education amid Sri Lanka\u2019s 300% surge in paper costs. Armed with the insight that over Rs. 25 billion worth of paper are discarded annually in the country, the campaign called on the public to donate their used notebooks which were then upcycled for Braille writing. Repurposing the donated notebooks in this manner meant that they offered visually impaired students the same learning opportunities of a brand-new book, making them Books that Keep on Giving.",
    "The campaign\u2019s main communication asset was a touching video that called on all Sri Lankans to contribute to the cause, which became a viral success that inspired companies, schools, charities and individuals to take action. Collection points were setup across the country through ProMate\u2019s branch network and partnership with Volunteer Sri Lanka, with collections to date accumulating sufficient materials to support visually impaired students across all government schools in Sri Lanka.",
    "Geometry Global Creative Group Head Nadeera Warawita said: \u201cThe Books that Keep on Giving campaign stemmed from a fundamental truth: even something perceived as waste can hold value for another. A used notebook provides a visually impaired student with the same opportunity for learning and growth as a new one. This message resonated powerfully across the country, inspiring individuals, businesses, and organisations to upcycle materials and champion inclusive education. Further, to be recognised on a global stage like the Epica Awards, judged by esteemed members of the international press, underscores the power and impact of this initiative. We are incredibly proud of this achievement, proud of the impact achieved through this simple act of repurposing, and deeply appreciate ProMate\u2019s partnership in bringing this vision to life.\u201d",
    "The Bronze award at Epica 2024 builds on Geometry Global\u2019s recent success at the Dragons of Asia 2024, where the agency clinched the coveted Blue Dragon for the \u2018Best Campaign in Country\u2019 and the Gold in the \u2018Best Cause/Charity Marketing\u2019 category. At the Dragons of Sri Lanka Awards, the campaign earned additional recognition with the Gold for \u2018Best Small Budget Campaign\u2019, a Silver for \u2018Best Brand Building/Awareness Campaign\u2019, and a Black Dragon for \u2018Best Social Media Campaign\u2019. These awards recognised the campaign\u2019s innovative approach and the power of purpose-driven marketing in creating meaningful social impact."
