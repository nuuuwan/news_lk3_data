### Copyright and creativity: Why Sri Lanka must embrace global standards

Sri Lanka exists within the global community, not apart from it. Yet, in public discourse surrounding law, technology, governance, and culture, a recurring theme persists: the belief that Sri Lanka is somehow exceptional, requiring uniquely local solutions. While national context is important, this mindset often overlooks a critical reality: we operate within an interconnected world governed by international norms. Nowhere is this more evident than in the realm of copyright law, particularly in music.

### French govt collapses after Prime Minister Bayrou loses confidence vote

French lawmakers voted to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou Monday, plunging the country into a new political crisis and leaving it without a government at a time of increasing economic strain and geopolitical tensions.

A total of 364 MPs voted against Bayrou and 194 voted for him after he called the vote in a bid to push through an unpopular €44 billion ($51 billion) savings plan that included scrapping two public holidays and freezing government spending. The 364 votes against Bayrou were well above the 280-vote threshold needed to topple the government.

Bayrou will now be forced to step down after just nine months in office, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Michel Barnier, who lost a no-confidence vote last December.

Bayrou is expected to submit his resignation to French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday morning, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The prime minister’s departure leaves Macron with few palatable options.

Selectivity weakens not only resolutions on Sri Lanka but the credibility of the entire multilateral system

More than 15 years have passed since Sri Lanka’s armed conflict ended in May 2009. The years since have been difficult, but also marked by important progress. Successive Governments have pursued policies of reconciliation and accountability. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), appointed in 2010, produced a comprehensive report in 2011 with recommendations on governance, reconciliation, and human rights. In 2016, Parliament established the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) to trace thousands unaccounted for during the war, and in 2018 the Office for Reparations was created to address the needs of victims and their families.

### Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power faces legacy of civil war

President Anura Kumara Disanayake and his National People’s Power Government are struggling to build a more stable, inclusive political culture in Sri Lanka. A mix of bold action and political skill will be needed. Support from the UN Human Rights Council can help.

The election of President Anura Kumara Disanayake in September 2024, and the landslide parliamentary victory of his National People’s Power (NPP) alliance two months later, have ignited hope throughout Sri Lanka. Elected on a mandate to eliminate the widely reported large-scale corruption, nepotism and abuse of power that contributed to the country’s economic collapse in 2022, the NPP appealed to voters in large part because it lacked experience in office and was distant from the elite-dominated parties that had ruled Sri Lanka since independence in 1948. Among their more soaring goals, Disanayake and the NPP pledged to fight impunity and establish a “new political culture”.
