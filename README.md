These elections, originally slated for 25 April 2020, became a significant factor in the Government’s response to the crisis. With a new Executive President elected on 16 November 2019, and the dissolution of Parliament on 2 March 2020, the timing of the pandemic’s emergence and the subsequent actions taken by the Government were intricately tied to political considerations
