    "Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - United Republican Front (URF) leader Patali Champika Ranawaka said the recent incident involving the alleged harassment of Russian tourists at a beach hotel in Sri Lanka is deeply regrettable and unacceptable.",
    "In a statement, he said Sri Lanka and Russia have enjoyed longstanding and strong diplomatic relationships, built on mutual respect and cooperation. Such incidents tarnish the reputation of both countries and undermine the goodwill that exists between them.",
    "\"As a party, we strongly urge the government to take immediate and decisive action to investigate into the matter thoroughly and apprehend the culprits responsible for the harassment. It is essential that justice is served swiftly and that the guilty parties face the maximum punishment under the law, if found culpable.",
    "\"Furthermore, steps should be taken to ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future and that the safety and well-being of all tourists, including Russian visitors, are safeguarded. The relevant authorities must prioritize the protection of tourists and uphold the standards of hospitality and respect that Sri Lanka is known for.",
    "\"We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining the strong and friendly relations between Sri Lanka and Russia, and we call upon the government to take all necessary measures to preserve and strengthen these ties. Let us work together to ensure that all visitors to Sri Lanka, including Russian tourists, feel welcomed, respected and safe throughout their stay,\" he added."
