    "On that historic morning of February 4, 1948 as the Lion flag of Ceylon proudly fluttered in the morning breeze at Independence Hall, the first seeds of communalism had begun to sprout. As every Sri Lankan is aware the main features of our National flag are a golden colored lion, holding in its right paw a sword referred to as a Kasthane and from the four corners are four spires similar to what can be seen on the top of Dagobas.",
    "However the minorities were dissatisfied. They questioned the significance of such a flag as being referred to as our National flag on which the minorities were not symbolically represented ? The authorities responsible for designing this flag were concerned. They realized that antagonizing the minorities at this stage in our country\u2019s history was a matter to be settled without delay. However, with all due respects to our country\u2019s bureaucracy whose work ethic seemed to be \u201cHemin,Hemin\u201d it was three years after Independence that on March 2, 1951 two stripes \u2013 an orange colored stripe to represent the Tamil community and a green colored stripe to represent the Muslim community were added on the left side of the flag facing the lion",
    "But that was not the end of the changes being made to our National flag. There were more significant additions. Twelve years later, on May 22, 1972 under the direction of Dr.Nissanka Wijeyeratne who was Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Chairman of the National Emblem and Flag Design Committee the four spires were replaced by four Bo leaves to represent Buddhism which is undisputedly accepted as being the religion of the majority of this island.",
    "In addition to the changes made to our National flag it is relevant to mention that after Independence the name of our country had been changed twice. The first change was made in May 1972 when we were renamed as the Free Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka. The second occasion was on September 7, 1978 when we became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Furthermore it is very unlikely that many readers of this journal would realize that long before our country gained independence sports clubs were formed based on communal lines",
    "The Colombo Malay Cricket Club ( CMCC) was formed in 1872 and is the oldest cricket club in the island. Singhalese (that\u2019s the club\u2019s official spelling) Sports Club (SSC) in 1899, Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, (TUC & A C ) popularly referred to as the \u2018Oval\u2019 or the \u2018P Sara Stadium\u2019 also in 1899, the Burgher Recreation Club (BRC) in 1896 and Moors Sports Club in 1908. As to whether cricketers became members of any one of these clubs for reasons of ethnicity is a debatable issue.",
    "However ethnicity may not have been the deciding factor. It was likely that aspiring young schoolboy cricketers wanted to be associated with the senior members of the club through whose influence suitable jobs would be found in the private sector. Furthermore there would be the opportunity of being able to continue playing cricket and represent the club in local tournaments and even be selected to represent the country in cricket. Certain companies such as Freudenbergs and Maharajas selected cricketers, who were well paid, given fully maintained official cars for their private use and most importantly sufficient time for cricket practices.",
    "It is also worth mentioning that many of the island\u2019s cricketers were educated in colleges in which cricket was one , if not the most important, of sports in the extra-curricular activities of that particular college. For example, there was one college in which being the captain of the First XI cricket team became a stepping stone to the highest position a student could achieve which was to be appointed as a Prefect !",
    "August 12, 2005 was one of the saddest days in Sri Lanka\u2019s post independence history. It was on that fateful day that one of Sri Lanka\u2019s noblest sons was assassinated. He was Lakshman Kadirgamar \u2013 humanitarian, lawyer, and most importantly a statesman of the highest caliber. As Minister of Foreign Affairs he won the respect of all the world\u2019s leaders. Truly, it can be said of him that he bestrode the world like a Colossus. Had he lived there was every possibility that he could and should have been elected as President of our country.",
    "Next to be remembered was that rotund \u2018entrepreneur showman\u2019 Donavan Andree. He will be best known for that amazing and fascinating show \u2018 Holiday on Ice\u2019 where a mobile ice rink with portable refrigeration was imported and installed. He catered to music lovers by getting down the Golden Gate Quartet, the Duke Ellington Band whose jazz compositions were world famous and the Harlem Black Birds. He financially supported Sri Lankan singers such as Cliff Foenander, Bill Forbes and the \u2018Queen of Songs\u2019 Erin de Selfa. He introduced All- In wrestling where unknown to the cheering crowds, the verdicts many of the bouts were pre-planned. While Dara Singh who was a favorite of the spectators displayed his muscle power Wong Bok Lee who was often \u2018booed\u2019 by the crowd, specialized in the \u2018flying kick.\u2019",
    "In 1955 Donovan Andree was elected \u2018The \u2018Personality of the Year\u2019 contest sponsored by the Sunday Observer, by obtaining the most number of \u2018votes\u2019 submitted by readers, defeating the then Prime Minister Sir John Kotalawala. It was rumored that Donovan Andree had sent his trusted employees early each Sunday morning to purchase as many copies of the Sunday Observer from which the contest coupons were cut off, Donovan Andree\u2019s name inserted and subsequently hand delivered to the Sunday Observer office.",
    "It is a fact that Donovan Andree earned money through his casinos. But it must be mentioned that he also spent as much as he earned in helping the less fortunate.",
    "For satire and humor there was that unmatchable duo \u2013 Aubrey Collette and Tarzie Vittachi. Aubrey Collette had the knack of transforming serious issues into cartoons which were incisive, satirical and humorous. These appeared in the Times of Ceylon and Sunday Observer during the early post independent years. He displayed a deep insight into the foibles and failures of politicians. In fact with his cartoons he played around with the political elite. They in turn were delighted in being featured. It has been said that Sir John Kotelawela had hung on the walls of his residence at Kandawela a series of cartoons depicting politicians including those of himself.",
    "Tarzie Vittachi will best be remembered for his column in the Sunday Observer titled \u2018Bouquets and Brickbats\u2019 which he wrote under the pseudonym \u2018Fly-By-Night. It included a fictitious island inhabited by talking animals who were easily identified as well known politicians.",
    "With all due respects to the surviving members of their respective families, the writer takes the liberty of quoting Tarzie Vittachi -The Tired Tortoise ( Dudley Senanayake ), The Rogue Elephant (Who else but Sir John Kotelawela !) The Seethala Kotiya (J.R. Jayawardene) The Slippery Eel (S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike) \u2018The Depath Naya\u2019 \u2013 R.G. Senanayake who created political history by winning two seats in two different electorates at the same General Elections \u2013 Dambadeniya and Kelaniya!",
    "Tarzie Vittachi won the Magasaysay Award for his book \u2018Emergency -58\u2019 which was an honest exposition of the political wheeler- dealings that led to the Anti \u2013Tamil race riots of 1958. As can be expected the book was banned in this country, making it one of the best sellers overseas. Later wiser counsel prevailed and the ban was lifted. Outside the door of his office in the UNICEF building in New York where he worked Tarzie Vittachi had hung a satirical motto which reflected his persona \u2018EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE\u2019",
