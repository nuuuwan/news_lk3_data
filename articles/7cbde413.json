    "Tensions erupted at the United Nations General Assembly today as many delegates walked out in protest, the moment Netanyahu took the stage, signaling a strong diplomatic backlash.A growing number of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, with more than 145 nations now joining the call for international recognition.They join Canada, Australia and Portugal, as well as the United Kingdom, which announced its recognition on Sunday, in a move that deepens Israel\u2019s international isolation amid anger regarding its conduct in the Gaza war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York today.He stated that recognition of a Palestinian state is \"sheer madness, it's insane and we won't do it\", adding that recognition by several other countries is \"disgraceful\".As Netanyahu took to the stage, dozens of people filed out of the room in New York in protest, as some applauded.The Israeli PM also spoke of Iran, Houthis and Hamas, in his address.\u00a0Netanyahu then suggested that much of the world doesn't remember the attacks of 7 October 2023.\"But we remember,\" he added, before pointing to a QR code on a badge on his jacket, which he says contains the reason \"why we fight, and why we must win\".Netanyahu then went on to describe some of the events of 7 October, saying that some of those taken hostage were Holocaust survivors, as well as grandparents and their grandchildren.He said Israel has brought home 207 of these hostages, adding that 20 of the 48 remaining in Gaza are alive.He read the names of these 20 from a list, before speaking directly to the hostages through loudspeakers the Israeli military has set up on the Gaza border.Then, he brought out placards, and did a \"pop quiz\".The first read: \"Who shouts death to America?\", with the answers reading: \"a) Iran, b) Hamas, c) Hezbollah, d) Houthis, e) all the above\".Shouts could be heard in the hall, and Netanyahu ticked the option for \"e) all of the above\".Netanyahu further said that President Trump \"understands better than any other leader that Israel and America face a common threat\".He added that in the wake of the 7 October attack, many leaders supported Israel, but that support has since \"evaporated\".International media reported that as Netanyahu praised President Trump and spoke of the assassination attempts against him, those seated at the table broke out into applause.Netanyahu then reacted to the decision of countries including France and the UK to recognise a Palestinian state, calling it \"national suicide\" for Israel.It's \"sheer madness, it's insane and we won't do it\", the Israeli PM said.Upon the conclusion of his address thereafter, the Israeli delegation gave Netanyahu a standing ovation."
