    "The electronic products sales market in Sri Lanka is expected to show sustained weakness in the next 12-18 months due to prolonged weak demand, according to a report from Fitch Ratings.",
    "Fitch expects Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP to contract by 1.4% in 2023 (2022: 7.8% decline), before growing modestly by 3.3% in 2024, indicating only a gradual recovery in economic activity.",
    "\u201cConsumer income has yet to adjust to the higher cost of living while the increase in taxes in early 2023 weakened purchasing power\u201d, Fitch states.",
    "The ratings agency expects sales volumes of Singer Sri Lanka, the foremost consumer durables retailer in the country, to rise in the low single digits in the financial year 2024.",
    "The report titled, \u2018Fitch Downgrades Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC to \u2018A(lka)\u2019; Outlook Stable\u2019, the agency points out that the downgrade reflects the sustained deterioration in Singer\u2019s financial profile such that Fitch-forecasted EBITDAR fixed-charge cover will fall to 0.7x in the financial year ending 31 March 2024 (FY24), compared with 1.1x in FY23.",
    "\u201cThe Stable Outlook reflects Singer\u2019s adequate liquidity supported by its access to domestic banks. We expect that the company\u2019s EBITDA will recover gradually in the next two years supported by a slow improvement in demand amid falling interest rates and the removal of the ban on consumer durable imports since October 2023,\u201d Fitch says.",
    "However, Fitch doesn\u2019t expect Singer Sri Lanka\u2019s fixed charge cover to improve to above 1.2x \u2013 the level commensurate with a higher rating \u2013 until after FY25.",
    "\u201cWe forecast Singer\u2019s sales volumes to grow by double digits in FY25, due to a gradual recovery in income supported by a revival in the agriculture sector, which accounts for 30% of the population, salary increments across the public and private sectors, and a full year\u2019s impact of pent-up demand after the removal of a ban on consumer-durables imports in October 2023. Hire-purchase (HP) and credit sales should also rise with interest rates almost halving from the highs in FY23, and we expect Singer will selectively grow its HP book, which shrank in the last few years, to cater to this demand. We expect Singer\u2019s EBITDAR margin to improve to around 9% in FY25, from 3.3% in 1HFY24, benefitting from revenue growth, prudent inventory management, and a shift towards high-margin product categories.",
    "\u201cWe estimate Singer\u2019s cash interest to reduce by 35% in FY24 as interest rates fall. Market interest rates have fallen to 13% by November 2023, from 30% a year ago. Given most of Singer\u2019s debt is short-term, the company should be able reprice faster at favourable rates. However, we do not believe Singer\u2019s EBITDAR generation in FY24 will be sufficient to cover the reduced interest cost,\u201d Fitch says.",
    "According to the report, Singer\u2019s rating is not notched for support from its stronger parent, Hayleys PLC, as they believe Hayleys has limited incentive to provide support according to their Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria.",
    "\u201cThe \u2018Low\u2019 legal incentive stems from the absence of corporate guarantees from Hayleys on Singer\u2019s debt, and the lack of cross-default clauses between the two entities. Hayleys is a highly diversified group, resulting in limited operational synergies with Singer. Furthermore, Singer has an independent management team and its brand is separate from that of Hayleys. Therefore, the operational incentive to support is also regarded as \u2018Low\u2019, Fitch says.",
