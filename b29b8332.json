    "The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party filed a fundamental rights petition before the Supreme Court yesterday against the proposed Anti-Terrorism Draft Bill.",
    "The petition was filed by MP Vijitha Herath on behalf of the party through Counsel and NPP member Sunil Watagala.",
    "In his petition, MP Herath has requested an order declaring that specific provisions of the Draft Bill, currently on the Parliament\u2019s agenda, violate the sovereignty of the Sri Lankan people and fundamental human rights enshrined in the constitution of Sri Lanka.",
    "He noted that many offences declared as acts of terrorism in the Draft Bill are already covered under the Sri Lankan Penal Code.",
    "The petitioner therefore urged the apex court to mandate its passage by a two-thirds majority in Parliament and through a referendum.",
    "Addressing the media outside the court complex, Watagala said the Draft Bill appears to be in violation of the constitution and the fundamental rights set out in it. He called on the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to withdraw the Draft Bill immediately."
