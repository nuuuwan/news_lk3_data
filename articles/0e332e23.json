    "\u201c(Nasrallah) was not an individual. He was a path and a school of thought and the path will be continued,\u201d Khamenei said in a statement read on State television, in which he announced five days of mourning in Iran. \u201cThe blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged,\u201d he said.",

    "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian blamed Nasrallah\u2019s killing partly on the United States, which has long supplied Israel with advanced weapons."
