    "Government, which provides almost the entirety of primary and secondary education, is on a mission to reform the education system. It is most timely. The widespread application of digital technology in most activities (general artificial intelligence) in many societies is on a scale comparable to the use of electricity as an energy source in the first half of the 20th century. It is pervasive. It reduces production costs and enables the creation of new goods and services. Super artificial intelligence holds forth prospects of hitherto unimagined creative activity, whether for good or for ill. There is no escape from the need to teach, learn and practice artificial intelligence. It is feared that super artificial intelligence may come to be beyond the comprehension of any human. Children who begin their secondary schooling now will enter the workforce in the decades beyond 2035. There is no detailed mapping of what that economy and society would be like, but there is little doubt that the \u2018brave new world\u2019 is one that, if we miss, we will be in the backwoods again. Therefore, serious thought on what might be taught in schools is most timely.",
    "In secondary schools, children learn for seven periods of 50 minutes each, every weekday. Although the \u2018liberal arts\u2019 dominated school and university education in the 19th and early 20th centuries, mathematics and science must now form the basis of all systematic education. We must understand the forces at work in societies where constant vigilance is essential to make civilised life possible. A good school will teach first language, second language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biological sciences and social studies, every day to all students: 15 periods for basic subjects (2 languages plus mathematics), 10 periods for the three sciences (physics, chemistry and biology) and 5 periods for social studies. That leaves 5 periods during a week when students may choose to study religion and fine arts. There will be arguments about whether we should teach religion and fine arts more often in school. The central question is what can be dropped from the 30 periods a week to accommodate more religion and fine arts, and I see none. Languages and mathematics, social studies and basic sciences must be taught in schools. From the viewpoint of a student and a parent, consider the following situation. You have a brilliant child who scores in the high 90s in languages and mathematics consistently in school. Would you teach that child religion and fine arts at the expense of mathematics, biology and social studies? The answer you give in respect of your child applies to all children. Would you drop physics to accommodate the teaching of religion and/or fine arts? Would you drop social studies to accommodate them? If you do not agree to drop any one of them, you are left with 5 periods in the week to teach religion and fine arts.",
    "I would be happy with three periods in the week to study religion. (I did not spend any time in school studying religion or the fine arts.) If you use three periods in the week to study religion, that time must be used to introduce young people to the variety of religions and religious practices, the world over. Studies of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, some idea of Judaism and other forms of religious beliefs and practices over 6 years will introduce the children into that world, its variety, its values and conflicts in a way that is unlikely to be done at any other stage in his/her life. Religiosity in one\u2019s parents\u2019 religion can be taught at home and in places of respective worship and prayer. It is being done very well now in kovils, viharas, churches, and mosques. There is little need for duplication. I understand the teaching of fine arts poorly. In answering questions about subjects that can be substituted for the ones that I have proposed, a prior question to answer is, what would you drop to accommodate the substitute?",
    "The government makes a horrible mistake by dropping social studies (social science) from the curriculum of secondary education. Languages and mathematics lay the foundations for all other learning. (In medieval times, in Europe, they formed the trivium) Both mathematics and language help us to convert our abstract ideas into forms accessible to others.",
    "The study of physics, biology, and chemistry helps us understand nature. There is no way that a civilized society can ignore the study of the society in which it lives and which is changing rapidly as now. Notwithstanding Rousseau\u2019s well-known dictum, man is not born free but utterly dependent. What degree of autonomy one achieves is a product of the society one lives in. A Chinese who has a regular income in the Sichuan Province is free in a way that her compatriot, without a regular income in Anhui Province, is not. A young woman teaching chemistry in Lahore University is free in a way that an illiterate fruit vendor in Chattogram is not. The Magna Carta, an agreement arrived at in Latin between an English king and his barons in 1215 CE, is quoted in a court in Lagos, Nigeria in 2025 to seek the freedom of a young undergraduate arrested by the police. All these are products of social relations. It is not only Newton\u2019s second law of thermodynamics that all educated people must be familiar with but also Marx\u2019s interpretation of human history.",
    "Our own society is rotten with corruption, riddled with crime and striving and struggling for a better life. Apart from the need to understand problems in our society, there is no general study of this society in any language as it changes under numerous pressures.",
    "Another dozen books can be written on Gemunu\u2019s attack on Vijitapura and two dozen on Suniyama but there is nothing on life in slums in Maradana; nothing on the emigration for employment in West Asia; and nothing on the lives of masses of people transplanted into the less thickly populated northeastern Sri Lanka, although a descendant of one of them was elected president of the republic. We must understand the nature of these problems and solutions there for, and interest in them can well begin in secondary schools. Besides, we live in an increasingly integrated world where norms of behaviour seem to be determined by crude strength, whether military, technological or economic and where deprivation and cruelty are acceptable as normal. Children in secondary schools will learn about social relations as they mature into citizenship. Social studies will help them in the process.",
    "There is a second set of problems which the government plans to solve: the size of the student population in each school. This problem has been alive since at least the mid-1960s. The Department of Education then, with the assistance of the World Bank, studied this issue, but the proposals came up against the opposition of teachers\u2019 unions and of some politicians. In 2023, of 10,000 schools, some 1,500 had less than 50 students on roll. They were all Type 2 and Type 3 schools and about 90 percent had Grades 1-5. These children, aged 5 to 10 years, cannot travel long to join large schools. Most of them come from low-income families with parents who themselves did not receive much education. Of all schools, some 3,000 had less than 10 teachers each. On these many accounts, children in small schools suffer from limited options compared to those in larger schools. It is more expensive per student to run these schools than larger schools. Although it may sound reasonable to close these schools and absorb the displaced children in larger schools, in the circumstances, it is not practicable to do so without harming the interests of those children. The higher costs have to be borne.",
    "Bandula Gunawardena, when he was the minister of education, started a highly commendable programme of opening schools that taught technology in towns spread over the country. That practice, with necessary changes, can be carried out usefully. The government can also use the infrastructure of some Central Schools to teach the new curriculum. Where new centres of population have grown, as in Horowapatana, Embilipitiya and in the north, as well as the plantations (which I have not visited of late) new schools need to be built.",
    "A problem which has not been raised by the government is that of the supply of teachers. Taken as a whole, there are plenty of teachers: about one teacher for every 20 students. Of these 240,000 or so teachers, except for some 2 %, all are either trained university graduates, university graduates or otherwise trained professionals.",
    "The small schools absorb a disproportionately large number of teachers. Schools in large towns with many secondary schools attract teachers for a variety of reasons. Schools in between suffer from a shortage of teachers. Teachers of English, Mathematics and Science are especially scarce in small towns and rural areas, a deep contrast to a surplus of teachers in urban areas. Within a square mile of the Royal College on Reid Avenue, there are 12 \u2018good schools\u2019. Private tuition, whether individually or in classes, steps in to help students where schools do not have the right teachers. The large number of students who seek admission to arts faculties in universities do so because there are no opportunities in their schools to study English, mathematics and science. They turn to anthropology and fine arts for lack of options.",
    "An adequate supply of teachers in English, mathematics and sciences will change the social composition of the student populations in the relevant faculties in universities and make better sense of state education. The whole nation will gain.",
    "Before I close, I want to make two more comments. For a long time, commentators have spoken of rote learning in Japan, South Korea, China, India and the rest of Asia. Although so far there are few Nobel prizes awarded to persons working in these countries, they also have produced the Toyota car, Samsung cell phone, most of the world\u2019s supply of advanced computer chips and some of the world\u2019s leading institutes of technology, whether in Harbin or in Chennai. Above all, in one generation, one billion people in China and India have been raised out of poverty. That is not bad for rote learning.",
    "In the same vein, there is the complaint that there is no \u2018critical thinking\u2019 among teachers and students in Asian communities. Is there critical thinking in lecture halls in US, where a teacher lectures to an audience of a few hundred? Questioning takes place in small groups where students have intimacy of discussion, where students have access to books and papers, and now the internet, and there is an active intellectual life. You have to spend an academic year in Cambridge or Princeton to appreciate an intellectual atmosphere. It is the tutorial system and that atmosphere that contribute to the legendary good teaching in Oxford and Cambridge.",
    "In the US, it is in graduate schools that students come into close contact with star teachers. You can meet thousands of graduates who attended even the most prestigious universities in the US, who never met the star professors at their university, whom they see on television. It would also help if those who complain about the lack of critical thinking in our universities give their understanding of \u2018critical thinking\u2019. Please don\u2019t quote a professor in Yale as your explanation. We can read her contributions ourselves.",
