    "The 16 days of Activism against Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) commemorated globally starting 25 November each year, is an invaluable tool to raise awareness on these important issues and to support complex public discussions about violence against women and girls.",
    "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka as a part of its overall engagement with Uber Sri Lanka, has partnered with its Rides and Eats businesses in the lead up to the 16 Days of Activism this year, to launch \u2018Delivering Change\u2019. #End SGBV\u2019, a campaign to build awareness through its network of couriers, drivers, merchant partners, and customer base across both Rides and Eats platforms in Colombo, to speak up and advocate for social issues through SGBV.",
    "Commenting on the partnership, Varun Wijewardane, General Manager of Uber Eats Sri Lanka, noted, \u201cAt Uber, we are committed to supporting the communities we serve. This partnership with UNDP to spread awareness about available channels of support to combat sexual and gender based violence is a step in the right direction. We are proud to lend our platform to this important cause and hope it can contribute to delivering change.\u201d",
    "As part of this partnership, Gender experts from UNDP will undertake in-person sensitization sessions for select drivers and couriers from Uber and Uber Eats respectively, to raise awareness about SGBV and provide practical guidance on how to handle such sensitive situations during their rides or deliveries. In solidarity with the campaign, drivers, couriers, and merchant partners will wear orange armbands as a visible symbol of support signifying our collective commitment to fostering a safer environment for all, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and vigilance. Information kits with details on getting support for survivors of SGBV will be provided to high-volume merchant partners to be included in all take-away orders during the 16 days of activism. Across the 16 days of activism, eaters will receive in-app messaging with vital information on protections and support available for victims of SGBV.",
    "Highlighting the importance of such partnerships, Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka, noted, \u201cFighting gender-based violence requires a whole of the society efforts. Therefore, UNDP supports partners in their efforts including ensuring that women survivors have access to legal support, economic and social essential services and receive an enabling environment to rebuild their lives. Working together with partners such as Uber Sri Lanka, UNDP reiterates our commitment to standing with survivors, giving them a voice and facilitating their empowerment.\u201d",
    "Violence against women continues to be an obstacle to achieving equality, development, peace as well as to the fulfillment of women and girls\u2019 human rights. The promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2013 to leave no one behind \u2013 cannot be fulfilled without putting an end to violence against women and girls. The \u2018Delivering Change, #End SGBV\u2019 advocacy campaign which commenced today, will run throughout the 16 Days of Activism period which ends on 10 December 2023, with UBER Eats couriers, merchant partners and customers carrying the important message to stand united against SGBV in Sri Lanka.",
