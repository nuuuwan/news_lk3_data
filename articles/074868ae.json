    "Ogilvy Sri Lanka\u2019s\u00a0\u2018Second Life Notebooks\u2019\u00a0campaign for ProMate (PrintXcel) has become the most internationally awarded campaign in Sri Lankan advertising history, securing 17 awards and shortlist honors at prestigious global festivals, including Cannes Lions, D&AD, Clio Awards, and Spikes Asia.",
    "The campaign was born out of necessity during Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, which caused a 300% surge in paper prices, making Braille notebooks unaffordable for visually impaired students. Geometry Global Sri Lanka, part of Ogilvy, devised an innovative solution, repurposing used notebooks into Braille writing books. The initiative invited public donations, receiving overwhelming support and enabling the provision of Braille notebooks to every government school in the country.",
