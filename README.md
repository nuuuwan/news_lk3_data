### Japan‚Äôs government in flux after election gives no party majority

*2024-10-28 08:34:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102968/japans-government-in-flux-after-election-gives-no-party-majority) ¬∑ `en`

The make-up of Japan‚Äôs future government was in flux on Monday after voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba‚Äôs scandal-tainted ruling coalition, leaving no party with a clear mandate to lead the world‚Äôs fourth-largest economy.

The uncertainty sent the yen currency to a three-month low as analysts prepared for days, or possibly weeks, of political wrangling to form a government and potentially a change of leader.

That comes as the country faces economic headwinds, a tense security situation fuelled by an assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea, and a week before U.S. voters head to the polls in another unpredictable election.

Ishiba‚Äôs Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito took 215 seats in the lower house of parliament, down from 279 seats, as voters punished the incumbents over a funding scandal and a cost-of-living crunch. Two cabinet ministers and Komeito‚Äôs leader, Keiichi Ishii, lost their seats.

### CASIO intensifies fight against counterfeits in Sri Lanka

*2024-10-28 02:56:53* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/CASIO-intensifies-fight-against-counterfeits-in-Sri-Lanka/34-768495) ¬∑ `en`

In a strong commitment to upholding brand integrity and protecting consumers, Casio Computer Co. Ltd., headquartered in Japan, after its successful enforcement against counterfeit watches, recently conducted another significant enforcement action against counterfeit calculators including both desktop and scientific ranges, in Sri Lanka.

This initiative is part of the Casio Group‚Äôs IP Enforcement Policy, aimed at combating the rising issue of counterfeit Casio products in the Sri Lankan market and safeguarding its valued consumers.

In collaboration with a local law firm and the Colombo Crime Division (CCD), Casio successfully carried out a raid on a leading wholesaler and importer of stationery goods based in Colombo. As a result of this coordinated operation, authorities seized substantial quantities of counterfeit calculators which were imitations of running Casio Calculator models.

This report has been prepared by them for the faith, development, and advocacy group Jubilee-USA Network and the USA branch of the German foundation, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, for submission to IMF to enable it to consider how its standard DSA should be revised. Aseni has found that it is a technical subject that needs the support of her grandfather, Sarath Mahatthaya, an ex-Finance Ministry Official, to understand it.

üü©

Leader of the Tamil National People's Front (TNA), Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, said that if we reject the monolithic constitution, the Tamil National People's Front is a team that can reject and implement it.

The Tamil National People's Front's Vanni District Candidates' Launch meeting was held on Sunday (27) at 4.30 pm at the Mannar Municipal Council Hall.

Our people have been affected in these 15 years.

Is the JVP participated in a struggle in them?

Our people are carrying out protests against private land grabbing. Do you attend any of these JVP or national people's power?

The political system is the main organization in Sri Lanka. The political system has been brought three times. Our people have rejected the three political system.

If the second race continues to reject the country's main law, it means that the race has a ethnic problem.

The international community clearly emphasizes every resolution passed at the UN Human Rights Council since 2012.

The attack, in which a truck ran into a bus stop close to a military base, took place around 10 am (0800 GMT), police said, noting the driver - who had Israeli citizenship - was ‚Äúneutralised‚Äù by gunfire from a nearby civilian.

‚ÄúAll investigative directions are being examined with an emphasis on the suspicion that this is a terror attack,‚Äù police said.

Ranil Wickremesinghe predicts Anura Kumara Dissanayake's government won't last three months. He claims lack of majority support and warns against short-term leadership.

üü©

I don't think this government will last for more than three months. Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that three weeks will not last for three weeks.

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has said that I have no majority.

He said this at an election campaign meeting in Negombo

The President has said that if I lose the election, the President has said that the majority does not vote, and I am not a majority of President Anura Kumaradisanayake, who is not a majority.

One day I asked me if I was ready to be Prime Minister.

He said that all would accept this, and then I accepted the challenge to meet the president.

When the parliament was surrounded by the presidency of the time, there was no one, and now all who demanded leadership fled.

People say that Anura Kumaratisanayake will hold office for three months. I do not do so. He must continue his post.. Do not do such things.

But I do not think that this government will last even three months.

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that the current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake lacks a parliamentary majority, similar to himself.

He made these remarks while attending a public meeting held by the New Democratic Front in Negombo this morning (27).

‚ÄúIf you look into his list, I don‚Äôt know whether his government can last three months or at least three weeks. We need experienced people for the country to run. We ask to put experienced people forward. He can last at least for three years only if he has a majority,‚Äù the former president added.

‚ÄúThey tell me to stay at home if I lose. I lost, I accept that. I contested the presidential election. The majority did not vote for me. So I lost, but the majority did not vote for him either,‚Äù Wickremesinghe said.

The former president further pointed out that Dissanayake also failed to secure 51% of the vote, stating that both he and the current president are presidents without a majority.
