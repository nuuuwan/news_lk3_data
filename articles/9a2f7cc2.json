    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, speaking in Parliament yesterday, took exception to a Supreme Court (SC) determination on the Gender Equality Bill. He alleged that the SC had engaged in what he called judicial cannibalism. He claimed that some previous SC judgements and an amendment to the Penal Code had been ignored. He went on to propose that a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) be appointed to look into the SC determination in question.",
    "President Wickremesinghe supported his arguments against the SC determination with some facts, which however are debatable. Stressing that he did not intend to have judges summoned before Parliament, he said the majority of the Parliamentary Women\u2019s Caucus should be appointed to the proposed PSC. Thankfully, his proposal ran into stiff resistance from the Opposition, and the opponents thereof, including Wimal Weerawansa, Dullas Alahapperuma and Ven. Athuraliya Rathana, convincingly argued against the President\u2019s proposal, highlighting its potential ill-effects. TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran proposed that the Bill be referred to the SC again for a fresh determination.",
    "All Bills that Parliament passes and the Speaker signs into law become faits accomplis even if they are detrimental to the interests of the public. That is the way the cookie crumbles. So, those who make bad laws are without any moral right to be critical of the SC determinations on Bills, which more often than not are badly drafted; some of them have been found to be inconsistent with the Constitution in toto.",
    "The SC alone has the power to interpret the Constitution and determine whether Bills are consistent with the Constitution. This is the most effective safeguard available to the Opposition and the public against the ruling party\u2019s authoritarianism. If the legislature is allowed to challenge SC determinations at the behest of the Executive or of its own volition, the people will be the loser in that the government in power will be able to bulldoze its way through by undermining the SC and passing laws according to its whims and fancies.",
    "The Executive now has all three tiers of government\u2014Parliament, the Provincial Councils (PCs) and the Local Government authorities (LGAs)\u2014under his thumb. The ruling party is subservient to the President, and the Opposition accuses the Speaker of his partiality to the government. The President is controlling the PCs and LGAs through the Governors he appoints as those institutions are without elected representatives. It is doubtful whether the President will be able to prevent the public from considering his proposal for a PSC to look into the SC determination at issue as a move to browbeat the judiciary into doing his bidding. The proposed legislative review of a vital judicial review will make a mockery of the doctrine of separation of powers. The fact that Parliament exercises people\u2019s judicial power through courts, etc., does not mean that it can usurp the power of the judiciary.",
    "It is heartening that even some of those who stooped so low as to be members of a PSC that subjected Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake to a kangaroo trial and caused her to be wrongfully impeached in 2013, as their political bosses had an axe to grind with her, have risen in defence of the SC. Those worthies were heard criticising President Wickremesinghe\u2019s attempt to appoint a PSC on the SC determination on Gender Equality Bill. If only they had plucked up the courage to resist the Rajapaksas\u2019 witch-hunt against CJ Bandaranayake. Sadly, those who took up the cudgels for the rights of the beleaguered CJ and condemned the Rajapaksa government at that time are now all out to undermine the SC.",
    "What the government is planning to do to the SC determination on the Gender Equality Bill could be considered an act of political cannibalism, which must be condemned unreservedly.",
    "The need is in fact for a constitutional amendment to vest the SC with the power of post-enactment judicial review of legislation so that all bad laws that governments make by abusing their parliamentary majorities can be challenged afterwards.",
