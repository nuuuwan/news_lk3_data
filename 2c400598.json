    "Sri Lankans have a general attitude that this nation cannot be refined and made a developed country. This thinking or attitude surfaced when former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa- before stepping down from his portfolio- invited the Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa to be the Prime Minister. It was then that UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe obliged and received the green light to assume duties as the Premier. Wickremesinghe- a few months later- was appointed President following a vote taking in parliament.",
    "Sri Lankans in general need an attitude change in every possible sphere. The attitude of youth at present is that they should leave this island as soon they complete their school education. We even hear of school teachers wanting to immigrate. Where would this \u2018culture of escaping from an island\u2019 lead us to? The majority of students who have completed their A Levels have done so courtesy state funded education. So don\u2019t they have an obligation towards staying back for at least a few years and doing their part for their motherland at a time when all is gloomy in Sri Lanka?",
    "Right now in Sri Lanka an economic revival is unthinkable. Many would use the word \u2018impossible\u2019. But then if we use that word and if an economic revival does take place then that word itself would have no meaning. Hence the word unthinkable fits better when facing a challenge; from a language usage point of view. However there is one man who can throw the dictionary out of the window and use the language the way he wishes. That individual is Sir Richard Branson-the founder of Virgin Group Ltd-and he thrives on the attitude of achieving what he terms as the impossible. He had this to say about attitude, \u201cAttitude is one thing you can control or change. It has a huge impact on your success or failure and can make the impossible happen\u201d. Sri Lankans have much to borrow from Branson in their attempt to move out of misery and poverty.",
    "A pastor recently got into much trouble when he opined that Buddhists didn\u2019t advocate love. Much of these ruthlessly ambitious Sri Lankans who are dreaming of a rich life overseas are harsh on their health. A good many of them consume narcotics and their rich lifestyles here are associated with alcohol and products made of tobacco. Such lifestyles suggest that these individuals don\u2019t love themselves and they are only after the money and elevated lifestyles that are promised when living overseas. We all love Charlie Chaplin movies because they have the potential to help rejuvenate us and ease our stress after an exhausting day at work. However simple this man and his acting career may seem Chaplin took the \u2018loving himself part very seriously\u2019. He is quoted saying, \u201cAs I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is not good for my health - food, people, things, situations, and everything that drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism. Today I know it is Love of Oneself\u201d.",
    "We had a priest by the name Gangodawila Soma who promoted the attitude that to be a Buddhist one must practice the Dhamma. Being a ceremonial Buddhist didn\u2019t work with him. During much of his sermons youth made up the larger share of the audience. There were many youth in such an audience who had lost their way in life due to negative influences from the society. We can safely say that this priest was successful in making an attitude change in people; especially the Buddhists.",
    "Coming back to Sri Lanka as a nation that has collapsed we must not stop trying in our attempts to make an economical revival. Many who back Sri Lanka know that this island has everything within to produce, consume and do business with the outside world. A word of caution though; stealing must not outweigh the attempts made at earning revenue in state institutes. Sri Lankans must have an aim. The great actor Bruce Lee once said \u201cNot failure, but aiming low is the crime\u201d."
