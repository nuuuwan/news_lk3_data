    "Some studies have been conducted on the ill effects of the current economic crisis on the physical well-being of Sri Lankans. They have revealed an increase in malnutrition, especially among children. However, no such comprehensive study has been carried out to ascertain mental health issues caused or aggravated by the economic crisis and the resultant socio-political problems.",
    "A study published in Nature has revealed that brain networks differ in people battling depression, and a special brain network (\u2018salience network\u2019) \u2018is expanded nearly twofold in the cortex of most individuals with depression\u2019. There is reason to believe that the average Sri Lankan\u2019s salience network must be much larger.",
    "There are signs of the spring of hope Sri Lankans looked forward to, before last month\u2019s presidential election, turning out to be a winter of despair. Some issues identified as forefront policy concerns have gone unaddressed, one being the high prices of essentials owing to market manipulations.",
    "The argument that it is not fair to expect an interim government to tackle serious issues swiftly is not without some merit, but hasn\u2019t the NPP administration undertaken to solve emblematic criminal cases, find out the mastermind/s behind the Easter Sunday carnage and trace the stolen public funds lying in offshore accounts? For an interim administration that is confident of accomplishing such gargantuan tasks, bringing the prices of essential food items down should be child\u2019s play. After all, it does not require a parliamentary majority or a mega Cabinet to lower the prices of commodities such as rice, eggs and coconuts.",
    "The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) is currently awake and doing its utmost to justify its existence. Some of its officials recently visited the warehouse complexes of some large-scale rice millers blamed for the current artificial shortage of rice. They were shown on TV interviewing the millers and their aides, who gave evasive answers and obfuscated the issue of shortage of rice and high prices. This hare-brained approach exemplifies a popular local saying, which roughly rendered into English means \u2018seeking the help of a female clairvoyant to catch a thief who happens to be her own son\u2019. The government is tracing its rivals\u2019 hidden vehicles, but it cannot detect the stocks of illicitly hoarded paddy! No wonder the people are troubled by frequent episodes of depression, and their anger is welling up.",
    "Moreover, the new dispensation\u2019s handling of accountability issues does not hold out much hope. Instead of inquiring into the findings and recommendations made by a presidential probe committee, in respect of two retired police officers catapulted to high posts in the public security sector, the government has chosen to vilify Udaya Gammanpila, who released the committee report at issue and the former judge, A. N. J de Alwis, who headed the committee. Regardless of the serious allegation that the two officers failed to prevent the Easter Sunday terror attacks, the government has said it will not remove them under any circumstances and the Easter Sunday tragedy will be probed afresh under their supervision.",
    "Gammanipila has also made public the report of the presidential committee, which probed the Channel-4 allegation that a section of the Sri Lankan military intelligence was involved in the Easter Sunday attacks. The committee headed by former Supreme Court judge S. I. Imam has dismissed the Channel-4 claims as baseless, according to Gammanpila, who has also alleged that \u2018a former high-ranking police officer currently in a top position in the public security sector\u2019 collaborated with Channel-4 to tarnish the image of the country. He has stopped short of naming the officer, but if his claim is true, and the \u2018officer\u2019 concerned is involved in the fresh probe into the Easter Sunday terror attacks, the integrity of the investigation will be compromised. Now, besides the ongoing probe to find out the Easter Sunday carnage mastermind/s, another investigation will have to be launched to identify the \u2018officer\u2019 who made false allegations against the military intelligence.",
    "The people\u2019s depression and resentment, which is palpable, have the potential to turbo boost the rising wave of anti-politics. The outcome of the recently-concluded Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election points to the people\u2019s growing disillusionment with the self-proclaimed messiahs of all political hues.",
