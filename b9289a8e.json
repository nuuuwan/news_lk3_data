    "\u201c12 children were reported with symptoms and four of them were identified as infected\u201d",
    "The measles infections in the country show an increase among those who had not received their immunization vaccines, Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children. Dr. Deepal Perera said.",
    "He said it was recorded that there had been an increase in the number of measles-infected patients in the past few days.",
    "\"Twelve children were reported with symptoms relating to the disease, and four of them were clearly identified as infected after measles antibody tests,\" Dr. Perera said.",
    "Measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus and typically include high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. The measles rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms, he said.",
    "\"It is unfortunate to say that some people do not take proper immunization medicine for measles infection, or maybe they do not know the disease is very serious. The people who reject the immunization vaccines are infected with the disease,\" Dr. Perera said.",
    "The government used to give the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine to children within nine months and after they turn three years old. However, there is a possibility of being infected with the measles disease for those who did not take the immunization vaccines.",
    "Diarrhea, vomiting, and malnutrition can be the most common complications, and the disease might affect the brain after a longer period."
