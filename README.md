### Polar ice is melting and changing Earth’s rotation

*2024-03-29 10:48:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Polar-ice-is-melting-and-changing-Earths-rotation/108-279823) · `en`

CNN - One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by humans, according to a new study, as melting polar ice alters the Earth’s rotation and changes time itself.

The hours and minutes that dictate our days are determined by Earth’s rotation. But that rotation is not constant; it can change ever so slightly, depending on what’s happening on Earth’s surface and in its molten core.

These nearly imperceptible changes occasionally mean the world’s clocks need to be adjusted by a “leap second,” which may sound tiny but can have a big impact on computing systems.

Plenty of seconds have been added over the years. But after a long trend of slowing, the Earth’s rotation is now speeding up because of changes in its core. For the first time ever, a second will need to be taken off.

### Rise in hand-foot-and-mouth disease among children

*2024-03-29 05:57:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Rise-in-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-among-children/108-279814) · `en`

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said today that there is an increase in the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) among schoolchildren these days.

He said this disease spreads every year, especially between March and April.

If children have symptoms like small, oval, red or white blisters on the palms and soles of the feet, as well as in the mouth, if there is a red skin rash with a brown scale on it, or if the rash appears on the outer arms, then parents should keep in mind not to send their children to schools, daycare centres or public places.

HFMD is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie virus. The main way HFMD spreads is through contact with the fluid from inside the blisters or with the droplets spread from sneezing and coughing.

The virus can also be present in bowel movements (excrement) for up to several weeks after the person has recovered.

### No mea culpa

*2024-03-29 05:45:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/No-mea-culpa/4-760104) · `en`

It’s almost comedic in its simple-minded analysis of complicated issues

In the end there was no conspiracy. The book proves once more that GR is a person so naïve and so completely out his depth in either running a country, or writing a book. Alas, it’s the truth though he may have had success as defence secretary once upon a time. There may have been others who may or may not have conspired against him, but certainly it wasn’t a foreign power and the book he trots out to prove otherwise is the greatest testimony underlining the fact that he had to leave because of his own folly, and not due to the machinations of some sinister foreign force. Folly, to be sure, seems to be his calling card

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s book titled “Conspiracy to oust me from the presidency” does in no way live up to its title. If anyone thinks this is a page turner that gives a blow by blow about how a conspiracy unfolded to destroy his presidency, don’t waste your time or your money on the work.

It’s almost comedic in its simple-minded analysis of complicated issues

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s book titled “Conspiracy to oust me from the presidency” does in no way live up to its title. If anyone thinks this is a page turner that gives a blow by blow about how a conspiracy unfolded to destroy his presidency, don’t waste your time or your money on the work.

The former president merely insults those who don’t believe there was a conspiracy to get rid of him. This writer read the Sinhala version of the book. The author writes that only the extremely naïve, ‘bolanda’, would believe that there wasn’t a foreign conspiracy to oust him.

That statement is typical of the way Gotabaya Rajapaksa (GR) ruled the country. He seemed to be so aloof that he was constantly seen to be out of touch when in power. Added to that was his rather supercilious attitude which seemed to make him think he knew more than the rabble he ruled over.

### “Ye are the light of the world”: A mystical approach to Easter

*2024-03-29 05:41:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Ye-are-the-light-of-the-world-A-mystical-approach-to-Easter/14-760102) · `en`

Our purpose in this world is to choose the resurrection where we join with Christ and seek his power of thought to restore our minds to its original glory

Birth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it “perceptually” witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who “have sinned and come short of his glory.” But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind

### Easter and the Roman Centurion: A Symphony of Redemption

*2024-03-29 04:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/easter-and-the-roman-centurion-a-symphony-of-redemption/) · `en`

Easter, the cornerstone of the Christian faith, is universally described as a celebration of penance, hope, renewal, and the triumph of life over death. Central to this profound narrative in history is the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, a pivotal moment that unfolded on the cross; an instrument known, and well-recognised, as an emblem of condemnation, retribution, and shame. However, on that fateful day of the crucifixion, amidst the anguish and agony of the execution of the Son of God, one figure emerges from the pages of history; the Roman Centurion who stood at the foot of the cross. His coincidental encounter with divinity and spirituality transformed a moment of despair into a guiding light of redemption.

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Minor staffers at the National Hospital Colombo (NHC) have chosen not to wear their uniforms, despite receiving an annual allowance for them, according to an official from the hospital.

These staffers,both male and female, are provided with specific white uniforms for their duties at the hospital to make them easily identifiable. However, instead of wearing these uniforms they allegedly opt for casual attire and behave more like clerical staff or office assistants.

Although they receive an annual uniform allowance of Rs.9,500, they claim this allowance and continue to wear casual clothes.

### Getting back to that peaceful Easter Sunday - EDITORIAL

Easter Sunday is an important day in the Sri Lankan calendar as this day has become the talking point as never before due to the  2019 ‘Easter Sunday bombings’.

Christians would never compare man’s sufferings with the agony Jesus went through on the cross. According to Rev. Frs. Sanjeewa Mendis and Sriyananda Fernando-who spoke on the meaning and message of Easter on ITN’s Pini Viyana programme on March 28-the message conveyed by the Son of God is to spread ‘love’ even during the toughest of times.

Sri Lankan Christians also conveyed a similar and strong message when their kith and kin were brutally blown to pieces inside three churches chose to stay calm and collected as a community. They had forgiven the assailants, but demanded justice for the affected families. This calmness was preserved largely due to the instructions issued by the head of the Catholic Church, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

### Gaza genocide, ISIS and the tailpiece of Moscow terror

An injured man is helped outside Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City: The United Nations says the Gaza Strip’s health system is collapsing. AFP

The Moscow terror attack, conveniently claimed by the so-called Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS, and the diplomatic circus at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday in passing a Gaza ceasefire resolution may appear disconnected at first glance. But there is enough interconnection between the two tragedies.

First, let’s discuss the ISIS connection. The Friday evening terror attack at the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow has revealed the mercenary character of ISIS. Questions have always lingered about the Islamic credentials of ISIS since its birth from the ashes of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2011.

The Central Bank this week noted that the government’s move to suspend the rights of banks to exercise parate execution will not have severe implications on the financial sector since it is a short term measure.

“The government’s decision is to suspend only for six months. I don’t think that will have a significant impact,” said Dr. Weerasinghe responding to a question raised at the Monetary Policy briefing held this week.

Despite repeated warnings by banks, the Cabinet approved the draft Recovery of Loans By Banks (Special Provisions, Amended) Act to suspend parate rights of banks until 15th of December this year.

Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of his now-bankrupt firm.

The ruling cements the downfall of the former billionaire, who emerged as a high profile champion of crypto before his firm's dramatic collapse in 2022.

The 32-year-old was later found to have stolen billions from customers of the exchange ahead of its implosion.

But he was convicted by a New York jury in November on charges including multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

During the sentencing hearing on Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan provided a harsh assessment, saying it was clear Bankman-Fried was motivated by a drive to be politically influential.

Despite "protestations of sorrow" about customer losses, Judge Kaplan said, Bankman-Friend had expressed "never a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes".
