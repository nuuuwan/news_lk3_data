There were two reasons why President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India and his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gained much importance in the media.

The second, his JVP. Was identified as a Chinese pro organization. The reflection of the Chinese Tutu in Colombo on the victory of the National People's Power in the general election also strengthened this view.

During his visit to New Delhi, President Dissanayake revealed the most relaxed diplomacy in the wake of the intensification of Sri Lanka -based Chinese -Indian power competition.

The attitude of Dissanayake was seen as the one who accepted the importance of India in the South Asian region. That is, the history of the JVP in the past has been confirmed during this visit that the President is changing the severe course of India.

Dementia indeed is a very sad disease where the personality, habits and the routine of a loved one could drastically change, and family members would find it extremely stressful to recognise and deal with this тАЬnew personтАЭ who has evolved from the one they once knew. Dementia persons are by and large helpless and need care for even the most mundane tasks.

To achieve lasting growth and better manage its debt, the country must implement critical structural reforms

With a new Government in power, Sri Lanka finds itself grappling with immense economic challenges. The burden of enormous debts continues to weigh heavily on a fragile economy, necessitating robust growth to overcome these hardships. However, achieving such growth is complicated by a governmental predisposition toward centralised economic control, rooted in socialist-communal ideologies.

These challenges are not unique to Sri Lanka; they echo the historical pitfalls of centralised economic systems. This essay explores three illustrative examples from history: The failed socialism of the Plymouth Colony, the rapid recovery during the Forgotten Depression of 1920-1921, and the transformative innovation of the Gilded Age.
