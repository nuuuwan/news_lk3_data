  "original_body_lines": [
    "Chairman of the National Sports Council and Cricket World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga intimated that despite Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) reporting a record surplus, it was of no benefit towards the development of the sport in the country.",
    "He made this statement following SLC's revelation that it had recorded a surplus of Rs 6.3 billion in the last financial year, which it added was the highest ever in its history.",
    "\"This surplus is not from playing and winning matches. This money is from television rights, from the International Cricket Council and sponsorships, so you cannot attribute this success to the SLC administration,\" Ranatunga told the media today.",
    "\"We must check and see how much of this has actually been spent on the development of Sri Lanka cricket.\"",
    "He further aluded to this point by expressing disappointment that Sri Lanka had to qualify for the Cricket World Cup.",
    "\"It's disappointing about the team, and how much it has fallen. When we were playing, we didn't even pay attention to teams like Afghanistan. But now they are outperforming us and even beating them has become a challenge. Going forward it appears even qualifying for the World Cup is a challenge for us,\" Ranatunga added. (Susil Premalal)"
