  "original_body_lines": [
    "Under growing pressure from his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will step down and end his nine-year stretch as leader.",
    "Trudeau said he would stay on in office until his Liberal Party can choose a new leader, and that parliament would be prorogued - or suspended - until 24 March.",
    "\u201cThis country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I\u2019m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,\u201d he said during a press conference Monday.",
    "Trudeau\u2019s personal unpopularity with Canadians had become an increasing drag on his party\u2019s fortunes in advance of federal elections later this year."
