    "Accordingly, tickets will be issued only at the beginning of the journey for SLTB buses plying on expressways.",
    "The decision to issue tickets at the beginning of the journey has been taken after the detection of a racket where fake tickets had been given to 34 passengers on a SLTB bus on the Southern Expressway for the Matara-Makumbura journey for which a ticket costs Rs. 1200.",
    "The Criminal Investigations Department is conducting investigations into the racket.",
