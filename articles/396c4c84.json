    "We refer to the published studies by Caritas Sri Lanka titled Research Study on the Culture and Identity of the Plantation Community in Sri Lanka\u00a0and Right to Education of the Children of the Plantation Community.",
    "At the outset, we express our appreciation to the Catholic Bishops Conference and Caritas Sri Lanka for their interest and recommendations aimed at creating an enabling environment for preserving and promoting the culture and identity of plantation communities. We recognize that the recommendations in these publications encompass a wide range of areas, including inclusive development policies, education and awareness programs, cultural preservation funding, legal protection, economic empowerment, and the promotion of culture-based tourism. While we respect the commitment of Caritas to these communities, we believe the data used in their reports should be revisited to reflect today\u2019s on-the-ground realities. Our goal is to offer updated information so that all stakeholders can align on how best to support plantation communities most effectively today.",
    "In that regard, we note that many of the statistics cited in the report are based on research that dates as far back as 2003/2004, failing to account for the significant progress and developments made in plantation communities since then. As the Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon, which represents the interests of Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) in whose estates reside an estimated 42% of Malaiyaha Tamil\u00a0community, we are compelled to clarify these points and provide a more accurate representation of the current state of these communities. We also acknowledge that further investment and effort is required from all stakeholders, including the Government in order to drive meaningful progress on the several issues. We caution however, that placing the responsibility solely with plantation companies who are only capable of operating within the constraints of employer-employee relationships fails to hold all other stakeholders accountable for their role and capacity to drive broader progress.",
    "Accordingly, we believe It is important at the outset to address the continuous references of this community as Indian-origin Tamils (IOT). While historically, many have referred to this group as Indian-origin Tamils (IOT), today, they are recognized as Sri Lankan citizens with full political and civic rights. As proud Sri Lankans, it\u2019s vital to celebrate the rich diversity within our nation. The Tamil community, with roots in India, is an essential part of our shared heritage. While the term IOT does hold historical and cultural significance, using it exclusively can overshadow the strides this community has made over many generations to achieve these rights, and establish their own identity as Sri Lankans. The term IOT therefore perpetuates an outdated and exclusionary narrative that risks undermining their rightful inclusion within Sri Lankan society. Now commonly referred to as the Malaiyaha community, they are an integral part of the nation\u2019s socio-economic fabric. With a population of approximately 960,000\u201420% of whom form a vital, actively contributing workforce \u2013 which is increasingly transcending the plantation industry.",
    "The assertion that education within plantation communities remains chronically underfunded is misleading. With the nationalization of schools, they were incorporated into the mainstream education system. Over time, the education system has undergone significant advancements, supported by consistent government initiatives. This progress underscores the evolution of schooling facilities and the broader education framework, which now aligns with the national mainstream education standards.Since 1977, when the government assumed responsibility for these schools, there has been a steady expansion, and today 863 schools operate within plantation areas.",
    "In parallel, the Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) with the support of Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), have collaborated\u2014often with donor assistance\u2014to establish 1,200 Early Childhood Development Centers (CDCs). These CDCs, staffed by trained professionals, provide not only foundational education for young children but also critical nutritional and developmental support. Through scholarship programs, RPCs have within the means available to them further facilitated opportunities for higher education, with over 100 students from plantation communities entering Government universities each year. With greater support, such positive initiatives could be drastically amplified. While we acknowledge that resource constraints continue to pose challenges, we also wish to give equal and fair emphasis to the tangible gains already achieved. By building on these successes, we aim to ensure that schools serving plantation communities are strengthened, rather than diminished, as Sri Lanka collectively addresses its nationwide education funding needs.",
    "Similarly, health outcomes within RPC-managed plantations have seen vast improvements due to targeted interventions led by RPCs with the support of PHDT. The infant mortality rate, which the publications erroneously state as 60.6%, is now 9.07% under RPC-led estates, aligning closely with national averages. Undernutrition, another cited issue, has also received significant attention, with several targeted programmes having been launched aimed at ensuring comprehensive maternal and child health support to communities within the estates. As a result of these practices, current prevalence of moderate and severe undernutrition stands at 15.57% and 3.9%, respectively, a significant improvement over previous decades.",
    "The studies also portray the housing situation within plantation estates inaccurately. The line rooms, which were historically used for worker accommodation, have been systematically upgraded or replaced under RPC-led initiatives. Over 140,000 housing units have been reroofed, ensuring improved living conditions. In addition, more than 60,000 families now reside in individual/improved housing units with modern facilities. Furthermore, 230,000 individual latrines have been constructed, significantly enhancing sanitation and hygiene within these communities. These ongoing development programs have transformed living conditions, ensuring privacy, sanitation, and dignity for plantation workers and their families. We also note that cultural and identity-related challenges faced by plantation communities are not ignored. RPCs have actively worked to preserve cultural practices while facilitating integration into broader Sri Lankan society. Programs focusing on community engagement, cultural events, and skill development have helped foster a sense of belonging and empowerment. The work carried out by the RPCs with the support of PHDT, trade unions, and government authorities, has been instrumental in driving these advancements. Through this tripartite collaboration, RPCs have achieved measurable progress in improving the quality of life across all facets, including education, healthcare, housing, and economic opportunities.",
    "The Planters\u2019 Association wishes to clarify that the report does not capture the true nature of plantation communities within RPC-managed estates, unfairly painting a negative picture of the entire sector without considering the substantial improvements led by RPCs. This demarcation is necessary to ensure a fair and accurate understanding of the progress made and the ongoing commitment to the welfare of plantation communities.",
