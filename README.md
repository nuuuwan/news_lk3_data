Dr. Jayatissa’s comments came in response to the statement issued by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s office on December 09. The statement claimed that Wickremesinghe had not granted any liquor licenses outside the prescribed procedure and emphasized that the government had generated over Rs. 3 billion in revenue by granting liquor licenses.

Addressing the matter today, Minister Jayatissa stated: “Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he hoped to strengthen the temperance movement by issuing 250 to 300 liquor licenses per year and using the taxes generated from them.

*2024-12-10 08:25:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104122/netanyahu-to-take-the-stand-in-his-corruption-trial-for-the-first-time) · `en`

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks.

Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying.

Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing.

SriLankan ගුවන් සමාගම ගැන ජනපති ගත් තීරණය පිළිබඳව විද්වතුන් කියන්නේ කුමක් ද?

ශ්‍රීලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය යනු ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ පාඩු ලබන රාජ්‍ය ව්‍යාපාර අතර ඉහළින් ම ඇති ආයතනයකි.

ශ්‍රීලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය පෞද්ගලීකරණය කිරීමට පසුගිය ආණ්ඩුව ගන්නා ලද තීන්දුව වෙනස් කරමින් වත්මන් රජය එය තවදුරටත් ජාතික ගුවන් සේවය ලෙස පවත්වාගෙන යාමට තීරණය කර තිබේ.

එ් අනුව, ශ්‍රීලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය පෞද්ගලීකරණය නොකරන බවට ප්‍රකාශයක් කළ නව ජනාධිපති අනුර කුමාර දිසානායක ශ්‍රීලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය සඳහා නව අධ්‍යක්ෂ මණ්ඩලයක් ද පත් කළේ ය.

ඇතැම් ආර්ථික විද්‍යාඥයින් පෙන්වා දෙන්නේ, ශ්‍රීලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය පවත්වාගෙන යාම සඳහා "ගුවන් යානයක් ඇසට නොදැකපු රට වැසියන් පවා බදු ගෙවමින් සිටින," බව ය.

දිගින් දිගට ම පාඩු ලබමින්, අර්බුද රැසක් මැද ශ්‍රීලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය තවදුරටත් රජය සන්තකයේ තබා ගැනීම රටට, රටේ ආර්ථිකයට කෙලෙස බලපානු ඇති ද? බීබීසි සිංහල සේවය ඒ පිළිබඳව කළ සොයා බැලීමකි, මේ.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ජාතික ගුවන් සේවය ලෙසින් ක්‍රියාත්මක වන ශ්‍රී ලංකන් ගුවන් සේවය 1979 වසරේදී ආරම්භ කරන ලදී.

එම ගුවන් සේවය 2021 වසරේදී ලබා තිබූ අලාභය රුපියල් බිලියන 166.37කි.

### Sri Lanka forex reserves marginally down in November, CB buys US$374mn

*2024-12-10 06:05:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-forex-reserves-marginally-down-in-november-cb-buys-us374mn-193166/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves fell marginally to 6,462 million dollars by the end of November 2024, from 6,472 dollars a month earlier, central bank data shows.

Gross official reserves include balances of the Treasury. Reserves may go down due to debt repayment by the central bank or Treasury.

The central bank borrowed reserves including through swaps to target the policy rate with printed money in the past and has been settling them over the past year after buying dollars using deflationary policy with market rates.

In November the central bank bought 374 million US dollars from banks, data showed.

Concerns have been raised over recent cash injected through domestic operations (open market operations) at a time when money is already created over international operations, to closely target a policy rate with excess liquidity.

In order to maintain external stability, build reserves or repay debt compatible interest rates are needed to balance domestic credit.
