    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s external current account surplus hit 2,039 million dollars by August 2025, official data show, as the central bank missed its inflation target making it possible to easily make outward payments through the financial account.",
    "The August current account surplus was 368 million US dollars, taking the total above two trillion up from 1,618 million dollars last year.",
    "Sri Lanka has to repay multilaterals, any payments on restructured debt including amortizing bonds, with minimal inflows through the financial account as bilateral loans have not yet started to flow.",
    "Sri Lanka is only getting some budget support loans from the ADB and World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.",
    "Sri Lanka however gets around 2 to 2.5 billion US dollars of current inflows a month, and has a high private savings rate, making it easy to make outward payments and keep a strong exchange rate as long as the parliament can restrain the central bank from printing money and bring down its inflation target.",
    "\u201cIn late 2024, the central bank under IMF tutelage, scrapped the Lombard rate through subsidiary legislation (gazette) for a single policy rate making a second default almost certain,\u201d EN\u2019s economic columnist Bellwether says.",
    "\u201cHowever inflationary policy is now in abeyance and banks are borrowing for clearance purposes only through the ceiling rate.",
    "\u201cAs a result, the statistical \u2018monetary policy modernization\u2019 through which the first default was carried out is temporarily in abeyance and making external payments is not difficult.\u201d",
    "The external current account is a mirror image of the financial account, subject to errors and omissions (it is difficult to actually track current flows, tourism for example is an estimate).",
    "However, if money is printed for an inflation target, the single policy rate, or whatever political purposes of macro-economists, forex shortages emerge.",
    "Widespread forex shortages without war started to emerge in the 1930s after the Federal Reserve invented open market operations and started to impose a political interest rate (the infant policy rate) which then infected Europe, Bellwether says.",
    "This ushered in the age-of-inflation without war, delivering a death blow to classical economics, fomenting social unrest and war.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has since September 2022 (except for the inflationary policy in the last quarter of 2024 and some buy-sell swaps) has maintained monetary stability, though the threat of the single policy rate gazette still exists.",
    "On September 30, banks borrowed 4.57 billion rupees at the ceiling rate of 8.25 percent, compared to 8.26 percent in late 2024 (one pip above the then floor rate), through inflationary open market operations before recent rate cuts.",
    "The inflationary open market operations led to a public outcry.",
    "RELATED : Sri Lanka prints Rs100bn through open market operations",
    "A so-called \u2018Lombard\u2019 rate above the interbank rate, stops banks from lending without deposits, maintaining monetary stability. If there is deflationary policy, the central bank is also able to purchase dollars, which however creates new rupees.",
    "In 2025, the central bank has transferred hundreds of millions of such dollars to the Treasury (but unsterilized) to repay debt.",
    "Any unsterilized transfer of dollars to the Treasury, kills rupee liquidity (deflationary policy), slows credit, helps create a current account surplus (or narrow a deficit) and allows the central bank to buy more dollars to finance outflows or build reserves.",
    "However, analysts have urged the Treasury to buys its own dollars (a Treasury purchase does not impact reserve money) to so that it is not dependent on the Central Bank deflationary policy to repay debt, given its relentless pursuit of a 5 to 7 percent inflation target which will eventually undermine monetary stability as it had done in the recent past.",
    "Analysts have also warned that the \u2018buffer\u2019 to repay debt is not the past collections of reserves as claimed by the statistical \u2018ARA metrics\u2019 of the IMF, but the interest rates as an ongoing tool in the present and future.",
    "At the moment however deflationary policy is limited to interest coupons on the central bank bond portfolio.",
    "Meanwhile bank interest rates have also edged up a little, which will boost savings, allow the central bank to collect reserves or repay debt.",

    "A stable exchange (implies inflation and currency destruction close to that suffered by US citizens) will allow capital to be preserved and helping an eventual fall in the interest rate.",
    "Classical economists have warned that interest rates are not determined by central bank reserve money (OMO) but the capital of a country.",
    "\u201cIt can, I think, be made manifest, that the rate of interest is not regulated by the abundance or scarcity of money, but by the abundance or scarcity of that part of capital, not consisting of money,\u201d Adam Smith pointed out.",
    "Before the central bank was set up, Sri Lanka was raising 20 year money around 3 percent.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee has depreciated in 2025, despite the record current account surplus, showing that the Mercantilist narrative spread by macro-economists that external current account deficits lead to depreciation (and not the flawed operating framework of a central bank) is false.",

    "However it is a useful narrative since it allows macro-economists to escape accountability and perpetuate inflationism. (Colombo/Oct01/2025)"
