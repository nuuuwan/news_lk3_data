    "At the\u00a0recent Invest Sri Lanka\u00a0Investor Forum held at Conrad Singapore Marina Bay, Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Director\u00a0Ray Abeywardena\u00a0set the tone with a powerful message:\u00a0\u201cSri Lanka is not merely a story of recovery, it is a story of transformation.\u201d",
    "His remarks captured the essence of the forum, which showcased Sri Lanka\u2019s stable macroeconomic environment, sweeping reforms, and a resurgent capital market \u2013 positioning Sri Lanka as a compelling frontier investment destination. The event, organised by the\u00a0CSE\u00a0and the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC)\u00a0in partnership with the\u00a0Sri Lankan High Commission in Singapore, attracted over\u00a0150 investors, sparking immediate market optimism with\u00a0Rs. 1 billion in foreign-led trades\u00a0the next morning.",
    "Abeywardena emphasised that Sri Lanka\u2019s revival goes beyond post-crisis stabilisation.\u00a0\u201cThis is a moment of alignment between policy, performance, and potential,\u201d\u00a0he said, highlighting opportunities in\u00a0infrastructure, digital finance, and equity markets. His optimism was echoed by\u00a0Central Bank Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, who noted that\u00a0debt restructuring is nearing completion, with a potential sovereign rating upgrade from\u00a0CCC+ to \u2018B\u2019, making early investment crucial.",
    "Prof. Anil J. Fernando, Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, outlined Sri Lanka\u2019s\u00a0investment-led growth strategy, targeting sectors like\u00a0energy, tourism, and logistics. He assured investors of\u00a0clean governance and policy consistency, key to rebuilding confidence.",
    "Meanwhile,\u00a0SEC Chairman Prof. D.B.P.H. Dissabandara\u00a0made a bold case for\u00a0capital market financing, citing\u00a0John Keells Holdings\u2019 $1.4 billion raise\u00a0for\u00a0Cinnamon Life\u00a0as proof of the market\u2019s potential.\u00a0\u201cIf corporates can do it, why not the government?\u201d\u00a0he asked, advocating for\u00a0market-driven solutions\u00a0to fuel growth.",
    "Two panel discussions moderated by\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Avril Hong\u00a0and\u00a0Farringdon Asset Management\u2019s Ana Isabel Gonzalez \u2013 delved into\u00a0Sri Lanka\u2019s economic resilience\u00a0and\u00a0equity market prospects. Key takeaways included:",
    "The forum closed with\u00a0one-on-one meetings\u00a0between Sri Lankan corporates and global investors, setting the stage for future partnerships. The forum was supported by the\u00a0Singapore Sri Lanka Business Association, CFA Society Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankan Airlines.",
