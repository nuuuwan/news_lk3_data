    "\u201cWhen President Ranil Wickremesinghe assigned me this ministry he entrusted me with the challenge of converting the Postal Department into a profit-generating institution. The postal service\u2019s income in 2022 was Rs. 7,000 million while the expenditure was Rs. 14,000 million.",
    "The state minister said he has had discussions with the respective officials and taken steps to reduce the gap between the income and the expenditure of the Postal Department from Rs. 7,000 million to Rs. 4,000 million. \u201cIt is planned to resolve the gap between income and expenditure by the year 2024.\u201d",

    "\u201cWe have identified the Post Office Ordinance as a major obstacle to the modernization process of the Postal Department and other relevant activities. Therefore steps are being taken to amend it urgently and its work has already been completed by 80 percent,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cWe hope to create new revenue generation channels through digitization of postal service,\u201d the state minister continued noting that at present, Rs. 4,000 million, Rs. 668 million and Rs. 200 million have been earned annually through the sale of stamps, postage of stamps and Cash on Delivery (COD) service respectively.",
    "In the future, it is planned to increase the revenue by popularizing the COD method, he explained.",
    "\u201cDuring the modernization of postal service, 1,000 three-wheelers will be deployed all over the country replacing the traditional bicycles that were used in field for a long time. We also hope to provide an official uniform. By doing so, our ultimate goal is to create a strong postal service in the country,\u201d the state minister continued."
