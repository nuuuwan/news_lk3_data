    "Asks bankers to introduce attractive deposit products to promote savings",
    "As saving money has become more crucial than ever with an increasing ageing population in Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) yesterday urged the banking sector to introduce innovative solutions to promote savings despite the prevailing low-interest rate environment.",
    "He pointed out that savings that lead to increased capital stock would also help embed elements of liquidity and safety to compensate for interest rate volatilities during business cycles.",
    "\u201cThe culture of saving at an earlier stage of life should be nurtured, which will not only promote long-term savings but also will ensure greater financial security for a better life after retirement,\u201d he said.",
    "He made these remarks while unveiling the Central Bank\u2019s policy agenda for 2025 and beyond.",
    "Referring to interest rates, private credit and deposits, Dr. Weerasinghe said:",
    "\u201cThe recovery in credit to the private sector has been supported by the noteworthy reduction in market lending interest rates. However, the Central Bank observes some excessive, outlier rates of interest on facilities extended to Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) as well as marginal borrowers and certain credit products, which are not consistent with the prevailing relaxed monetary policy stance. Moreover, risks associated with lending are on the decline while the credit appetite of banks and financial institutions is improving given the overall stability and recovery witnessed in the economy. Therefore, with a view to making the low interest rate credit accessible, the Central Bank will closely work with banks and other financial institutions to reduce the excessive interest rates still prevalent in the market.\u201d",
    "\u2018\u2019While low interest rates have helped revive credit and contributed to improving the overall business sentiment, they could also disproportionately hurt savers. However, unlike during the high inflation episode, real returns on deposits have been positive, with inflation successfully being reined into low levels. Interest rates have their cycles, and the Central Bank will manoeuvre interest rates to ensure that inflation is kept low and stable with a view to promoting overall public welfare.\u201d",
