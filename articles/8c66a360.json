  "original_body_lines": [
    "If enacted without significant reform, this Bill will not just destabilise Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector\u2014it will effectively sign the death warrant of\u00a0Sri Lanka\u2019s economic sovereignty",
    "The National People\u2019s Power Government rose to power promising transparency, institutional reform, and a green energy revolution. The President vowed to build an accountable electricity regime; the Energy Minister committed to regulator independence and market modernisation. Yet, the Electricity Amendment Bill 2025 delivers the opposite. It entrenches ministerial control, resurrects monopolies, enables corruption, and locks the nation into decades of coal dependence. Enacting this Bill will devastate donor confidence, repel investors, deepen energy poverty, and reverse Sri Lanka\u2019s hard-earned progress",
    "Political betrayal masquerading as reform \u2014 the end of sovereignty",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s fragile recovery from the devastating 2022 sovereign debt crisis now faces an unprecedented and existential threat. The newly proposed Electricity Amendment Bill 2025, under the guise of modernising and reforming the power sector, is in reality a carefully disguised Trojan Horse \u2014 designed to dismantle independent oversight, legalise corruption, suffocate private investment, entrench fossil fuel dependence, and burden future generations with an unsustainable debt bomb.",
    "This legislation is not merely a policy miscalculation; it is a politically driven assault on fiscal discipline, institutional integrity, and environmental responsibility. If enacted without significant reform, this Bill will not just destabilise Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector\u2014it will effectively sign the death warrant of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic sovereignty.",
    "1. Assassination of independent oversight \u2014 crushing accountability to cement ministerial control",
    "At the heart of this Bill is the abolition of the National Electricity Advisory Council (NEAC) \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s only multidisciplinary, independent body tasked with overseeing electricity sector reforms and safeguarding public interest (Section 3). The Bill replaces NEAC with a committee directly appointed and controlled by the Minister of Power (Section 8), stripping away constitutional protections that ensured NEAC\u2019s autonomy and multidisciplinary expertise.",
    "Independent oversight bodies worldwide have proven essential to transparency, market confidence, and reducing political interference. According to the World Bank (2025), countries abolishing similar councils experienced a devastating 37% reduction in renewable energy project approvals between 2015 and 2022, severely crippling climate action efforts. India\u2019s insulated regulatory model, which empowers independent commissions, has yielded tariff reductions of 22% and improved service quality (World Bank, 2025).",
    "The Bill\u2019s repeal of NEAC betrays these proven global practices and will inevitably concentrate unchecked power in ministerial hands \u2014 turning oversight into a rubber-stamp mechanism.",
    "The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) coalition, which ascended to power in 2024, campaigned on a robust platform of transparency, institutional reform, and de-politicisation of energy governance. Their manifesto explicitly pledged to:",
    "Guarantee the autonomy of regulators to protect consumer rights and promote sustainable development.",
    "Foster accountability and transparency mechanisms to root out corruption (NPP Manifesto, 2024).",
    "Contrary to these commitments, the Electricity Amendment Bill abolishes NEAC and consolidates control within the Minister\u2019s office, signalling a sharp regression into politicisation and eroding public trust.",
    "Implement transparent, multi-party appointment processes to shield NEAC from political sabotage.",
    "2. Emergency powers \u2014 legalising corruption under the guise of crisis",
    "Section 11(4) of the Bill grants sweeping authority to award no-bid contracts lasting up to one year during vaguely defined \u201cnational calamities.\u201d This provision institutionalises unchecked favouritism and inflated costs.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Auditor-General exposed these risks in 2023, reporting a 47% inflation in emergency diesel contracts awarded without competitive bidding, sparking corruption scandals and breaching the IMF\u2019s fiscal integrity conditions linked to the $ 3 billion bailout (IMF Country Report, 2025).",
    "The Bill\u2019s ambiguous definition of \u201ccalamity\u201d effectively normalises a perpetual state of emergency, allowing the Government to bypass procurement safeguards indefinitely.",
    "The President and Energy Minister have publicly pledged fiscal discipline and anti-corruption reforms (Presidential Address, 2024; Energy Ministry Press Release, 2025), yet the Bill\u2019s emergency provisions dangerously undermine these assurances, risking donor confidence and bailout continuity.",
    "Limit emergency no-bid contracts to 90 days, renewable only with parliamentary approval.",
    "Mandate judicial review and full public disclosure of all emergency procurement.",
    "The Bill enshrines 100% State ownership of transmission and the National System Operator (NSO) (Sections 12 & 14), bans private equity stakes or cross-ownership (Section 20(6)), and forcibly nationalises the $ 1.3 billion Norochcholai coal plant (Schedule I).",
    "This aggressive state monopoly has already led to investor retreat: the Adani Group withdrew a $ 500 million wind power investment citing \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d (Reuters, 2024). The World Bank estimates $ 4.2 billion in grid modernisation is required by 2030, funding impossible without private sector participation (World Bank, 2025).",
    "The NPP manifesto emphatically committed to a mixed ownership model, promoting private investment, public-private partnerships, and renewable energy expansion as pillars of economic recovery (NPP Manifesto, 2024). It stated:",
    "\u201cWe will open the energy sector to private investors while ensuring state oversight to safeguard public interest.\u201d",
    "\u201cOur regulatory framework will guarantee transparent, investor-friendly markets that catalyse clean energy growth.\u201d",
    "\u201cDecentralisation of power and diversification of ownership will accelerate innovation and energy access.\u201d",
    "The Bill\u2019s hardline centralisation and state monopolisation directly contradict these pledges, undermining investor confidence and casting doubt on the Government\u2019s reform commitment.",
    "Remove ownership restrictions to encourage public-private partnerships and attract foreign direct investment.",
    "4. Weaponising the national system operator \u2014 conflict of interest on steroids",
    "The Bill mandates the NSO to draft market rules (Section 30(3A)), enforce grid codes (Section 10(15)), and approve emergency no-bid contracts (Section 11(4)), all while remaining a State entity.",
    "Verit\u00e9 Research (2024) highlights that systems combining operational and regulatory roles suffer 220% more blackouts, undermining grid reliability. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and other international regulators emphasise the importance of separating these powers.",
    "Though the Energy Minister declared during parliamentary sessions a commitment to maintain NSO neutrality and technical independence (Parliament Hansard, Nov 2024), the Bill eviscerates this independence, transforming NSO into a political instrument.",
    "5. The $ 2.9 billion debt bomb \u2014 fiscal time bomb for future generations",
    "The Bill saddles new State entities with the entire $ 2.9 billion Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) debt (Section 14(3)(b)). This financial burden will trigger a projected 28-40% tariff hike by 2027, pushing over 500,000 households into energy poverty (PUCSL, 2025; Tamil Guardian, 2025).",
    "The IMF warns of bailout suspension and sovereign default risks if debt restructuring fails (WSWS, 2025).",
    "NPP\u2019s platform commits to \u201cprotecting vulnerable populations from energy poverty\u201d and \u201cintroducing lifeline tariffs to ensure affordable access for all\u201d (NPP Manifesto, 2024). Passing this Bill without debt relief contravenes these promises, forcing energy costs on the poor and deepening inequality.",
    "Cancel or restructure at least $ 1.8 billion of legacy debt under IMF terms.",
    "6. Tariff regulation \u2014 from independent protector to political puppet",
    "The Bill grants ministers overriding power on tariff-setting, dismantling the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka\u2019s (PUCSL) autonomous pricing mechanism.",
    "This shift injects uncertainty for investors, removes consumer protections, and opens the door for politically motivated tariff manipulation.",
    "The NPP manifesto promised \u201clegally guaranteed tariff autonomy\u201d and transparent, formula-based pricing to protect consumers and investors (NPP Manifesto, 2024). The Bill\u2019s reversal of this principle betrays these commitments.",
    "7. Climate commitments betrayed \u2014 locking in coal, killing the future",
    "The forced nationalisation of Norochcholai coal plant locks Sri Lanka into emitting 4.2 million tonnes of CO\u2082 annually, making the nation\u2019s Paris Agreement commitments impossible to fulfil.",
    "The Bill\u2019s barriers on private renewable projects further exacerbate this issue.",
    "President and NPP declared a goal of 70% renewable energy by 2030, embedding climate action into their agenda (NPP Manifesto, 2024). This Bill betrays those climate goals, threatening the country\u2019s environmental future.",
    "Rural and marginalised communities bear the brunt of tariff hikes and unreliable supply, with rising disconnection rates worsening energy poverty.",
    "Women and marginalised groups disproportionately suffer increased domestic burdens and health impacts (UNDP, 2024).",
    "On 30 June 2025, Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court ruled key provisions unconstitutional, especially unlimited emergency powers and forced debt assignments (Supreme Court Judgment SC FR/187/2025).",
    "The Bill sidelines Parliament\u2019s Estimates Committee, removing critical scrutiny over massive procurement decisions.",
    "Conclusion \u2014 the crossroads between national renewal and economic ruin",
    "The National People\u2019s Power Government rose to power promising transparency, institutional reform, and a green energy revolution. The President vowed to build an accountable electricity regime; the Energy Minister committed to regulator independence and market modernisation.",
    "Yet, the Electricity Amendment Bill 2025 delivers the opposite. It entrenches ministerial control, resurrects monopolies, enables corruption, and locks the nation into decades of coal dependence. Enacting this Bill will devastate donor confidence, repel investors, deepen energy poverty, and reverse Sri Lanka\u2019s hard-earned progress.",
    "Parliament now faces a clear choice: amend the Bill to restore independence, open markets, protect consumers, and honour political promises \u2014 or sign Sri Lanka\u2019s economic death warrant.",
    "2. Strictly limit emergency procurement to 90 days with judicial and parliamentary approval.",
    "3. Open transmission and NSO to 49% private ownership, enabling public-private partnerships.",
    "4. Cancel or restructure legacy CEB debt under IMF terms, protecting new companies.",
    "5. Safeguard PUCSL\u2019s autonomy in tariff-setting, market design, and procurement oversight.",
