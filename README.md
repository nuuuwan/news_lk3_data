South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift a surprise martial law declaration he had imposed just hours before, backing down in a standoff with parliament which roundly rejected his attempt to ban political activity and censor the media.

In South Korea’s biggest political crisis in decades, Yoon shocked the nation and declared martial law on Tuesday night to thwart “anti-state forces” among his domestic political opponents. But outraged lawmakers unanimously rejected the decree. Yonhap news agency said the cabinet had agreed early on Wednesday to scrap the martial law.

Protesters outside the National Assembly parliament shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.

The main opposition Democratic Party called for Yoon, who has been in office since 2022, to resign or face impeachment.

### Sri Lanka central bank net foreign reserves just above zero

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka net foreign assets moved to positive territory in October 2024, with about 63 million dollars over its reserve related liabilities, official data shows, after two years of deflationary policy with interest rates to match.

Sri Lanka’s central bank’s reserves became negative by 4.6 billion after rate cuts were enforced by inflationary direct and open market operations.

The central bank also borrowed reserves through swaps, and also busted a special drawing rights allocation (a type ‘reserve’ created by the International Monetary Fund) in the course of mistargeting rates through a policy rate which ended in a sovereign default.

A ‘transmission mechanism’ then spreads the mis-targeted rates along the yield curve.

When reserves were hitting negative territory during the last currency crisis, the central bank already had loans from the International Monetary Fund taken during currency crises triggered by earlier rate cuts.

The MP raised the question prior to yesterday’s Parliamentary debate on the President’s policy statement, emphasising that the issue is of national significance and has sparked widespread public concern.

### New Government faces tough questions over IMF U-turn

Can the Government implement the IMF’s reforms in a way that minimises their impact on vulnerable populations?

When the NPP party swept into power just a couple of months ago, it did so on a wave of hope and promises of change. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s campaign was built on sharp critiques of past economic mismanagement and vows to steer the country towards a more equitable future. Yet, in a move that has surprised many supporters, the new Government has chosen to accept the IMF bailout terms negotiated by its predecessor—a decision that underscores the scale of the challenges it faces.

### Inland Revenue Dept. should understand plight of contractors

*2024-12-04 05:38:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Inland-Revenue-Dept-should-understand-plight-of-contractors/4-770047) · `en`

VAT payments in the construction industry work in strange and sometimes unfair ways

Some Inland Revenue Department (IRD) officers have misunderstood that contractors’ bills have been settled as per their satisfaction. This is a myth, because although a portion of contractors’ dues have been paid by previous Governments, these bills have been stagnant for two or three years. By that time, bank interests have eaten up all of their profits and have pushed them towards great losses. Further, many bills remain uncertified and these have not been settled for contractors. In such a context, some IRD officers have quoted statements regarding the settlement of these old dues to pursue contractors for tax payments within unreasonable time periods.

### Cabinet approves new bill to recall and reopen nominations for LG polls

Arugam Bay is no Gaza, thankfully, but Chabad-Lubavitch members are bringing Gaza into Arugam Bay – just as Maccabi Tel Aviv fans brought Gaza into Amsterdam

They are back, creeping of the woodwork. The gathering outside Colombo’s main railway station was mercifully small, just the mandatory monk and a handful of civilians. Having offered flowers to a statue of the Buddha, they proceeded to violate his teachings by trying to ignite an ethno-religious fire. Their target was the welcome decision by the NPP/JVP Government to release some of the military-occupied land in the north to their original owners.

The monk accused President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of being a diaspora agent trying to rejuvenate the Tigers and start the next Eelam War. Madubhashana Prabath, the secretary of Sinhala Ravaya, called the new president King Elara of Tambuttegama and promised to struggle till the ‘last drop of blood’ to ‘save the nation’.

### The Serial stupidity of  SJB leader Sajith Premadasa whose decision to run against Ranil Wickremesinghe in Presidential election assured the mutual destruction of both and played into the hands of the NPP and Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

*2024-12-04 00:27:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=85165) · `en`

The political Opposition in this country has yet again reduced to insignificance. This is a precarious existence for politics and the country at large, though this has been a recurrent phenomenon throughout the 2010s. Only the travails have incrementally worsened:

In 2010, during the second term of Mahinda Rajapaksa’s presidency, the UPFA won 144 seats, a tad short of the two-thirds majority, which was compensated with the pole vaulters from the Opposition to pass the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which decimated the independent commissions and removed the term limits of the presidency.

The same misfortune was revisited in 2020 when the Sri Lanka People’s Freedom Alliance, led by Pohottuwa, won 145 seats against Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s 54 seats. Bolstered by the overwhelming parliamentary majority, Gotabaya Rajapaksa instituted some of the stupidest policy decisions, effectively bringing the economy crashing down to the ground.

“Don’t let it happen. It depends on you.” – George  Orwell (1984)

They are back, creeping out  of the woodwork. The gathering outside Colombo’s main railway station was mercifully small, just the mandatory monk and a handful of civilians. Having offered flowers to a statue of the Buddha, they proceeded to violate his teachings by trying to ignite an ethno-religious fire.

Their target was the welcome decision by the NPP/JVP Government to release some of the military-occupied land in the north to their original owners.

The monk accused President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of being a diaspora agent trying to rejuvenate the Tigers and start the next Eelam War. Madubhashana Prabath, the secretary of Sinhala Ravaya, called the new president King Elara of Tambuttegama and promised to struggle till the ‘last drop of blood’ to ‘save the nation’.

During the flood disaster in Ampara, police failed to function properly. Opposition member Rishad Bathiudeen said an independent inquiry should be conducted in this regard.

Eight people died when a browsing machine collapsed during a flood disaster in Ampara. The police were present at the site of the incident.

At the same time, the disaster management was not in operation on the occasion.

Only a few people in the neighboring village act immediately and protected two people. Otherwise, two more people would die.

When asked the police to take action to protect the victims, they asked the police to lodge a complaint.

When the people then went to the police to present a complaint, they were waiting for an hour to write the complaint. They then arrested the Principal of the Matarasa School.

But the incident has taken place and the police who are on duty there should be an independent inquiry into the absence of any action and I urge you to take action to prevent such measures in the future.
