    "Ambassador Jayantha Dhanapala\u2019s career in national and international service spanned over half a century as he laboured to ensure a safer world for all, even after retirement. As we mark the first year of his passing, we remember with gratitude his invaluable contribution to diplomacy in general and his unwavering commitment to the promotion and safeguarding of Sri Lanka\u2019s national interest in particular. He excelled as a diplomat, contributing tangibly to both international norm-setting as well as to nurturing compliant state practice which encompassed numerous fields, ranging from disarmament to good governance and from human rights to humanitarian endeavours.",
    "This dual approach to diplomacy was a striking feature in all of his work- \u2013 whether it related to his ambassadorial duties on behalf of Sri Lanka or at a broader level with issues of international concern at the United Nations where he served as Under Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs. The constructive role he played when he chaired the UN conference of 1995 for the extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which led to its indefinite extension remains to-date the only consensus reached on this vexed issue.",
    "He did not rest on his laurels after his service to his country and the world outside our shores. For on retirement, the late Jayantha Dhanapala provided leadership and guidance to many prestigious international entities such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs (Pugwash) and the Asia-Pacific Leadership Network (APLN). At home, he served as a Trustee and Member of the Board of Advisers of Sri Lanka Unites, mentoring a national youth movement dedicated to the transformation of Sri Lanka to a land, free of religious and ethnic strife. He was also closely involved from its inception in the establishment of the Friday Forum, an informal and self-financed group of citizens dedicated to democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law.",
    "I first got to know Jayantha in the late 1980s. Our friendship grew over the years, I happen to think, because we shared much in common. We both schooled and spent our formative years in Kandy\u2013 he at Trinity in the 1950s and I at Kingswood in the 1960s. Later he and I both entered the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya at different times, given that he was a decade older. There we both read for the Special Degree in English. His extra-curricular activities at Peradeniya, like mine, included sports\u2013 rugger in his case and cricket in mine\u2013 and theatre. We both took part in plays, held office and were participants in the diverse activities of the University Drama Society (DramSoc).",
    "Jayantha and I also shared a fondness for the spoken and written word and, not infrequently, combined our resources in this area. We jointly edited A Garland for Ashley: Glimpses of a life celebrating the life of Ashley Halpe and His 50 Years of University Teaching (2008). He was instrumental in making me the editor of SIRIMAVO \u2013 Honouring the world\u2019s first woman prime minister (2010) for which publication he wrote an excellent essay on The Foreign Policy of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. He contributed a chapter titled, A City Upon a Hill for Excursions and Explorations Cultural Encounters Between Sri Lanka and the United States that I put together in 2002. He reviewed Peradeniya: Memories of a University (1997) that I jointly edited with Silva. Jayantha served as keynote speaker while I introduced the publication at the launch of the late Tissa Abeysekera\u2019s collection of essays on culture and the arts titled, Roots, Reflections and Reminiscences (2007). A couple of years ago, Jayantha and I teamed up one more time to write an essay titled, A Study in \u2018Creative Compassion\u2019 for The Fourth Lion \u2013 Essays for Gopalkrishna GANDHI (2021) edited by Venu Madhav Govindu and Srinath Raghavan.",
    "In the 1990s, when our friendship had matured to an extent that I could ask the Dhanapalas for a personal favour, I would on certain of my regular visits to the United States, stay with Maureen and Jayantha whenever they were free of pressing official commitments. I stayed with them in Washington while he was our ambassador (1995-1997) and later in New York when he was serving as Under-Secretary General for Disarmament Affairs (1998-2003). In New York, they would book tickets in advance for plays on Broadway to make my visits even more enjoyable. Their friendship and warm hospitality knew no bounds. I also recall a visit to the UN with my wife Lilani and our daughter Lara when Jayantha hosted us to lunch at a restaurant in the premises of the UN headquarters.",
    "No account of Jayantha would be complete without a reference to the solid and sensitive supporting role played by Maureen in his life and career. She was a superb fellow-traveller who had known Jayantha from a very young age and were fellow undergraduates at Peradeniya as well. If marriages, as we are told, are indeed made in heaven, then theirs undoubtedly would be one of them. They were an extremely compatible and congenial pair to the very end. After their return to Sri Lanka, we had the opportunity to meet Jayantha and Maureen in more relaxed settings over food and drink, either at our home or theirs or in the homes of common friends.",
    "Lilani and I went up to Kandy to spend a long- promised weekend with our senior colleagues and intimate friends Gananath and Ranjini Obeyesekere at April\u2019s end in 2023. Knowing of our strong desire to meet Jayantha and Maureen during our visit and, as all of us were close mutual friends, our kind and thoughtful hosts invited the Dhanapalas to lunch at their lovely home. It was when we sat to lunch that it struck me that all six of us around the table, belonging to different eras, had been through the Department of English and read for the Special Degree in English at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya which later became the University of Peradeniya. Little did we know that one of us would be gone in less than a month and not be around for another meeting over lunch! Impermanence is all.",
    "My one-time teacher (he taught Lilani too, in later years), senior colleague in Peradeniya\u2019s Department of English and close friend, Professor Thiru Kandiah, and his wife Indranee, have shared a friendship of much longer standing with the Dhanapalas. Thiru was a year senior to Jayantha at Peradeniya while Indranee and Maureen who had been schoolmates and close friends at Girl\u2019s High School, Kandy, resumed their friendship at a later date at Peradeniya. Their fathers had been members of the Trinity College staff, very close friends and neighbours. Trinity\u2019s Lemuel House was founded when Jayantha was a student at the school with Indranee\u2019s father, the illustrious teacher and Head Master R.L Kannangara in charge. Jayantha was one of the most outstanding students of Lemuel and Indranee\u2019s father soon came to respect and, also like him very much.",
    "The Kandiahs now live in Perth, Australia and realizing that they may be unaware of Jayantha\u2019s passing, I wrote to inform them of the sad event. Soon there was a flurry of emails exchanged amongst the three of us and I found myself in total agreement with their assessment of the Dhanapalas.",
    "Jayantha was held in especially high esteem and regard by absolutely everybody. This was not least for the obvious brilliance of his mind. But closely allied with that, there was in addition this very distinctive way in which he tended to come across to people in his interactions with them- as of his very nature a signally intellectual sort of person: always impeccably reasoned, and very definitely and firmly so, if in an unostentatious and quietly unassertive, also exemplarily courteous, manner that lent him great dignity; with the unmistakable integrity of the positions he adopted on matters and what he stood for adding considerable power to the strikingly impressive impact he had on people.",
    "Indranee\u2019s pertinent observation is that Maureen is as good natured as she is beautiful and gentle. She goes on to say that Maureen\u2019s father was a very caring and helpful person and her mother, a gentle and gracious lady. These are sentiments that deserve to be widely shared and hence my doing so.",
    "All in all, Jayantha Dhanapala was a formidable personality, though, never aggressive or unapproachable. He was friendly and unfailingly courteous at all times. I wish to end this tribute with another most appropriate quote from Thiru Kandiah:",
    "Much will, I am sure, be said and written of Jayantha at this time of his leaving us. But the man we were fortunate to know and whom we had such affection and respect for will remain in our hearts and minds as long as we are around.",
