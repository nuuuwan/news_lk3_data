    "Sri Lanka will be able to earn well over 10 million Euros because of its selection by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as the host country for the next on-site inspection (OSI) Integrated Field Exercise (IFE), IFE25, to be held in 2025, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "This is an exercise to rehearse for steps to be taken in the event of a nuclear attack. IFE25 will be the third such exercise conducted by the organization. The first was in Kazakhstan in 2008, and the second in Jordan in 2014.",
    "A top source said there will be a lot of international participants for this event in Sri Lanka, and it will generate foreign exchange revenue amounting to well over 10 million Euros.",
    "According to a news story published on the official site of the organization, OSI Integrated Field Exercises are amongst the largest and most technically complex multinational exercises in the fields of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) arms controls in the world.",
    "\u201cThey are designed to test the application of virtually all OSI techniques, mechanisms, systems, and procedures against a technically realistic, scientifically credible scenario. Moreover, all four OSI phases, namely launch, pre-inspection, inspection, and post-inspection, are included in the IFE,\u201d it said.",
    "\u201cIFE25 is expected to bring together more than 180 technical experts and other participants from around the world, in various roles, who will have an opportunity to apply their training and expertise in what we hope will be a near-realistic OSI exercise scenario. In doing so, the IFE will serve as a prime opportunity to demonstrate and assess overall OSI capabilities, identify opportunities for improvement and further build relationships with stakeholders and within the CTBT community,\u201d",
