    "In celebration of Earth Day, Sri Lanka Resorts of Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts conducted a series of impactful initiatives conducted across its eight properties in Sri Lanka, under this year\u2019s global theme of \u2018Plastic Vs Planet\u2019.",
    "The beach properties of Sri Lanka Resorts, including Cinnamon Bentota Beach, Cinnamon Bey Beruwala, Hikka Tranz by Cinnamon, and Trinco Blu by Cinnamon, organized beach clean-up drives in their designated regions with the support of the surrounding community. These proactive endeavours not only facilitated the removal of polythene, litter, and debris from the shorelines but also acted as a rallying cry for individuals to embrace their role in safeguarding coastal ecosystems. Collectively, all resorts gathered over 200 kilograms of plastic waste during the clean-up activities. In addition to beach clean-up efforts, Cinnamon Bentota Beach contributed to environmental conservation by planting trees along the Bentara Riverbed. Hikka Tranz by Cinnamon also conducted a thorough cleaning of the ocean strainer at the Mawakada Canal in Hikkaduwa, to prevent further environmental degradation in the surrounding area.",
    "Meanwhile, Cinnamon Wild Yala organized a beach clean-up at Palatupana beach, reaffirming the brand\u2019s dedication to preserving the natural habitats of Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse wildlife. Cinnamon Citadel Kandy also took action to protect the Mahaweli river by leading a clean-up project along its banks and surrounding areas, by engaging with local communities and mobilizing resources.",
    "Recognizing the importance of waste management and sustainable living, Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon collaborated with the Palugaswewa Divisional Secretariat to host a workshop for women in Habarana under the name \u2018Empowerment through Sustainability\u2019. The workshop focused on empowering the participants to generate income through upcycling used plastic and waste materials into creative home decor items. The Resorts plan to continue this initiative, making a lasting impact on both the community and the environment.",
    "Commenting on these initiatives, Johan Aschan, Area Vice President of Sri Lanka Resorts & General Manager of Cinnamon Bentota Beach stated, \u201cAt Cinnamon, we firmly believe in the power of collective action to drive positive change. Polythene, a common material in everyday life, poses grave environmental challenges due to its non-biodegradable nature. Our Earth Day initiatives reflect our commitment to sustainability and responsible tourism practices, in line with our ESG policies. By fostering partnerships with local communities, we aim to cultivate a culture of environmental stewardship, combatting plastic pollution, and promoting sustainable practices. Together, we strive to mitigate the harmful impacts of polythene on our planet\u2019s delicate ecosystems, ensuring a healthier environment for current and future generations to enjoy.\u201d",
    "As a leading hospitality brand in Sri Lanka, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts remains dedicated to driving sustainable tourism practices and fostering a deeper connection between the community and the natural beauty of the island. Through ongoing efforts like these, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts continues to set the standard for environmentally conscious hospitality in Sri Lanka.",
