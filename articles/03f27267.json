    "The Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon (PA) yesterday via a statement congratulated the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on his election as the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka and called for renewed collaboration to secure sustainable growth and livelihood empowerment within the plantation sector.",
    "The Association called on President Dissanayake to initiate a transformative era for the plantation industry by prioritising stakeholder engagement in policymaking, which is crucial for advancing sustainable development and fostering crop diversification. By actively involving all stakeholders, the Government can establish a comprehensive policy framework that bolsters the long-term viability and growth of the plantation sector.",
    "\u201cThe PA remains confident that, under the new leadership, collaborative efforts can help resolve the prevailing issues and unlock the full potential of Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation sector,\u201d said PA Secretary General Lalith Obeyesekere. \u201cWe are committed to supporting the Government in implementing forward thinking policies for long term sustainability and prosperity.\u201d \u201cKey areas such as diversification and modernisation will require strong Government support to thrive,\u201d he further stated.",
    "\u201cThe plantation industry is currently grappling with significant challenges that require focused attention and proactive measures. One critical concern is the urgent need for diversification. As market dynamics shift, the ability to cultivate other crops becomes increasingly important. However, recent policy hurdles have impeded progress in these areas, limiting the sector\u2019s potential for growth. By fostering a supportive environment for diversification, the Government can enhance the resilience of the plantation industry and strengthen its contribution to the national economy.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe PA extends its best wishes to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and is committed to assist his administration in promoting initiatives that enhance the plantation industry and foster the country\u2019s economic growth.\u201d"
