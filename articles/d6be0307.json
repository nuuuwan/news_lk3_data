    "Sri Lanka Police Service is the premier law enforcement agency on the Island and one of its oldest government establishments counting over one and half centuries of existence. During this long history, 36 Inspectors-General of Police \u2013 11 of them from the Colonial Administration, and the rest thereafter \u2013 were in charge.",
    "Their periods of office were characterized by riots, coups, insurrections, terrorism, political violence, trade union action, mass protests, and worst of all, the politicization of the institution. The vicissitudes the police had to face were many.",
    "The thrust of this essay is to show how once a force that worked according to the rule of law during the colonial administration turned partial and eventually became an apparatus serving political interests rather than those of the common man. Party politics crept into the picture with the progressive introduction of constitutional reforms. To substantiate his thesis, the writer will draw selectively from material available on various websites and other archival material including Police Commission Reports.",
    "The Maritime Provinces of Ceylon were under the Portuguese after their invasion in the 15th Century. The Dutch, who arrived in Sri Lanka in 1602, were able to bring the Maritime Provinces and the Jaffna Peninsula under their rule by 1658. Although they controlled certain areas of the maritime provinces, they did not carry out any serious changes to the existing system of civil administration of the country. The concept of policing in Sri Lanka however, started with the Dutch who saddled the military with the responsibility of policing the City of Colombo.",
    "In 1659, the Colombo Municipal Council (under the Dutch) adopted a resolution to appoint paid guards to protect the city by night. Accordingly, a few soldiers were appointed to patrol the city at night.",
    "They initially opened three police stations, one at the northern entrance to the Fort, a second at the causeway connecting the Fort and Pettah, and a third at Kayman\u2019s Gate in the Pettah. In addition to these, \u2018Maduwa\u2019 or the office of Dissawa of Colombo who was a Dutch official at Hulftsdorp, also served as a police station for these suburbs. Thus, it was the Dutch who established the earliest police stations and thus became the forerunners of the police in the country.",
    "The Dutch surrendered to the British on February 16, 1796. After the occupation of Colombo by the British, law and order were, for some time, maintained by the military. In 1797 the office of fiscal, which had been abolished was re-created. Governor Fredrick North, having found that the fiscal was over-burdened with the additional duty of supervising the police, obtained the concurrence of the Chief Justice and entrusted the Magistrates and Police Judges with the task of supervising the police.",
    "In 1805 police functions came to be clearly defined. Apart from matters connected with the safety, comfort, and convenience of the people, these also came to be connected with preventing and detecting crime and maintaining law and order. The rank of police constable (PC) was created and it came to be associated with all types of police work. By Act No. 14 of 1806, Colombo was divided into 15 divisions, and PCs were appointed to supervise the divisions.",
    "Mr. Thomas Oswin, Secretary to the Chief Justice, was appointed the first Superintendent of Police of Colombo. Mr. Lokubanda Dunuwila, who was the Dissawa of Uva, was appointed as the Superintendent of Police for Kandy. He goes into history as the very first Lankan to be a Superintendent of Police.",
    "In 1847 the ranks of Assistant Superintendent of Police and Sub Inspector of Police were created. Inspector De La Harpe was promoted as the first Assistant Superintendent of Police.",
    "Robert Campbell, KCMG, was the first\u00a0Inspector General of Police\u00a0of\u00a0British Ceylon. The Governor, who was looking for a dynamic person to reorganize the police on the island, turned to India to obtain the services of a capable officer. The Governor of Bombay recommended Mr. G. W. R. Campbell, who was in charge of the \u201cRatnagiri Rangers\u201d of the Bombay Police, to shoulder this onerous responsibility.",
    "After serving as chief of police in the Indian province of\u00a0Ratnagiri, Campbell was appointed by\u00a0Governor\u00a0Frederick North\u00a0on September 3, 1866, as Chief Superintendent of Police in Ceylon, in charge of the\u00a0police force and assumed duties on September 3, 1866. This date is thus reckoned as the beginning of\u00a0the Sri Lanka Police Service.",
    "Campbell is credited with shaping the force into an efficient organization and giving it a distinct identity. He brought the whole island under his purview and the police became a national rather than a local force. In 1867, by an amendment to the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, the designation of the Head of the Police Force was changed from Chief Superintendent to Inspector-General of Police. In 1887 he was awarded the\u00a0CMG. On his retirement, he received a knighthood for his service.",
    "Apart from Campbell, 35 others were in charge of the Police Force in Sri Lanka. They performed to different degrees of standards contributing to the development or the decline of the police service in Sri Lanka. Cyril Longdon, the sixth Inspector-General was instrumental in establishing a Police Training School for recruits and a\u00a0Criminal Investigation Department.",
    "Ivor Edward David was the seventh\u00a0British colonial\u00a0Inspector-General of Police\u00a0in\u00a0Ceylon\u00a0(1910-1913). During his tenure, David was noted for establishing the\u00a0POLICE SPORTS GROUNDS\u00a0in Bambalapitiya in 1912. Dowbiggin succeeded him as Inspector-General of Police.",
    "Sir Herbert Layard Dowbiggin, CMG, was the eighth British colonial\u00a0Inspector General of Police\u00a0of\u00a0Ceylon\u00a0from 1913\u00a0to 1937, the longest tenure of office of an Inspector General of Police. He was called the \u2018Father of the Colonial Police\u2019. Dowbiggin joined the\u00a0Ceylon Police Force\u00a0in 1901 and became Inspector General in 1913.",
    "During his tenure, the strength of the force was enhanced considerably with the posts of two deputy inspectors general were created. He oversaw an expansion of the force: the number of police stations increased so that by 1916 there were 138 all over the island. He also modernized the force, introducing new techniques of investigation such as\u00a0fingerprinting\u00a0and photography; improving the telecommunications network for the police as well as increasing the mobility of the force. The analysis of crime reports became more systematic. He purchased the land on Havelock Road, Colombo, on which the Field Force Headquarters and the \u2018Police Park\u2019 playing fields are located. He was knighted in 1931.",
    "Beginning with Sir\u00a0Richard Aluwihare, KCMG, CBE, JP, CCS, 25 others served as IGPs thereafter. Sir Richard was a\u00a0Sri Lankan\u00a0civil servant and the first Ceylonese IGP who later served as Ceylon\u2019s\u00a0High Commissioner to India. The Police Department, which was under the Home Ministry, was brought under the purview of the Defense Ministry during his tenure.",
    "Sir Richard faced the unenviable responsibility of transforming the police from its colonial outlook to a national police with the gaining of independence in 1948. To this end, he introduced a large number of innovative measures embracing the welfare of the men, investigation, prevention, and detection of crime, the women police, crime prevention societies, rural volunteers, police kennels, public relations, new methods of training and improvement of conditions of service.",
    "He transformed what was a Police Force into a Police Service. Its role was narrowly defined and restricted to the maintenance of law and order and the prevention and detection of crime. In 1948 he established the Police Training School in\u00a0Kalutara.",
    "He retired from the civil service as IGP and was succeeded by his son-in-law\u00a0Osmund de Silva. Santiago Wilson Osmund de Silva, OBE was the 13th and the first\u00a0Ceylonese\u00a0career police officer to become\u00a0Inspector-General of Police\u00a0(1955\u20131959). In 1955 he succeeded his father-in-law,\u00a0Sir Richard Aluwihare\u00a0to be appointed IGP. He became the first IGP appointed from within the police force and the first Buddhist. He introduced community policing to the country, a vision not shared by his successors.",
    "It was during his tenure that Prime Minster Bandaranaike is reported to have exhorted IGP Osmund de Silva that the police should have that \u2019extra bit of loyalty\u2019 to the government. The response to this by the IGP was an exhortation to his officers that what they should uphold is the Rule of Law. He said this knowing that he would be falling out of favour with the premier and that it would affect his tenure. This assertion by the IGP came when there was no Bill of Rights in the Parliament or no Republican Constitution with Fundamental Rights to fall back on.",
    "Thereafter, when the Prime Minister,\u00a0S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike\u00a0requested that the police intervene against trade union action occurring at\u00a0Colombo Port.\u00a0De Silva declined to do the PM\u2019s bidding on the basis that he believed the request was unlawful. On April 24, 1959, de Silva was compulsorily retired from the police force with \u00a0M. Walter F. Abeykoon, a senior public servant, appointed in his place.",
    "This was the first betrayal by the head of government ignoring an entrenched police norm held sacrosanct through almost a century by the colonial administrators. It eventually led to a near mutiny by the police top brass and later even to more serious consequences of a coup the government managed to avoid by a stroke of luck.",
    "Morawakkorakoralege Walter Fonseka Abeykoon served IGP between 1959 and 1963. He was appointed to this position May 1, 1959 by his personal friend and bridge partner,\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike.\u00a0The appointment was highly controversial as the PM appointed Abeykoon from outside the service by-passing several senior career police officers, on the basis that Abeykoon was a\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0Buddhist.",
    "Senior police officers protested and DIG\u00a0C. C. Dissanayake\u00a0tendered his resignation, which was later withdrawn. The senior police officers, who were predominantly Christian, fearing a calamity, met to consider their options. They considered whether the entire police executive resigned on masse, although they decided against this as they thought it had the potential to cause the entire police service to collapse. Alternatively, they surveyed the Executive Corps for the senior- most officer among them who was a Buddhist and could find only young SP Stanley Senanayake.",
    "They resolved to make representations to the Prime Minister that they were prepared to work under Stanley who was junior to all of them rather than having to work under an outsider with no experience who knew nothing of Police or the Police Ordinance. Bandaranaike however ignored their representations and appointed Abeykoon. In 1962, when a\u00a0coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was attempted\u00a0by senior officers of the military and police, Abeykoon was caught off guard.\u00a0Early warning from one of the conspirators, however, allowed the government to respond in time. Ironically, Stanley Senanayake was the whistle blower and the information was conveyed to IGP Abeykoon by P. de S. Kularatne, Senanayake\u2019s father-in-law.",
    "Thereafter, Benjamin Lakdasa \u2018Lucky\u2019 Victor de Silva Kodituwakku\u00a0was appointed as the Inspector General of Police on September 1, 1998 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga following the retirement of Wickremasinghe Rajaguru\u00a0on August 31, 1998 . This was a controversial appointment, his being selected over five other DIGs with greater seniority. Allegedly this appointment was influenced by the ruling party.",
    "Kodituwakku, while in charge of the Kelaniya Police Division as SP, received transfer orders to go into charge of the Jaffna Police Division. He tried his best to get the transfer canceled but the department stood firm on its policy decision that every police officer needed to serve Jaffna for one year during the LTTE threat.",
    "He opted to leave the service in 1984 resigning his post when he failed to circumvent the transfer. Following his resignation, he worked as a security consultant in a private company and was out of the Police Service for over one-and-a-half decades.",
    "However, following the election of the\u00a0People\u2019s Alliance\u00a0government at the\u00a01994 parliamentary elections\u00a0the new government enabled public servants who had faced alleged \u201cpolitical victimization\u201d to appeal for reinstatement and back wages. Making use of this opportunity Kodituwakku re-joined the service and on October 1, 1997, was promoted to DIGl\u00a0and Senior DIG rank on August 2, 1998 (a double promotion, from the rank of SSP ignoring the fact that he refused to go on transfer to Jaffna and resigned defying a mandatory policy decision taken by the Department that applied to every servicing police officer.",
    "Kodituwakku was the Inspector-General at the time the Waymaba Provincial Council Elections took place. He was blamed for the violence and the election malpractices that took place during the elections. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution was the result of a political initiative launched by Members of Parliament in the Opposition led by the United National Party in 2001 as a response to the Wayamba Election Episode.",
    "This was the second betrayal by a Head of State-\u00a0President\u00a0Chandrika Kumaratunga- when she decided to appoint Lucky Kodituwakku the 26th IGP ignoring so many other seniors over him just because of the special position he enjoyed as the Personal Security officer (PSO) of a VVIP that gave him an advantage over his seniors to canvass for the post. Wayamba- election- bungling and the 17th Amendment to the Constitution was the result.",
    "These precedents led to yet other betrayals last of which was when Deshabndu Tennakoon came to be appointed by the current President Ranil Wickremasinghe as the 36th IGP even though the Supreme Court held that Deshabandu was guilty of human rights violations.",
    "Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Wanshalankara Deshabandu Tennakoon\u00a0(born 3 July 1971), known as\u00a0Deshabandu Tennakoon\u00a0is the current\u00a0Inspector General of the Sri Lankan Police.",
    "On 14 December 2023, a three-judge bench of the\u00a0Supreme Court of Sri Lanka\u00a0ruled that Tennakoon and two of his subordinates were guilty of torturing Weheragedara Ranjith Sumangala of Kindelpitiya for alleged theft and thereby violating his fundamental rights when the men were in uniform attached to the Nugegoda Police Division in 2010.",
    "The Fundamental Rights Application (SC/FR 107/2011) was filled by Sumangala in the Supreme Court in March 2011, against the then Superintendent of Police, M.W.D. Tennakoone, Inspector of Police Bhathiya Jayasinghe, then OIC (Emergency Unit) Mirihana, Police Officer Bandara, former Sergeant Major Ajith Wanasundera of Padukka, and several others in the police department. The three bench panel consisting of Justices\u00a0S. Thurairaja, Kumudini Wickremasinghe, and Priyantha Fernando, directed the National Police Commission and other relevant authorities to take disciplinary action against Tennakoon and two of his subordinates.",
    "On 29 November 2023,\u00a0President\u00a0Ranil Wickremesinghe however, appointed Tennakoon as acting Inspector General of Police. He was appointed as the permanent Inspector General of Police on 26 February 2024.",
    "The same day that he was appointed to the post of Inspector General of Police,\u00a0Leader of the Opposition\u00a0Sajith Premadasa\u00a0claimed that the\u00a0Constitutional Council, which oversees high-level appointments, saw only four votes cast in favor of Tennakoon. In comparison, two votes were cast against and there were two abstentions. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, counting the abstentions as votes against exercised his casting vote to break the tie in Tennekoon\u2019s favour. This matter is currently being canvassed in the Supreme Court.",
