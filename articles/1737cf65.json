    "Issuing a statement in this regard, the Commission noted that officials who were required to submit their declarations by 31 March should have submitted their assets and liabilities declarations to the respective heads of their institutions by 30 June, in order for them to be forwarded to the CIABOC.",
    "However, the Commission added that legal action will be taken under Section 90 of the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023 against officials who fail to submit their assets and liabilitie declarations to their heads of institutions by 31 August.",
    "In addition, the Commission announced that a fine will be imposed in accordance with the provisions of the Act for late declarations submitted between 30 June and 31 August 2025.",
    "Accordingly, any Executive Grade State officials who have not yet submitted their declarations of assets and liabilities are advised to do so as soon as possible in order to minimise any administrative fines that may be imposed, the Bribery Commission added.",
    "The Commission also stated that assets and liabilities declarations submitted after 30 June must be accepted by the heads of institutions, and that if a head of an institution refuses to accept a declaration, the matter should be reported to the CIABOC."
