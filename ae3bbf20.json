    "With President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka\u00a0 Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Government taking practical and effective\u00a0 measures to pull Sri Lanka out of the debt crisis and restore economic\u00a0 stability within a few months, it is important to give a vital place to\u00a0 the role of youth in the economic development strategy. They could get\u00a0 involved practically and effectively in major social problems such as\u00a0 poverty alleviation, and the battle against climate change so that we could\u00a0 have a \u201cgreen economy\u201d.",
    "Indian social reformer Kailash Satyarthi\u2014who\u00a0 campaigned against child labour in India and advocated the universal\u00a0 right to education\u2014has portrayed the role of the youth in a powerful\u00a0 way. He says the power of youth is the common wealth of the entire\u00a0 world. The faces of young people are the faces of our past, our present\u00a0 and our future. No segment in society can match with the power,\u00a0 idealism, enthusiasm and courage of young people. Judged on this\u00a0 basis, where does Sri Lanka stand?",
    "At present the youth are seen mostly\u00a0 in demonstrations against various policies of the Government but they\u00a0 also performed the extraordinary feat of forcing former President\u00a0 Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country in a secret flight. The\u00a0 Government through proactive and innovative measures should inspire the\u00a0 youth to enter into a peaceful and friendly dialogue and work out the\u00a0 role they could and should play in this digital era.",
    "We did see through\u00a0 powerful youth uprisings in 1971 and 1988, but the youth and the country\u00a0 realized that violence is counterproductive or destructive and the way\u00a0 to solve problems is a peaceful and friendly dialogue. In the north the\u00a0 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and other terror groups learned\u00a0 the same lesson with more than 100,000 being killed or injured, the\u00a0 economic cost incalculable and the country still suffering its\u00a0 consequences politically and economically.",
    "On August 12 the United Nations marks International\u00a0 Youth Day with the theme being \u201cGreen Skills for Youth: Towards a\u00a0 Sustainable World\u201d. In a statement, the UN says today, the world is\u00a0 embarking on a green transition. The shift towards an environmentally\u00a0 sustainable and climate-friendly world is critical not only for\u00a0 responding to the global climate crisis but also for achieving the\u00a0 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",
    "A successful transition towards a\u00a0 greener world will depend on the development of green skills in the\u00a0 population. Green skills are \u201cknowledge, abilities, values and attitudes\u00a0 needed to live in, develop and support a sustainable and\u00a0 resource-efficient society\u201d.",
    "According to the UN, these include technical knowledge and\u00a0 skills that enable the effective use of green technologies and processes\u00a0 in occupational settings, as well as transversal skills that draw on a\u00a0 range of knowledge, values and attitudes to facilitate environmentally\u00a0 sustainable decisions in work and in life. Due to their\u00a0 interdisciplinary nature, the essence of green skills is sometimes\u00a0 expressed, partly if not wholly, through other associated terms such as\u00a0 \u201cskills for the future\u201d and \u201cskills for green jobs\u201d. While green skills\u00a0 are relevant for people of all ages, they have heightened importance for\u00a0 younger people, who can contribute to the green transition for a longer\u00a0 period of time.",
    "The UN says youth can be a positive force for development\u00a0 when provided with the knowledge and opportunities they need to thrive.\u00a0 Today, there are 1.2 billion young people aged 15 to 24 years,\u00a0 accounting for 16 per cent of the global population. By 2030\u2014the target\u00a0 date for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that make up the 2030\u00a0 Agenda\u2014the number of youth is projected to have grown by seven per cent, to\u00a0 nearly 1.3 billion.",
    "Half of the people on our planet are 30 or younger, and\u00a0 this is expected to reach 57% by the end of 2030. A survey shows that 67%\u00a0 of people believe in a better future, with 15 to 17-year-olds being the\u00a0 most optimistic about this. The majority of people agree that the age\u00a0 balance in politics is wrong. More than two-thirds (69%) of people\u00a0 across all age groups agree that more opportunities for younger people\u00a0 to have a say in policy development/change would make political systems\u00a0 better. Globally, only 2.6% of parliamentarians are under 30 years old,\u00a0 and less than 1% of these young MPs are women.",
    "American singer-songwriter and poet Jim Morrison has some\u00a0 practical advice for youth who do not wish to play an active role in\u00a0 politics and social fields. \u201cThe most important kind of freedom is to be\u00a0 what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You give up\u00a0 your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask\u201d."
