    "The Lanka Sama Samaja Party [LSSP] was formed in 1935 with two main objectives \u2013 winning independence from British imperial rule and eliminating poverty and gaining social equity for all the people of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). There was a list of 22 other issues like a free health service, free education, employees\u2019 rights etc.",
    "The struggle for independence led to the banning of the LSSP and the imprisonment of its leaders like Dr. N M Perera, Dr. Colvin R de Silva, Philip Gunewardena and many others, both in Sri Lanka, and in India where they went underground after escaping from jail here.",
    "Leslie Goonewardene led the underground struggle against the British, who finally granted us independence in 1948. They left, but retained control of the plantations, and the King (later Queen) of Britain retained sovereignty. Full independence with sovereignty was obtained after 24 years of struggle led by the LSSP (as the local capitalist class and the feudalists were satisfied with Dominion status). It was only in 1972, through the Republican Constitution drawn up by Colvin, which made Sri Lanka a fully independent and sovereign Republic. India won independence in just three years through struggles led by Gandhi and Nehru, with the full support of their capitalist class.",
    "It was Colvin, who as Minister of Plantations, with the support of Kobbekaduwa, who nationalized the plantations, thereby getting full control of our economy. It was the LSSP that formed most of the trade unions that struggled and won workers rights and fair wages. They had to have frequent strikes to support these struggles for rights and proper wages. The strength of the trade unions gave the LSSP the necessary support for the political struggles. The unions were also the recruiting grounds for new party members.",
    "A bulk of the members came from different districts. The party was started in the Kegalle district by Dr.N M Perera and while the party has 270 branches in all 25 districts, Kegalle is its stronghold. As such the Ruwanwella and Yatiyantota electorates are the strongest and the LSSP has won seats at all levels up to Parliament at every election. Deraniyagala has been lost only once. Yatiyantota came to be called \u201cthe N M electorate\u201d.",
    "The next in strength for the LSSP is the southern coastal strip extending from Colombo to Galle districts, with representatives up to Parliament including Moratuwa, Panadura, Kalutara, Balapitiya, Ambalangoda, and Ratgama. Extending inland from this area the LSSP has won Matugama, Agalawatte, and Bandaragama.",
    "In Colombo too LSSP had members of Parliament from Wellawatte-Galkissa (Colvin) Colombo South (Bernard Soysa), Colombo North (Vivienne Gunewardena), Colombo East and Borella. There were MPs from Badulla, Bandarawela, Nuwara Eliya and Maskeliya in the hill country. There were Tamil MPs from Jaffna in the North and from Batticaloa District. The LSSP is free of any prejudice based on race, religion or caste.",
    "All these MPs, MMCs etc have worked day and night for the people they represented. Not one of them has ever had any charges of misdeeds lodged against them in any Court of Law. None have obtained or misused any Government money or buildings. Rather than using Government property or funds for themselves or relatives or friends, they have spent their own money to help others in need. They have never charged a cent for any services rendered by them. This is a proud record that has been upheld by all LSSP politicians. We are committed to serve the people and the country. You can rely on us at all times.",
