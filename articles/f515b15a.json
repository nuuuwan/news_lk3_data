  "original_body_lines": [
    "Deputy Minister of Public Security, Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala, alleges that some police officers are receiving regular payments from underworld and drug trafficking activities.",
    "Speaking during Ada Derana\u2019s current affairs program \u201cBig Focus\u201d, he emphasized that certain measures taken to eradicate the underworld activities and drug trafficking cannot be disclosed to the media.",
    "\u201cThere are police officers who receive their salaries from the underworld and drug trafficking activities. Following intelligence reports, we had to transfer almost the entire police force in Ruwanwella. Not only that but also in Avissawella. These individuals are a network. The underworld\u2019s money is flowing into the hands of the police,\u201d he added.",
    "Deputy Minister Watagala also noted that discussions had been held with the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) regarding the issue and revealed that the current leader of the underworld is operating in Mathugama.",
    "\u201cWe see this as a serious problem. It is difficult to disclose all the measures we have taken through the media. Some decisions have been made at the ministerial level regarding drugs and the underworld activities,\u201d he said.",
    "The Deputy Minister further mentioned that the implementation of these measures has been entrusted to a team led by the police chief.",
    "Furthermore, he urged all police officers to honour their duty to the public and respect their mandate.",
    "\u201cYesterday and the day before, underworld incidents surfaced again. There is also narrow, opportunistic politics involved in this,\u201d Deputy Minister Watagala claimed."
