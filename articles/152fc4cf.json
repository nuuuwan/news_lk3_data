    "In address at BASL Legal Symposium calls for ethical integrity, Constitutional values, and collaborative legal development",
    "Addressing the inaugural session of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Legal Symposium 2025, Chief Justice Murdu Fernando, PC, emphasised the importance of ethical integrity, Constitutional values, and collaborative legal development in steering Sri Lanka towards a \u201cJust Republic.\u201d",
    "This was the first Legal Symposium of the BASL held after the assumption of office by Rajeev Amarasuriya as the President of the Association.",
    "In her keynote address, Fernando expressed appreciation to the BASL for organising these Legal Symposiums and commended its efforts to engage outstation branches with the same vigour as its metropolitan counterpart. \u201cThis symposium, hosted in the South, amply showcases the BASL\u2019s recognition of its outstation branches,\u201d she noted, praising the inclusive outreach.",
    "The Chief Justice urged continued commitment from the BASL in advancing justice, describing the symposium as a gathering \u201cunited by a shared commitment for the advancement of justice in Sri Lanka or a \u2018Just Republic.\u2019\u201d",
    "Reflecting on rising public concerns about the legal system, she acknowledged the challenges posed by archaic or unresponsive laws. \u201cSome speak up stemming from their fair share of disappointment, some talk to correct them, some to make a mockery of the legal system,\u201d she said, underscoring the need for legal renewal in an evolving society.",
    "She emphasised that the law must begin with its \u201cmoral compass,\u201d pointing to ethics as the foundation of justice. \u201cEthics are not a burden\u2014it is the heartbeat of our profession. If we lose it, we lose the legitimacy of our very system which we tend to serve.\u201d",
    "Highlighting the importance of harmony between the Bench and Bar, she stated that \u201cinstitutional bridges need be built,\u201d adding that, \u201cdiverse views should be tolerated\u201d in pursuit of a resilient judicial system. Fernando urged for a culture of respectful engagement rooted in Constitutional values.",
    "Turning to the Constitution, the Chief Justice described it as \u201cthe central law of the land,\u201d likening it to the bark of a tree\u2014\u201cthe bridge between the roots, the values of our culture and heritage, and the branches, which are the legal texts and statutes.\u201d",
    "Quoting American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, she reminded the audience that \u201cthe life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience,\u201d arguing that legal development must be responsive to the country\u2019s changing social and technological realities. \u201cSri Lanka cannot afford a judicial system frozen in time,\u201d she stressed.",
    "She emphasised that the judiciary must not only defend the Constitution but also act as its active stewards. \u201cIf the Constitution is the beating heart of our country, then the citizens who are sheltered by it will be the blood that flows along its veins.\u201d",
    "In support of this view, she cited the renowned legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart: \u201cWhat surely is most needed in order to make men clear sighted in confronting the official abuse of power, is that they should preserve the sense that the certification of something as legally valid is not conclusive of the question of obedience; its demands must in the end be submitted to a moral scrutiny.\u201d This, Fernando stated, demands that legal validity be rooted in ethical legitimacy.",
    "In strong support of the BASL\u2019s mission, she praised the BASL as a \u201cguardian of standards and a conscience of the profession,\u201d highlighting its unique position to influence both legal reform and the ethical climate of the country. \u201cAt its finest, it has proven how a professional association may also function as the legal system\u2019s conscience.\u201d",
    "The Chief Justice recognised the BASL\u2019s efforts to eliminate regional and social inequities within the legal community and promote diversity. \u201cJustice, in order to be truly accessible, must begin with a legal profession that represents the variety of the people it serves.\u201d",
    "Calling for continued vigilance and independence from the BASL, she urged the Association to never become \u201can instrument of expedience,\u201d but rather a principled institution willing to \u201cspeak truth to power as a matter of principle.\u201d",
    "Concluding her address, Fernando quoted Justice C.G. Weeramantry: \u201cLaw is too important to be left to lawyers alone. It must engage the minds and hearts of the whole people.\u201d She reaffirmed the judiciary\u2019s and BASL\u2019s shared duty to build a legal culture based on \u201cprinciple, courage, and compassion.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis Legal Symposium,\u201d she concluded, \u201cwill be a crucial step in ensuring this commitment. May it be more than a conversation but the start of a renewal, for justice denied anywhere diminishes justice everywhere.\u201d"
