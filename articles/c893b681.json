    "U.S. economists deem that hiking tariffs may slow the growth of U.S. debts but not achieve any significant reduction, said a report released by the Fortune magazine on its website on Sunday.",
    "U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that revenues from raised tariffs could both reduce America\u2019s national debt of 37 trillion U.S. dollars and fund a public \u201cdividend.\u201d",
    "His primary purpose is \u201cto pay down debt, which will happen in very large quantity,\u201d while there is also a possibility that \u201cwe\u2019re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,\u201d Trump said earlier this month.",
    "The Fortune\u2019s report, citing some U.S. economists, expressed skepticism over the president\u2019s claim.",
    "Joao Gomes, a professor of finance and economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told Fortune that the tariff income may offset some costs of the \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d projected by the Congressional Budget Office to add 3 trillion to the debt by 2030, but is unlikely to make a meaningful dent in overall debt.",
    "Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, said Trump\u2019s claim of raising 300 billion dollars is just \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d compared with the country\u2019s growing debt. \u201cThe country is on a really dangerous debt trajectory,\u201d he said.",
    "Lachman also warned that while Trump frames tariffs as a tool for job creation or debt reduction to bolster political support, investors are unlikely to be convinced. \u201cMarkets aren\u2019t dumb. They can do the arithmetic and figure out that this is nonsense,\u201d he added.",
    "The report also noted that current revenues from the tariffs do not even cover the interest on the U.S. debt, let alone reduce its total. Citing U.S. Treasury data, it pointed out that national debt interest expenses totaled 60.95 billion dollars in July, while tariff revenues amounted to only 29.6 billion dollars."
