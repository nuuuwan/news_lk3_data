  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a Ukraine peace deal could boost his chances of getting to heaven -- joking that his odds of making it through the pearly gates are currently low.",
    "The 79-year-old US president has previously said he wants to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine as part of his bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize.",
    "But a day after hosting the leaders of Ukraine and several European nations at the White House, Trump said his motivations were not all earthly.",
    "\u201cI want to try and get to heaven if possible,\u201d Trump told Fox News morning show \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
    "\u201cI hear I\u2019m not doing well -- I hear I\u2019m really at the bottom of the totem pole! But if I can get to heaven this will be one of the reasons.\u201d",
    "By traditional yardsticks the three-times-married, twice-impeached Trump is no saint.",
    "The billionaire Republican has been embroiled in a number of scandals over the years and is the first president to have a criminal conviction, in his instance a hush money case involving payouts to a porn star.",
    "But Trump has taken on an increasingly religious tone since surviving an assassination attempt last year. He said at his inauguration in January that he had been \u201csaved by God to make America great again.\u201d",
    "Boasting strong support from America\u2019s religious right, Trump has embraced the trappings of faith far more strongly in his second term in the White House.",
    "He has notably appointed an official spiritual adviser, Paula White, who has led a number of prayer gatherings that have seen attendees lay their hands on Trump at White House events.",
    "Trump\u2019s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday she believed \u201cthe president was serious\u201d about his Ukraine comments.",
    "\u201cI think the president wants to get to heaven, as I hope we all do in this room,\u201d the 27-year-old Leavitt -- who herself holds prayer sessions before her briefings -- told reporters."
