### Janaka Ratnayake criticises political rallies as ‘business ventures’

*2024-09-18 03:45:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Janaka-Ratnayake-criticises-political-rallies-as-business-ventures/56-766838) · `en`

Eksath Lanka Podujana Peramuna Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake yesterday expressed concerns over the state of politics in Sri Lanka, claiming that the political landscape has transformed into a business enterprise over the past 76 years, causing significant hardship for the people. Speaking at a media briefing, Ratnayake alleged that candidates routinely organise large election rallies with the help of companies that specialise in assembling crowds.

He further claimed that individuals attending these rallies are paid between Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 5,000, creating an artificial image of public support.

“These gatherings, featured on social and State media, are not representative of genuine political movements,” Ratnayake said.

He claimed that most people are still undecided on whom to vote for. “Our people have become disillusioned with politics,” he said.

A challenge to note in the presence of the new government that requires a long -term racism through a political solution based on devolution. The new president must give priority to this issue to bring about sustainable peace and unity to the country.

### Sri Lanka’s next leader: can make or break the nation

*2024-09-18 02:03:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-next-leader-can-make-or-break-the-nation/4-766815) · `en`

As Sri Lanka prepares for its upcoming Presidential election, the stakes have never been higher. In 2022, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis that brought the nation to a standstill, marked by fuel shortages, soaring inflation, and widespread protests. Since then, the country has taken steps toward stabilising the economy, but much remains to be done. This election is not just about choosing a leader but about securing the nation’s future and ensuring continued recovery from the devastating economic collapse.

The road to recovery has been difficult, but significant progress has been made since 2022, largely supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. However, Sri Lanka remains vulnerable, and the next president must navigate the country through this challenging period with a steady hand. Voters, therefore, must consider candidates who possess the qualities necessary to complete the recovery process and set the nation on a path to sustainable growth.

Either the country enters a new era on 21st with AKD at the helm or continues to struggle facing crisis after crisis under the current system

The success of NPP’s entire economic trajectory hinges on reforming governance. This is the pillar on which the new system would be built and that was the message from the Aragalaya generation. AKD’s resolve to change the rotten political culture and moribund system of governance should therefore stabilise the economy faster with IMF assistance and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth with equity. Voters seem to have understood this message for the first time

We need to allow for persons with political will to be given the batten of opportunity to run the relay – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Thirty-eight candidates vying for the ‘hot seat’ literally, makes Sri Lanka a laughing stock in the eyes of the world.

The expense of printing ballot papers of the length required is gargantuan. How dysfunctional can a country be, declared bankrupt.

Meaningless exercise in a country struggling under strain of billions of Dollars in Sovereign Debt and no means or plan of payback.

Unrest and conflict in the Middle East and Eastern Europe adding to economic woes.

We the voter who is today the VVIP for all purposes will decide on the proffered one.

Incumbent President has the advantage of media coverage and attention ad lib. He also while promising a rosy future as always, keeps passing bills in parliament to gain favour and fervour.

Salary increases and other delectable benefits to the naive uninformed electorate.

Sri Lankans are to elect a new President on 21 September 2024 to rule the country for the next five years. Whether it is the confirmation of the incumbent interim President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the post or the election of one of the two frontrunners to presidency, it is the economy stupid that the new President should tackle immediately. That is because the economy is not stable as claimed by the incumbent President in his election campaign.

The notion that Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability is more fragile than the narrative suggests is reinforced by the IMF’s own warnings to Sri Lanka; that its debt sustainability and economic recovery remains on a “knife edge”

Given below are these broad targets of the IMF:

### Tribute to Late Anthony A. Page

*2024-09-18 00:56:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Tribute-to-Late-Anthony-A-Page/4-766807) · `en`

I first met Anthony A. Page, fondly known as Baba, in early 1992 while conducting an audit of the Ceylon Theatres Group. At the time, I was working as an article clerk at KPMG Ford Rhodes Thornton & Company. During our initial meeting, where he interviewed me for a position within his Group, I was struck by his gentle and humble demeanour. Our conversation revolved around the importance of family, and he shared the story of his father, late Albert Page, who came from Manipay, Jaffna to Colombo, eventually succeeding in business. Little did I realise that this conversation will lay the foundation for a lasting professional and personal relationship.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankas basic food prices are sharply down after multiple value added tax hikes over the past two years, but politicians, who stay mum on import duties, continue to claim that they will reduce VAT to bring down food prices.

After years of pushing the ideology that direct taxes are the best system tax, and indirect taxes were ‘regressive’ both politicians and ‘professionals’ received shock when income tax rates were raised to pay state worker salaries in 2022.

Politicians are usually against tax in a knee-jerk reaction from Western ideology

Now they want to reduce personal income tax. Personal income taxes have a major disadvantage because they undermine individual choice and take taxes away before an economic decision and transaction is made.

Value added tax is collected after an individual makes a choice, guiding the economy towards their needs and then the government collects a tax, analysts say.
