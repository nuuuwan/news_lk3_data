### A shooting incident and conspiracy theories

*2024-07-21 13:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188993) · `ta`

Conspiracy theories often arise when official explanations lack clarity, especially regarding incidents like shootings. They suggest a "shadow government" operates outside democratic norms, using power secretly. This concept isn't new in U.S. history; it's been linked to events such as presidential assassinations. These theories serve as political tools, highlighting the potential misuse of conspiracy narratives.

🟩

The shadow government is seen as contrary to democracy because of the exercise of power beyond the selected government. As far as the United States is concerned, the assassination of the president and the unleashing of assassinations on them is not new. In all cases where there is no proper answer to the question, stories are told in the name of conspiracy. The lesson we can learn from American history is that conspiracy can be used as political weapons.

“The postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the whole country. Especially for the Tamils.

As for this presidential election, no candidate can get more than 50 percent of the votes. So they will try to get the votes of the minority people.

At the same time, when no one gets more than 50 percent of the votes in the presidential election, the political stability in the country will be left.

There are already economic crises in the country. If there is no political stability, the country will face the worst economic setbacks.

In addition, there will be a situation where large funds will be spent on the election. That too will affect the country's economy ”.

### My Family’s “Black July” Experience: A Personal Memoir.

*2024-07-21 03:33:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84405) · `en`

The anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983 is an unforgettable chapter in the post-independence history of Sri Lanka.  The catastrophic events of that dark month  drastically affected  the lives of large numbers of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

As a Sri Lankan Tamil journalist, Black July did have an effect on me in both personal and professional capacities. Furthermore my family – like thousands of other Tamil families – was also affected and displaced during those turbulent times.

Although I have been writing  extensively about Black July in the past, I did not write about those happenings from a personal perspective  for many,many years.

I  refrained for a long time  from writing about the impact of Black July on our family for two reasons. Firstly I was spared the full blast of that violence because I was not in Colombo then. I was on assignment to cover the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) party convention in Mannar.

### Republicans put on show of unity behind Trump after assassination attempt

*2024-07-21 02:04:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/republicans-put-on-show-of-unity-behind-trump-after-assassination-attempt/) · `en`

The Republican National Convention was held as scheduled from Monday, July 15, in spite of the assassination attempt of Donald Trump the previous Saturday, at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He escaped with minor injuries, but the iconic picture of Trump defiantly doing a fist pump, his bloody ear and face prominent with Old Glory fluttering in the background, conveyed an image that will go down in history – the courageous warrior, fighting for the country he loves, despite the excruciating pain he has suffered all his life with bone spurs.

The shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, described as “a very quiet young white man” was a poor marksman. Two inches to the left would have changed the history of the most powerful nation in the world. As Senator Tim Scott said at the Convention, “On Saturday, the Devil came to Pennsylvania with a rifle, but OUR AMERICAN LION GOT UP AND ROOOOARED!

### Failure to find a political solution is a bigger shame than Black July

*2024-07-21 00:54:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84410) · `en`

After the death of veteran Tamil political leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan recently, a communist leader from Tamil Nadu contacted me and asked about the remarkable role the late leader played in Sri Lankan Tamil politics.

I began by recounting Sampanthan’s contributions to the negotiations that led to the signing of the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord after the 1983 Black July anti-Tamil pogrom. He immediately interrupted and asked me what happened in July 1983. I was very much disappointed that there was a Leftist leader in neighbouring Tamil Nadu who did not know that the brutal ethnic violence against Tamils all over the country led to the civil war that lasted almost three decades.

He is not too young to know what happened in Sri Lanka at that time. I wondered if he had not even considered why Sri Lankan Tamil refugees had been staying in Tamil Nadu camps for more than four decades.

On a Saturday morning weeks later, his father appeared, He was an imposing figure, sporting a Kaiser mustache and during our conversation he inquired from where I hailed and also my name. I said that I am from a village upcountry, called Karahandungala, near Nawalapitiya and my name was Sirimal. On hearing this his facial expression changed and I knew he had heard a name sounding like ‘Sirimala’ identified with a low caste.

### Merrill J. Fernando:A Friendship Remembered

Speech made at an event marking the first anniversary of the passing of Mr. Merrill. J. Fernando on July 17

My earliest recollections of Merrill are of his consulting me at the Ratnam Private Hospital when I was a young and energetic surgeon. Although he consulted doctors in Singapore, UK and Australia, he always came back to me for a second opinion. Our friendship grew with mutual admiration for each other’s work.

I did not realize that he had another doctor at home until one day he called me to say that one of his sons has read on the Internet of the side effects of a drug that I had prescribed, and asked me what I thought he should do. I replied “Merrill, it takes 10 to 15 years to become a good doctor but it takes only 10 to 15 seconds to become an Internet doctor”! He roared with laughter. That was the side of Merrill who loved a good joke and even better, a repartee.

### My aunt, the Veda Menike and herbal medicine

*2024-07-21 00:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-aunt-the-veda-menike-and-herbal-medicine/) · `en`

Ceylon’s native medicinal practitioners did not all come from a single social class anymore than did her astrologers. I can remember that, in my childhood days, a man named Punchi Rala, who cultivated a paddy field owned by my family, prescribed medicines for the commoner ailments. On the other hand, there was the Veda Menike, a female relative of mine, the daughter of an Adigar, who apart from being a competent ayurvedic doctor, had a good knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit and was at home with ola manuscripts.

Living in Kurunegala town at the beginning of the 20th century, we also had a family doctor who came with his shiny instruments in a buggy cart. There were, as far as I can remember, two motor cars in Kurunegala at the time. Neither the doctor or any member of my family possessed one.

### ARTI or Peradeniya University? – career dilemmas of a young man

*2024-07-21 00:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/arti-or-peradeniya-university-career-dilemmas-of-a-young-man/) · `en`

In 1971, after the failed Marxist uprising against the state, the government introduced the rule that anyone applying for a government job should get a report (a ‘chit’) from the local political agent of the government. This rule especially applied to young men and women, as the government distrusted the youth because of their involvement in the insurrection.

Soon after graduating from the University of Peradeniya in 1972, I applied for a vacancy at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI) for a research and training officer (rural sociology). I visited the political agent, who lived in Hendala, to get a chit. The agent was an Ayurvedic doctor who was also a justice of the peace and a member of the Town Council (He was known as ‘Member Mahatmaya.’). He cordially received me in the verandah of his small house. He was in a sarong without a shirt or a vest. A heavy leather belt with a large buckle was around his belly over the sarong. A small towel covered his shoulders.

For the younger generation that may not know of Dr. Mary H. Rutnam, she was a Canadian missionary doctor, who came to Ceylon on her marriage to a Ceylonese missionary educator, Mr. S.C.K. Rutnam. She was born as Mary Irwin, in Ontario, Canada (1873-1962). She had a medical degree from Canada, but opted to work as a medical missionary in Ceylon. Later, after the mission did not approve of her marriage to a native Ceylonese, she ceased to be a missionary worker and settled into a medical practice in Colombo. Her patients were mainly women, mainly Muslim women who preferred to have a female doctor. Although she was white and foreign-born, it was remarkable that she was able to bypass the white-colonial structure in Ceylon and identify directly with its native people.

### THE FAILURE OF TEACHING RELIGION IN SCHOOLS

*2024-07-20 22:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-failure-of-teaching-religion-in-schools/) · `en`

To quote. “Religion should be the motor of life, the central heating plant of personality, the faith that gives joy to activity, hope to struggle, dignity to humility and zest to living.” Upliftment is the keynote. Yet Religion has been the cause of the most appalling bloodshed and strife . The most horrendous wars have been fought in the name of religion and rivers of blood have flowed while idiots quarreled over the words of god-like men who must have been appalled by the distortion of their messages to humanity. So let us agree that religion DIVIDES and most certainly does not UNITE.

I am at a loss, therefore, to understand, WHY our Education Planners insist on religion being taught in schools? Religion continues to be a divider even in our little island. In schools that contain pupils of all faiths, students are split up whenever it is time for that period in religion. Language is already a divisive factor yet we purposely add yet another subject to compound the folly.
