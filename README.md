During her 107-day presidential election campaign, Kamala Harris (having inherited the Democratic Party candidacy after the precipitous departure of Joe Biden) tried to project herself as the true change agent.

It is learnt that this facility was constructed almost 20 years ago, using leftover material

The tragedy that occurred at internationally famed Na Uyana monastery, killing seven Buddhist monks on the spot and injuring six other Bikkus is another heartrending news that shocked the entire Sri Lanka within the last one month. From the wide publicity given over the electronic media, it is reported that this unfortunate accident has taken place when the steel cable attached to the cable cart had snapped mid-journey, sending 13 Buddhist monks plummeting down a 300 meters precipice at a rapid speed without any control.

Apparently, this last batch of Bikkus out of three had been returning from a religious observance when the accident struck at about 21:30 hours. The bodies had been flung to a more than 100 meters distance, according to eye-witnesses and rescuers, which gives the impression that the cart has travelled excessive speed after losing control.
