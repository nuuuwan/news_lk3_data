    "SLACC to be platform for friendship and understanding as well",
    "In the realm of international commerce and diplomacy, the Sri Lanka and Australia Chamber of Commerce stands as a testament to visionary leadership and a profound commitment to fostering prosperity and deeper connections between two nations with a shared historical tapestry.",
    "Founded and presided over by Kalum De Silva, this initiative is poised not only to stimulate economic growth but also to redefine the landscape of bilateral relations in the years to come.",
    "Kalum\u2019s visionary leadership in establishing the Sri Lanka and Australia Chamber of Commerce (SLACC) exemplifies a commitment to not only economic growth but also to the cultivation of stronger bonds between two nations with a shared history.",
    "Through the Chamber, the path is paved for businesses to flourish, collaborations to thrive, and friendships to deepen. This initiative is set to redefine the landscape of bilateral relations in the future.",
    "In an interview with the Daily FT, Kalum shared his visionary initiative to bolster trade, investment, and cultural exchange between two nations with a rich history of diplomatic relations.",
    "Kalum, the driving force behind this ground-breaking endeavour, emphasises: \u201cThe Chamber was born out of a recognition of the immense potential that exists in the economic partnership between Australia and Sri Lanka. We witnessed a doubling of bilateral trade over five years just before the onset of the global pandemic, and I firmly believed that with the right platform, we could not only recover that momentum but also surpass it. The Chamber serves as this platform, facilitating connections, collaborations, and understanding between our business communities.\u201d",
    "Beyond facilitating trade, Kalum sees the Chamber as a catalyst for growth. He envisions an environment where businesses from both nations can thrive. By providing a forum for key representatives to engage in meaningful discussions and explore synergies, the Chamber is paving the way for innovative partnerships that will drive economic development. As per the AED, the value of trade already taking place is over AUD 700 k (that is within the first 4 weeks).",
    "While economic prosperity is paramount, the Chamber also seeks to cultivate stronger bonds of friendship and understanding between the nations. Australia and Sri Lanka share a history of diplomatic relations, and the Chamber aims to build on that foundation.",
    "Through cultural exchange and knowledge sharing, they hope to foster an environment of mutual respect and appreciation. They recently signed an agreement to become the first \u201cFriends of Kinaway\u201d Global Alliance Partner. Through Kinaway their Sri Lankan members can access over 500 Australian businesses to partner with.",
    "Kalum outlined a series of events and forums in the pipeline, designed to bring together business leaders, policymakers, and thought leaders from both countries. These platforms will facilitate discussions on key sectors, from technology and innovation to agriculture and tourism. Additionally, the Chamber is exploring avenues for mentorship programs and educational exchanges to further strengthen ties.",
    "Kalum leaves businesses and stakeholders with a powerful message, \u201cI would encourage businesses on both sides to seize this opportunity. The Chamber is a bridge to new markets, fresh ideas, and invaluable connections. Together, we can shape a future of prosperity and understanding for Australia and Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "In the wake of a rapidly changing global landscape, the Sri Lanka and Australia Chamber of Commerce stands as a beacon of hope and possibility, forging a path towards a future defined by mutual prosperity and enduring friendship. Under the leadership of Kalum, this initiative is set to leave an indelible mark on the economic and diplomatic landscape of both nations."
