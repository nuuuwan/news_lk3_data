    "The driver was later found to have been shot, according to police, who were searching for a suspected gunman who fled the scene along Santa Monica Boulevard in East Hollywood.",
    "It was not immediately clear if the driver was shot before or after the crash or why he drove into the crowd, a police spokesperson said.",
    "Twenty-three victims were taken to hospitals and trauma centers, according to police. Seven were in critical condition, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement.",
    "Fire Capt. Adam VanGerpen said a line of people \u2014 mostly female \u2014 were waiting to enter Vermont Hollywood when they were struck by a Nissan Versa that also hit a food vending cart and valet stand. \u201cThis was a very chaotic scene,\u201d said VanGerpen, a public information officer.",
    "People inside came out to help victims in the minutes before emergency crews arrived, he said.",
    "The driver, whose gunshot wound was found by paramedics, was also taken to a hospital. Police did not identify him or disclose his condition.",

    "Vermont Hollywood was hosting a reggae-hip hop event from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., according to its online calendar. There was no immediate response to a phone message left with the business.",
    "A fight broke out outside the venue beforehand, according to Maria Medrano, who with her husband was there selling hot dogs. Shortly afterward, she said, the car hit the people, and the couple narrowly escaped when it crushed their stand.",
    "\u201cThe car stopped once it hit the hot dog stand, it got stuck there,\u201d Medrano told The Associated Press from the hospital. \u201cIf not, I wouldn\u2019t be here to tell\u201d the story."
