  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 has commenced\u00a0 a series of discussions with Parliamentarians from the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka with the\u00a0 objective of resolving the Tamil national question. Currently talks are underway with Tamil MPs from the\u00a0 five Northern and three Eastern administrative districts. These MPs are from both the Government as well as the opposition.",
    "As is well known the largest concentrations\u00a0 of Sri Lankan Tamils\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Island are in the Tamil dominated Northern Province and Tamil majority Eastern province. Parliamentary representatives of the Sri Lankan Muslims and Hill Country Tamils of recent Indian origin are likely to\u00a0 be accommodated in these discussions officially. The next round of talks will be held in June.",
    "However Tamil Progressive Alliance(TPA) leader and former cabinet minister Manoharan Ganesan known as Mano Ganesan and Mano has a different opinion on this. The Colombo district MP told this column that regarding the Tamil national question or Tamil ethnic issue as being\u00a0 confined to the\u00a0 Tamils of the North and East alone was not correct.",
    "Elaborating further Mano Ganesan said\u00a0 \u201cPresident Wickremesinghe has been repeatedly told that Hill Country Tamils today are an unique ethnic community.It has now grown beyond the old \u201cPlantation worker \u201d identity. We are one of the \u00a0four national ethnic communities \u00a0in Sri Lanka, along with Sinhalese, NE Tamils and Muslims\u201d.",
    "Speaking further to this column, Mano Ganesan said he disagreed with the idea of participating in\u00a0 discussions where the primary focus would be on issues facing the Tamils of the North and East. \u201cThere is no point \u00a0in\u00a0 the \u201cMalaiyahath Thamilar\u201d(Hill Country Tamils) and Muslim parties sitting as spectators at the discussions \u00a0while \u00a0the President talks to North-east \u00a0Tamil party MPs. \u00a0This can only \u00a0be a hindrance to their discussions. \u00a0It is not going to help our North -Eastern \u00a0Tamil brethren or us. President Wickremesinghe should listen to the North -Eastern\u00a0 MPs\u00a0 separately.\u201d",
    "When asked\u00a0 what the TPA wanted to discuss specifically, Mano Ganesan replied as follows \u2013 \u201c You see, TPA being the largest party is ready with Hil lCountry Tamil National political aspirational proposals. The other good aspect is that we have exchanged views with the Ceylon Workers Congress(CWC) on this. They (CWC ) are in agreemen with us.t. We have political differences but we stand together on national aspirations.\u201d",
    "Responding to a query about the\u00a0 envisaged proposals Ganesan said \u201c The important proposal in our set of proposals is the\u00a0Non-Territorial Community Council (NTTC). We are not demanding territory here, as a province or district, but a \u00a0Non-Territorial Community Council.\u201d.",
    "The TPA leader emphasised that \u201cMalaiyahath Thamilar\u201d or Hill country Tamil aspirations and issues had to be discussed separately.\u201dI have requested President Wickremesinghe to appoint \u00a0a high powered Presidential committee on HillCountry Tamil aspirations. I think \u00a0Cabinet minister Jeevan Thondaman \u00a0has also made this request to the President.. Therefore, President Wickreeasinghe could do so and \u00a0initiate talks with us, the HillCountry Tamil parties. I think he should provide such \u00a0an opportunity \u00a0for Muslim parties too. If the govt wishes we are ready to \u00a0talk. If not \u00a0we will talk to the next govt.\u201dstated Ganesan with a chuckle.",
    "According to the 2012\u00a0 official \u00a0census, the Indian origin Tamils numbering 839,504 (4.12%) are the fourth-largest ethnicity in Sri Lanka. However these\u00a0 figures \u00a0may not be \u00a0entirely accurate as a very large number of the Indian Origin Tamil citizens have been categorized as Sri Lankan Tamils in the official census. This is blatantly visible in the Northern and Eastern districts as well as in Colombo and Gampaha. Even in the Up Country districts the census enumerators have a tendency to classify those living in estate regions as Indian Tamils and those residing in urban areas as Sri Lankan Tamils. The total population of Tamils \u2013 both Sri Lankan and Indian -is 3,113, 247. Of these 1,611,036 Tamils are living in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Another 1,502,211 Tamils live outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces.",
    "The harsh reality is\u00a0 that the Tamils living in the seven Sinhala majority provinces have been deprived of equitable political representation over the years. The majority of these people are those of Indian origin known as Hill Country Tamils or Malaiyahath Thamilar. . Moreover the community notably the plantation workers are economically under-privileged.",
    "The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) founded on June 3rd 2015 is the premier political configuration of the Hill Country Tamils as far as Parliamentary representation is concerned.The TPA obtained six seats at the 2015 Parliament poll. The party got three seats in Nuwara- Eliya and one each in Colombo, Badulla and Kandy districts.",
    "The TPA repeated its success in 2020 by winning six seats in the exact manner as it did earlier in 2015. Three other Hill Country Tamil MP\u2019s were elected from the Ceylon Workers Congress(CWC) in Nuwara -Eliya and Samagi Jana Balavegaya(SJB) in Badulla.",
    "However the TPA\u2019s Badulla district MP violated party discipline by voting for the 20th Constitutional amendment and was expelled. The TPA contested the 2015 election under the UNP\u2019s elephant symbol and the 2020 poll under the SJB telephone symbol.",
    "The TPA comprises the Democratic Peoples Front (DPF) National Union of Workers (NUW)\u00a0 and Up Country Peoples Front (UCPF) led by Mano Ganesan, Palanyi Thigambaram and Velusamy Radhakrishnan respectively. While the three constituent parties continue to retain their status as separate parties, the TPA \u00a0has been \u00a0 officially recognized as an Independent political party by the Elections Commission\u00a0 and allocated the torchlight as election symbol.",
    "Mano Ganesan is the Tamil Political Alliance leader while Palani Thigambram and V Radhakrishnan are the joint deputy -leaders. The TPA has a Presidium of 6 Members and a 14 member Politbureau. The TPA\u2019s\u00a0 name in Tamil is \u201cTamil Mutpoakku Kootani\u201d.",
    "The\u00a0 TPA proposal to form a Non \u2013 Territorial Community Council(NTCC) is an integral and vital component of a politically important document formulated\u00a0 by the TPA last year. It is titled \u201cAspirations of Tamil People of Recent Indian Origin Towards Integration with Dignity and Mainstreaming as full Citizens in Sri Lankan Polity and India Sri Lanka Accords\u201d.",
    "Initially the TPA held public discussions on the need for such a document and thereafter called for related submissions from intellectuals, scholars and professionals in the community. A committee was formed to draft the document referred to in brief as the \u201cAspirational Document\u201d. The final draft was approved and authorized for public dissemination by the TPA politbureau and presidioum. A key element of the aspirational document is the proposal to establish Non -Territorial Community Councils for \u201cMinority Communities of Special Interest (MCoSI) living in dispersed form in the country\u201d.",
    "The following is the text of the Constitutionl proposal to establish a Non-Territorial Community Council(NTCC) for the Malayaha/Indian Origin Tamil community in Sri Lanka.",
    "* Non-Territorial Community Councils (NTCC) shall be established to represent the interests and aspirations of the Minority Communities of Special Interest (MCoSI) living in dispersed form in the country.",

    "* All financial activities related to national budgetary allocations, local and foreign grants shall be subjected to the department of auditor general.",
    "TPA) leader Mano Ganesan is the driving force behind \u00a0the initiative of \u00a0seeking a new representative body for the pre-dominantly Tamil people of recent Indian origin or Indian Origin Tamils(IOT). In recent times the community has become known as the \u201cMalaiyahath Thamizhar\u201d (Hill Country Tamils/Up Country Tamils). Although called Hill Country Tamils because they are mainly concentrated in the Uva,Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces,the \u201cMalaiyahath Thamizhar\u201d community is widely dispersed in all parts of the Island.",
    "What the TPA envisages is the creation of a new entity \u2013 Non -Territorial Community Council- to represent the interests and aspirations of the hill country Tamils scattered throughout the country. The laudable objective is to facilitate and expedite the comprehensive integration of the community into the mainstream as full-fledged citizens of Sri Lnka while retaining their ethnic identity.",
    "The TPA proposal to establish a Non Territorial Community Council (NTCC)for the Hill Country Tamils is a novel idea worth pursuing. It is hoped that the NTCC would \u00a0soon become a reality after discussions with President Wickremesinghe and the Government.",
