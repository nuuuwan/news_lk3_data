    "Nations Trust Bank recently launched an Urban Forestry Initiative, a multi-phase tree-planting project that is aimed at increasing greener spaces in Colombo city while encouraging environmental stewardship.",
    "The initiative demonstrates Nations Trust Bank\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability and its aim to reach the Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Twenty-four trees of the variants Mee, Karanda, and Koboleela, were planted along Union Place and Staple Street in Colombo during the project\u2019s initial phase, and another sixteen Ehala and Rath Koboleela trees will be planted on Sir James Pieris Mawatha during the second phase. The project will be further divided into multiple stages, reaching more areas within urban Colombo.",
    "The trees possess notable environmental benefits. They help decrease the effects of dire heat in urban areas, minimize noise pollution, and purify the air, in addition to uplifting the beauty of the city landscape. The staff of Nations Trust Bank actively participated in the tree planting initiative, demonstrating the Bank\u2019s dedication to environmental conservation.",
    "Speaking on the initiative, Sanjaya Senerath, Chief Marketing Officer of Nations Trust Bank, stated that \u201cEnvironmental sustainability is one of our key focuses at Nations Trust Bank. We continue to be fully engaged in a range of initiatives that support environmental protection and this is an additional endeavour that we have taken on with the hopes of building an environmentally friendly future for local urban communities.\u201d",
    "Nations Trust Bank\u2019s dedication to environmental responsibility goes far beyond the Urban Forestry Initiative. The Bank has partnered with Biodiversity Sri Lanka for a five-year project to rehabilitate degraded fern land in Kanneliya. NTB also hosts public lectures on environmental topics in partnership with the Wildlife & Nature Protection Society and assists the Animal Rescue & Rehabilitation Programme at Hiyare, which plays an important role in restoring injured wildlife and raising environmental conservation awareness among youth.",
