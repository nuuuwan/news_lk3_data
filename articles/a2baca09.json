    "Speaking at the inauguration of a new building at Chunnakam Police Station in Jaffna, Weerasooriya noted,",
    "\u201cThe government has informed me to ensure equal application of the law, and I have relayed this to all officials. After the last presidential election, no incidents of post-election violence were reported. This reflects a new culture in Sri Lanka and underscores the community\u2019s support and the authority granted to us to enforce the law without bias.\u201d",
