    "\u201cTime to put a complete end to underworld crimes\u201d -\u00a0 Public Security Minister",
    "A comprehensive investigation is being carried out into \u2018Kehelbaddara Padme\u2019 and his associates, Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala has stated.",
    "Minister Ananda Wijepala further noted that organized criminal groups in the country had been allowed to grow over a long period with the blessing and support of certain politicians.",
    "He made these remarks while addressing media at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).",
    "The Minister stressed that it is now time to put a complete end to underworld crimes and that no further opportunity will be given for such groups to continue oppressing the public.",
    "\u201cToday, five members of a leading criminal gang, including Commander Salintha \u2014 a close associate of Kehelbaddara Padme \u2014 were brought back to Sri Lanka from Indonesia. All five are now in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",
    "This operation was the result of long-term planning, particularly by Police, the Inspector General of Police, and the CID. They had been preparing for this over an extended period and, for about seven days, engaged in a joint operation with Indonesian police to apprehend the suspects and bring them back to the country.",
    "It is well known that these organized criminal groups were able to thrive in Sri Lanka due to the blessings of politicians. They were used to maintain political power and, in return, politicians benefited from their activities. We have now uncovered instances where the properties and resources of these criminals were used to fulfill the needs of politicians.",
    "As a result, the IGP has already instructed the CID to carry out an in-depth investigation into the individuals now in custody. We are conducting both a broad and deep inquiry into this matter.",
    "We assure the people of this country that the time has come to put a stop to these underworld activities that continue to harm society. These actions will not be allowed to continue any longer.\u201d"
