    "In a country which still prefers lackeys to competent men, we are bound to come across many more Hirushans either in ICUs or in coffins",
    "The University of Ruhuna seems to be very well quarantined. Under an extremely capable Consultant Paediatrician, it seems to have been saved from a killer virus which has invaded the entire Sri Lankan body of public universities causing occasional deaths, permanent injuries and life-long psychological scars. A virus called Brutal Ragging.",
    "At a time when the entire nation is hunkering down due to COVID-19, a recently widowed dad is praying for the survival of his son Hirushan barely hanging on to life thanks to a machine in the ICU. Hirushan\u2019s only apparent crime was being a fresher at the premier Public University for Management. He shouldn\u2019t have been where he was in the early hours of that fateful morning. But he had no choice in an institute which was not ruled by a Vice Chancellor, a Senate and security staff, but a murderous gang of \u201cAnthare\u201d seniors, whose orders no fresher dared to resist or disobey. Freshers were lamb-for-slaughter to be tortured at will; most times in broad daylight and right in front of the VC\u2019s office.",
    "Hirushan shouldn\u2019t have walked away after being forced to participate in a party that wasn\u2019t likely to end anytime soon, as the murderers were on a drinking spree. Finally, when he walked away, a huge tractor tyre chased after him seeking his life. The authorities claimed it was an unfortunate accident. The university wasn\u2019t closed instantly; CID and the Government Analyst weren\u2019t summoned immediately to carry out a meticulous investigation until the attempted murderers were identified with hot and compelling evidence. It looked like another unfortunate accident.",
    "Too bad Hirushan came from a poor family and was not connected to a politician in power. The heads would never roll at the top for criminal negligence, as they are political lackeys appointed by ones in power. Once the anger and frustration of the public dies down it would be business as usual with the tacit partnership between the \u201cAnthare\u201d and the university leadership. I can\u2019t help thinking: What if Hirushan had ended up at Ruhuna University instead? He would definitely be very much alive and kicking. Because Ruhuna \u2013 a well-known torture-chamber a year ago has been transformed to a zero-ragging campus within months by a man with a steely spine supported by a caring staff, who consider each fresher as their own and are totally committed to protect each one; where the authorities aren\u2019t least scared of \u201cAnthare\u201d thugs and waste no time to put them behind bars. One doesn\u2019t mollycoddle terminal cancer \u2013 one destroys it with laser treatment.",
    "In a country which still prefers lackeys to competent men, we are bound to come across many more Hirushans either in ICUs or in coffins. But at least there\u2019s one university where the freshers are looking as happy as the riot of Bougainvilleas at the VC\u2019s Lodge; dressed in clothes of their choice instead of drab uniforms decreed by \u201cAnthare\u201d; Geoffrey Bawa\u2019s masterful architecture rescued of torture chambers; young men and women energetically participating in sports instead of being herded as cattle for slaughter.",
    "How much longer does J\u2019pura need to rehabilitate? Aren\u2019t there any more academics who are sensitive, caring, responsible and with a backbone? Is Sujeewa Amarasena the last?",
