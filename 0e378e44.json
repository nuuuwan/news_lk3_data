  "original_body_lines": [
    "The administration of the Sri Dalada Maligawa (The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) is in the process of arranging a cost-effective lighting system for the annual Esala Perahera.",
    "Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela told the Daily Mirror that the decision over the settlement of the estimated electricity bill will be taken after a meeting with the respective parties.",
    "Earlier, the CEB informed Sri Dalada Maligawa to deposit more than Rs.13.2 million to provide continuous electricity supply for the perahara.",
    "This estimated bill became an issue after it was published on social media.",
    "A large electricity bill estimate is provided, assuming using halogen street lights during the perahera days. Halogen street light systems are outdated, and therefore, the Maligawa administration is considering using LED lights instead, which consume less electricity.",
    "However, a discussion will be held on Wednesday (19) on settling the respective electricity bills to the four Dewalayas and to the Kandy Municipal Council. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
