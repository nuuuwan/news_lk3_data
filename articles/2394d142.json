    "Hambantota International Port (HIP) experienced a modest increase in cruise ship arrivals in 2024, marking a significant shift in the origin of vessels calling at the port. While there was a noticeable decline in cruise ships originating from the Indian subcontinent, the port saw a substantial rise in ships arriving from Europe. Of the 23 cruise ships that called at HIP during the year, only six were from India, compared to 17 liners from Europe.",
    "The last three cruise liners to call at HIP in 2024 highlighted the diversity and reach of the port\u2019s growing reputation. Mv. Azamara Pursuit, part of the Azamara Cruise Line fleet based in Miami, Florida, made her inaugural visit to HIP in early December. Although this was the first time for Azamara Pursuit, the port had previously welcomed her sister ships: Azamara Quest and Azamara Journey in May and November 2023, respectively, and Azamara Onward in April. After her stay at HIP, Azamara Pursuit departed for Phuket, her next destination. Azamara Line\u2019s local agent, Prudential Shipping, played a pivotal role in facilitating 10 cruise liner calls to the port this year.",
