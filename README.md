### Sri Lanka says Adani Port Project to continue despite US charges

Indian conglomerate Adani Group’s port project in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite US charges against its founder and sudden changes to its financing, the island nation said Friday.

A bombshell indictment in New York last month accused billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani and several colleagues of deliberately misleading international investors as part of a bribery scheme.

The charges sent Adani stocks into freefall and again raised questions over corporate governance at the family firm, whose founder is considered a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But Sri Lankan ports minister Bimal Ratnayake said the allegations against Adani had no bearing on the deep-sea container terminal project in the capital Colombo.

“The problem between Adani and the US... is not our concern,” he told reporters during a tour of the port on Thursday night.

“It is of high importance for us that western container terminal development by Adani goes ahead.”

The enduring fisheries conflict in the Palk Bay - which impacts fisher folk of northern Sri Lanka and daily wage fishermen of Tamil Nadu - can be decisively resolved only if the Indian side stops using the destructive bottomtrawling method, according to Sri Lanka’s Minister of Fisheries Ramalingam Chandrasekar.

The fisheries conflict has remained a key diplomatic issue between India and Sri Lanka for many years. It is likely to be discussed during President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s scheduled visit to India next week.

“People from all ethnic groups and geographic regions, including the north, east, and hill coun-try, voted for us [National People’s Power alliance], giving us a big mandate in the recently held elections.  We have a responsibility to address their concerns,” said Mr. Chandrasekar, who represents the northern Jaffna district in par-liament.
