    "Sri Lanka currently imports most of its energy needs, including oil, coal and hydrocarbons. To ease the economic burden, the island nation aims to generate 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.",
    "Russia has emerged as one of the strongest contenders to build nuclear power plants in Sri Lanka, according to a media report published on Tuesday.",

    "Chairman of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Authority (SLAEA) Prof. S.R.D. Rosa briefed the Russian delegation on the status of Moscow\u2019s proposal to develop an offshore or onshore nuclear power plant in Sri Lanka. He said his office had in principle given its approval for nuclear power to enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s energy mix and it had been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval.",
    "\u201cWe can implement this project only if the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) is signed between Sri Lanka and Russia. That is now pending,\u201d he added.",
    "Many countries, including the US, Denmark and China, have expressed interest in investing in nuclear power plants in the island nation after the SLAEA gave the green light to nuclear power.",

    "According to media reports, Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity generation in 2020 was heavily reliant on fossil fuels (10 TWh) and hydropower (5 TWh), with small contributions from wind and solar. The CEB\u2019s long-term energy plans include nuclear power from 2030.",
    "In 2022, a team of IAEA experts assessed Sri Lanka\u2019s readiness for a nuclear power programme through an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review. This review was part of the IAEA\u2019s Milestones Approach, designed for countries introducing nuclear energy."
