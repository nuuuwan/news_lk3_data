  "original_body_lines": [
    "Nepal\u2019s major political parties have demanded the country\u2019s president reinstates the parliament he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests.",
    "In a statement, eight parties - including the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Maoist Centre - said President Ram Chandra Poudel acted unconstitutionally.",
    "Poudel dissolved the House of Representatives on Friday upon the recommendation of newly appointed interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki - it was also a key demand from the protest movement.",
    "More than 50 people were killed in clashes with riot police during this week\u2019s mass protests sparked by a ban on social media platforms. Karki was appointed after a deal was reached with protest leaders.",
    "The ban was lifted on Monday - but by then the protests had swelled into a mass movement. Angry crowds set fire to parliament and government buildings in the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday, forcing then-Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to resign.",
    "Saturday\u2019s statement demanding the reinstatement of the parliament was signed by the chief whips of the eight political parties.",
    "They argued the step taken by the president was unconstitutional and against the precedents set by Nepal\u2019s judiciary.",
    "The dissolution of the parliament was a major demand by student leaders from the so-called \u201cGen Z\u201d protest movement.",
    "But the eight parties say the protesters\u2019 demands - including new elections announced for 5 March next year - should be addressed through an institution voted by the people.",
    "Later on Saturday, President Poudel urged all sides to show restraint and help conduct the elections.",
    "In a statement, he said a peaceful resolution was being achieved in a \u201cvery... difficult and scary situation\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe constitution is alive, the parliamentary system is alive and the federal democratic republic still exists. People have an opportunity to move forward in the path of a more efficient democracy by conducting elections within six months,\u201d the president said.",
    "Karki, a 73-year-old former Supreme Court chief justice and the first woman to lead the impoverished Himalayan nation, was sworn in during a brief ceremony in the capital Kathmandu.",
    "She is expected to appoint ministers to her cabinet within a few days.",
    "She is widely regarded as having a clean image, and her leadership of the interim government is being supported by student leaders from the \u201cGen Z\u201d movement.",
    "But her cabinet will face multiple challenges, including restoring law and order, reconstructing parliament and the other key buildings that were attacked, reassuring the Gen Z protesters who want change - and others in Nepal who are fearful its young democracy and constitutional order could be derailed.",
    "Another key task will be to bring those responsible for violence to justice.",
    "Nepal is gradually returning back to normalcy after the worst unrest in decades.",
    "Nepal\u2019s soldiers - who had been deployed to patrol the streets of Kathmandu - returned to their bases after Karki took the oath of office.",
    "The protests were triggered by the government\u2019s decision last week to ban 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook - but they soon widened to embody much deeper discontent with Nepal\u2019s political elite.",
    "In the weeks before the ban, a \u201cnepo kid\u201d campaign - spotlighting the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children and allegations of corruption - had taken off on social media.",
    "And while the social media ban was hastily lifted on Monday night, the protests had by that stage gained unstoppable momentum."
