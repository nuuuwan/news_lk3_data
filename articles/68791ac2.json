    "In 1994, I had the privilege of working at the Galle Face Hotel (GFH) as the Consultant to its Chairman, Cyril Gardiner. Over time, our professional relationship evolved into a warm camaraderie. Cyril had a sharp sense of humour. On one occasion, while discussing the maintenance challenges faced by historic seaside hotels like Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) and GFH, he quipped, \u201cChandana, GFH is only 130 years old!\u201d",
    "Cyril was a master of public relations, capable of crafting newsworthy stories and engaging with leading international journalists. He turned what might seem like eccentric behaviour into captivating narratives for the media. His knack for creating publicity was not accidental but meticulously orchestrated, a lesson I was fortunate to learn first-hand.",
    "His extensive network of affluent and influential families in Sri Lanka further amplified his ability to promote GFH. One day, he showed me a photograph taken at his wedding, where he and his wife were flanked by four of Ceylon\u2019s most powerful figures: the second, third, and fourth Prime Ministers and a long-serving Governor-General.",
    "Among his many achievements, Cyril elevated the GFH\u2019s iconic doorman, Kuttan, to celebrity status. Kuttan, born in 1920 in southern India, arrived in Ceylon in a small boat at 19, penniless but full of ambition. After working as a domestic servant for a Colombo elite family, he joined GFH in 1942. Over seven decades, Kuttan became a symbol of Sri Lankan hospitality, renowned for his friendly demeanour, sharp memory for guests, distinctive handlebar moustache, and full head of white hair.",
    "Cyril\u2019s efforts ensured Kuttan\u2019s fame extended far beyond Sri Lanka. Kuttan graced the covers of international travel magazines, becoming one of the most celebrated hotel employees in the world alongside Chef Publis of MLH. My interactions with Kuttan enriched my experience at GFH, as he shared fascinating stories of the hotel\u2019s illustrious past.",
    "Cyril was equally supportive of my initiatives beyond GFH. When I confided that my part-time M.Phil./Ph.D. at the University of Surrey and a textbook project with UK publisher Hodder & Stoughton had been sidelined during my tenure at MLH, he was disappointed but encouraging. He even reduced my GFH commitment to three days a week while continuing to pay my full salary, enabling me to complete my book, Profitable Food & Beverage Management, co-authored with Professor Richard Kotas.",
    "I then formed a consortium of hotel consultants with three esteemed professionals: Hiran Serasinghe, the first Sri Lankan General Manager of a five-star international hotel; Damayantha Kuruppu, a London-educated hotelier-turned-planner; and Kamal Hapuwatte, an expert in hotel training. At our initial meetings at my in-laws home in Nugegoda, they chose me as the leader of this venture.",
    "The consortium achieved early success, providing services such as drafting standard operating manuals, upgrading equipment, and delivering training programmes. We were on the brink of securing management contracts for a pioneering resort in Negombo and a 90-room hotel near Colombo. I began our presentations to potential clients with a bold statement: \u201cOurs is the only consortium of hotel consultants in Sri Lanka, with over 100 years of collective experience managing hotels ranging from one to five stars.\u201d",
    "Even after leaving MLH, I remained the Managing Director of the International Hotel School (IHS), where I owned 30% of the shares. My mentor, Professor Kotas, held another 10%. When Sanath Ukwatte, Chairman of the MLH Group, suggested that I buy the Ukwatte family\u2019s 60% stake and move IHS outside MLH, I began exploring the possibility.",
    "Around the same time, Clairemont, Sri Lanka\u2019s second-oldest hotel school, was up for sale. I started negotiations with the founder\u2019s son and envisioned merging it with IHS. Central to my vision was the concept of a \u201cfunctional hotel school,\u201d which required operating within a large hotel. I proposed relocating IHS to GFH and shared this idea with Cyril, who was intrigued and asked for time to consider it.",
    "Amidst my hectic schedule, I pursued my passion for art, producing a significant body of work in my home studio. In 1994, I participated in the Kala Pola Open-Air Art Fair alongside my son, Marlon. Launched in 1993 by the George Keyt Foundation with 35 artists, the event had grown significantly by 2024, hosting over 300 artists and attracting 30,000 visitors annually.",
    "Following my Kala Pola experience, legendary Sri Lankan artist Cavaliere Tilake Abeysinghe encouraged me to organise my first solo exhibition. I approached Cyril, an art enthusiast, for a venue. He promptly offered GFH as the host site free of charge, declaring, \u201cChandana, don\u2019t look any further.\u201d",
    "In March 1994, I held my first solo exhibition, Contrasts, at GFH, showcasing 50 paintings and five sculptures. Cyril purchased two pieces and displayed one in GFH\u2019s boardroom. Sri Lankan film star Swarna Mallawarchchi inaugurated the event. This exhibition marked my only solo exhibition in Sri Lanka.",
    "After that regularly having held solo art exhibitions in Guyana, Jamaica, and Canada, I presented my 16th solo show in November 2024. More details on Reflecting on my 30-year journey as a semi-professional visual artist, I remain grateful for Cyril\u2019s initial support, which set me on this artistic path.",
    "Looking back, my short period at GFH were transformative, thanks to the mentorship and friendship of Cyril Gardiner. His generosity, vision, and support allowed me to grow as a consultant, entrepreneur, and visual artist. His influence continues to resonate as I reflect on this chapter of my life, one rich in experiences and lessons that shaped my future endeavours.",
    "In 1994, as I was feeling happy with successes at different fronts, I gradually accepted that I may not achieve my previously set goal of becoming an international hotelier/the General Manager of globally branded five-star hotel in another country. My wife and son too were doing well in Sri Lanka, and it appeared that we would remain in Sri Lanka.",
    "One rainy night the phone rang at home, and it was an overseas call. The caller said, \u201cThis is the Vice President \u2013 Human Resources of the Trust House Forte (THF) Hotels head office in London. We received your application some time ago\u2026 We now have a vacancy for a General Manager. If you are still interested, can you fly to London within two days for a series of interviews? We will look after your air tickets and board and lodging for three days in London. Are you available?\u201d",
