    "(A member of the former Ceylon Civil Service and Retired Senior Professional of the Asian Development Bank, Manila, Philippines)",
    "The unparalleled victory of JVP/NPP in the national elections of November 14, 2024 has created an unprecedented sense of euphoria among Sri Lankans. This was no ordinary achievement as a lot of hard work went into changing the mindset of communities that had hitherto blindly followed the elitist policies of the major political parties. What led to this transformation?",
    "An analysis of the voting pattern clearly illustrates that many factors were at play in seeking a complete overhaul of the policy and administrative structure in the country \u2013 there has been a low turnout of voters (around 65 percent) compared to previous elections but this is a subject that is outside the scope of this paper. Obviously, the cry for a systems change was heard and the people were prepared to listen and digest the causes and consequences of a weakening economy that was overwhelmed by disjointed policies, corruption and waste, and administrative structures that did not provide flexibility and freedom to change approaches.",
    "It is important to analyse more critically the factors that were at play in achieving this incredible victory that included several firsts: becoming the first single party two-thirds majority in the Parliament after the proportional representation (PR) system was introduced; winning in 21 out of 22 electoral districts thereby obtaining the participation of all ethnic communities, including the estate communities who had been accustomed to vote based on trade union affiliations; and above all, changing the collective psyche and traditional mindsets of the northern and eastern Tamils who for the first time opted to vote for national parties than to parochial regional parties.",
    "JVP/NPP led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, more popularly known as AKD, was closely engaged for over a decade in reconstructing the rural base, building significant ties with the urban middle class and the trade union movements, and establishing links with the public sector and the Sri Lankan diaspora. The leadership factor here should not be underestimated as the form, structure and presentational characteristics of AKD\u2019s messages were forceful, eclectic and quickly absorbed.",
    "Simultaneously, social media and digital marketing were used as catalytic modes of communication. The culmination point came with the \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 movement which opened-up new opportunities that were seized with vigour and enthusiasm. In fact, the beginnings of the tremendous successes achieved on September 21 and November 14, 2024 respectively, must be traced to the Aragalaya which was taken too lightly by the established political parties.",
    "The organisational skills that went into village level campaigning and canvassing were undervalued by the JVP/NPP\u201ds opponents. There was a determined effort to address the crying needs of people at all levels and make them understand the nuances of the NPP manifesto, which combined with the oratorical skills of AKD, had the magical result of spreading the message in a clear, concise and convincing manner. The writer listened to a few speeches of AKD\u2019s via \u2018You Tube\u2019 to understand the thrust of his campaign.",
    "What he eloquently said at his Jaffna rally created a lasting impact on the minds of listeners. He raised issues, asked questions and provided convincing answers that mesmerised the public-I could see the smiling faces clapping with all their might appreciating both the innuendos and the practical insights offered for solving the problems of the dispossessed landowners and the missing peoples\u2019 relatives. The proof of the pudding is in the eating and needless to add the convinced listeners decided to vote for NPP resulting in significant electoral successes in Jaffna.",
    "The campaign strategies adopted by NPP cut into the failures of past socio-economic policies and were aimed at capturing the essence of livelihood issues. Cost of living, mismanaged economy, corruption, social inequities, inequitable justice system and law and order issues, along with the colossal waste of public resources, including by those in power, formed the core of the issues advanced urging system change",
    "Critically reviewing the NPP manifesto, one is struck by the scope, scale and versatility of the major socio-economic, governance, institutional and policy reform issues identified and assessed for review, reform and reconstruction. The comprehensive coverage of developmental issues from economy and social transformation to framing a new constitution; public service reform, improved health, education, and transport; and a myriad of other institutional reforms- from investment promotion to digitalization provided a platform for the people to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a new political dispensation.",
    "The concept of one nation embracing the north, south, east, central highlands and the west with equal opportunities for the Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim and the plantation communities sank well into the minds of the people from Dondra head to Point Pedro yearning for change and social liberation. Interestingly, race and religion were excluded in the dialogues. The outcome was evident in the composition of the elected representatives who clearly vindicated that social transformation has indeed begun.",
    "Another factor that contributed to the expansion of the vote base was the role played by the expatriate community and the social media \u2013 they served to provide incentives for knowledge transfer and logistical support. The visit of the NPP leader of the NPP to a few western countries and Japan generated both funding and substantial enthusiasm and support from the Sri Lankan diaspora which in turn helped to provide promising feedback and advice to their kith and kin living in Sri Lanka. This was confirmed in discussions with expatriates in the U.K and Canada, among others.",
    "The people have spoken decisively and unambiguously. The Cabinet, the focal point of the decision-making process of government, is now in place. What follows next is the question that is in the minds of the millions who voted for change. Expectations are running high. Election promises as well as the key challenges outlined in the 130 page Election Manifesto have now to be dissected, analysed and prioritised for action through projects and programs.",
    "Promises that need to be translated into intputs and outcomes cover a wide array of subjects from poverty alleviation, social restructuring, new investment strategies, eradication of corruption and waste, framing of a new constitution, building trust and reconciliation among divided communities for improved power sharing, and several other interrelated priority areas such as transport, health and education sector improvements. These are no ordinary list of \u2018to-do\u2019 things.",
    "AKD and the Prime Minister have the vision, ability and power to design and execute a program befitting the varied developmental interventions necessary to implement the promises given to the people of the country. They will have to carry the cabinet of ministers and the public officials along with them to deliver. How would this be done and what kind of strategies and official structure will be initiated -obviously these are issues which would have been thought of, debated and decided upon and would likely be placed before the country shortly.",
    "The writer, based on his experience in the development sector both in-country and overseas, thought it relevant to highlight some experiences that may be relevant here. In his book, \u2018Managing Development: People, Policies and Institutions\u2019 he touches on some of the more important areas in Governance, Institution Building, Agricultural Development and Monitoring and Evaluation. The book deals extensively with public sector reform in Sri Lanka and this was well received at all levels.",
    "But since its publication in 2019, despite all efforts, little has been done to revamp the public administration. The public service suffers from lethargy and inefficiencies that have been hardly touched upon for a couple of decades. A strong will to reform the public service must be present to execute the diverse programs encapsulated in the Election Manifesto.",
    "Similarly, there is copious data available on poverty alleviation strategies experimented and successfully executed in several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), among others, have documented some of the success stories. There is an urgent need to undertake targeted interventions to deal with extreme poverty- 26 percent of the people in Sri Lanka live in poverty and need intensive support mechanisms to rise above poverty.",
    "Restrictive regulatory policies and practices have hindered the development process considerably in the recent past. It is presumed that a committee of experts will be chosen to address shortcomings and map a path to facilitate expeditious despatch of business, including a suitable mechanism to provide easy access to foreign investment. In short, Sri Lanka has to set up a special overarching institution that will cut red tape, ease restrictions inimical to investment, and provide easy access to investment opportunities.",
    "There are competing demands, including the promise to frame a new constitution, that would engage the attention of the government. But the determination of priorities is based on emerging demands, including a full assessment of the current economic and social needs. At present, debt restructuring and economic sustainability in the context of the IMF Agreement precedes others. A follow-on exercise will be to itemise and determine priority areas of intervention with framing of the new constitution given a lower priority.",
    "The question that is being raised now is how the long-standing issue of ethnic discontent, power devolution and language disparities will be resolved along with the existentialist issues of the average Sri Lankan who is plagued by cost of living, transport, education and health issues. These are matters that the government needs to resolve through short, medium and long term interventions.",
    "Several expert panels and advisory committees may have to be enlisted to look at ways and means of making good the promises given to the people. None of the long-standing issues can be resolved quickly and this is something that the government should reiterate at all times to dispel adverse publicity by elements waiting to undermine the new government.",
    "Formidable challenges lie ahead. Obstacles are many and the entrenched public service along with political opponents can make matters difficult. Prioritised interventions should make things happen irrespective of hidden sabotage and non-cooperation. The shortage of rice being experienced now, for instance, may be the artificial effect of non-cooperation by the millers who have formed an oligopoly to stifle competition. More such instances may arise and a watchful eye is what is required to resolve issues as they surface.",
    "There is overall commitment and dedication and a significant knowledge base present in the current cabinet. However, with few exceptions, experience in the art of governance is lacking among many. This may adversely affect policy formulation and implementation in the short term. But as long as the will to succeed prevails, short term inadequacies could be overcome through proper training, guidance and supervision.",
    "A standard monitoring and evaluation system has to be established to monitor implementation of projects and programs and assess performance periodically so that appropriate corrective actions could be taken promptly.",
    "The government and especially AKD is aware that the country is watching with cautious optimism the realisation of the promised land.",
