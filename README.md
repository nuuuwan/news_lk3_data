### Why two-third majority for NPP?

*2024-10-20 23:02:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-two-third-majority-for-NPP/4-768190) · `en`

A supportive parliament with two-third majority for NPP is an absolute must for the new regime to translate its promises into action

AKD expects his JVP-led NPP to win a majority of seats in the legislature to make his task easier. The question is whether that majority should be a simple working majority or a solid two-third majority. Disastrous consequences under governments that ruled with two-third majority in the past had provoked political pundits and opinion makers to question the wisdom of electing governments with two-third majority. Without questioning their wisdom however, a special case could be argued in favour of such a majority to the regime (the terminology is employed neutrally) headed by President AKD.

Unlike the traditional political parties that have operated under a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” arrangement, the NPP under President AKD stands independent, promising nothing but results for the people. The parties that have suffered crushing defeats are now devoid of manifestos or visions, as they have plundered the nation’s resources and sold off valuable assets. It is crucial that the public be vigilant in casting their votes, ensuring that corrupt individuals do not return to power

### The JVP’s commendable evolution on matters economic has not been paralleled in the ethnic problem arena. The NPP was remarkably reticent on the subject in its  presidential manifesto.  Behind a non-racist façade, the JVP is as regressive about the Tamil question today, as it was in the past.

*2024-10-20 20:58:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84942) · `en`

“The future is cloth waiting to be cut.” Seamus Heaney (The Burial at Thebes)

The point had been made often enough. Without a Gotabaya Rajapaksa presidency, there wouldn’t have been an Anura Kumara Dissanayake presidency. For the NPP/JVP to go from 3 percent to 42 percent in four plus years, the system had to be broken from within by the very leaders entrusted with its care by a majority of voters. Gotabaya Rajapaksa achieved that feat in ways inconceivable even by his most stringent critics (who in their sane minds could have imagined the fertiliser fiasco?).

But President Dissanayake’s victory has two other fathers: Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa. President Dissanayake won because the competition was so uninspiring. It was more a case of Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe losing rather than President Dissanayake winning. While the NPP’s rise was meteoric, President Dissanayake failed to gain 50 percent mark of the vote. He is Sri Lanka’s first minority president.
