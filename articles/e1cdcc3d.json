    "The overall rate of inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) on year-on-year basis has recorded a significant decrease in the month of March 2024, according to the most recent figures published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS).",
    "The CCPI-based inflation was calculated as 5.9% for the month of February.",
    "According to the DCS report, the year-on-year inflation of Food Group was recorded at 3.8% in March, showing a minor increase from the 3.8% recorded in February, while the inflation of Non-Food Group decreased to -0.5% in March from 7.0% in February.",
    "For March 2024, the contribution of inflation by food commodities was 1.19% while the contribution of Non-Food items was -0.32%.
