    "Colombo, Jan 30 (Daily Mirror) - The Yala Safari Jeep Association has decided to increase the fare of the Yala and Bundala safari jeeps from February 1, Association President Ajith Priyantha said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that all safari jeep fares will be increased by Rs. 2,000 due to an increase in prices of fuel and spare parts after the imposition of the new 18 percent Value Added Tax (VAT).",
    "Accordingly, the fare for a four-hour trip in a Toyota Hilux and Mitsubishi used for safari jeeps has been increased from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 15,000. The daily fare has been increased from Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 30,000, he said.",
    "The fare of a Mahendra Maxi and Tata vehicle for four hours has been increased from Rs. 11,000 to Rs. 13,000, and the fare of a day trip has been increased from Rs. 26,000 to Rs. 28,000.",
    "\"The road conditions in Yala and Bundala are not in good condition, and therefore, our vehicle maintenance costs have increased. We have to complete at least 90 kilometres inside the park, and it takes at least four hours, depending on the road conditions,\" Priyantha said."
