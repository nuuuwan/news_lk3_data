    "The Sports Ministry\u2019s Anti-Corruption Unit today informed the Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court that they are yet to receive the voice test report related to the investigation being carried on former Sri Lankan cricketer Sachithra Senanayake, over allegations of match-fixing.",
    "This was informed to the court when the relevant case was taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage on Friday (17).",
    "The officials of the Sports Ministry\u2019s Anti-Corruption Unit stated that even though the voice sample has been recorded, the relevant report has not been received yet due to a machine used for the voice test breaking down.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, then stated before the court that even though the voice test was carried out a year ago, his client has been treated unfairly due to the report not being received thus far.",
    "After considering the facts presented, the magistrate ordered to take the necessary steps to send a reminder to the Department of Government Analyst to submit the relevant report as immediately as possible.",
    "Former Sri Lankan cricketer Sachithra Senanayake, who was arrested and remanded over the allegations of match-fixing during the Lanka Premier League (LPL) tournament in 2019, is currently out on bail."
