    "In a bold and timely release marking Singapore\u2019s 60th year of independence, a new book is shaking up the familiar narrative of nation-building by offering a surprising and deeply human portrait of the men behind the republic\u2019s birth. \u2018The First Fools: B-Sides of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s A-Team\u2019 is a literary excavation of the 10 men who signed the 1965 Separation Agreement, offering fresh insight into their lives beyond the headlines and history books.",
    "Published by The Nutgraf \u2014 a boutique editorial studio run largely by former journalists \u2014 the anthology is not a typical commemorative volume. Instead of celebrating political milestones and statecraft, it uncovers the untold personal stories of Singapore\u2019s founding fathers: their hobbies, love lives, eccentricities, and even secret pasts.",
    "Speaking exclusively to The Island Financial Review, Peh Shing Huei, Editor of the book, said the team set out to produce something unlike anything already on the shelves. \u201cThere are already countless books and documentaries detailing their political legacies \u2014 their policies, speeches, and public service. But what about who they were as people? Their B-sides, so to speak?\u201d",
    "That question led to \u2018The First Fools\u2019, a title intentionally playful and irreverent, mirroring the tone of a book that dares to show Lee Kuan Yew as \u201cthe lover,\u201d Jek Yeun Thong as a \u201ccrypto-communist,\u201d and Othman Wok as a \u201cghost story writer.\u201d",
    "In perhaps the most unexpected chapter, founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is depicted not as the unyielding architect of modern Singapore, but as a man profoundly and singularly devoted to his wife, Kwa Geok Choo.",
    "\u201cWe were very conscious not to romanticize unnecessarily, Huei told The Island Financial Review. \u201cBut there was something so moving and consistent in every account we heard \u2014 that for all his steely pragmatism, Lee had this deep, unwavering love.\u201d",
    "The authors interviewed Philip Yeo, a former senior civil servant who served as Lee\u2019s Special Advisor for Economic Development. His comment was both humorous and poignant: \u201cA teapot has many teacups, just like an emperor has many concubines. But Lee Kuan Yew had only one teacup.\u201d",
    "Their love story, including a secret marriage while studying in England, is rendered with tenderness and surprising intimacy. \u201cKwa was more than a spouse \u2014 she was his confidante, his emotional compass,\u201d said Huei. \u201cShe helped him see people clearly, and often softened his more authoritarian impulses.\u201d",
    "One of the most memorable anecdotes in the book is about a \u201cmissing photo\u201d of Kwa combing Lee\u2019s hair \u2014 a moment captured by Straits Times photographer George Gascon but mysteriously absent from the public record. The image, like the relationship it portrays, remains elusive yet resonant.",
    "The First Fools follows \u2018The Last Fools\u2019, a 2022 release by The Nutgraf that profiled eight lesser-known civil servants from Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s inner circle. Where the earlier book explored the \u201cA-sides\u201d of obscure figures, \u2018The First Fools\u2019 presents the \u201cB-sides\u201d of famous ones.",
    "\u201cThese men signed the document that made Singapore an independent nation,\u201d said Huei. \u201cBut they also lived, loved, wrote, joked, doubted, and dreamed. That\u2019s what we wanted to show. And we hope their stories resonate not just in Singapore but also in Sri Lanka and the wider region, where questions of identity, leadership, and legacy are just as urgent.\u201d",
