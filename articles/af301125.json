    "Sri Lanka\u2019s bond auction on August 12, 2025 sent a stark warning to policymakers: despite macroeconomic stabilisation under IMF reforms as deep-seated investor skepticism remains.",
    "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) sought to raise\u00a0LKR 65 billion\u00a0through bonds maturing in\u00a02032 and 2035, but the market delivered a brutal verdict \u2013 zero uptake\u00a0for the 2032 bond and tepid demand for the 2035 issue, leaving the auction\u00a0LKR 46.5 billion short\u00a0of its target.",
    "2032 Bond (8% coupon):\u00a0Fully rejected, signaling investors see the return as inadequate for Sri Lanka\u2019s lingering default risks and inflation.",
    "2035 Bond (10.7% coupon):\u00a0Only\u00a074% of target met, underscoring persistent doubts over long-term debt sustainability, policy clarity and economic reforms.",
    "\u201cThe bond market is flashing red,\u201d a debt market analyst told the Island Financial Review on condition of anonymity. \u201cInvestors are saying, \u2018Show us real progress on debt restructuring and economic reforms before we commit.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhile short-term bonds (2027-2029) traded at\u00a08.50%-9.39%, yields on longer-dated debt (2030-2032) climbed to\u00a09.45%-10.25% which was a clear risk premium. Overnight liquidity also tightened to\u00a0LKR 97.89 billion, hinting at growing caution. The rupee inched up to\u00a0LKR 300.67/USD. Yet, traders appear to think that stability is fragile. In this context, if bond auctions keep failing, pressure on the currency will return,\u201d he cautioned.",
    "When asked what could be done to make the bond market more attractive for investors, he replied, \u201cThe Central Bank may be forced to sweeten terms, risking a reversal of recent rate cuts which will push borrowing costs higher though. Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is stabilising, but the bond market\u2019s cold shoulder reveals a harsh truth \u2013 investors still don\u2019t trust the recovery. Without faster debt solutions and critical economic reforms, the Central Bank\u2019s Road ahead would just get rougher,\u201d he opined.",
