    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will not support the domestic debt restructuring programme which is to be presented to Parliament on July 01 if certain conditions are not met.",
    "\u201cWe will not support the domestic debt restructuring programme if the government goes ahead with a debt haircut which is more or less writing off debts. We also stress that the depositors should be safeguarded. We have already said that the government should not lay its hands on the EPF and ETF. We will support the programme only if the government agrees to the line which we have drawn,\u201d Dr. de Silva told a media briefing.",
    "At the same time he said the Opposition had heard of plans by the government to present the domestic debt restructuring plan to the Cabinet on June 28, refer it to the Public Finance Committee on June 29 and then get it approved by Parliament on Saturday.",
    "\u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe talked to me and the Leader of the Opposition over the phone regarding the matter,\u201d he said but fell short of divulging the details of the phone conversation.",
    "He also said all opposition parties will meet tomorrow to discuss the developments. (Yohan Perera)"
