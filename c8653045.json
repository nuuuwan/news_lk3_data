    "Alpine have secured a \u20ac200m cash injection from a group of investors, including Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds, to support the French operation\u2019s sporting ambitions in Formula 1.",
    "Alpine are currently fifth in the constructors\u2019 championship \u2013 one place lower than they finished the last campaign \u2013 and have been searching for investment to help close the gap to F1\u2019s leading teams.",
    "The Investor Group \u2013 formed of Otro Capital, RedBird Capital Partners and Maximum Effort Investments \u2013 have acquired a 24% stake in the F1 team, placing their value, say Alpine, at around \u20ac900m.",
    "The group have worked with NFL side Dallas Cowboys, America\u2019s National Football League (NFL), French football club Toulouse FC and English football team Wrexham AFC.",

    "\u201cFormula 1 and Alpine are strategic assets for Renault Group,\u201d said Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo. \u201cOver the past two years, we have re-ignited Alpine, capitalising on its iconic A110 sports coupe, boosting it by entering Formula 1, where it aims to become a championship contender. This partnership will accelerate Alpine F1 development by diversifying revenue drivers and increasing brand value.\u201d",
    "The investment centres around the F1 team only, with Renault\u2019s engine division in Viry not part of the transaction and remaining entirely owned by the Renault Group.",
    "The news comes as part of a wider announcement from Alpine that sees them set a target of achieving \u20ac8 billion in revenue in 2030 and to break even in 2026.",
    "The Formula 1 team is only one side of the business, with the automotive arm looking to develop its own high-performance platform for its future 100% electric sports cars \u2013 which will see a seven-model range including one future roadster and the all-new A310.",
