    "The rules-based international order has been exposed for what it really is\u2014a farce. Israel, backed by the US, rendered the rest of the world impotent, and made it look on while tens of thousands of Palestinians were perishing in indiscriminate Israeli attacks. The conflict has taken a savage turn with Israel being accused of having weaponised hunger to drive Palestinians out of Gaza. Thankfully, some western nations have plucked up the courage to defend the rights of Palestinians, albeit belatedly.",
    "The UK has said it will be compelled to recognise a Palestine state in September unless Israel takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza. This is something the UK should have done a long time ago in keeping with the Balfour Declaration. It is duty bound to help Palestine emerge as a fully fledged state, as it is one of the nations that were instrumental in establishing Israel at the expense of the Palestinians. France and Canada have joined the UK in trying to save the lives of Palestinians. Israel has protested and the US has sought to leverage trade to prevent its allies from recognising Palestine.",
    "What the UK, France and Canada have undertaken to do to protect Palestinians\u2019 lives will not yield the desired results unless it is coupled with meaningful action to make the two-state solution work on the ground.",
    "The current humanitarian tragedy in Gaza would not have come about if not for a series of coordinated armed incursions carried out by Hamas and other militant groups into Israel from Gaza, in October 2023, killing about 1,000 Israelis, taking more than 250 hostages, and triggering retaliatory attacks. Hamas should have released all hostages. However, the grave crimes committed by Hamas cannot be cited in extenuation of Israel\u2019s brutal military campaign, which has left about 60,000 Palestinians dead so far, according to international media reports.",
    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has apparently taken a leaf out of General Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s book. During the American Civil War, Grant resorted to the scorched earth policy and ordered his army to render the areas it marched through so barren that \u2018crows flying over it for the balance of the season will have to carry their own provender with them.\u201d Netanyahu is apparently all out to ensure that Gaza would be a barren strip of land when his military campaign comes to an end.",
    "US President Trump pretends to be shocked by the heart-rending stories about the predicament of starving Palestinian children, but nothing apparently can shake America\u2019s conscience where the Gaza conflict is concerned. Netanyahu knows this. Hence, the continuation of his brutal military campaign.",
    "Trump boasts of having nipped potential conflagrations in Asia in the bud. He has effectively used trade to force Thailand and Cambodia to stop a border clash. He has also been praised for defusing tensions between India and Pakistan recently. However, Trump has not cared to prevent Israel from destroying lives and property in Gaza. There is no way Israel can continue its military campaign in Gaza without help from Washington.",
    "A lasting solution to the ongoing conflict will never be in the realm of possibility unless both Israel and Palestine are liberated from the clutches of extremists like Netanyahu and Hamas. The US-led western bloc, which continues to support Israel while shedding copious tears for the Palestinians, and the Islamic nations that wield influence on Hamas and Palestine will have to keep the violent elements on a tight leash. First of all, Israel must be made to stop its barbaric military campaign while Hamas is pressured to eschew the macabre cause it is advancing on the pretext of liberating the Palestinians.",
