    "Sri Lanka took three second innings wickets to keep their hopes alive in the first Test against Pakistan in Galle, though the hosts ended the fourth needing just 83 more runs for victory.",
    "The home team was bowled out for 279, leaving Pakistan, who held a 149 run first innings lead, with a 131-run target.",
    "Pakistan had reduced that deficit by 48 runs at stumps, but not before Prabath Jayasuriya dismissed Abdullah Shafique and Shan Masood, and nightwatchman Noman Ali was run out.",
    "Pakistan still remain favourites, though on a wearing Galle wicket, the hosts will still believe they can pull off a win.",
    "At the crease for Pakistan at the close of play was Imam-ul-Haq (25 not out) and Babar Azam (6 not out).",
    "Earlier, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 179, with Dhananjaya de Silva once again proving to be a man for a crisis, with a well-made 82.",
    "The home team were on 99 for 4, but de Silva and Dinesh Chandimal stitched together a 60-run partnership that helped get Sri Lanka's innings back on track.",
    "And just when the momentum appeared to swinging back in Sri Lanka's favour, Chandimal picked out the fielder at short midwicket, to undo the hard work that he and de Silva had put in.",
    "Sadeera Samarawickrama fell 16 runs later, with the total on 175, and if not for an innings-best 76-run partnership between de Silva and Ramesh Mendis, Sri Lanka would well and truly have been out of the contest.",
    "De Silva appeared on course for another century, but egded Shaneen Shah Afridi behind, dismissed for an important 82.",
    "The innings was wrapped soon after, with spinners Abrar Ahmed and Noman Ali taking three wickets each, and Shaheen Shah Afridi and Agha Salman both picking up brace.\u00a0 (Pix: Pradeep Dilrukshana)"
