  "original_body_lines": [
    "Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party\u2019s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.",
    "A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.",
    "With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump\u2019s vision for the country.",
    "The incoming president has promised to carry out the country\u2019s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government\u2019s most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.",
    "When Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority. Not this time.",
    "When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed.",
    "Trump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election.",
    "\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u2019\u201d Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response.",
    "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trump\u2019s endorsement won the Republican Conference\u2019s nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a \u201cblowtorch\u201d to the federal government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an \u201cambitious\u201d 100-day agenda.",
    "\u201cRepublicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,\u201d Johnson said earlier this week. \u201cThe American people want us to implement and deliver that \u2018America First\u2019 agenda.\u201d",
    "Trump\u2019s allies in the House are already signaling they will seek retribution for the legal troubles Trump faced while out of office. The incoming president on Wednesday said he would nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fierce loyalist, for attorney general.",
    "Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has said GOP lawmakers are \u201cnot taking anything off the table\u201d in their plans to investigate Special counsel Jack Smith, even as Smith is winding down two federal investigations into Trump for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
    "Still, with a few races still uncalled the Republicans may hold the majority by just a few seats as the new Congress begins. Trump\u2019s decision to pull from the House for posts in his administration \u2014 Reps. Gaetz, Mike Waltz and Elise Stefanik so far \u2014 could complicate Johnson\u2019s ability to maintain a majority in the early days of the new Congress.",
    "Gaetz submitted his resignation Wednesday, effective immediately. Johnson said he hoped the seat could be filled by the time the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. Replacements for members of the House require special elections, and the congressional districts held by the three departing members have been held by Republicans for years.",
    "With the thin majority, a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed. The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson \u2014 at times with Trump\u2019s help \u2014 largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump\u2019s election victory.",
    "The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay onboard for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies.",
    "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of its election losses.",
    "In the Senate, GOP leaders, fresh off winning a convincing majority, are already working with Trump to confirm his Cabinet picks. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota won an internal election Wednesday to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history.",
    "Thune in the past has been critical of Trump, but praised the incoming president during his leadership election bid.",
    "\u201cThis Republican team is united. We are on one team,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
    "The GOP\u2019s Senate majority of 53 seats also ensures that Republicans will have breathing room when it comes to confirming Cabinet posts, or Supreme Court justices if there is a vacancy. Not all those confirmations are guaranteed. Republicans were incredulous Wednesday when the news hit Capitol Hill that Trump would nominate Gaetz as his attorney general. Even close Trump allies in the Senate distanced themselves from supporting Gaetz, who had been facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
    "Still, Trump on Sunday demanded that any Republican leader must allow him to make administration appointments without a vote while the Senate is in recess. Such a move would be a notable shift in power away from the Senate, yet all the leadership contenders quickly agreed to the idea. Democrats could potentially fight such a maneuver.",
    "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s social media supporters, including Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, clamored against picking a traditional Republican to lead the Senate chamber. Thune worked as a top lieutenant to McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d in his private notes.",
    "However, McConnell made it clear that on Capitol Hill the days of Republican resistance to Trump are over."
