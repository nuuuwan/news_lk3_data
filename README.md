More than 1,300 faithful died during the Hajj pilgrimage, which took place amid intense heat, and most of the deceased did not have official permits, Saudi Arabia said on Sunday.

Based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries’ responses, an AFP tally last week put the toll at more than 1,100.

The dead came from more than 10 countries stretching from the United States to Indonesia, and some governments are continuing to update their totals.

Arab diplomats said last week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths — 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.

The diplomats said the cause of death in most cases was heat-related.
