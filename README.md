*2024-10-19 00:47:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/196620) · `ta`

### 2024-10-18 (Friday)

### How important was India’s help to Sri Lanka in 2022?

*2024-10-18 23:42:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-important-was-India-s-help-to-Sri-Lanka-in-2022/4-768162) · `en`

India’s help was significant at a crucial time as Sri Lanka was going through a nightmarish

The IMF program is to give Sri Lanka $ 3 billion over four years with conditions. India gave $ 4 billion in one year to Sri Lanka with no conditions. Also, the timing is important to note. The IMF program came in 2023 when Sri Lanka had stabilised to a large extent under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also, most of the toughest policies that were needed for Sri Lanka to achieve macroeconomic stability were already put in place by the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe when the IMF program was approved. But India came to Sri Lanka’s aid when Sri Lanka was staring at the abyss with a Government that was behaving very irrationally in January 2022 with the country facing macroeconomic instability. This point should not be forgotten by the Sri Lankan public

### Towards a climate-smart tourism sector: Building resilience through financial instruments

*2024-10-18 23:33:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Towards-a-climate-smart-tourism-sector-Building-resilience-through-financial-instruments/4-768154) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector holds great economic and social importance, but it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change

The tourism sector is an important pillar of Sri Lanka’s economy, providing income and employment for more than 400,000 people directly and indirectly across areas such as hospitality, transportation, and retail. However, like many other sectors, it is facing serious challenges and risks connected to climate change, necessitating a transformation towards sustainability and resilience.

Innovative financial instruments and risk transfer solutions could play an important part in enhancing the sector’s capacity to withstand climate-related shocks, recover from losses and damages, and adapt to long-term climatic changes. If Sri Lanka can pioneer new business models and creative risk management tools, it could help communities, entrepreneurs, tourism companies, and other stakeholders to turn the country into a more vibrant, resilient, and prosperous destination.

### In appreciation of Professor Kumar David

Professor Kumar David, once an academic in the Engineering Faculty, Peradeniya University, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in the UK and Hong Kong has left for eternal rest, last Monday while in Los Angeles, USA. We believe the “left” leaning English reader would miss Kumar’s forays into political controversies, with his own reading of issues that often provided dissenting, but populist perspectives, he developed over the decades since leaving the NSSP in 1980 July. Politically, he was advocating for “unity in the scattered left”.

Professionally too, he stood out as an exceptional, pragmatic thinker and was accepted for that. We believe he still remains the youngest to be appointed to the Director Board of the CEB way back in 1970, perhaps after the change of government in July. Kumar would not have been 30 years then. He was also a strong critic of the Mahaweli Development power generation scheme in 1979, when the blueprint was out for academic observation.

New Zealand qualifies for T20 Women's World Cup final after defeating West Indies by 8 runs. They'll face South Africa on Sunday.

🟩

B.I. West Indies women defeated by 8 runs and qualify for the final of the T20 Women's World Cup final.. West Indies Women's team passed today (18).

The competition was held in Sajah as the second semi-final in the United Arab Emirates.

In response to 129 runs in New Zealand, West Indies were able to score only 120 runs in the 20 overs.

Batting first, New Zealand women's group scored 128 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in their 20 overs.

New Zealand, with the highest number of experience in the International T20 Women's cricket, qualified for the semi-finals.

Despite these occasions, they were allowed to play the final, but they had to be satisfied with the runners-up in two.

West Indies also played a semi-final match of the Twenty20 Women Cup.

However, they were able to play the final at the tournament held in India in 2016.

It was once defeated by the strong Australian group and crowned World Champions.

New Zealand will be held on Sunday (20) between New Zealand and South Africa.

Here's a 200-character summary:



Political parties use Ampara as transit camp - Chandranayagam



Former MP Chandranayagam stated political parties use Ampara as transit camp. He criticized current political situation in Ampara, saying it affects people without considering their opinions. Parties now select candidates based on money rather than public input. This approach is unhealthy for democracy.

🟩

அரசியல் கட்சிகள் அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தினை ஒரு இடைத்தங்கல் முகாமாக பயன்படுத்துவதாக முன்னாள் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் சந்திரநேரு சந்திரகாந்தன் தெரிவித்தார்.

He made the above statement at a media briefing in Tirukovil.

The Ampara district has been affected by the current contemporary politically, like a slave on all sides.

அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தில் சமகால அரசியல் போக்கானது மக்கள் கருத்து இல்லாமல் அரசியல் கட்சிகள் தாமாக சிந்தித்து செயற்படுகின்றது.

ஆரம்பத்தில் தேர்தல் கேட்பது என்றால் பிரதேச புத்திஜீவிகள், அதிபர்கள் , இளைஞர்கள், ஆலய அறங்காவலர்கள் என மக்களின் கருத்து கேட்டதன் பின்னரே வேட்பாளர்கள் அரசியல் கட்சிகளில் நியமிக்கப்படுவர்.

ஆனால் இப்போது யார் வேண்டுமானாலும் தேர்தல் கேட்கலாம் என்று புதிய கோட்பாடு அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தை பெறுத்த மட்டில் உருவாகியுள்ளது.

தேர்தல் காலத்தில் மாத்திரமே அரசியல் கட்சிகளின் வரவு அம்பாறை மாவட்டத்தில் காணப்படுகின்றது தமிழ் கட்சிகள் அனைத்தும் ஒன்றிணைந்து ஒரு வேட்பாளரை முன் நிறுத்தி குறித்த வேட்பாளருக்கு களம் அமைத்து வெற்றி பெற வைக்க வேண்டும்.

The Yars, which can be deployed in silos or mounted on mobile launchers, has a range of up to 11,000 km (6,835 miles) and is capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads.

Russia has carried out a series of nuclear drills this year in what security analysts say are signals intended to deter the West from intervening more deeply in the war in Ukraine.

The latest one is taking place in the same week that NATO conducted its annual nuclear exercise and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy unveiled his “victory plan“.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that Moscow had extended the list of scenarios that could prompt it to use nuclear weapons, effectively lowering the threshold for their use. Ukraine accused Moscow of nuclear blackmail.

The Palestinian people have pledged that the war against Israel will continue, despite the killing of Yahya Sinwar.

The Palestinians in Khan Unis, who have been destroyed by the destruction war, are sure to continue the war, but the BBC reports that the war will continue.

Dr. Ramadan Paris said the Palestinian people did not carry out this war with confidence in any leader or officer.

He said that this is much greater than Yahya Sinwar, the destruction war and the issue against the Palestinian people.

Israel is not just destroying us, he wants to destroy the entire Middle East.

He said the war between us and the Jews has been going on since 1919 for over 100 years.

I do not think that Sinwar's death will affect Hamas.

### CEB clarified about fueling thermal power plants

*2024-10-18 15:32:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/202314) · `si`

Here's a 200-character summary:



CEB clarifies fuel supply for thermal power plants. Uses HFO (5.8%), naphtha (1.9%), diesel (1.1%) for electricity generation. Diesel purchase via CPC at fixed price due to lack of competitive bids. CEB considers diesel uneconomical but uses temporarily to meet demand until other power plants restored.

🟩

The Ceylon Electricity Board has issued a special announcement on supplying fuel to thermal power plants.

It states that some recent newsletters are expected to explain the word 'fuel'.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (Ceylon Electricity Board) is also used to generate three types of fuel to generate electricity.

* Receipt oil (HFO) - 715.3 GWh (5.8% of total electricity production) in 2024

* Napatha (Naphatha) - 235.5 GWH (1.9% of the total electric production) in 2024

* Diesel (Diesel) - 133.1 GWH (1.1% of total electric production) in 2024

Both credits (HFO) and Naupta (Naphatha) are bypace on the oil refinery.

Since there is no other supplier, the Ceylon Electricity Board is purchased by CPC from an anciently agreed price.

Competitive bidding is diesel, and some of them have recently commenced their business for diesel.

However, even under the management of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Diesel has not purchased competitive bids for electricity generation.

### Sri Lanka’s Kotagala Plantations downgraded three steps to CCC(lka) after wage hike

*2024-10-18 11:38:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-kotagala-plantations-downgraded-three-steps-to-ccclka-after-wage-hike-184121/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka’s Kotagala Plantations by three levels to ‘CCC(lka)’ from ‘B+(lka)’ and its listed unsecured debentures four steps to CCC-(lka) after a state driven wage hike.

“We expect the statutory increase in labour costs effective September 2024 to dampen free cash flow (FCF), leading to a high likelihood that Kotagala will amend or extend the terms of its debt facilities as they fall due over the next two years,” Fitch Ratings said.

“We are likely to consider such transactions to be distressed debt-exchanges under our rating criteria, as they would significantly reduce the contract terms and allow the issuer to avoid a probable default.

“This would lead to a downgrade of the National Long-Term Rating to ‘C(lka)’ or ‘RD(lka)’ (restricted default).”

Margins will be hit by depressed plantation yields, due to labour shortages and ageing crops, Fitch said.

### Egg traders urge govt to implement pricing formula

*2024-10-18 11:18:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102777/egg-traders-urge-govt-to-implement-pricing-formula-) · `en`

The All Ceylon Egg Traders’ Association has called on the government to introduce a pricing formula to stabilize the price of eggs in the market.

The Secretary of the association Anura Marasinghe stated that it costs less than Rs. 25 to produce an egg, making it feasible to sell them at a price of Rs. 35 per egg.

“The issue of escalating egg prices remains unresolved, with current market rates ranging from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 per egg. We urge the government to appoint a committee and establish a transparent pricing formula,” Mr. Marasinghe said.

He further noted that the actual production cost of an egg is between Rs. 20 and Rs. 23, while farm-gate prices currently stand at around Rs. 30.

The association believes a pricing mechanism would benefit both producers and consumers, ensuring fair pricing across the board.
