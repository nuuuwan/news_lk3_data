    "Wanindu Hasaranga, who was on course for a world record fourth consecutive five wicket haul was unfortunate to miss out on the feat, finishing with 2 for 42 in six overs.",
    "Maheesh Theekshana ended with figures of 3 for 41 in 10 overs.",
    "Sri Lanka had Scotland on the ropes early in their innings, and plugged away to have the Scots on 100 for 8 in the 22nd over.",
    "A fighting 55-run partnership from Chris Greaves and Chris Sole would have caused some unease for the Sri Lankan bowlers, but that resistence was ended seven overs later, when Sole was run out.",
