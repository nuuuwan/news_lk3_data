    "Speaking on the matter, the lawmaker said the current government has done away with this arbitrary provision of subsidies which had been in place for at least 25 years, while admitting that the newly-introduced welfare scheme \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 is not without its own flaws.",
    "Semasinghe said the government would work to eliminate these shortcomings in the future, adding that the most deserving groups of people would be provided with more welfare benefits.",
