    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Presiednt Ranil Wickremesinghe does not want to create an election mentality earlier than the declaration by Election Commission amid the current reforms to strengthen a battered economy, State Media Minister Shantha Bandara said.",
    "Election Commission (EC) officials have said a presidential election is likely to be held between September 18 and October 18 this year as per the island nation\u2019s constitution.",
    "President Wickremesinghe is expected to contest in a common alliance with the backing of some opposition party strongmen. However, he has not declared his candidacy yet.",
    "\u201cWe still have not given a major focus on the elections. The reason is because there are several months remaining before the election,\u201d Bandara told reporters at a media briefing on Tuesday (08).",
    "\u201cPresident and we expect to take the current (reform) program as it is without creating an election mentality,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka has a history of slippage of IMF-led reform programs during elections as political parties attempt to woo the voters without any strong policies. Providing subsidies and promising welfare have been the key pledges by politicians during any elections.",
    "Sri Lankan voters are not used to vote for policies of political parties. Instead, they vote for anybody who promises more benefits for them.",
    "However, Sri Lanka is unable to afford such election promises after its unprecedented economic crisis with sovereign debt default in 2022.",
    "The IMF has strongly advised to continue the current reforms despite an election.",
    "Bandara said if the President can continue the reforms until the elections are declared, the country \u201cwould be more strengthened economically\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe Election Commission will declare the election when the time comes. At that time, we will come forward for the election.\u201d (Colombo/April 10/2023)"
