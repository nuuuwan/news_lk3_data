### Use of smoke-emitting firecrackers renews air pollution debate in India’s capital ahead of Diwali

As India gears up for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, people are divided over whether they should celebrate by setting off firecrackers, which worsen the country’s chronic air pollution.

Diwali, which will be celebrated Thursday, is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many Indians light earthen oil lamps or candles. But every year the festivities are tinged with worries over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can takes days to clear.

The capital, New Delhi, which is among India’s worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali. Authorities there and in some other states have banned the use and sale of firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for more sustainable options like environmentally friendly firecrackers and light shows, but the rule is often flouted. Firecrackers can be easily bought from roadside stalls and stores.

### Anurakumara Dissanayake and the creation of the national people's power

*2024-10-31 13:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197579) · `ta`

Based on the detailed historical and political analysis provided, here are the key points regarding the JVP and its evolution:



1. The JVP initially pursued revolutionary violence but shifted towards democratic methods after the armed conflicts in 1971 and 1988-90.



2. In the 2015 parliamentary election, the JVP received 543,944 votes (4.8%) and won six seats.



3. The party contested alone in 2015 instead of joining an opposition coalition.



4. In the 2018 local government elections, the JVP received 693,875 votes (6.27%) but failed to capture any councils.



5. The JVP formed the National People's Power alliance in 2019, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.



6. In the 2019 presidential election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake received 418,563 votes (3.15%) as the National People's Power candidate.



7. In the 2020 parliamentary election, the National People's Power received 445,958 votes (3.84%), winning three seats.



8. Despite efforts to increase its vote bank, the JVP has struggled to overcome its status as the third political power in Sri Lanka.



9. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been instrumental in changing the electoral strategy and enriching his political image within the party.



10. The JVP continues to maintain its independence and does not want to form coalitions or alliances with other parties, preferring to lead as an equal partner.



The analysis suggests that while the JVP has made some progress in recent years, it still faces challenges in increasing its vote share and electoral performance compared to the major political parties in Sri Lanka.

🟩

This is the fourth part of my article on Sri Lanka's new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

In the first part, I wrote about his gradual development in the second part of the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the second part and his rise to the JVP leadership in the third part.

The JVP led by Dissanayake in this fourth part. Let me explain how the national people's power was transformed into a party.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is an important day on February 2, 2014. It was on that day that the 17th National Conference of the JVP was held.

The change in the leadership of the party was the best of the conference. Somawansa Amarasinghe, who has been the leader of the JVP for 24 years, took over.

Anura or AKD. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, popularly known, arrived as the new leader of the JVP.

It was generally revealed before the conference that Somawansa is going to retire from the post of Chairman.

### Spain battles deadliest flood disaster in decades as death toll rises to 95

*2024-10-31 07:55:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/103051/spain-battles-deadliest-flood-disaster-in-decades-as-death-toll-rises-to-95) · `en`

Spain is enduring its worst flooding disaster in decades, with at least 95 people dead and dozens more missing, after huge rains swept the eastern province of Valencia and beyond.

Torrential rain on Tuesday triggered flash floods which swept away bridges and buildings and forced people to climb on to roofs or cling to trees to survive.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has declared three days of national mourning as the extreme conditions continue, restricting some rescue efforts.

The death toll is feared to climb as “there are many missing people”, the government says.

At least 92 deaths were recorded in Valencia, with another two in Castilla-La Mancha to Valencia’s west and one in Málaga - a 71-year-old British man who died in hospital after being rescued from his home.

The flooding death toll is the country’s worst since 1973, when at least 150 people were estimated to have died in the nation’s worst-ever floods in the south-east.

*2024-10-31 03:04:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-ISB-restructure-Debt-trap-backed-by-IMF-and-Ceylon-Chamber-of-Commerce/4-768633) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s debt crisis is a stark example of the destructive power of predatory lending

The current NPP administration has agreed to implement a new variant of the same corrupt deal which merely reduces the weighted coupon rate of interest of bonds from 8.1% to 6.5% from 2028 onwards reducing total payments by $ 1 billion. The new Government must reject this destructive path and prioritise people’s interests. It is evident that the Sri Lankan Government’s actions have been influenced by corrupt interests. The cosy relationship between the Government and international creditors raises serious questions about transparency and accountability. The new administration must break free from this destructive path and prioritise the well-being of the Sri Lankan people

### Irrational behaviour of RW and MR vs. rational behaviour of President AKD

*2024-10-31 02:51:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Irrational-behaviour-of-RW-and-MR-vs-rational-behaviour-of-President-AKD/4-768632) · `en`

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President RW will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behaviour can be compared with the rational behaviour of President AKD. Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost

Given the parliamentary election on 14 November 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

🟩

Accordingly, an alleged war between the former President and the present Prime Minister insists that there is growing.

Speaking at a public meeting in Padukka, Amarasuriya expressed his views that the salaries of public servants increased by the false promise of "a false promise."

"Now Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to increase the salaries of public servants, but the decision of the Cabinet decision at the Cabinet discussion is not approved by the Treasury or the Treasury.. The decision was made, but the decision was taken to make the decision to be implemented, but not done. What does that mean then?Clearly, it is a false promise in the election period, to mislead the people. "

### The President's Diwali greeting news

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake greets Hindus on Diwali, emphasizing change and unity. He calls for celebrating the festival as a symbol of hope and progress, urging Sri Lankans to work towards eliminating injustice and promoting cultural diversity.

🟩

In his Diwali greeting, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that we have initiated the era of change of public expectations.

The Diwali festival is celebrated by Hindu devotees in the world to mark the light of darkness.

The Sri Lankan people who have been searching for light from the dark after independence are now carrying new expectations. This is the many years expectation of the people. We have begun the age of change of the expectations of the public who have been paralyzed by the rulers of Sri Lanka for so many days.

There are many reasons for the Diwali celebration. The festival is celebrated to commemorate the return of Ayodhya and destroy Krishna Narakasura after the 14 -year wilderness.

I urge the people to celebrate the Diwali festival this time that the new revolution will lead to the new revolution by carrying torches in the tone of the light of the conscience.

We extend their hands for honor, acceptance and brotherhood, in order to enrich the beauty of cultural diversity.

### Examining Elpitiya, Israeli-Zionist beachheads, Anura’s inaction and Prabhakaran’s profile

*2024-10-31 01:50:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Examining-Elpitiya-Israeli-Zionist-beachheads-Anura-s-inaction-and-Prabhakaran-s-profile/4-768630) · `en`

On the campaign trail, President AKD followed-up his memorable line “I hear talk in certain places about an Opposition. An Opposition? No. What we need now is a powerful Government!” with a no less memorable and ominous one: “They think this government will be short-lived but I’m telling you this Government will step down only after having rebuilt the entire country!”

He should have said “this government will step down only if you decide it should at a national election”.

Meanwhile senior JVP member and NPP candidate Samantha Waidyaratna reassured his audience and the nation on TV news that “the incoming Government will last an aeon (‘kalpayak’)”.

Elpitiya was a legendary JVP stronghold during the April 1971 insurrection and thereafter. Therefore, last week’s Elpitiya PS election weeks after Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s presidential victory, illuminates greatly.

The JVP-NPP has shrunk slightly (47%) in comparison with its Elpitiya vote in September (49%).
