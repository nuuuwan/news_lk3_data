    "Government politicians are taking great pains to have the public believe that they have not misused state funds for private purposes. The Opposition says it is convinced otherwise. It argues that since the government claims that expenses the state had to bear during an \u2018unofficial\u2019 leg of an overseas tour of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in 2023, amounted to a misuse of state funds, a ride his successor, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, took in a state-owned helicopter, accompanied by his security detail, in December 2024, to visit his mother in hospital, in Anuradhapura, should also be considered an instance of misuse of state funds. Minister of Foreign Affairs Vijitha Herath has disputed the Opposition\u2019s claim, insisting that Wickremesinghe\u2019s overseas visit cannot be compared to Dissanayake\u2019s domestic travel to see his ailing mother. JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva has dared the Opposition to take the issue to court, if it can. The Opposition says it is planning to do so after forming a government.",
    "Unfortunately, the ongoing political slugfest between the government and the Opposition over instances of misuse of state funds has got down and dirty, and their propagandists are guided by Rafferty\u2019s rules in hurling insults at prominent figures on either side of the political divide. They have not spared even the family members of the politicians they attack.",
    "Nobody made an issue of how President Dissanayake travelled to visit his mother in hospital. Sri Lankans cherish family bonds and affection. In fact, many praised the President for being a caring son and rushing to Anuradhapura to see his ailing mother despite his busy schedule. But that particular hospital visit has become an issue because the NPP government has rigidly demarcated the Head of State\u2019s official duties and private affairs; it also caused the arrest of Wickremesinghe over expenses related to his 2023 visit to a British university to attend an event where his wife, who is courageously facing a life-limiting illness, was awarded an honorary doctorate. Wickremesinghe has said his London visit was part of his official programme, and he attended the aforesaid function as the President of Sri Lanka. Going by the NPP\u2019s argument in support of legal action instituted against Wickremesinghe, the act of using state resources for private purposes, either overseas or here, should be considered an offence, regardless of the amounts of funds spent. Hereafter, all government politicians and state officials will have to live under the microscope, and anything that can be construed as a misuse of state resources for private purposes will be used against them when the NPP is voted out of office.",
    "The NPP came to power promising to dismantle the old system, which it called a curse, pave the way for a new political culture and practise austerity. It said its leaders would share in the hardships of the public. Minister Sunil Handunnetti declared in a television interview, before last year\u2019s elections, that all NPP MPs, including ministers, would use the same mode of transport as the ordinary people, and refrain from enjoying anything that was not available to the public. He told the interviewer to keep the video of the interview and use it against the NPP government to be formed in case the NPP leaders did not honour that pledge. That video is now doing the rounds in the digital space! The NPP also pledged to do away with all VVIP security outfits. Those promises remain unfulfilled.",
    "The only difference one sees today, according to the Opposition, is that the VVIP security convoys avoid moving in a single file; instead, vehicles zing in groups of fours and fives, separated by short gaps to make it difficult for the public to keep count of them. Dissanayake, as an Opposition MP, used to question the wisdom of deploying two helicopters whenever the President flew; he kept asking whether, in case of an emergency, the President could jump to the other chopper in midair. Audiences at the NPP\u2019s election rallies erupted into thunderous applause when he made such statements, and the people voted for the NPP overwhelmingly, expecting, among other things, an end to politicians\u2019 whirlybird rides at their expense.",
    "Now that the government has declared that it is a criminal offence for state resources to be used for private purposes, it must ensure that all politicians, representing both the NPP and the Opposition, do not use their official vehicles and security details during their election campaigns.They must be asked to hire private security personnel and use their own vehicles for electioneering and for their private travel. That is the least they can do to assuage the seething anger of the ordinary people who undergo the daily ordeal of travelling in heaving hulks\u2014packed buses and trains.",
