### Govt. revenue in January surge 62% on economic turnaround, higher taxes

*2024-05-20 03:50:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Govt-revenue-in-January-surge-62-on-economic-turnaround-higher-taxes/108-282928) · `en`

The revenue to the government, including the grants, rose by a staggering 61.8 percent in January 2024. This is a result of the government raking in billions of rupees out of people’s pockets to appease the International Monetary Fund’s revenue targets.

The government revenues and grants for January were Rs.283.19 billion, out of which Rs.257.57 billion was raised via taxes. This was 63.8 percent higher from the same period last year.

The staggering increase in the tax revenues in January compared to the same month in 2023 was predominantly due to the recovering economy which was supported further by the 3 percent increase in the value added tax rate from January 1, 2024 onwards.

Between then and now, there wasn’t a single other tax imposed or raised except for the value added tax, and hence the bulk of the growth in tax income came from the recovering economy due to the normalising foreign currency inflows.

*2024-05-20 02:49:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183989) · `ta`

It seems like you've shared a detailed perspective on the political and social dynamics surrounding the Tamil people's relationship with the Sri Lankan state, focusing on issues of rights, representation, and the impact of electoral processes on their struggle for recognition and autonomy. Your message highlights several key points:

2. **Compromise and Negotiation**: The call for the Sri Lankan government to engage in meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the Tamil people to address their grievances and concerns.



3. **Rejection of Sinhala Buddhist Hegemony**: The rejection of policies and structures that marginalize the Tamil people and promote Sinhala Buddhist dominance.



4. **International Recognition and Support**: The importance of international community involvement and support in addressing the Tamil people's plight.



5. **Historical and Current Injustices**: A recounting of historical injustices faced by the Tamil people, including forced displacement, denial of resettlement rights, and the lack of accountability for human rights abuses.



6. **Political Aspirations and Solutions**: The emphasis on self-determination, federalism, and the right to a political solution that recognizes the Tamil people's sovereignty and identity.

8. **Call for Unity and Collective Action**: The appeal for the Tamil people to unite and exert collective pressure through peaceful means to achieve their political and social objectives.

If you have specific questions or need assistance with a particular aspect of this topic, please let me know how I can assist you further.

🟩

The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) has called for a complete boycott until the unity of the Sri Lankan presidential election will be eliminated and the federal guarantee is granted.

The party said in a clarification report on the presidential election titled 'We will be thinking of the welfare of Tamil Nadu'.

In the Tamil nation, the Tamil Nadu state is acting as an enemy of the Tamil nation by continuing the Sinhala Buddhistization, militarization and systematic ethnic process through the construction of the ethnic groups.. The Sri Lankan government, which considers the Tamils to cause any crisis as long as the majority representation within the unity state structure is in their hands, is maintaining the interests of the Sinhalese nation, not considering the Tamil people as its enemies.

It is high time for Sri Lanka to break free from the shackles of corrupt political culture that prioritises personal gain over public welfare

In the bustling chambers of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, a disheartening spectacle unfolds with disturbing regularity – elected officials engaged not in constructive debate for the betterment of the nation, but in heated exchanges and even physical altercations. Yet, behind the façade of discord lies a disconcerting unity among MPs when it comes to safeguarding their own interests and privileges, even at the expense of the struggling populace.

In a country where rap is illegal, Toomaj chose rap to challenge Iran’s hardline regime

In a country where rap is illegal, Toomaj chose rap to challenge Iran’s hardline regime which doesn’t tolerate dissent. Now he’s facing the death penalty for refusing to back down.

This is part of a terrifying crackdown on the “Women, Life, Freedom” protests that have swept through the entire country since the killing of Jina Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman arrested in 2022 for  not covering her head properly. She died in police custody three days later, and was posthumously awarded the 2023 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The prize was shared between her and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in Iran.

People all around the world are calling for Toomaj’s release. In Iran,  he’s become a national hero for all those who continue to resist the regime at great personal risks.

In its report on accountability for enforced disappearances in our country, the OHCHR has suggested enhancing the capabilities of the Office on Missing Persons ensuring thorough investigation into mass graves and the prosecution of those responsible for these crimes.

From the early 1970s our country has faced three armed uprisings -the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) insurgency of 1971, the near three-decade ethnic war of 1983 and the JVP uprising in 1989.

According to the World Bank, our manufacturing industry was responsible for 25% of Sri Lanka’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023

Just 6,000 industrial entities account for 93% of the industrial electricity

The CEA is now working to change the application process so that companies will be required to provide greenhouse gas-related data

Some industrial sectors are making changes to adopt renewable technologies

Of the 70,000 industrial entities supplied by the CEB, 350 consume 42% of all industry sector electricity

To change something, first you have to understand it. But unless you fully understand what you are trying to change, you will be moving forward with your eyes closed. You will be struggling to understand the situation as you will be feeling your surroundings in the dark.

The worm’s eye will show us how people behave differently in response to challenges posed to them by changing circumstances. Those pure black or white people we have seen through a bird’s eye will suddenly disappear and, instead, appear as a mixture of blackness and whiteness making it almost impossible to pass any clear judgment. On one occasion, they are pure white but commences a process of transformation that ends finally in pure blackness

The 683lb cluster is owned by a Sri Lankan gem dealer who wants to cash in his asset to fund his financial security and lifestyle.

James Constantinou, who became a hit on the Channel 4 series ‘Posh Pawn’, will be brokering the giant sapphire, known as the Queen of Asia, to his high profile global connections.

“I deal with a lot of rare and luxurious goods, but this might be my greatest endeavour yet,’ said Constantinou, who runs Prestige Pawnbrokers, which has eight branches around the country. “It is an investment opportunity for the seller and prospective buyers will include collectors of rare and exotic stones or institutions that want to display it in museums or galleries. It has certainly caused a stir as it is not every day you get such a massive gemstone coming onto the open market.”

### ‘A Death In An Antique Shop’: Challenge To Our Cognitive Capacity?

Asoka Handagama is notorious for challenging our cognitive capacity through his artwork, be it through poetry, fiction, stage drama, teledrama, or movies. His newest stage drama, ‘A Death in an Antique Shop’, is the best, or worst in some sense, in this tradition. You can watch it not on stage but on YouTube.

In many respects, watching the drama on YouTube is better than doing it in a theatre-environment. First, it is free from the attention deficiency which we will face in a theatre. As Salman Khan, creator of the Khan Academy, has told us in his autobiographical professional experience, The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined, we can keep attention to a single object continuously not more than for about seven minutes; beyond that, we lose focus on the object. In a theatre where we sit for hours in an uncomfortable posture, it is certainly not possible to pay full attention to what is being unfolded on the stage for the whole duration of the drama.

“If a child can’t learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn.” Ignacio Estrada. This is a quote that is lost on the Sri Lankan education system but bamboo rods and beatings still remain as the number one tool to teach. Contrary to our cultural beliefs, this method is the least effective way to teach and it’s particularly detrimental when it comes to children with learning disorders.

Take Dyslexia, for example, a disorder identified 130 years ago by ophthalmologist Rudolf Berlin. People with Dyslexia have difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and their relation to words and letters (University of Oxford , n.d.). Simply put, these are the children who struggle to read and write and saying “Idiot, open your eyes and read what’s on the page. For every spelling mistake, I will give you a beating with a ruler,” will not cure their dyslexia.

### BOI concerned over proposed Economic Transformation Bill

Colombo, May 19 -  The Sri Lanka All Union Alliance of the Board of Investment (BOI) has issued a stark warning against the proposed Economic Transformation Bill, set to be submitted to Parliament on May 22.

The alliance cautions that the Bill will severely destabilize the investment sector, which is already grappling with economic challenges.

According to the coalition, the Bill caters to a select few individuals without consulting field experts or investors. This could prompt the departure of existing investors, further jeopardizing the sector.

The alliance calls for a transparent revision of the Bill, involving affected parties and economic experts.

While proponents claim the act will drive significant economic transformation, the alliance argues that its true aim is to secure financial gains by transferring 15 profitable investment zones under BOI control to private associates before upcoming elections.
