### Japan PM says Palestine state recognition ‘when not if’

*2025-09-24 16:35:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/112865/japan-pm-says-palestine-state-recognition-when-not-if) · `en`

Japan’s prime minister told the United Nations on Tuesday (Sep 23) that Tokyo’s recognition of the State of Palestine was only a question of time, saying he was “indignant” at recent comments by Israeli officials.

Nearly 80 per cent of UN members recognise the State of Palestine, with a string of countries including Britain, Canada and France adding their names this week after nearly two years of war in Gaza.

“I feel strongly indignant at the statements made by senior Israeli government officials that appear to categorically reject the very notion of Palestinian state-building,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.

“For our country, the question is not whether to recognise a Palestinian state, but when. The continued unilateral actions by the government of Israel can never be accepted,” he said.

“I must state clearly that if further actions are taken that obstruct the realisation of a two-state solution, Japan will be compelled to take new measures in response,” he added.

A Singapore-registered ship’s Sri Lanka agent paid US$1 million out of US$1 billion damages awarded for causing the island’s worst pollution, a litigant told AFP on Wednesday (Sep 24).

A petitioner who brought action against the MV X-Press Pearl, which sank off Colombo Port in June 2021, said he had been officially informed of the payment.

“I was given a copy of the affidavit of Sea Consortium (to the court) after it paid 300 million rupees (US$1 million) to the Treasury,” environmental activist Hemantha Withanage told AFP.

“They have done this because the court held them responsible for any non-compliance by the Singapore owners.”

### Asia-Pacific issuers to have bumpy ride as trade strains hit: S&P Global Ratings report

*2025-09-24 14:29:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/asia-pacific-issuers-to-have-bumpy-ride-as-trade-strains-hit-sp-global-ratings-report-241756/) · `en`

SINGAPORE (S&P Global Ratings) Sept. 24, 2025 — Asia-Pacific’s credit conditions are keeping steady, after strong first-half growth and supportive financing conditions. However, the road ahead looks bumpy. That’s according to a report S&P Global Ratings published today, titled “Credit Conditions Asia-Pacific Q4 2025: On A Jagged Course.”

The “frontloading” of exports and resilient domestic consumption have supported the region’s growth in 2025. However, slower trade will start materializing in fourth-quarter 2025 as effects of tariffs start to unfold. Consequently, we expect Asia-Pacific’s growth to slow to 4.4% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026.

This combined with other risks could lead to reversals in market sanguinity and easy financing conditions.
