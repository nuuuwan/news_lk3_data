### Constitutional dictatorships – OR: is the era and ethos of ‘strongman’  governments gone for good? (1/4)

*2025-10-03 23:42:16* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Constitutional-dictatorships-OR-is-the-era-and-ethos-of-strongman-governments-gone-for-good-1-4/4-782589) · `en`

The citizenry vote for political leaders in the hope that ‘this time’ there will be change for the better

The ethos of Sri Lankan politics is such that political party leaders prefer to nominate candidates who will sweep the polls even if their ethics are questionable. In doing so, it entrenches the patron-client system in which government and citizenry are both complicit in the model of transactional politics whereby “political parties have become election and patronage machines”

It has been a year since a new government voted in by the people of Sri Lanka brought the issue of types of political leadership into the forefront of reflective civics.

In the dark years preceding this unprecedented regime change, the Aragalaya (‘people’s struggle’) critically engaged with a ‘strongman administration’ that promised much but delivered little. It also ended in ignominy despite the hype and hoopla of its apologists.

### Fools, knaves and narratives

*2025-10-03 23:38:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Fools-knaves-and-narratives/4-782587) · `en`

While these countries were transforming their economies rapidly, our ruling elite led us from one crisis to another

By our basic nature, as well as ideology, we cannot claim to be a warrior race. True, there have been violent conflicts in our history, however relative to wars fought by other nations, ours appear more skirmishes than full blown wars. Wars fought against your own racial type, enemies of similar strength and disposition, could distort one’s assessment of the actual fighting prowess of an army

“People don’t want to hear the truth, because they don’t want their illusions destroyed”

Nepal is in flames; murder, arson, rape, looting; the once idyllic Himalayan country is now the picture of every human atrocity. Nature has blessed that land, man had failed it: corruption and incompetence doomed the realm.

A story with an eerily familiar ring to us Sri Lankans, simmering frustrations of a people with nowhere to turn but violence.

### Alcohol and tobacco usage in SL decline, reveal latest surveys

*2025-10-03 23:29:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Alcohol-and-tobacco-usage-in-SL-decline-reveal-latest-surveys/14-782584) · `en`

Despite the overall decline, the survey highlights that young people remain a vulnerable group

Youth say drinking alcohol a purposeless behaviour and smoking a useless behaviour

Despite the positive trend in quitting, the survey emphasises the powerful role of social influence in starting to drink as a significant 46.6% of current consumers reported that their first experience with alcohol was with friends. This finding reveals the critical importance of addressing peer pressure in prevention efforts, especially for young people. Among current drinkers, 18.0% were between the ages of 15 and 21, indicating that a substantial number of young people are still initiating alcohol use. ADIC recommends implementing a national prevention program aimed specifically at children and youth to discourage them from starting in the first place

Alcohol consumption in Sri Lanka has shown a decade-long downward trend, with a new 2024 survey revealing that fewer than 30% of men are current drinkers.
