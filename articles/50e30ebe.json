    "Unilever Sri Lanka and the Industrial Development Board (IDB) signed a three-year memorandum of understanding to uplift SMEs in Sri Lanka. This is a public private partnership between Unilever and the IDB to jointly support the growth and development of 20 Micro Small & Medium Scale entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka every year through the Industrial Development Fund (IDF). The IDF, under the supervision of the Industrial Development Board, and conforming to guidelines of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides financial capital in the form of low interest, repayable loans to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), enabling them to commence or expand local manufacturing in sectors prioritized by the Ministry of Industries to fuel an export-oriented economy. The first batch of loans were handed over to 10 female micro entrepreneurs at the occasion of the International Women\u2019s Day on the 12th of March 2024.",
    "nder this initiative, Unilever will contribute to the IDF, a portion of the revenue generated from its own and ongoing SME upliftment programme, \u201cSaubhagya\u201d, which, over the last 20 years has empowered over 15,000 rural females to start their own door to door selling operations with the provision of an initial stock of Unilever products.",

In this regard, as the government, we are thankful that Unilever has stepped forward to help the local industry.",
