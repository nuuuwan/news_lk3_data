    "These regulations pertain to the temporary suspension of motor vehicle imports into Sri Lanka under the Import and Export (Control) Regulations No. 2 of 2023.",
    "On 1 April, the Cabinet approved a proposal to allow the import of 250 small buses and 750 vans specifically for tourism purposes. To implement this decision, Import and Export (Control) Regulations No. 7 of 2024 has been issued under the Import and Export (Control) Act No. 1 of 1969.",
    "\u201cThese measures are intended to boost the tourism sector by ensuring the availability of adequate transport options while maintaining stringent standards for imports to protect the national interests,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "In addition, the Import and Export Control (Standardisation and Status) Regulations, 2017, were originally enacted to establish standards and conditions for the import of 122 categories of goods classified under 217 HS codes. These regulations aim to protect the national economy, public health, and the environment.",
    "On 11 March, the Cabinet approved new regulations to facilitate prompt, safe, and effective trade transport, and to ensure fair opportunities for both local and non-domestic products. This decision revokes the previous Import and Export Control (Standardisation and Status) Regulations 2017. The new standardisation and quality control regulations under the Import and Export (Control) Act No. 1 of 1969 have been published accordingly."
