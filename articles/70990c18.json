    "Former Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday responded to allegations and defended his efforts to establish the E-8 visa program.",
    "He emphasised that it was intended to create employment opportunities for Sri Lankans. \u201cI personally went and requested these people to provide us with this E-8 visa category. Accordingly, they made arrangements to provide this E-8 visa category to Sri Lanka as well,\u201d he explained. Nanayakkara\u2019s response comes following accusations raised by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) yesterday.",
    "He attributed delays in implementing the program to internal disruptions at the SLBFE, particularly in the weeks leading up to elections. \u201cDue to the behaviour and actions of certain officers of the Bureau, it was finally not implemented. It can be implemented even now. If implemented, it is an opportunity to obtain thousands of new jobs,\u201d he said.",
    "Nanayakkara urged the current administration to revive the scheme, arguing that it could benefit citizens across the country regardless of political affiliation. \u201cWe tell the Government and the Prime Minister \u2013 don\u2019t lose this. It is not the people I chose politically; there are people all over Sri Lanka. Give anyone the opportunity to go abroad,\u201d he appealed."
