    "Charting a new course towards maritime security and economic prosperity, the Sri Lanka National Hydrographic Office (SLNHO) was declared open at the Welisara Naval Complex today (14th December 2023), under the patronage of the State Minister of Defence, Premitha Bandara Tennakoon.",
    "The milestone event was also attended by the Secretary of Defence, General Kamal Gunaratne (Retd), Chief of Defence Staff, General Shavendra Silva, Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera and Chief Hydrographer of the Navy, Commodore Kosala Warnakulasooriya.",
    "Since the colonial era, the hydrographic service in Sri Lanka has been controlled by the Navy and this leadership role has persisted even after the country gained independence.",
    "The first recorded survey by the Royal Ceylon Navy was done in 1962 when the Navy under took hydrographic surveys for the Pulmoddai Mineral Sand Corporation.",
    "As of 1970, the Sri Lanka Navy successfully charted previously unexplored regions of the island waters.",
    "As a result, the Navy accomplished the comprehensive surveying of the Indo-Lanka maritime boundary by 1976. However, by 1983, the naval hydrographic involvement came to a halt due to the conflict situation in the country.",
    "As a member country of International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), Sri Lanka is obliged to regularly adopt and enforce the charters accepted by those organizations regarding safety of navigation and related activities.",
    "Accordingly, the fourth and ninth regulations of Chapter V of international convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) have covered hydrographic survey activities and related services. In its role as a maritime hub, Sri Lanka is expected to ensure safe navigation within its waters by establishing facilities and conducting thorough hydrographic surveys.",
    "Additionally, the country should be responsible for the production and distribution of accurate nautical charts.",
    "The basic criteria for the production and distribution of these nautical charts have been published by IMO and IHO according to the international standards and all member countries must maintain their hydrographic services in accordance with them. For nearly four decades, Sri Lanka has lacked sufficient intervention in addressing this matter.",
    "In response to the Cabinet of Ministers' decisions on 13th December 2022, the Secretary of Defence has been directed to implement necessary measures and it has been emphasized that immediate action should be taken to establish a National Hydrographic Office, comprising qualified hydrographic surveyors.",
    "It is in this backdrop, the newly established office will be tasked with effectively overseeing hydrographic surveyors and hydrographic surveying operations.",
    "It also aims to generate revenue from the maritime sector through direct activities, including the production and sale of nautical charts and to swiftly provide highly reliable navigational charts to the market. This initiative promises both direct economic advantages and indirect gains for the nation.",
    "Historically, despite an annual passage of around 35,000 ships through Sri Lanka's sea routes, the country has remained untapped in terms of potential revenue.",
    "However, by supplying essential navigational charts to these vessels, Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to generate substantial income. Thus, the National Hydrographic Office has taken on the crucial task of replacing outdated maps, which are currently provided by foreign countries. Accordingly, the main objective of the new office is to refresh the existing data with up-to-date information and produce charts that reflect current data.",
    "In addition, the National Hydrographic Office is set to introduce a novel approach that will shape the future of various sectors, including the regulation and secure protection of highly sensitive data which can directly have an impact on the security of the country.",
    "Meanwhile, the event was also attended by the Chief of Staff of the Navy, Rear Admiral Jayantha Kularatne, senior officers from the Navy Headquarters and Western Naval Command, former Chief Hydrographers of the Sri Lanka Navy Hydrographic Service, distinguished invitees, government officials and a group of officers of Sri Lanka Navy Hydrographic Service.",
