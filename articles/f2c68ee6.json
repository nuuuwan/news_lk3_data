    "Geometry Global, a Strategic Business Unit of the Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka, achieved a significant milestone as Sri Lanka\u2019s only agency to be recognised at the prestigious Epica Awards 2024. The agency secured a Bronze in the \u2018Public Interest \u2013 Social Advocacy\u2019 category for its meaningful \u2018Books that Keep on Giving\u2019 campaign for ProMate (Printxcel), a leading stationery manufacturer in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Epica Awards are the only global creative awards judged by journalists from the marketing and communications industry, with the 2024 winners being evaluated in Paris by a jury of editors and media personnel from across Europe and the United States.",
    "Geometry Global\u2019s \u2018Books that Keep on Giving\u2019 initiative for ProMate Sri Lanka addresses the critical social need of supporting visually impaired students\u2019 education amid Sri Lanka\u2019s 300% surge in paper costs. Armed with the insight that over LKR 25 billion worth of paper are discarded annually in the country, the campaign called on the public to donate their used notebooks which were then upcycled for Braille writing. Repurposing the donated notebooks in this manner meant that they offered visually impaired students the same learning opportunities of a brand-new book, making them \u2018Books that Keep on Giving\u2019.",
    "The Bronze award at Epica 2024 builds on Geometry Global\u2019s recent success at the Dragons of Asia 2024, where the Agency clinched the coveted Blue Dragon for the \u2018Best Campaign in Country\u2019 and the Gold in the \u2018Best Cause/Charity Marketing\u2019 category.",
