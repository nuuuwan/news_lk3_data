    "President\u2019s Counsel (LLM International Law (UCL)), former Ambassador to UAE and Israel, President of the Lanka Ambassador\u2019s Forum United Kingdom, Solicitor England and Wales, and Suchithra Withanage (LLM (UK) (LLM (UK) MBA (UK, Reading) LLB (Hons) (UK)) MCIArb (UK) MBCS (UK) MCMI (UK) ACIPR (UK)",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka @ 75: Perils of Complacency in a Fragile Nation,\u2019 penned by President\u2019s Counsel Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya, is a highly educative publication, teeming with profound insights and visionary discernments. In this compilation, Dr. Jayasuriya navigates the labyrinthine corridors of Sri Lanka\u2019s history, celebrating the undulating tapestry of triumphs and tribulations, and beckoning forth an evocative exploration of its future, summoned through the resonant voices of erudite luminaries hailing from diverse fields.",
    "The book is dedicated to two diplomatic luminaries who have left a resounding impact on the annals of Sri Lankan history. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, often hailed as the \u201cFather of the Nation,\u201d represents a beacon of statesmanship, whose devotion to the cause of self-rule was instrumental in guiding Sri Lanka towards emancipation from the clutches of colonial subjugation. His perspicacity in comprehending the intricate fabric of Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic and cultural diversity paved the way for the nation\u2019s unity and independence. Beyond the mantle of Sri Lanka\u2019s inaugural Prime Minister, he remains a symbol of unity, foresight, and statesmanship, an exemplar for future generations to emulate.",
    "The book also extends its tribute to H.E. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the inaugural female President of Sri Lanka, a pioneering figure in the nation\u2019s political panorama. Her tenure, characterized by a remarkable ability to bridge the chasms of ethnicity and politics, served as a beacon of reconciliation and unity in a post-conflict Sri Lanka. Her ceaseless endeavors in nurturing peace, justice, and socio-economic development, resonate as a testament to her commitment to her homeland, leaving a significant imprint on Sri Lankan politics, and earning commendation both domestically and internationally.",
    "Dr. Dushani Weerakoon\u2019s incisive analysis of the nation\u2019s economic development since its inception in 1948 within these pages, replete with invaluable statistics and insights, adds gravitas to the volume. The discerning assessment by the Chief Guest at the book\u2019s inauguration, Hon. Eran Wickremaratne, further underscores the eloquence and significance of the discourse contained therein, affirming its pertinence to the audience. Dr. Harsha Aturupane\u2019s meticulous scrutiny of Sri Lanka\u2019s educational system from 1948 to 2023, while acknowledging its merits, draws attention to its evident shortcomings, beckoning a much-needed reevaluation of this critical facet of national development.",
    "In addition, the essays penned by Dr. Lalani Rajapaksa and Dr. Narada Warnasuriya on the nation\u2019s healthcare sector unearth the challenges posed by drug shortages and inefficiencies stemming from mismanagement. These pressing concerns warrant due consideration by academics and professionals.",
    "The comprehensive exploration of Sri Lanka\u2019s legal system and legal education, as elucidated by Emeritus Professor Savitri Goonesekere, heralds a pertinent discussion in contemporary times. The Lanka Ambassadors\u2019 Forum United Kingdom\u2019s commitment to facilitating this discourse in its forthcoming volume stands as a commendable initiative, underscoring the importance of soliciting intellectual and professional input to fortify the nation\u2019s legal framework. The work of Emeritus Prof. M. Sornarajah on constitutionalism and Dr. Nirmala Chandrahasan\u2019s engrossing exposition on the struggles of the Tamil community for equality offer multifaceted perspectives on historical injustices, governmental involvement, and the ensuing tumultuous period in the nation\u2019s history as well.",
    "Furthermore, Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy\u2019s illuminating treatise on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and its repercussions for the nation\u2019s economy imparts valuable knowledge from a seasoned veteran in the field. In a similar vein, Emeritus Professor Amal Jayawardane\u2019s masterpiece on foreign policy bears the weight of contemporary relevance, deserving expansion to navigate the currents of Sri Lanka\u2019s evolving socio-political landscape, to illuminate the path for professionals, academics, and policymakers.",
    "Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya himself unfurls a profound banner of reflection upon religion, law, and the constitution in his article, inviting contemplation and discourse. Shanti Jayasuriya\u2019s treatise on the \u2018Status of Women in Sri Lanka\u2019 augments this symphony of contemplation with her own musings on equality, being the lady behind the success of Dr. Dayanath\u2019s endeavors. It must also be noted that Kavinda Rathnapala and Malik Cader contribute holistic narratives that delve into the recent turbulence in the political sphere and the intricacies of the stock market, evoking introspection on matters of immediate concern.",
    "In its entirety, Dr. Jayasuriya\u2019s compilation of academia reflects a masterstroke in intellectual pursuit, and a beckoning call for collective educational upliftment of the country. Dr. Dayanath is a frequent contributor to the academic volumes published by the Lanka Ambassadors\u2019 Forum \u2013 United Kingdom, and is poised to be honored with a prestigious award by the Forum in January 2014. We wish him all success and salute the relentless endeavors of this assembly of intellects, ardent in their service to the realm of ideas and contemplations, who have uplifted the scholastic spirit of intellectuals and academics alike.",
