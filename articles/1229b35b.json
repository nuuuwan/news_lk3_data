    "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella has been remanded until 15 February on the orders of Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "The current Environment Minister was produced before Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama this morning (Feb.03).",
    "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested the lawmaker on Friday (Feb.02) in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.",
    "The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.",
    "During today\u2019s court proceedings, Rambukwella was also listed as the 8th suspect in the ongoing case on substandard human immunoglobulin procurement.",
    "Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand.",
    "Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, speaking on behalf of the prosecution today, accused the former health minister of amending the procurement process that governs the import of medicine.",
    "She alleged that Rambukwella had removed the suppliers registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and enabled unregistered suppliers to enter the procurement process.",
    "Presenting to the Magistrate a Cabinet paper previously tabled by Rambukwella, the Deputy Solicitor General pointed out that there was no shortage of human immunoglobulin vaccine at the time when the former health minister sought Cabinet approval to make emergency purchases for a list of certain medicinal drugs.",
    "She also emphasized the fact that no document was uncovered during the investigations to corroborate the need to prepare the Cabinet paper in question.",
    "The lack of such corroborating evidence reportedly prompted concerns within the courthouse.",
    "Responding to a query put forward by the Magistrate, the Deputy Solicitor General mentioned that while recording a statement with the CID yesterday Rambukwella had revealed that the list of medicines was given to him by the Medical Supplies Division (MSD). He had further claimed that the Cabinet memorandum was not prepared by him.",
    "It was further revealed that a staggering amount to the tune of over Rs. 144 million had been paid for the procurement and that the money credited to the account of the first suspect had been withdrawn within just 3 days.",
    "As such, the prosecution argued that Rambukwella\u2019s bail application should be rejected since he has been charged under the Public Property Act.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Anuja Premaratna, representing the accused, said all Cabinet ministers should thus be brought forward for questioning.",
    "He also cast doubts as to how the entire Cabinet of Ministers were misled by a single document.",
    "Commenting on the lost document, the defence counsel, noting that the authorities should \u2018go after\u2019 the person who lost the documents without making allegations against the minister, urged the Magistrate to grant bail to Rambukwella, while highlighting his client\u2019s medical conditions.",
    "After taking into account all the submissions made, the Maligakanda Magistrate said Rambukwella, as the then-health minister, must be responsible for all actions carried out by the ministry beyond just signing a document.",
    "In October 2023, the NMRA revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of 22,500 vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",
    "The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party.",
    "After the human immunoglobulin scandal came to light, Rambukwella was stripped of health ministerial portfolio and was appointed as the Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October. Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries."
