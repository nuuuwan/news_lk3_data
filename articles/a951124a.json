    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is expected to grow 1.9 percent in 2024, and speed up to 2.5 percent in 2025, as the island recovers from a contraction last year, the Asian Development Bank said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s currency collapsed in 2022 after two years of aggressive macro-economic policy where money was printed to boost growth and taxes were also cut, throwing large section of the population into poverty and pushing up inflation.",
    "\u201cIn Sri Lanka, growth will rebound to 1.9 percent in 2024 and 2.5 percent in 2025 from the 2.3 percent contraction in 2023,\u201d the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report.",
    "\u201cThis will be driven by rising output in services, resumption in industrial projects, and continuous reform aimed at improving the business climate.",
    "\u201cStill, tax increases will dampen the recovery in private consumption and investment.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank restored monetary stability by September 2022 and the economy started to show positive growth officially from the third quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter the economy was estimated to have grown 4.5 percent.",
    "Sri Lanka has a history of recovering from severe monetary shocks and the island has one of the worst central banks in the region, along with Pakistan, analysts have said.",
    "In addition to the usual currency crises generated by the central bank which does not have a credible single anchor monetary regime, Sri Lanka also defaulted on its external debt and was also faced by capital flight from banks.",
    "Both Sri Lanka\u2019s and Pakistan rupee is derived from the Indian currency at 4.70 to the US dollar at independence.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s growth for the year to June 2024, will also recover to 1.9 percent, and 2.8 percent in 2025, the Asian Development Bank said from a contraction last year.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee fell to 360 to the US dollar and has been allowed to appreciate to 298 amid deflationary open market operations (sell-downs of domestic assets of the central bank against dollar purchase), which is making traded commodities cheaper and boosting disposable incomes.",
    "The central bank also has to collect foreign reserves under an IMF program, which requires dampening domestic investments, at least by an equal amount. However countries with monetary stability generally attract foreign capital while also preserving the real value of domestic savings.",
    "The ADB has been funding Sri Lanka after an IMF deal was struck.",
    "Sri Lanka is expected to wrap up re-structuring debt by June 2025, which will also open bilateral lending taps. (Colombo/Apr12/2024)"
