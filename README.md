Fire officials said all the dead and missing were in Guangfu, where the waters swept away a major road bridge across a river.

“Dad, don’t hurt yourself,” Routh’s daughter, Sara, screamed as the bailiffs struggled to restrain Routh and rushed him out of the courtroom.

A short time later, Routh was returned to the courtroom to complete the proceedings. This time, he was wearing handcuffs, but there was no blood visible on his white shirt, and he did not appear to have succeeded in harming himself.

“We love you, Dad,” Routh’s son, Adam, said after he was escorted out of the courtroom again.

It took the jury just 2½ hours of deliberating to also find Routh guilty of assaulting the Secret Service agent who rousted him from his hiding place and guilty of three federal gun charges stemming from the Sept. 15, 2024, incident.

Ajantha Kammethake MP at the time of the oral answer in Parliament on Tuesday (23). In response to the questions raised, he added

“Tea cultivation in the plantation industry has recently declined. The problem of fertilizer was mainly due to the lack of fertilizer in the past.. The resolutions made without fertilizer were the opposite of a major crisis. In that way, the tea crops have fallen and we have fertilized for it in the past year.

There were troubles from the people that the fertilizer was supplied only through a company and that there was a delay in fertilizer supply. Some parties also put forward the idea of ​​getting fertilizer from other companies.

Subsequently, we have obtained the permission of the Cabinet to create a new system in the distribution of fertilizer with all the ideas.

### Gaza, genocide and Sri Lanka’s dilemma of conscience

The finding by the United Nations that genocide is occurring in Gaza is an inflection point

The Government should support civil society and free media at home. Journalists should not be threatened for reporting on Gaza

Last week, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, chaired by former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.

The Commission of Inquiry found that four out of the five acts defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention are being carried out. They are: killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part, and imposing measures intended to prevent births.

What is glaring, however, is just how completely the NPP has capitulated

Among the hopes many had for the NPP Government when it was elected one year ago was that it would move Sri Lanka to actually opposing the devastating genocide Israel was carrying out against the Palestinian people in Gaza. What the NPP Government has gone on to do since then has been the opposite. A look at its positions on Palestine, its actions while in Government and its own past unearths a shamelessness which all Sri Lankans must contend with.

### Who cries for Hambantota, and why?

Hambantota is not merely an alternative; it is a practical solution to systemic inefficiencies in Sri Lanka’s current LPG supply chain

This article is written to set the record straight in response to misleading narratives about the recent Litro Gas tender. It is not about protecting one company’s interest, but about revealing how Hambantota, if rationally utilised, can deliver long-overdue benefits to Sri Lanka’s economy and people.

For time immemorial, Sri Lanka has been a decisive node in global trade. From the days of the Silk Route, Ceylon—as it was then called—connected East and West. Historical records from the Godawaya port in Hambantota show how this southern coast played a role in international trade centuries ago. After 75 years of independence, despite every Government repeating Hambantota’s location-specific advantage as an election slogan, little was done to convert that advantage into real economic prosperity.

Eco-conscious travellers look for destinations that practise what they preach, and packaging, often overlooked, can reinforce Sri Lanka’s positioning as a responsible, ethical destination

Sustainable food packaging is no longer about simply replacing plastic with paper. The real test lies in creating systems that deliver food safety, preserve shelf life, and meet consumer convenience, all while being environmentally responsible. What matters now is how packaging performs across its entire lifecycle: from raw material sourcing and production to disposal and reuse. That’s where real impact begins.

### The need for investor education about risk-taking and Unit Trusts

*2025-09-23 23:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-need-for-investor-education-about-risk-taking-and-unit-trusts/) · `en`

Interview with Jeevan Sukumaran, Secretary, Unit Trust Association, Sri Lanka

What does “risk” really mean in investing, and why should the public not be afraid of it?

At the mention of the word risk in terms of investing, especially in a Sri Lankan context, there can be a significant level of fear or stigma attached to it. To some degree, this is fair given the country’s history of civil war, investment company scams (such as Golden Key/Ceylinco and Sakvithi and in more recent times, the Easter Attacks, Covid and the Economic crisis. This has led to a large majority of potential investors being afraid to venture very far beyond commercial banking products and, therefore, losing out on the earnings potential of other asset classes.
