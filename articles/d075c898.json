    "The air is crisp and thin atop Horton Plains, the morning mist curling like breath over the rolling patanas. Then, as the rising sun pierces the haze, the landscape begins to shimmer\u2014waves of mauve and violet unfurl across the slopes, as though the earth itself has exhaled after a dozen years of silence. Bees hum in the stillness. A sambar deer lifts its head, framed by the purple blaze. After 12 long years, the Nilu has returned.",
    "This is 2025, and Sri Lanka\u2019s highlands are once again transformed by the mass flowering of Strobilanthes, locally called",
    "\u201cNilu.\u201d It is an event so rare and rhythmic that few living people have witnessed it more than twice in their lifetime. For those who stand here today\u2014among the rippling blossoms, where clouds cast fleeting shadows across mauve hillsides\u2014it feels as though time itself blooms with the flowers.",
    "I first stood amid this botanical tide in 2013, camera in hand, the Horton Plains veiled in violet light. Even then, I sensed that I was witnessing something larger than beauty\u2014a heartbeat of the land, one that pulses only every 12 years. Digging deeper, I discovered that I was not alone in this fascination. In 1910, British planter and naturalist",
    "Thomas Farr, who built the original  \u201cFarr Bungalow\u201d at Horton Plains, wrote of this same miracle in meticulous detail.",
    "Farr documented the great flowerings of 1881, 1893, and 1905, and confidently predicted the next in 1917. His forecast proved astonishingly accurate. Since then, the blooms have recurred with unwavering regularity: 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, and now\u2014true to the century-long rhythm\u20142025.",
    "During my own field visits, I uncovered fragments of local memory and tangible evidence: Mr. Perera of Ohiya spoke of the 2001 bloom with reverence, recalling how the hills turned purple overnight. My 2013 documentation added another link in the chain\u2014a living continuation of Farr\u2019s cycle, now spanning more than 140 years.",
    "This year\u2019s spectacle not only confirms Farr\u2019s observations; it validates nature\u2019s astonishing precision. Across the plateau, the Nilu has kept time better than any clock we could build.",
    "The Nilu belongs to the genus Strobilanthes\u2014a group of tropical shrubs and herbs known for a peculiar rhythm: synchronous,  gregarious flowering followed by death. Botanists describe it as  monocarpic, meaning each plant flowers only once in its lifetime. For 12 years, these unassuming green bushes quietly photosynthesize, storing energy for one single, all-consuming act of reproduction. Then, in a matter of weeks, they burst into bloom, release millions of seeds, and die\u2014blanketing the forest floor in their faded remains.",
    "Strobilanthes sexennis stands tall, reaching up to 30 feet, its mauve blossoms painting the valleys in ethereal tones.",
    "S. pulcherrimus and pale S. viscosus join the chorus, blending hues of heliotrope, lilac, and white. Together, they transform the undergrowth into a living tapestry, what Farr once described as \u201clike fairy lands, as though veils of transparent gauze were draped through and about the Nilu stems.\u201d",
    "Farr\u2019s century-old prose captures the ecological choreography of this phenomenon with astonishing acuity. In his 1910 essay The Inflorescence of the Nilu (Strobilanthes), he wrote of Bambara bees swarming from the lowlands, drawn by instinct and the scent of nectar. He observed  elephants retreating from the stinging clouds of bees,",
    "sambar deer returning to graze the newly opened glades, and leopards following in their wake. Even  jungle-fowl and pigeons, Farr noted, migrated toward the flowering zones to feast on the bounty of seeds\u2014a \u201ctrek,\u201d he called it, that rippled through the web of life.",
    "Today, many of those players remain\u2014though elephants no longer roam these uplands. Modern ecology now explains what Farr could only marvel at: the Nilu flowering acts as a trophic pulse, a sudden surge of energy cascading through the ecosystem. The explosion of nectar feeds pollinators; the seed rain sustains rodents and birds; predators thrive on the abundance. Then, as the plants die, sunlight reaches the soil, allowing a new generation to sprout\u2014a cycle of death and renewal, written in the DNA of the hills.",
    "The regularity of this rhythm\u2014every 12 years without fail\u2014is one of nature\u2019s most exquisite mysteries. The timeline now reads like a biological chronicle of Sri Lanka\u2019s highlands:",
    "1881, 1893, 1905, 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025.",
    "Each date marks not just a flowering, but a fleeting convergence\u2014of generations, species, and human witnesses. Farr saw the first three. I have seen the last two. The next, in 2037, will bloom for another generation\u2014perhaps observed by those who read these words today.",
    "Across the Palk Strait, in India\u2019s Western Ghats, the famed  Neelakurinji (Strobilanthes kunthiana) follows the same 12-year rhythm, cloaking the Nilgiri Hills in lavender-blue. To gether, these cousins tell a story that transcends borders: of evolutionary adaptation, of resilience in montane habitats, and of the quiet synchrony that unites distant ecosystems across time.",
    "As throngs of visitors now trek to Horton Plains to witness the Nilu, the challenge lies in balancing wonder with responsibility. Overcrowding, trampling, and litter threaten the very ecosystems that nurture this miracle. Scientists warn that climate change\u2014altering rainfall, temperature, and pollinator behaviour\u2014could disrupt the Nilu\u2019s inner clock. If so, the 2037 bloom might not come on schedule.",
    "The Nilu is more than a tourist attraction; it is a living clock of climate, a barometer of ecological health. Protecting its rhythm means safeguarding the integrity of Horton Plains itself\u2014its soils, forests, pollinators, and every invisible thread that ties them together.",
    "Standing here in 2025, surrounded by the mauve sea of blossoms, I think of Farr in 1910, penning his notes by lamplight at the old Farr Bungalow. I imagine his bees swarming, his deer returning, his awe no different from mine. Between us stretch 144 years\u2014yet the same bloom, the same rhythm, the same pulse.",
    "The Nilu teaches patience. It reminds us that some miracles unfold not in days, but in decades\u2014that the earth keeps its own calendar, immune to human haste. To witness it is to step briefly into nature\u2019s time, where 12 years are but a breath, and beauty, like memory, always returns.",
    "As the mauve hills fade back to green, and another 12-year silence begins, one can only hope that when the Nilu blooms again in 2037, the world will still be listening.",
