    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s planned new Employment Act will look at how employers treat employees, especially in the plantation sector, a government minister said.",
    "\u201cWe are updating our employment laws to hold all employers accountable for the working conditions and facilities they provide their workers, especially in the tea estates,\u201d Minister of Estate Infrastructure Development of Sri Lanka, Jeevan Thondaman said on X (twitter).",
    "\u201cIf estate workers are sitting on the ground to eat and lack basic facilities at their place of employment, the questions should be asked directly from the plantation companies (RPCs) why they continue to provide deplorable working conditions for their employees.",
    "\u201cWe have come to the absurd situation where the Government has to fund for toilets and basic facilities for employees of large conglomerates.\u201d",
    "Thondaman said the government was looking at restructuring the entire RPC model.",
    "\u201cThe present leases (entered into decades ago) make RPCs mini kingdoms with almost absolute power over swathes of Sri Lankan land and everyone living on them. That system needs to end.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen I started the field room programme to provide a simple room in the estates for tea pluckers to rest, eat and use the washroom, the RPCs barely made any contribution towards them.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other major Sri Lankan company that treats their employees in the deplorable way some RPCs do. When you look at how large apparel companies such as Mas Holdings treat their workers and how the RPCs do, it\u2019s worlds apart.\u201d",
    "In September, President Ranil Wickremesinghe advised leaders of plantation companies to engage in a collective agreement concerning the wage hike for plantation workers, aiming for a minimum of Rs 1,700, as per their request.",
    "\u201cThey were urged to reach a consensus on the increased wage amount before December 31,\u201d a statement by the president\u2019s media division (PMD) said back then.",
    "The guidance on the wage hike was given by the president when he met with the heads of plantation companies. \u201cThe conversation also delved into the program designed to grant land rights to plantation workers,\u201d the PMD said.",
    "Sri Lanka tea plantations claim growing support for new wage model",
    "Ahead of elections, Sri Lanka leader suggests 70% hike for plantation workers",
    "Sri Lanka minister calls for solution to 800,000 landless non-workers in plantations",
    "Plantation workers\u2019 minimum wage was increased to 1,000 rupees in October 2021, but they have complained that it was insufficient due to the high cost of living after Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis."
