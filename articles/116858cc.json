    "Whenever the name \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 crop up, I\u2019m reminded of the American animated sitcom TV series which was very popular in our scene, as well.",
    "Believe me, we have now got the Simpsons in our midst \u2026 no, not the cartoon series but real live action in the form of Simpsons, the band.",
    "Originally, the setup comprised Dileepa Liyanage (keyboardist, producer, and music director), Ryo Hera (lead vocalist and acoustic guitarist), and Buddhima Chalanu (lead vocalist, bassist, and composer), and later came Chiranaka Dulmeth (drummer), and Ranga (lead guitarist, traditional dancer, and actor), making it a five-piece outfit.",
    "\u201cWe generally do the trio scene but switch to five-piece, depending on the occasion\u201d, says Dileepa, also known as Lee (Online), a celebrated composer in Sri Lanka and Qatar, with notable credits, including music production for FIFA Qatar.",
    "\u201cWe want our audience to feel deeply \u2014 to be moved, healed, and hyped, all in one performance.\u201d",
    "The band, just one year in existence, is known for fusion pop, rock, funk, jazz, Afro-tribal house, and acoustic soul, making every performance of theirs a layered, multicultural experience. Their live sets feel like immersive journeys \u2014 carefully crafted with loop-based soundscapes, meditative textures, and emotionally charged vocals.",
    "Whether at Melody of Colombo, Chill Colombo, One Galle Face, Arugambay Seasonal Festival, or intimate unplugged sessions, they bridge the gap between tradition and innovation, between energy and emotion.",
    "Dileepa Liyanage: Celebrated composer in Sri Lanka andQatar, with notable credits, including music production forFIFA Qatar",
    "They are currently working on original singles, paired with cinematic visual releases. With plans to expand into South Asian and European cultural festivals, the band is set to bring Sri Lanka\u2019s contemporary sound to the global stage.",
    "Their vision? To become a cultural export, blending Sri Lankan soul with global genres \u2013 while continuing to break boundaries in how music is experienced.",
    "Simpsons was born out of a shared vision between passionate musicians who wanted to create something that transcended traditional genres.",
    "\u201cWe came together through jam sessions, stage collaborations, and mutual gigs \u2014 and quickly realised our unique chemistry and sonic blend could offer something truly special,\u201d says Dileepa, adding that the name Simpsons reflects artistic familiarity with a twist. \u201cIt\u2019s rooted in everyday culture but leaves room for creative interpretation. It symbolises our approach to music: relatable yet boundary-breaking, familiar yet fresh.\u201d",
    "Referring to genres, or artistes, who influence their sound the most, Dileepa said: \u201cOur inspirations are vast \u2013 from Daft Punk and Coldplay to A.R. Rahman, The Rolling Stones, Fela Kuti, and Sri Lankan icons like Bathiya & Santhush and Charitha Attalage. We\u2019re drawn to artistes who blend soul, rhythm, and storytelling with innovation.\u201d",
    "The band\u2019s future plans include original singles, with immersive visuals, and also cultural festival tours across South Asia and Europe.",
    "Says Dileepa: \u201cWe see Simpsons evolving into a cultural ambassador for Sri Lanka \u2014 innovating with genre-blending, storytelling, and collaborations across borders. Our goal is to make an international impact while staying rooted in who we are.\u201d",
