  "original_body_lines": [
    "Some 28 countries have condemned what is being referred to as the \u2018drip feeding of aid\u2019 to the Gaza and this coming together in the name of humanity could be considered as long overdue. Included in this fold are some major states of the West, such as the UK, and it is hoped that more countries would join the grouping to prevent the Gazans from starving to death; for that is how the community is placed currently.",
    "Those other states that mean well by the Palestinians are also obliged to bring moral pressure to bear on the Trump administration to change course and give pride of place to humanitarian considerations in the formulation of its Middle Eastern policy going forward. Currently, it is only moral pressure that could be seen as counting, because Western states empathizing with the Gazans and those countries making common cause with them are yet to collectively measure up fully to the US in terms of power and influence. It is the US\u2019 diktat that continues to prove most decisive in the region on account of its capability to fashion power relations in the Middle East virtually single-handedly.",
    "At present, China and Russia are yet to inveigh heavily against the US on its Middle Eastern policy and could not be counted on much to hold the US to account on Gaza linked matters. Accordingly, the US and Israel are not facing any substantive opposition to their policy and actions in the Middle East and it is hoped that moral pressure would prove effective in the short and medium terms.",
    "Meanwhile, the Gazans\u2019 condition could be best described as a \u2018living death\u2019. It is being said in some quarters that relief to the Gazans is being \u2018weaponized\u2019 and the fact that scores of Gazans have been gunned down while rushing for food and water at relief centres gives substance to this allegation.",
    "Unfortunately, the UN has been sidelined in the distribution of food and other requirements to the Gazans by a US and Israel-backed relief outfit and this situation could very well be depriving the victimized community of the required security and material necessities.",
    "Accordingly, international soul-searching is an urgent requirement. Given the Palestinians\u2019 grim condition, the world is deeply obliged to go to their assistance without further delay. In the process it would need to disregard the US\u2019 diktats and its policy priorities in the Middle East.",
    "This is the principal challenge before the international community on the Gaza question. Could it follow the call of its conscience and stand up to the US? The world would need to get its act together on this crisis and work concertedly together to meet this challenge. Given their inclusivity and comparative broad-mindedness it is the vibrant democracies of the West who would need to lead this effort.",
    "Meanwhile, the Palestinian camp is obliged to figure out as to what constructive actions and policy initiatives it could implement to ease its suffering. While the US and Israel could be described as facing the censure of the conscience-stricken on account of the ordeals of the Gazans and other Palestinian sections, the latter are obliged to considerably overhaul their policy positions on the Middle East question to meet their legitimate ends. For example, it ought to occur to them that there would be no stable peace for them if the security of the Israeli state is not ensured as well.",
    "The simple truth about the Middle East conundrum is that we have had decades-long war and destruction there basically because distrust has been dogging both sides to the conflict on account of nagging insecurities. These insecurities could be eased somewhat if we have in the Middle East two states, inhabited by the Palestinians and Israelis, that opt to live peacefully side- by-side. The \u2018Two State Solution\u2019 has been much discredited but there is no sensible alternative to it.",
    "Decades of war ought to have convinced both sides that either side could not be eliminated completed by military means. There is no alternative to peaceful co-existence. And a measure of peace is possible because in the mid-nineties no less a Palestinian political leader than Yasser Arafat tried peace out with some success. Unfortunately, hard liners were allowed to hijack the Palestinian cause.",
    "Likewise, peace loving Israelis are suffering relentlessly because religious fundamentalists are in the seats of governance in Israel. A challenge for both sides going forward is to alienate and get out of the way hard liners who have a vested interest in war.",
    "In the final analysis, humanity needs to be at the heart of policy-making on both sides of the Middle East divide. Moderates on both sides are obliged to seek the cooperation of Western Europe and other democratic and peace-oriented sections of the international community to map out the detailed way forward.",
    "Meanwhile, backers of the Palestinian cause locally and internationally would need to carefully assess their policy positions on political militancy. The spilling of civilian blood excessively for a political cause should be seen as terrorism. Accordingly, the term \u2018terror\u2019 should be seen as applicable to the Israeli state if it brings about excessive civilian casualties in the course of its military operations and to the Palestine militants, if they do the same in the name of their cause.",
    "There could be no double standards on this question and moderate and democratic opinion on both sides of the divide should be prepared to identify aloud and clearly, as terrorists, those groups that shed civilian blood for the furtherance of their causes. Unfortunately, some sections in Sri Lanka fight shy of adhering to these norms. Consequently, peace-making fumbles and runs aground.",
    "It is also in order to tell those sections that see themselves as Christians in the US that they need to \u2018call out\u2019 loud and forcefully the Trump administration on the Gaza tragedy. This applies in particular to the Christian Right which is believed to be ardently behind the government.",
    "Civilian life and wellbeing need to be protected and perpetuated by all those who consider themselves to be Christians. It follows that Trump\u2019s Christian supporters should bring pressure on him to end the suffering of the Gazans by revamping his policy positions on Right wing governments in Israel. It is time for \u2018Christian Witness\u2019. There could be no double talk on this issue as well.",
