  "original_body_lines": [
    "A national constitution is more than just a legal document \u2013 it is the backbone of a country\u2019s identity, governance, and democratic values. It outlines the principles that guide the state, defines the structure of government, and safeguards the rights of its citizens. In democratic nations, the Constitution ensures that all institutions derive their authority from the people and remain accountable through free and transparent elections and governance. Notably, it can also facilitate the devolution of power, enabling local governments to serve their communities better and uphold the rule of law (1). As Sri Lanka stands at a critical crossroads, revisiting and revising its Constitution is essential to building a more disciplined, fair, and prosperous nation.",
    "According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, a strong democratic constitution must meet several key standards. It should apply to all branches of government, define political structures and citizen rights, enjoy broad public legitimacy, be difficult to amend without a wide consensus, and uphold international standards of representation and human rights [1].",
    "Yet despite these benchmarks, constitutions differ around the world due to varying political and cultural histories. A global ranking of democratic nations [2] places countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland at the top, while Australia ranks 13th, the UK 17th, Canada 24th, and the US 36th. Sri Lanka, however, lags far behind at 93rd \u2013 a reflection of longstanding issues such as corruption, crime, judicial inefficiency, and poor governance.",
    "A constitution is more than a legal framework \u2014 it reflects a nation\u2019s identity, values, and priorities. For a democracy to thrive, it must guarantee fairness in access to services and actively challenge discriminatory laws and practices. It should promote equity, protect fundamental rights, and ensure that all citizens, regardless of background, are treated equally under the law.",
    "Democracy, as Abraham Lincoln famously said, is \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d In practice, this means that elected representatives must govern with the trust of the people, protect the rights of minorities, and remain accountable to the public. As the United Nations outlines, true democracy also requires free and fair elections, judicial independence, separation of powers, a free press, and transparent governance [3].",
    "In this context, constitutional reform is not just a legal exercise \u2014 it\u2019s a moral and civic imperative. It\u2019s about building a foundation that ensures no individual or political group is above scrutiny. Politicians must be held accountable, both in Parliament and in court, to prevent abuse of power and uphold the principles of democracy.",
    "The urgent need for a new constitution that protects democratic rights, ensures an independent judiciary, strengthens economic development, and eliminates corruption has been evident since the introduction of the executive presidency. Over the decades, successive governments have pledged reform but failed to deliver. Since Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972, constitutional changes have often been used not to empower the people, but to entrench political elites [4], enabling the continuity of political power within a few families.",
    "The abolition of the Senate since 1972 weakened accountability, while the 1978 Constitution expanded presidential powers dramatically, allowing political leaders to consolidate control and reward allies with impunity. Although the Constitutional Council was established in 2000 to promote independent governance, it has failed to depoliticise public institutions.",
    "In total, the Constitution has been amended 22 times, most recently in October 2022. Yet none of these revisions have meaningfully improved governance or curbed corruption. Public services remain plagued by political interference, and widespread crime and mismanagement led the nation to declare bankruptcy in April 2022. Consequently, trust in the political system has eroded severely.",
    "The victory of the NPP government in November 2024 reflects the public\u2019s cry for change, including a promise to build a thriving, democratic nation through good governance, national unity, and comprehensive constitutional reform [5]. Despite campaign promises of good governance, the current government faces daunting challenges, including widespread corruption and inefficiencies in the public sector. These issues have flourished for decades under the existing constitutional framework, particularly since the adoption of the executive presidential system in 1978. Therefore, numerous reform proposals have been put forward (6-10), some of which are detailed, while others are more conceptual.",
    "During the last election, the ruling NPP made constitutional reform a central pillar of its platform, pledging to uphold democracy, restore the rule of law, and ensure economic and social justice for all Sri Lankans. Yet, nearly a year later, the urgency behind these reforms appears to be fading. While the government continues to speak about fighting corruption and recovering stolen assets, action on other issues seems to be slow, leaving many voters disillusioned. The present NPP government\u2019s delay in constitutional revision can be an opportunity lost for meaningful change. The NPP risks squandering its current mandate and failing to secure the majority\u2019s expectations. For reform to be more than rhetoric, bold and immediate steps are essential to lay the strong foundation necessary for prosperity.",
    "The Key Areas a New Constitution Must Reform to Ensure Discipline?",
    "For Sri Lanka to move forward, the new Constitution must directly address the root causes of crime, corruption, and mismanagement, while strengthening democratic governance, transparency, and accountability. Here are some key areas requiring urgent reform:",
    "A genuinely independent judiciary is the backbone of law and order. While it must remain free from political interference, the judiciary must also maintain high standards of efficiency and ethics. The recent case of a prisoner\u2019s controversial release under the guise of a Presidential Pardon also reveals a serious loophole that must be closed in a revised constitution.",
    "Parliamentary conduct has deteriorated into disgraceful confrontations, such as the violent clashes that occurred in November 2018. Despite some improvement, verbal abuse and inflammatory rhetoric continue to persist, often shielded by parliamentary immunity. The Constitution must enable legal consequences for inciting violence, racial hatred, or corruption, and treat such statements as supportive records for crimes against the state. Lawmakers proven guilty should face the loss of privileges, confiscation of illicit assets, and the highest penalties under the law, and be ineligible for such individuals to serve as people\u2019s representatives in national, provincial, or local bodies.",
    "Sri Lanka cannot afford wasteful governance. Failures in public administration, such as the irregular release of 323 containers, unauthorised presidential pardons, and the misuse of state funds for luxurious perks, continue to harm national progress. A reformed constitution must mandate strict financial oversight, establish a second legislative chamber for checks and balances, and empower independent, politically neutral watchdog bodies to monitor the efficiency of governance.",
    "Public officials should be held accountable for inefficiency or corruption. The Constitution must establish clear standards for ethical conduct in public service and provide citizens with recourse in the event of an initial breach of these standards, as appropriate. Misconduct should not just be punished but compensated by those responsible, especially when it harms national prosperity.",
    "Combining elections where possible \u2014 such as holding presidential and parliamentary elections on the same day \u2014 could save significant public funds and minimise political disruption. This simple yet impactful reform can be enshrined in the Constitution.",
    "To curb crime and corruption in politics, all candidates should meet minimum standards of education, experience, and integrity rather than being a member of an influential politician\u2019s family. Those found guilty of misconduct must be disqualified from office, with appropriate legal action taken against them. Conducting all elections by secret ballot is essential to maintain fairness and order\u2014a pressing need, as evidenced by recent local government elections.",
    "The abolition of the Senate weakened legislative oversight. A revised constitution should consider reintroducing a second chamber to scrutinise bills and prevent power concentration. Additionally, the current size of Parliament and the extravagant privileges of its members are no longer sustainable and should be rationalised where necessary.",
    "Transparency in dealings with foreign governments, public spending, and national policy decisions is vital. The Constitution must guarantee public access to information, helping to eliminate inefficiency and wastage and restore trust in democratic institutions.",
    "The call for constitutional reform is not just a political promise \u2013 it is a necessity for the prosperity of the nation. As highlighted in the NPP government\u2019s election manifesto, restoring the Constitution\u2019s supremacy over Parliament is essential to rebuilding public trust and ensuring good governance. The people have given this government a historic mandate, with overwhelming support across all communities. Now, the responsibility lies with the leadership to lay the required foundation.",
    "The revised Constitution must enshrine discipline across all institutions, especially among those in Parliament and public office. While technical and political challenges may exist, they must not use such excuses to delay action. Sri Lankans are watching closely, hoping for a future where their rights are protected, their voices respected, and their leaders held accountable. The current term of the NPP government might be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure Sri Lanka\u2019s future \u2013 a future free from the grip of corruption, misrule, and impunity \u2013 and to revive democracy and good governance, thereby promoting the nation\u2019s prosperity and alleviating poverty.",
