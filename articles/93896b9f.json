  "original_title": "The Bowser Explosion  in Kaithady that Rocked  the LTTE on Valentine\u2019s day.; 43 Killed 51 Injured.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u201cThe best laid schemes  of mice and men often go awry, \u201dpenned the Scottish bard Robert Burns in his poem\u201dto a mouse\u201d. This truth was brought home in an explosive manner to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE)  37 years ago when  a massive explosion rocked the Kaithady area in the Thenmaratchi division of Jaffna peninsula.",
    "February 14th 1987 was a bloody valentine\u2019s day in northern Jaffna. A bold attempt  by the LTTE known popularly as the tigers  to attack the Navatkuli army camp on that day was  aborted due to an accident which killed 43 persons and injured 51 persons. A carefully planned operation by the LTTE with a tremendous chance of success was not implemented  as a result of it.",
    "The casualties included three senior leaders of the LTTE at that time. 14 February 1987  remains  an explosive date in the annals of contemporary military history and is worthy of being recounted as  it\u2019s 34th anniversary draws near.",
    "What happened then was  this. The war between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE was continuing. LTTE leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran gave the slip  to Indian authorities and clandestinely returned to Jaffna from Tamil Nadu on 5 January 1987. To mark his return, the tiger supremo wanted his men to expedite a bold attack being planned  against a Sri Lankan Army camp in the North.",
    "The Army camp at Navatkuli was set up in the 1984-85 period along the Jaffna-Kandy road near the lagoon. It had around 300 to 400 security personnel. The Ceygma Company factory which specialised in manufacturing water pumps and pipes had been  acquired by the state for this purpose.",
    "At the time the camp was set up the military installation was not self-sufficient in drinking water. If premises belonging to the adjoining Andriesz seafood processing factory or the adjacent \u201cThamby Walavu\u201d coconut grove had also been acquired then drinking water could have been available but it was not done initially.",
    "Instead a Tamil civilian from the neighbouring village Kaithadi was contracted to supply water to the camp. This man would haul a water bowser attached to his tractor every morning and evening and fill it up with good drinking water at a well in Kaithady. He would then deliver it routinely to the Navatkuli camp.",
    "Although the Tigers could have prevented this practice they did not as they perhaps did not want the camp to expand in perimeter or had a long-term plan to attack it.",
    "The LTTE commander for Jaffna district in 1987 was Sathasivampillai Krishnakumar alias Kittu. The Thenmarathi divisional area commander was Thileepan alias Curdles a.k.a. Curdy. Curdles was entrusted with the task of preparing a feasibility study on attacking the Kaithady camp.He was in the process of preparing one when the LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabakharan relocated to Jaffna from India.",
    "Prabakharan was very keen that the hitherto \u201cdefensive\u201d war should be transformed to \u201coffensive\u201d status. So he instructed Kittu to prioritise the attack on Navatkuli. Since the Navatkuli-Kaithady areas were part of Thenmaratchy and therefore technically under Curdles, Kittu ordered him to draw up the initial plan of action. Later it was personally streamlined by Kittu.",
    "The LTTE obtained maps and plans of the Ceygma factory premises from a construction contracting firm in Jaffna and made elaborate plans including the setting up of a model replica. Also heavy reconnaissance known in LTTE parlance  as \u201crekki\u201d was also conducted. Since LTTE sentries were posted around the camp earlier itself the presence of LTTE \u201crekki\u201dscouts did not arouse the suspicion of the army camp.",
    "Another unexpected bonanza to the Tigers was the willing cooperation of the water bowser  driver. The man was apparently an ardent Tamil nationalist and a genuine supporter of the Tigers.",
    "He was prepared to go to any length to help the LTTE  and proved  to be a useful accomplice. Through his assistance,  the LTTE photographed the water bowser in minute detail and started work on the project. It was decided to build an exact replica of the water bowser in question at a secret site in Meesalai.",
    "Ranjan, a non-LTTE civilian engineer who had collaborated earlier with \u201cideas \u201cVasu on an  aircraft project was in charge. He was assisted by  Yogaratnam Kugan alias Ponnamman in this respect. Although Ponnamman was then technically the Mullaitheevu district commander Prabakharan personally assigned Ponnamman also known as Atputhan to work on this project. The duplicate water bowser was to have a false bottom in which explosives were to be placed. Since the army sentries had got used to the reliable tractor driver and his water bowser, intensive search was not anticipated.",
    "The plan was to substitute the explosive-laden bowser for the original with the connivance of the driver. To avoid suspicion the duplicate bowser was constructed almost as an exact replica of the original with the appropriate shade of blue paint, water marks, signs of corrosion etc.",
    "The day of attack was  scheduled for Feb 14th 1987 a Saturday. In those days the LTTE had a penchant to launch major attacks on a numerological  basis.5th, 14th, 23rd were good days while 8th, 17th and 26th were bad days. The duplicate bowser was surreptitiously transported in the early hours of the 13th a Friday to a granary at Kaithady.",
    "There the false bottom was loaded with explosives along with proportionate booster charges. This was personally undertaken by Ponnamman the resident LTTE expert at that time in explosive technology. The plan  was for the driver to bring the original bowser to this granary where the  explosive ladedn duplicate bowser filled with water would be substituted  and then taken to the Navatkuli camp. The attack was to begin with the explosion of the water bowser between 5.30pm and 6pm.",
    "In the meantime the carefully drawn up attack plan was being executed with exact precision by the Tigers. Cadres from all over the Jaffna peninsula and Mannar were transported on 13th night in small groups to abandoned houses at Navatkuli.They were ordered to remain hidden throughout daylight on the 14th",
    "The usual frequencies on the LTTE communication channels were changed. Radio communication was avoided as far as possible and personal couriers were used whenever possible. This was to prevent the army from possibly eavesdropping on the wireless.",
    "The action plan was drawn up with meticulous detail.The driver was to enter the camp with the water bowser and then walk away towards the toilet without attracting attention. When he reached a safe distance the explosion was to be triggered off through remote control. In case the remote did not work a timer too had been fitted on as a precautionary measure.",
    "The LTTE spokesman of the time Rahim was stationed at the top of the adjoining Andriesz factory air-conditioning plant. It was a vantage point to obtain a bird\u2019s eye view of what was happening in the camp. When the Driver was clear Rahim was to signal another senior cadre Ravi who was to press the plunger.Once Ravi triggered the explosion at Rahim\u2019s signal the attack was to commence.",
    "The driver had also told the LTTE earlier that they could explode the bowser without waiting for him to get clear if necessary, a gesture which touched the Tigers. \u201cIt will be an honour if I am blown to bits\u201d the driver said without realising at that time about how tragically prophetic his words were  going to be. Incidently this was the first time the LTTE had planned to launch  a full-scale attack on a major camp preceded by a Vehicle bomb explosion.",
    "It was expected that the whole Navatkuli camp would be thrown into confusion and disarray by the explosion. A group led by Uthaman was to assault the gates with extensive use of \u201cBangalore Torpedoes\u2019 . Uthaman\u2019s group would clear frontal defensive mines.",
    "Four sandbag laden trucks with mounted fire-arms were to penetrate the outer defenses and enter the camp frontally from different points. Each truck was at the vanguard of four different Tiger groups on foot. The four groups were led by Curdles, Johnny, Soosai and Paran respectively.",
    "At that time Curdles was LTTE leader of the Thenmaratchi division, Johnny the Valigamam division, Soosai the Vadamaratchi division and Paran the deputy-leader of Prabakharan\u2019s body guard squad.Each leader was perched on each of the advancing trucks.",
    "A hallmark of the LTTE has been frontline leadership during battles. \u201cTiger leaders do not stay behind and ask the cadres to go forward. Our leaders are in front asking cadres to come up\u201d said Kittu to this writer once.",
    "Two groups led by Vasu and Kutti Sri were to conduct mortar fire from two directions. Veeman was in charge of the group assigned to provide covering fire with small arms.",
    "Six groups led by Ravi, Malaravan, Mathan, Rahim, Kandeepan and Mayooran respectively were to breach the defences at six points on three sides and enter the camp fighting.",
    "A cut-out to prevent military reinforcements by air was established towards the Ariyalai direction under the command of Daniel. This cut-out was equipped with 50 calibre guns then the most powerful in the LTTE arsenal.",
    "180 LTTE guerrillas comprising assault and support cadres were to be involved in the operation. The operational headquarters was at a house near the Kaithady-Kopay road. The person in charge was Kunju the deputy leader of the Thenmaratchi area but Kittu the overall Jaffna commander also stationed himself there. Prabakharan  was at Valvettithurai then.",
    "The H-hour struck and the water bowser was substituted and then filled with water at Kaithady but the Tigers found to their dismay that in spite of their elaborate preparations they had neglected one aspect. They had not filled their duplicate bowser with water prior to the actual switching of both. When  the water was filled,  the outer pipes of the explosive laden bowser began leaking.",
    "News of the leaking pipes did not reach all the leaders and group leaders as only an uncommon frequency was used to inform Ponnamman and Ranjan the engineer. They raced to the scene in a pick-up vehicle.",
    "The vehicle found itself unable to negotiate a sharp bend in a sandy by-lane and \u201cPambu Ajith\u201d a senior cadre got out of the vehicle to direct the driver. Once the bend was cleared Ponnamman in his haste instructed the LTTE driver to proceed at full speed without waiting for Ajith who was left behind. Being stranded was a blessing in disguise for Ajith who escaped death that day and is now in a Western country safe and sound.",
    "Three other tiger   leaders Vasu, Curdles and Paran also heard about the leaking pipes and proceeded to Kaithady with some of their cadres.",
    "As was customary LTTE battle practice a separate frequency was being used in the combat zone. Kittu also was using it. Some walkie-talkies had switched frequencies while others had not. That is why some leaders heard about the leaking pipes and others did not.",
    "However only Ponnamman was required to visit the site and it was totally unnecessary for Curdles, Vasu and Paran to have left the battlefront to  visit the battle site. If they had survived death disciplinary action may  have been taken against them by tiger supremo Prabhakaran for this lapse.",
    "Several  other tiger leaders  did not know what was happening and were waiting in their positions for the signal to attack. Rahim for example had detained the evening shift employees at Andriesz factory in a safe place so that they would not get caught up in the attack. Residents of Navatkuli who strayed into the combat zone were also detained in this manner.",
    "Kittu stationed only a short distance away too was not informed of the \u201cleaks\u201d by the cadres who did not want to be scolded in choice expletives by the Commander as was his custom. Kittu a stickler for detail would have definitely found fault for not checking out the bowser with water. Also it was seen only as a minor problem. Besides Ponnamman a senior leader was in charge of the water bowser aspect.",
    "When Ponnamman reached the scene he found the pipes leaking. He and Ranjan decided to fix it with a blow-Torch welder. The welding began on the outside while the explosives were in the secret compartment on the inside. Curdles, Vasu, Paran and others also gathered around those engaged in welding.",
    "The time was between 5.20 and 5.25 p.m.Suddenly there was a powerful blast!The bowser exploded. The explosion expected at Navatkuli went off by accident in Kaithady. All hell broke loose.",
    "12 LTTE cadres  and 31 civilians were killed. 51 persons comprising civilians and LTTE cadres were injured. Those waiting at the Navatkuli battle-front heard the explosion report and wondered what happened. The explosion was powerful enough to rattle the windows of Kailasapathy Hall at the Jaffna University at Thirunelveli.",
    "The exact reason for the explosion is unknown even today although it is surmised that the heat generated by the welding process may have been the cause.",
    "Among those killed were Lt. Col. Kugan alias Ponnamman the Mullaitheevu commander and a favourite of Prabakharan. The Thenmaratchy leader Major Curdles was also killed. Sudhagaran alias Vasu  known as \u201cIdeas Vasu\u201d was also killed..Apart from Capt. Vasu,  Lt. Paran And Lt.Siddarthan the younger brother of Sornalingam alias Shankar the Chief of the Air-Tigers wing was also killed. Among the civilians killed were Ranjan the engineer and The water tractor driver.",
    "The body of Ponnamman was blown to bits and nothing was recovered. Curdles was identified by parts of a belt. Vasu was identified through a piece of an identity card.",
    "An LTTE member was later to recall uncanny anecdotes. Ponnamman at the time of loading the explosives used to jokingly remark \u201cI have to be careful otherwise there won\u2019t be anything left to even remind you that once upon a time there was a man called Ponnamman\u201d. Nothing was recovered of Ponnamman exactly as he remarked.",
    "Curdles had a premonition that he was going to die in the Navatkuli attack. He left behind a letter written to Kittu. Curdles  had also made entries in his diary to that effect. He also took several photographs with his colleagues and also visited all the camps under his command from Nunavil to Elephant pass in the days preceding the attack.",
    "Also on the day of the attack he had with some of his friends gone for a wild ride on his Nissan and the ended up with a \u201cfeast\u201d of bread, roast chicken, biscuits and coke finishing up with a clandestine smoke which was banned in LTTE circles. Even Vasu who had never ever smoked before also participated, but Curdles never expected death by explosion and it is said that the hard-boiled Kittu cried when reading Curdy\u2019s last epistle.",
    "Aruna another senior leader was despatched with the unenviable task of breaking the news to the LTTE supremo Prabakharan in Valvettithurai.KIttu who visited the scene of the explosion almost broke down and it was left to Radha another senior leader to call off the operation. Couriers were dispatched to the attack groups who began withdrawing.",
    "Prabakaran wanted his cadres to re-draw plans and  attack Navatkuli again. But while preparations were  in progress, the soldiers expanded the camp area further by  taking over the Andriesz factory and the Thamby Walavu Coconut grove. The water problem  faced by the Army was solved.",
    "Separate funerals and Jaffna-wide memorial meetings were conducted in honour of the dead persons. The LTTE was the darling of the Jaffna masses then and all Jaffna overtly mourned the victims of the Kaithady bowser explosion.",
    "I conclude by stating that most of the information used in this article was obtained through conversations with ex-Jaffna LTTE commander Kittu and three other ex-tigers \u2013 Rahim, Ravi and Mathan \u2013 who were involved in the abortive Kaithady operation. (ENDS)",
