    "SriLankan Airlines yesterday clarified that AOG Technics is no longer an approved supplier of the national carrier in response to social media reports concerning the matter.",
    "In a statement, SriLankan said the Civil Aviation Authority of UK and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued safety notices to alert owners, operators, maintenance organisations, and distributors of suspected unapproved parts distributed by AOG Technics on 4 August 2023.",
    "In a subsequent scheduled EASA audit, SriLankan Airlines was specifically asked whether AOG Technics was a supplier. At the time, SriLankan Airlines confirmed that AOG Technics was on the airline\u2019s approved supplier list, however, SriLankan was also able to confirm that it had no record of any direct purchase made from AOG Technics.",
    "\u201cFurther, AOG Technics was removed from SriLankan Airlines\u2019 approved supplier list in September 2023,\u201d SriLankan said.",
    "\u201cIn the light of the current social media allegations, we have had our audit and engineering quality departments complete independent audits and confirm our records and we have further obtained letters from our two key service providers in the areas under question, CFM Materials and GE Engine Services Malaysia Sdn Bhd, confirming that they have not supplied the airline with any parts purchased from AOG Technics,\u201d the national carrier said in its statement.",
    "It said the aviation industry is highly regulated, and SriLankan Airlines undergoes multiple audits from the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka and international entities to ensure that safety is never compromised."
