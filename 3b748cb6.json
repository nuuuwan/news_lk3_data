    "Claims it was highly unsuccessful and was a mere political ploy",

    "Questions President\u2019s willingness to devolve power due to reluctance to hold LG polls",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) leader MP Dullas Alahapperuma accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday of attempting to gain the opposition\u2019s seal of approval for his political plans in the guise of discussing the 13th amendment to the constitution.",
    "During a press conference held at the party\u2019s headquarters, the MP said that this endeavour, unfortunately, resulted in a complete failure.",
    "\u201cThe President displayed before the entire world exactly how not to hold an all-party meeting,\u201d Alahapperuma said.",
    "According to the MP, his faction participated in the meeting as a responsible political party; however, it was not without a myriad of doubts and suspicions.",
    "\u201cWe felt it was a ploy by the President to obtain the opposition\u2019s endorsement for his political agenda,\u201d he noted.",
    "According to the MP, the public was not presented with an accurate depiction of the meeting. \u201cInstead, they were only informed about a heavily edited version of it,\u201d he said. The MP asserted that the reality was quite different, as the meeting was, in fact, unsuccessful.",
    "The MP questioned the President\u2019s willingness to devolve power, considering his reluctance to conduct Local Government polls. \u201cIs this not a reasonable doubt?\u201d he asked.",
    "Alahapperuma also called on the Government to reach a consensus on the 13A prior to holding discussions with other parties. \u201cThe President holds a different opinion to that of the Premier. The ruling SLPP has an entirely different opinion,\u201d he noted.",
    "\u201cReach a consensus and make an official announcement. Do not confuse the people. Do not increase the doubts in the minds of our Tamil brethren,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe drama over the devolution of powers is a mere tactic aimed at polls,\u201d the MP alleged. Alapahheruma called on the President to prevent any fraudulent manipulation of democracy and the future of the people. \u201cWe urge him to put an end to this deceitful political gambling immediately,\u201d he said."
