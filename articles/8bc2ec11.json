    "United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara, yesterday defended his recent proposal to postpone Sri Lanka\u2019s Presidential Election by two years, citing constitutional provisions and the need for national stability.",
    "Speaking at a press conference held at the UNP headquarters on Monday morning, Bandara emphasised that his proposal was neither undemocratic nor unconstitutional. He asserted that his suggestion was aligned with the provisions of the constitution, particularly referring to Article 86 and 87, which grants the President the authority to submit matters of national importance to the people through a referendum.",
    "Range Bandara came under heavy criticism last week after he suggested the Government must postpone both Parliamentary and Presidential polls for two years. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was forced to assure elections will go ahead as planned despite Range Bandara\u2019s comments.",

He urged all political factions to come together and announce their stance on the matter, emphasising the importance of consensus-building for the nation\u2019s progress.",
    "Bandara emphasised that his call for a referendum was in line with constitutional principles and aimed at preparing the country for future economic challenges, particularly the servicing of substantial debt in 2027. He urged political leaders to prioritise national interests and collaborate on advancing the existing economic program.",
    "In response to criticism, Bandara reiterated his readiness for the presidential election while emphasising the need for a comprehensive approach to address the country\u2019s economic future.",
    "The UNP General Secretary urged political parties to engage in constructive dialogue and collectively work towards the nation\u2019s prosperity."
