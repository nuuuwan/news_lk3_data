    "At the Colombo Tea Auction, the offerings declined to 4.6 million kilogrammes this week that was met with fair demand.",
    "The Ex-Estate offerings too declined and totalled 0.60 million kilogrammes, from 0.70 million kilogrammes the previous week. The overall quality of the teas was not as useful and perhaps against the backdrop of the limited availability, the prices were reasonably maintained, Forbes and Walker Tea Brokers said.",
    "The Best Western BOP/BOPFs, where quality was maintained, were mostly firm, whilst the others declined by Rs.50 per kilogramme and more following quality. In the Below Best category, a few select coloury BOPs appreciated, following special inquiry, whilst the others were firm and up to Rs.50 per kilogramme easier. The corresponding BOPFs sold around last.",
    "At the lower end, the BOPs were barely steady, whilst the corresponding BOPFs were Rs.20-30 per easier, except for select clean leaf coloury sorts, which sold around last week\u2019s levels.",
    "The Nuwara Eliyas continued to sell well. The Uda Pussellawa BOPs were barely maintained, whilst the corresponding BOPFs were Rs.20-30 per kilogramme easier. The Uvas were barely maintained.",
    "The High and Medium Grown CTCs \u2013 BP1s, had hardly any offerings. The PF1s \u2013 Better teas, were firm and up to Rs.50 per kilogramme easier, whilst the poorer sorts, particularly in the Mid Grown category, were often neglected. The corresponding Low Grown varieties \u2013 BP1s, were generally firm, whilst the PF1s too were generally firm, except for the poorer sorts, which declined by up to Rs.50 per kilogramme on average.",
    "The Low Growns comprised of 1.73 million kilogrammes and all categories met with fair demand. The shippers to the CIS, Turkey and Iran were active, in general.",
    "In the Leafy/Semi-Leafy catalogues, the BOP1s in general were firm, whilst the OP1s were lower. The well-made OPs were firm, whilst the balance was easier. The OPAs, in general, were lower. The PEKs were firm to dearer. The Select Best PEK1s were easier, whilst the balance was firm to selectively dearer.",
    "In the Tippy catalogues, the FBOPs in general were firm, whilst the bolder varieties were firm to selectively dearer. The well-made FF1s together with the clean leaf Below Best were firm, whilst the balance was easier, following quality.",
    "In the Premium catalogues, the Very Tippy teas met with good demand and were substantially dearer. The Best and Below Best varieties too were dearer to a lesser extent, whilst the balance sold around last levels."
