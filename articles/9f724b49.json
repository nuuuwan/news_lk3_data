    "Reflecting on the rising public concerns about the legal system, Chief Justice Murdu Fernando acknowledged the challenges posed by archaic or unresponsive laws. \u201cSome speak up stemming from their fair share of disappointment, some talk to correct them, some to make a mockery of the legal system,\u201d she said, underscoring the need for changes in an evolving society.",

    "Commenting on the Constitution, the Chief Justice emphasized that the judiciary must not only defend the Constitution but also act as its active stewards. \u201cIf the Constitution is the beating heart of our country, then the citizens who are sheltered by it will be the blood that flows along its veins.\u201d",
    "Concluding her address, Chief Justice Murdu Fernando said, \u201cThis Legal Symposium will be a crucial step in ensuring this commitment. May it be more than a conversation but the start of a renewal. For justice denied anywhere diminishes justice everywhere.\u201d"
