    "All the noise from various parties has now faded, as Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is set to be sworn in as Sri Lanka\u2019s 9th President, marking the change the public has long awaited. Personally, I\u2019m not concerned with what others think; our responsibility remains to work for our children\u2019s future, regardless of who is in power. Both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa allowed rogue elements from Pohottuwa into their ranks, leading to their downfall, while Namal Rajapaksa was a non-factor, as the results clearly showed.",
    "Sri Lanka needs a true transformation, and after six decades of cyclical politics, it\u2019s evident we require something new. AKD\u2019s platform speaks to this, with the National People's Power (NPP) emphasising that real change is a collective effort that won\u2019t happen overnight. They aim to address key issues like law and order, corruption, and drugs within five years, but success will hinge on public support. They\u2019re not pursuing revenge or shady political deals for short-term gains. If AKD\u2019s vision or NPP\u2019s mandate doesn\u2019t resonate with you, don\u2019t see it as a loss. Instead, recognise the victory in knowing that positive change is coming for the benefit of our children and future generations. While our time may be behind us, we must continue to support the younger generation as they bring fresh ideas and approaches, even if they differ from our own.",
    "A group of Anura Kumara Dissanayake fans pose after the voting",
    "This campaign was riddled with empty rhetoric, with only AKD addressing real issues. Politicians have long recycled outdated stories from the 60s through the 90s, but now is the time to wake up and embrace this change. Unlike Gota, AKD isn\u2019t driven by family interests. His success will depend on minority support, and his ability to take action against corruption will be the ultimate test of his sincerity. Challenges will come from those who have profited from corruption, so AKD must remain vigilant.",
    "However, this is the chance for a complete system overhaul, one that we owe to future generations. The Aragalaya, initiated by the middle class, gained momentum when ordinary citizens stood up against the Government\u2019s mismanagement. Despite opposition politicians benefiting from the movement, it was the working and middle classes who ultimately used their votes to express their frustrations. This is their victory, and even in defeat, we should remain gracious, as AKD has been humble so far in victory.",
    "There are reports that around midnight, the old political guard called AKD to congratulate him on his victory. AKD has already shown his intent for a peaceful transition by calling for a curfew to prevent chaos and ensure a smooth power handover. While the election results may have been delayed due to these precautions, they\u2019re positive signs of his leadership before even taking office. This moment is historic not only for the end of dominance by the green, blue, and political dynasties, but also as a turning point for Sri Lanka. We must unite behind AKD and support the system change that is finally within reach."
