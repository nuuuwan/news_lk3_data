More than 80 earthquakes, the strongest of 6.3 magnitude, struck Taiwan’s east coast starting Monday night and into the early hours of Tuesday and some caused shaking of buildings in the capital Taipei, the island’s weather administration said.

The quakes were centred on the largely rural eastern county of Hualien, where on April 3 at least 14 people died after a 7.2 magnitude temblor. Taiwan has been jolted by hundreds of aftershocks since then.

The fire department in Hualien said early on Tuesday that a hotel which had already been damaged on April 3 and was no longer in operation was now slightly leaning on its side.

Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.

More than 100 people were killed in a quake in southern Taiwan in 2016, while a 7.3 magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people in 1999.

### Why bring science into Buddhist discourse?

Unfortunately, the same mysticism and beliefs that Buddha dispelled two and a half millennia ago have crept back into Buddhism. It is true that some of it has cultural, artistic, or sentimental values. But if the human affliction for beliefs and mysticism, or the shortcomings in our sensory apparatus, are used to exploit the innocent and waste valuable resources that could be put into better use, that would be an insult to Dhamma, its author, and purveyors. The preferred outcome of comparing Buddhism and science would be to enable science savvy young generations to relate to Buddha Dhamma and prevent falling prey to mysticism

### An ‘arriere-pensee’ to proposed debate of SJB vs JVP/NPP

The Leader of the Opposition (LoO) having a public debate with Anura Kumara Dissanayaka (AKD) is simply a mismatch and an insult to the office of the LoO.

It is a globally accepted practice that an argument, debate or a discourse on an important issue or subject has to be conducted between two equal individuals, groups or societies. Otherwise, it will become a joke or useless exercise that fails to meet the expected objectives.

The office of the LoO is a statutorily established legislative body headed by the leader of the second largest political party in Parliament and not affiliated to the government in a parliamentary democracy according to Thomas Erskine May (1815 – 1886).

The Leader of the Opposition is the Prime Minister-in waiting in a Westminster form of governance or in any other legislature that practices a form of parliamentary democracy. He or she has a responsibility to safeguard the honour, dignity and statutory obligations of himself and his office.

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa criticizes the protection of close friends and the focus on conspiracies in politics over education. He emphasizes his independence from "thieves" and the importance of not accepting positions at their mercy.

🟩

The fact that the surviving Sunday attack is due to the fact that even today is the protection of close friends. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that I have no need to protect them because I am not in the mercy of the thieves.

He said that the 161st phase of the universal information technology program was held on Monday when smart classroom equipment worth Rs 10 lakh was presented to the Mulgirigala, Mulgirigala, Weerakettiya Meegarasa Maha Vidyalaya yesterday.

Conspiracy is currently taking place in the politics of the country. The importance of planning conspiracies is not in building education. Such conspiracies are being carried out for power and positions.

If I was sitting in the presidency with the thieves, the thieves would have to protect. I do not need to protect the thieves because I do not accept positions at the mercy of the thieves. The fact that the surviving Sunday attack is still the reason for the lack of exposure to the preservation of their close friends.

### Controls on Political Rights and Civil Freedom in Sri Lanka

*2024-04-22 20:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181717) · `ta`

Freedom House assesses Sri Lanka's political rights and civil freedom, scoring 54/100 for political rights and 32/100 for civil freedom. The report highlights limitations in media freedom, religious freedom, and expression. The government's handling of post-war issues and economic crises have been criticized. Political rights include formal elections and justified election laws, while civil freedoms include freedom of religion and expression.

🟩

In the International Organization of 'Freedom House', the International Organization of 'Freedom House' states that the media freedom in Sri Lanka, the freedom to follow the desired religion, the freedom of expression and the freedom of gathering is limited.

The 'Freedom House', the NGO, which is based on the United States, has released its assessment report on the freedom of the world this year, in the world, promising human rights and democracy.

In the case of Sri Lanka's assessment, the country's 'independence' has been awarded 54 points for political rights, 40 to 22 for political rights and 32 for civil independence.

### A Tale Of Shifting Sentiments & Political Chess

*2024-04-22 20:23:15* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-tale-of-shifting-sentiments-political-chess/) · `en`

As Sri Lanka prepares for both Presidential and General elections, the political scene is filled with anticipation and speculation. With three leading presidential candidates already announced and the SLPP, or Pohottuwa, yet to name theirs, the stage is set for a compelling contest.

The known presidential candidates are Sajith Premadasa of the SJB, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the NPP, and Ranil Wickremesinghe of the UNP (TBA?). The potential SLPP candidates range from Basil Rajapaksa, Dhammika Perera, Dilith Jayaweera, to Namal Rajapaksa, or perhaps a wild card pick. Additionally, Janaka Ratnayake is running as an independent candidate, though his motives remain unclear.

Given the current situation, the most strategic move for Pohottuwa would likely be to ally with Ranil Wickremesinghe by merging SLPP and UNP during the campaign to save face. However, the party’s image requires significant transformation to regain trust of the people without using Marcom tactics.

I am happy to be present here today for the event promoting the Ramayana trail. I thank the organisers for inviting me to this event. I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to the delegation from India led by Swami Govind Dev Giriji. Their presence here confirms that the deep connection between the people of two countries goes back several centuries into antiquity. A time when people and ideas were moving across seamlessly and without the modern impositions that sometimes constrain and restrict easy travel and connections between our peoples. We were reminded of this connect recently by His Excellency President Ranil Wickremesinghe who mentioned that even as we launch the Universal Payments Interface or the UPI in Sri Lanka, which will allow Indian tourists to make payments in Indian rupees in Sri Lanka, there is evidence of the use of each other’s coins or ancient currencies in both India and Sri Lanka deep into our antiquity.
