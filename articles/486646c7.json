    "National Development Bank PLC (NDB) reported resilient performance for the nine months ended 30 September 2024, navigating challenges and optimising emerging opportunities in a reviving economy. NDB\u2019s Director/ CEO, Mr. Kelum Edirisinghe commenting on the results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange on 13 November 2024 stated that \u201cwe are encouraged by the positive trajectory of Net Interest Margins (NIMs), strong cost discipline and improved credit cost. These are a result of the focus we maintain on our strategy to deliver sustainable returns and enhance shareholder value in a rapidly shifting economic landscape. In line with the Bank\u2019s commitment to sustainable growth, we are confident in delivering on our strategic mandate, with strong support from the Board, senior management, and the entire NDB team, reinforcing our contribution to the broader national economic agenda and advancing ESG objectives\u201d he further stated.",
    "NDB recorded a net operating income of Rs. 21.5 Bn for the period under review covering the nine months ended 30 September 2024, a 9% increase over the comparative period of 2023 (YoY). The notable reduction in impairment charges by 21% YoY augured well in maintaining the healthy growth in net operating income against de-growth seen in some key revenue lines. Net interest income remained largely static over the comparative period at Rs. 24.4 Bn, within which both interest income and interest expenses declined, attributable to the tapering interest rate environment in the economy. The timing of the deposits book repricing led to a larger decline in interest rate expenses, benefiting NIM. Driven by the strong strategic focus in this aspect, the Bank posted a NIM of 4.21%, consistently above the 4.00% mark for the third consecutive quarter. Net fee and commission income for the period was Rs. 5.1 Bn which continued to normalise over a relatively high base in 2023 alongside moderate balance sheet expansion, with a YoY decline of 7%.",
    "Impairment charges for the period was Rs. 11.0 Bn, comprising charges on the loan book and investment portfolio. Enhancing loan book quality, another key cog of NDB\u2019s mid-term strategy remained well on track, as demonstrated in continually enhancing related ratios. Impaired Loans (Stage 3) Ratio improved by 213 bps to 6.45%, whilst Impairment (Stage 3) to Stage 3 Loans Ratio increased to 49.40% by 829 bps over the end 2023 position. Strengthening asset book quality in turn bolstered the Bank\u2019s NIMs in the low interest rate climate. On the investment book, the Bank continued to provide adequate provisions in line with prescribed industry norms.",
