    "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court that it has launched a criminal investigation into the alleged involvement of former State Intelligence Services (SIS) Chief Major General Suresh Salley in the Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "The investigation follows a complaint filed by Centre for Society and Religion Executive Director Rev. Fr. Rohan Silva.",
    "According to CID sources, a statement has been taken from Fr. Silva, who made the complaint in relation to claims made in a Channel 4 documentary implicating Major General Salley in the attacks.",
    "The complaint is based on statements made by Hanzeer Azad Maulana, a former aide to Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP) leader Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, also known as Pillaiyan. In the Channel 4 documentary, Maulana accuses Salley of being involved in the attack. Fr. Silva\u2019s complaint calls for an independent investigation into these revelations.",
    "The CID further informed the Court yesterday that Pillaiyan has also been summoned to provide a statement as part of the investigation.",
    "The CID investigations had commenced on the directives of Acting IGP Priyantha Weerasooriya to CID Head DIG P. Ampavila, after the complaint was forwarded to the Public Security Ministry.",
    "Major General Tuan Suresh Salley, named in the Channel 4 documentary, was appointed SIS Director in December 2019 by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. However, following the complaint, Salley was removed from his position by newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake."
