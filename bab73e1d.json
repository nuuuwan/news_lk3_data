    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s debt to gross domestic product ratio had fallen in March 2023 compared to December 2022 as a value change from rupee appreciation outpaced the accumulation of new debt from deficit financing, data shows.",
    "Central government debt was down to 104.74 percent by March 2023 based on a quarterly debt statement down from 114.4 percent in December based on rolling GDP to March.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s real GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2023, but nominal GDP was up due to last year\u2019s inflation. Stable or a strenghtening currency can slow the growth in nominal GDP but can boost real consumption by  disposable incomes of wage earners.",
    "With guaranteed state enterprise and central bank debt, the debt to GDP ratio was 115.55 percent by March, down from 118.6 percent in December.",
    "Central government debt was 27,160 billion rupees, inclusive of 36.0 billion dollars of external debt.  The central bank had borrowed 5.065 billion US dollars but about 1.5 billion dollars from a Chinese swap was intact, reducing net debt.",
    "The central bank can borrow dollars through swaps and also from Asian Clearing Union, sell them and sterilize the interventions with new money effectively re-financing the private sector by allowing banks to give loans without deposits.",
    "The central bank swaps also delay the correction in interest rates, worsening currency crises, critics say.",
    "Central bank swaps were invented by the Fed in the run up to the break-up of the Bretton Woods to delay interest rate corrections and continue stimulus (output gap targeting)",
    "Fed then floated, blasting the Bretton Woods system and the gold standard and triggering the \u2018Great Inflation\u2019 period.",
    "The first wave of sovereign defaults of soft-pegged of countries with unrestrained soft or flexible exchange rate central banks started a decade later as Fed tightened policy.",
    "Sri Lanka also defaulted in 2022 after two years of money printed to cut policy rates, after accumulating foreign debt through two earlier currency crises which also reduced growth and widened deficits. In 2020 taxes were also cut for stimulus or output gap targeting.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee, which is subject to an ad hoc, inconsistent pegging arrangement called flexible exchange rate is vulnerable to aggressive open market operations and liquidity from budget support loans surrendered to the central bank, as soon as credit recovers, analysts have warned.",
    "READ MORE Sri Lanka budget support IMF loans show worrying policy confusion",
    "The rupee slid from 91 to 115 to the US dollar over the space of little over a week, largely due to inconsistent exchange rate policy involving one-sided purchases under the \u2018flexible\u2019 exchange rate, which is neither clean float nor a hard peg. Bank selling rates touched 230 rupees.",

    "A central bank has to follow exchange rate policy (peg) to meet a reserve target under an IMF program.",
