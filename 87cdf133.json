    "The Justice Ministry is in the process of introducing 'Plea Bargaining procedures' in Sri Lanka to ease backlog of a large number of cases in Courts and to ensure justice is delivered through the judicial system, Justice Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.",
    "He told Daily Mirror that 1,127,000 cases are pending in the courts in Sri Lanka and that Plea Bargaining procedure would reduce the number of trials and expedite to conclude the pending cases.",
    "The Minister said a Committee headed by Justice Vijith Malalgoda has been appointed to do a study and draft the provisions to be included in the law.",
    "\u201cWe have conducted several workshops and programmes on the matter with the participation of foreign experts, Chef Justice, Attorney General and Bar Association on the matter,\" he said.",
    "He said 97 percent of cases conclude in the US on Plea Bargaining trial.",
    "\u201cThe system is adopted in Magistrate\u2019s Courts in Sri Lanka as well. But there is no guarantee that convicts who plead guilty on Plea Bargaining would receive reduced sentences. We need to include provisions in the law to give that assurance,\u201d he said.",
    "In plea bargains, prosecutors usually agree to reduce a defendant's punishment after they plead guilty to the charges and agree to recommend that defendants receive reduced sentences. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
