    "For decades, the Indian elite have sought escape in Raj-era private clubs and gymkhanas, scattered around the swankiest neighbourhoods in the country\u2019s big cities, hillside resorts and cantonment towns.",
    "Access to these quintessentially \u201cEnglish\u201d enclaves, with their bellboys, butlers, dark mahogany interiors and rigid dress codes, has been reserved for the privileged; the old moneyed who roam the corridors of power \u2013 think business tycoons, senior bureaucrats, erstwhile royals, politicians or officers of the armed forces.",
    "This is where India\u2019s rich and powerful have hobnobbed for years, building social capital over cigars or squash and brokering business deals during golf sessions. Today, these spaces can feel strangely anachronistic \u2013 relics of a bygone era in a country eager to shed its colonial past.",
    "As Asia\u2019s third largest economy breeds a new generation of wealth creators, a more modern and less formal avatar of the private members-only club \u2013 that reflects the sweeping economic and demographic changes under way in India \u2013 is emerging. This is where the newly well-heeled are hanging out and doing business.",
