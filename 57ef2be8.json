  "original_body_lines": [
    "This special three -part article denoting the 40th the \u201cBlack July\u201d anti-Tamil pogrom concludes  this week. The first part of this article published on 12 July 2023 titled \u201cBlack July: Anatomy of an Anti-Tamil Pogrom\u201d was a brief overview of the horrific anti-Tamil violence that engulfed the Sri Lankan nation in July 1983. The second part of this article  published on 19  July  2023  focussed  primarily on how \u201cBlack July\u201d began in 1983 and its consequences.This week\u2019s article strikes a personal note by narrating the experience of my family and I during the dark days of Black July in 1983.",
    "This  week\u2019s \u201cpolitical pulse\u201d column in a sense is a \u201cfirst\u201d for me. Although I have written extensively about Black July in the past, I have never written about those happenings from a personal perspective. As a Sri Lankan Tamil journalist, Black July did have an effect on me in both  personal and professional capacities. Furthermore my family \u2013 like thousands of other Tamil families \u2013 was also affected and displaced during those turbulent times.",
    "Yet, I have refrained from writing about the impact of Black July on our family for two  reasons. Firstly I was spared the full blast of that violence because I was not in Colombo then. I  was on assignment to cover the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) party convention in Mannar. Secondly my family members though affected were fortunate in not having to undergo suffering  or  suffer losses on the scale of what some other Tamil families underwent then.",
    "My family was forced to abandon home in Ratmalana and hide among bushes in a marsh infested by Kabaragoyas and snakes to avoid a mob. Both my father and brother were caught up in a mob on the infamous \u201c tiger Friday\u201d on 29 July 1983 and escaped miraculously. My mother and two sisters were compelled to relocate to Jaffna. Nevertheless our family felt blessed in  the sense that none of us were killed or physically hurt. As such I  never wrote about July 1983 from a personal angle because I thought my family\u2019s experience did not warrant it. Also I did not want to revive those painful memories.",
    "What changed my mind was the exceptionally large volume of responses I have been receiving  \u2013 from persons known and unknown to me \u2013 since the publication of the first and second parts of this article. Most of these responses were about their  own experiences during Black July. Many asked me specifically about my personal experience.",
    "When I responded briefly, I was asked   by many, to place this on record as other  Black July victims had done and were doing. A particularly dear friend to whom I related some details insisted \u201cwrite all this David. Every single thing\u201d.It is against this backdrop therefore that I write this week on \u201cMy Family\u2019s Experience of Black July  Forty Years ago\u201d. Much of what I write is what I heard from my family members about their ordeal.",
    "My family comprised six persons in 1983. My parents, two sisters,  brother and myself. I was the eldest followed by a sister, brother and sister. None of the children were married then. My father was a lawyer based in Kurunegala. My mother was also a teacher in Kurunegala. So too was the elder of my two sisters. My brother and I were working in Colombo, staying separately. My youngest sister was studying for her  GCE  (A) exam.",
    "My mother retired as a teacher in May 1982. After retirement, she wanted to move to Colombo and be with her children. She had earlier taught in Colombo for 17 years and always felt that Colombo was home. So we rented a part of a hiuse along Cascia avenue in Ratmalana. My mother ,brother and youngest  sister resided there. My father and my other sister remained in Kurunegala and  would come over to Colombo for the week-ends. I continued to retain my room in Kotahena as I used to work late nights then at \u201cThe Island\u201d.  I would shuttle between Kotahena and Ratmalana relying on the 155 bus. My sister was trying to get a transfer to Colombo and live in Ratmalana.",
    "On Friday 22 July 1983  morning I left for Mannar to cover the TULF convention. I was in Mannar during the week-end when the anti-Tamil violence erupted. My father and sister had come down to Ratmalana for the  July 23-24 week-end. My sister a teacher at the Tamil school in Kurunegala departed early morning on Monday July 25th to take the bust at Pettah and return to Kurunegala. My father stayed on intending to return to Kurunegala on Tuesday.",
    "My brother   went to his workplace at Maradana in the morning.It was after he reached office that he heard of the overnight violence and how it was spreading. He  went in a friend\u2019s vehicle to Pettah in a futile bid to stop my sister from returning to Kurunegala. But she had already left. He then  went back to Ratmalana in the same vehicle witnessing  scenes of mob violence along the way.",
    "Our  Sinhala landlord  was living in the adjacent section of the  same house we were  in. He came over and said he had news of anti \u2013 tamil violence in Borella and Thimbirigasaya. He advised my family to hide in the marsh behind our house if a mob attacked. Meanwhile thetmorning newspapers had published news of 13 soldiers being killed by the  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Jaffna. This news was  also relayed  over TV and Radio on the same day.",
    "Mobs went into action in Ratmalana too. The mob that came down Cascia avenue was led by the son of a United National Party(UNP) municipal councillor. My parents, brother and sister went behind to the marsh and concealed themselves in the bushes. There were water monitors and snakes moving about. My father and brother were armed with a large kitchen knife and hoe. My mother had had a minor accident some weeks ago and found it exceedingly difficult to crouch.",
    "The mob  leaders  came to our  landlord and inquired from him about my family. They had details of Tamils living in the vicinity. Our landlord  said that his tenants had lled early morning upon hearing of the troubles. The mob then went to our entrance and attempted to break open the door. Some petrol was poured  on the porch floor in a bid to set fire.  When our landlord protested ,he was told that they wanted to burn our furniture.  Our landlord pleaded with the mob not to do so, saying the furniture belonged to him and not to the tenants. The mob then went off warning our landlord to inform them if my family returned home.",
    "After nightfall, my family left the marsh and went back to the house through the rear. They spent the night  .without putting on the lights. All seemed quiet at the crack of dawn on Tuesday July 26th. Our landlord wanted us to leave his house. My parents and two siblings walked to the Mt.Lavinia Police station seeking protection. It was very early in the morning.There was no trouble along the way. Several Tamil families were at the station. Trade and shipping minister Lalith Athulathmudali who was also Ratmalana MP was present. After a while the Police escorted the families including mine to the newly set up refugee camp at the Ratmalana airport.",
    "As was to be expected the conditions at the overcrowded Airport camp were terrible. Lack of space, poor  sanitary facilities and inadequate food were but some of the problems. People related or known  avoided each   other  because they were ashamed. People who had lived comfortably were now in a dirty,unwashed,  disshevelled state wearing the same stinking clothes.",
    "Mt family\u2019s worry then was about my sister in Kurunegala. They knew I would be safe  in Mannar. There were reports of a Kurunegala bound bus from Colombo  being stopped at Alawwa and all Tamil passengers being killed and hung on the bridge. So my family kept worrying whether she was safe or not. As for me I was worried sick about what may have befallen my family while I was safe in Mannar.",
    "My sister however had reached  Kurunegala safely. She stayed indoors at home quietly  without  venturing out. Her worry was about the rest of the family.  One of our neighbours  was a senior Sinhala police officer. So  Tamils in the neighbourhood were well  protected. But it must be said that the K\u2019gala district experienced little anti \u2013 tamil violence in 1983. This was mainly due to the then  North Western range  DIG Cyril Herath. He became IGP later.",
    "In my case I  too was frantic with anxiety about the fate of my family. I assumed that my sister would not have returned to Kurunegala and that  my  family would have been in Ratmalana. In those days there were no mobile phones.Our landlord did not have a telephone.",
    "There was also the problem of  gaining access to a telephone in Mannar and calling long distance to Colombo. Fortunately for me I made contact with a Tamil public official named Terrence Philippupillai who was the secretary of the then Mannar district minister MEH Maharoof. President JR Jayewardene had appointed district ministers for each administrative district then. Mutur MP Maharoof was appointed District minister for Mannar. Incidentally  current SJB Trincomalee district MP Imran Maharoof is MEH Maharoof\u2019s son",
    "In those days I used to write a weekly column \u201cBehind the Cadjan Curtain\u201d for \u201cSunday island\u201d. I  found to my delight that the Mannar DM\u2019s secretary Terence  was a regular reader and a fan. He was most accommodative and helpful. Furthermore he introduced me to a number of other top Govt officials in Mannar who were also my readers and fans. Thus telephone access was not a problem thereafter.",
    "I was in regular touch with \u201cThe Island\u201deditorial from Mannar. The editor Vijitha Yapa was out of the country when  Black July began. The then deputy editor Gamini Weerakoon was in charge.I kept myself informed of what was happening by calling the editorial regularly. My colleagues and friends Ajith Samaranayake and Prasad Gunewardene took the office vehicle to Ratmalana and found out through our landlord that my family was safe at the Airport camp. Ajith and Prasad  went there but could not make contact with my family because  they were looking for \u201cJeyaraj\u2019s family whereas my family was registered at the camp as the Sabapathyfamily.",
    "In the meantime the authorities at the Ratmalana Airport camp began allowing people to make local calls.  My parents got in touch with one of my cousins, Noble Vethanayagam. He was a  UNP member of the Colombo District Development Council (DDC)and  closely associated with  Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa at that time. Noble Anna had moved to a new house in Bambalapitiya and  turned his  earlier residence in Hulftsdorp into his political office.",
    "My cousin Noble Anna\u2019s  Hulfsdorp house had transformed into a mini-refugee camp with relatives seeking \u201casylum \u201cthere. It had Police protection. Arrangements were made for my family to move to Noble Anna\u2019s place in Colombo 12.  Three Methodist clergymen were to help us move to Hulftsdorp. My family and most of our relatives are Methodists.",
    "On Friday July 29th , three Methodist priests  arrived in a van to take my family to Hulftsdorp. The van had some others who were also to be dropped off elsewhere. Since the vehicle was already crammed, it was decided that my mother and sister would go in the van while my father and brother would follow  by bus. The violence in Colombo and outskirts had subsided by Thursday  28th and things seemed to be  slowly returning to normal. But the situation changed suddenly.",
    "There had been a recurrence of violence in Sea Street and a rumour began spreading that the tigers were attacking Colombo. This was only a rumour but it provided a pretext for Tamils to be attacked again. Sadky several Tamils who had left the relative safety of refugee camps were brutally murdered on that notorious \u201cKoti dawasa\u201d or tiger day. Both my father and brother had narrow escapes on that Friday.",
    "They had started out from the Airport camp and walked to Galle road from where they intended taking a bus,taxi or three-wheeler to Hulftsdorp. My mother and sister were going there with the Methodist pastors. But when they reached Galle road,  both got caught up in a furious mob going in search of Tamils again. Both got separated in the melee.",
    "My brother mingled with the mob and became part of it for a while. A section of the mob began marching down to the Airport camp threatening to destroy  the Tamil  refugees there. My brother marched along with them uttering slogans. Once the mob reached the airport, my brother  slipped out and went into the camp showing his camp ID card. The mob ranted and raved abusing in raw filth,  the vaval personnel guarding it. But the sailors stood firm and gradually the mob dispersed.",
    "My father had a nasty encounter with another section of the mob. Some suspected he was a Tamil and threatened him. Since my father spoke Sinhala perfectly with the correct diction, they could not detect his ethnicity. Then he was asked to recite a  Buddhist Gatha. My father replied truthfully that he was a Christian and not a Buddhist. Someone squeezed his neck. My father gasped in Sinhala \u201cis it worth your while to kill an old man like me\u201d. He was let off.My father also went back to the Airport camp.",
    "The van with  Methodist clergymen was also accosted by a mob. The Sinhala  pastors  talked their way out. It was however decided that travelling to Colombo city was dangerous. So the vehicle  changed course and reached Moratuwa. My mother and sister were given shelter at a  Sinhala Methodist residence in Rawatawatte over the week-end. On  July 31 Sunday evening , the Methodist  clergymen took my mother and sister to Hulftsdorp.",
    "They were in for a happy and pleasant surprise. My other sister in Kurunegala had come to the safe house in Hulftsdop barely half an hour earlier. She was brought there in a Police jeep thanks to the help of the Sinhala Police officer neighbour. My father and brother also came to Hulftsdop on Monday. The whole family -except myself \u2013  was united again.",
    "The Hulftsdop house was full of people as more  relatives  had flocked there. So it was decided that only the women and children would stay there. My father and brother moved out and subsequently found accommodation at the refugee camp set up at S. Thomas \u2018 College Mt.Lavinia.",
    "My family informed \u201cThe Island\u201d that all were safe and that my mother and sisters were at our cousin Noble\u2019s house in Hulftsdorp. I spoke to them by telephone from the  Mannar district minister\u2019s office.",
    "I returned to Colombo on 4th August 1983. The sixth Constitutional Amendment disavowing separatism was passed on that day. Muhammed a  Muslim journalist friend in Mannar who was the local correspondent for a Tamil newspaper had made arrangements with a Muslim businessman to give me a ride to  his hometown Kandy. I was to pose as a Muslim relative of his in case there was trouble.",
    "The  violence had dimished by then and the journey by car from Mannar to Kandy was uneventful. I got into a Colombo bound bus from Kandy and went straight to the Island office at Bloemendhal road. My friends and colleagues were happy to see me. I plunged into work and started writing immediately under my byline. This was my way of coping with what had happened. Upon seeing my byline in the newspaper, many friends , contacts and news sources began phoning and talking to me.",
    "I stayed in the Island premises, eating at the Sinhala and Muslim restaurants close to the office. I bathed in the shower at the drivers quarters and slept at night on the editorial dept t desks using the newspaper files as pillow. My friends Ajith, Prasad and Kule (KC Kulasinghe) would keep me company at night",
    "The editor Vijitha Yapa who had returned to  Sri Lanka was worried about my sleeping over in the office and using the drivers quarters to bathe. There were rumours that a particular driver was  in the forefront of a mob that attacked Tamls in Homagama. Ironically the driver in question was extremely fond of me and very concerned about my safety.",
    "Vijitha Yapa who had for long been a member of the MRA (Moral Re-armament) organization was worried  about my safety. He was a sensitive soul who broke down and cried in front of me apologizing for the hurt done to Tamils by some Sinhalese. Vijitha  put me up in a secluded room at his mother -in \u2013 law\u2019s house. Vijitha would pick me up in his car  in the mornings and drop me off later. At night",
    "It was a well-meaning gesture by the editor  and my hostess was most kind and considerate. Much as I appreciated their kindness,  I was  somewhat uncomfortable about imposing myself upon them.",
    ". So I returned to my room at Kotahena. It was part of a large hostel with  over 30 Tamil boarders. It was now deserted. I slept alone in my room and continued to work at the Island editorial. Gradually others too began returning and in a few months time the place was buzzing as usual.",
    "Meanwhile my family tried to return to Ratmalana but our landlord would not allow it saying that he was frequently asked about our whereabouts and warned not to let us return. So my mother and two sisters went by train to my mother\u2019s ancestral village Kaddaively in Jaffna. After  some weeks, we shifted our furniture from Ratmalana to Jaffna as our former landlord wanted it removed.",
    "My father returned to Kurunegala while my brother and I continued to live and work in Colombo. After some months my sister had to return to work in Kurunegala or lose her job as a teacher. Under those circumstances my mother and two sisters left Jaffna and  returned to Kurumegala.",
    "Thereafter my parents and sisters lived in Kurunegala. My brother and I were in Colombo. The important thing was that all members of the family were safe and had \u201csurvived\u201d Black July. We were blessed in that way.  What was most upsetting in those days was not knowing what had happened or whether all were safe.",
    "This then is the story of my family\u2019s Black July experience 40 years ago. It is but one of the  many stories of that time. Each tale was different in the details but all were the same in essence. I have tried to narrate my tale in a detached manner but   going down memory lane and recounting the Black July experience has been quite emotional and painful. Yet I am glad that I wrote about it after  four decades.E I hope and pray that the Black July Anti-Tamil pogrom will never  happen again.",
