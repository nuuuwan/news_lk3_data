  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 Member of Parliament, Dilith Jayaweera emphasized the party\u2019s commitment to guiding the government on the right path over the next five years.",
    "Delivering his first parliamentary speech today (06), Jayaweera attributed the election results to widespread public frustration, the absence of viable alternatives, and growing disillusionment with political deceit.",
    "\u201cThe political culture, coupled with the allegations of corruption surrounding it and the false images it perpetuates, has disheartened patriotic Sri Lankans who have historically supported the leftist political camp. The votes we received reflect that disappointment. Therefore, do not assume for a moment that we failed to engage with your manifesto, skipped your five lectures, or misunderstood your politics,\u201d he said.",
    "He further said that he suggested that the election results reflected the opposition\u2019s lack of effectiveness and expressed a willingness to offer sincere support, emphasizing a spirit of unity and collaboration.",
    "\u201cWe want to see this government move on the right path for the next five years. That is what we are committed to. Therefore, the way this weak opposition acted is one of the reasons why the people had no option to cast their vote.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey talked about the corruption taking place in this country\u2019s politics. That is good. And they talked about the misdeeds that are happening. But even more than that, they said false things. They said false things about me as well. But you need to remember that this vote was cast based on a decision oscillating between those false facts and the true facts, and that was one of the reasons why the people made this decision,\u201d he added."
