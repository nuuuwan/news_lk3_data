  "original_body_lines": [
    "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 71 Palestinians in a designated humanitarian zone in Gaza on Saturday, the enclave\u2019s health ministry said, in an attack that Israel said targeted Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif.",
    "It was unclear whether Deif was killed. \u201cWe are still checking and verifying the results of the strike,\u201d an Israeli military official told reporters.",
    "The militant Islamist group Hamas said in a statement that Israeli claims it had targeted leaders of the group were false and aimed at justifying the attack, which was the deadliest Israeli attack in Gaza in weeks.",
    "Displaced people sheltering in the area said their tents were torn down by the force of the strike, describing bodies and body parts strewn on the ground.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t even tell where I was or what was happening,\u201d said Sheikh Youssef, a resident of Gaza City who is currently displaced in the Al-Mawasi area.",
    "\u201cI left the tent and looked around, all the tents were knocked down, body parts, bodies everywhere, elderly women thrown on the floor, young children in pieces,\u201d he told Reuters.",
    "The Israeli military said the strike against Deif also targeted Rafa Salama, the commander of Hamas\u2019 Khan Younis Brigade, describing them as two of the masterminds of the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the nine-month war in Gaza.",
    "Deif has survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021 and has topped Israel\u2019s most wanted list for decades, held responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.",
    "The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 Palestinians were killed in the strike and 289 injured, the deadliest toll in weeks in the conflict-shattered enclave.",
    "Al-Mawasi is a designated humanitarian area that the Israeli army has repeatedly urged Palestinians to head to after issuing evacuation orders from other areas.",
    "Reuters footage showed ambulances racing towards the area amidst clouds of smoke and dust. Displaced people, including women and children, were fleeing in panic, some holding belongings in their hands.",
    "The Israeli military published an aerial photo of the site, which Reuters was not immediately able to verify, where it said \u201cterrorists hid among civilians\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe location of the strike was an open area surrounded by trees, several buildings, and sheds,\u201d it said in a statement.",
    "The Israeli military official said the area was not a tent complex, but an operational compound run by Hamas and that several more militants were there, guarding Deif.",
    "Many of those wounded in the strike, including women and children, were taken to the nearby Nasser Hospital, which hospital officials said had been overwhelmed and was \u201cno longer able to function\u201d due to the intensity of the Israeli offensive and an acute shortage of medical supplies.",
    "\u201cThe hospital is full of patients, it\u2019s full of wounded, we can\u2019t find beds for people,\u201d said Atef al-Hout, director of the hospital, adding that it was the only one still operating in southern Gaza.",
    "Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was holding special consultations, his office said, in light of \u201cdevelopments in Gaza\u201d.",
    "It was unclear how the strike would affect ceasefire talks underway in Doha and Cairo.",
    "The Hamas-run media office said at least 100 people had been killed and wounded in the Khan Younis attack, including members of the Civil Emergency Service.",
    "A senior Hamas official did not confirm whether Deif had been present and called the Israeli allegations \u201cnonsense\u201d.",
    "\u201cAll the martyrs are civilians and what happened was a grave escalation of the war of genocide, backed by the American support and world silence,\u201d Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters, adding the strike showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire deal.",
    "Critics have accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians, which Israel denies. It characterises its actions as self-defense to prevent another attack like Oct. 7, though the International Court of Justice ordered Israel in January to take action to prevent acts of genocide.",
    "Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in the cross-border raid into southern Israel on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies.",
    "Israel has retaliated with military action in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, medical authorities in Gaza say.",
    "Separately on Saturday, at least 17 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack on a prayer hall at a Gaza camp for displaced people in west Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said.",
    "Witnesses said the Khan Younis attack came as a surprise as the area had been calm, adding more than one missile had been fired. Some of the wounded who were being evacuated were rescue workers, they said.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re all gone, my whole family\u2019s gone ... where are my brothers? They\u2019re all gone, they\u2019re all gone. There\u2019s no one left,\u201d said one tearful woman, who did not give her name.",
    "Rising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group\u2019s network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise, Hamas sources say.",
    "In March, Israel said it killed Deif\u2019s deputy, Marwan Issa. Hamas has since neither confirmed, nor denied his death."
