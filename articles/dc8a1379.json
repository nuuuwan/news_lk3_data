    "My brother boasted he announced to the household and immediate neighbourhood the stunning news on September 1, 1939, by placing a painted placard on the door of our play tent in Katukelle, Kandy, which read War is Declared. I did not know who was warring against whom; however pictures of Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler were etched in my child\u2019s mind. And then restrictions and change of mode of living were felt with; however, a sense of complete security with widowed Mother managing things well, assisted by Grandfather.",
    "We soon felt the effects of war: difficulty in getting imported stuff like butter and cheese due to shipping to and from the UK being highly restricted. Torpedo laden German submarines prowled the oceans. Even local food was restricted because vast numbers of soldiers stationed in the island had to be fed \u2013 mostly local food. Later more were stationed in Kandy; the South East Asia Command (SEAC) being headquartered in Peradeniya. Dashingly handsome Lord Louis Mountbatten \u2013 Head of SEAC \u2013 resided in the Peradeniya Gardens, seen horse riding in Udawathakele. This was during the latter years of WW II when fighting was severe in the Far East, Japan having bombed Pearl Harbour on December 8, 1941.",
    "Hundreds of soldiers were billeted in Kandy, its environs and more in Peradeniya. They were differentiated by us kids as \u2018White\u2019 \u2013 British, Canadian and Australian; Indian \u2013 with some in turbans, the name Gurkha being mentioned; and \u2018Black\u2019 \u2013 from African countries. The last were the most dreaded by us children but more so by villagers. Rare consequences of secret co-habiting were evident later by the birth of unusually dark babies with crinkly hair. Presumably more consensual than rape; soldiers being generous with money, food stuff and cigarettes. Discipline was strict among them.",
    "As I mentioned earlier, food was scarce. Oliver Goonetilake was Food Commissioner liaising with the foreign army commanders. One could not even transport one\u2019s own paddy and rice from owned village fields without a permit from the Kandy Kachcheri. Mother was managing things competently with my eldest brother helping. His greater help was keeping a strict eye on my three elder sisters\u2019 friendships. Our family, like many others, was conservative. Romances were strictly debarred, but the elder two had their love interest intact, with secrecy. Exchanged letters and brief encounters in the much chaperoned gatherings of family friends, was all they enjoyed. I remember clearly running to the postbox at the junction of the upper Peradeniya Road and the lower road to the Kandy market, to post letters. They were my second sister\u2019s correspondence with a relative, disapproved of by Mother as a mere clerk. She had ambitions for this most beautiful daughter: marriage to a higher grade public servant.",
    "I also remember a widow who had seen much better times with her husband, who shot himself. Many a day she would visit, pleading with Mother to let her have some raw rice. Pity would overcome Mother\u2019s fear of being detected \u2018transporting rice\u2019 \u2013 a punishable offence. Thus son Teddy arriving surreptitiously late in the evening to collect a bag of rice through a window in our front room.",
    "Air raid practices were soon initiated in Kandy. The moment the ominous wail of the siren was heard we hurried under a bed with pencils stuck across mouths. An air raid shelter was built in the neighbourhood; Mother said we were not going down in it. Why? No exposure of elder daughters to the scrutiny of other shelter seekers and Air Raid Wardens. In schools, these practices were on at least once a week. Miss Allen, Principal Girls\u2019 High School where we were students, would blow her whistle and march from block to block peeping into classrooms. Sometimes, kids in our class \u2013 Middle Kindergarten (age 6) \u2013 would fall asleep on their desks! A second whistle ended the practice session.",
    "Blackout was strictly enforced with less lights being switched on or lamps in homes lit. No road lights. Very thick curtains were insisted upon and if streaks of light escaped outside, the Warden in charge of the area would visit and reprimand.",
    "We never went outdoors after early sunset. Mother was particularly apprehensive of soldiers coming to our verandah with dating girls in mind. This was mostly due to the next door Burgher family entertaining soldiers for evening parties. Sylvia, the grown up daughter, would play the piano and sing while couples ballroom-danced; considered a heinous crime by Mother. It was whispered that that home had plenty butter, corned beef, chocolates and other forbidden luxuries. Maybe alcohol too was brought in by the soldiers.",
    "One probably drunken soldier did enter our verandah one early night. Mother gathered all of us like an enfolding hen and we silently shivered. A rickshaw coolie parked his vehicle in the open front verandah and slept therein too; a security guard to us. He intrepidly rose to the occasion and persuaded or man-handled the intruder. Mother was so thankful that henceforth he was served dinner and breakfast!",
    "It happened one early night that the next door neighbor \u2013 Fernandos \u2013 had to be visited to get some brandy probably, which was a panacea for all ailments then, or ginger to boil Kottamalli. Mother opted to take me along \u2013 her escort \u2013 leaving my older brother to guard the sisters. Mother decided to exit from our back door and walk along on the lower road, since Peradeniya Road was full of soldiers returning to their barracks. I remember clearly my mother clutching tight my hand and us entering a totally dark road. But glowing with many red lights surging forward. They were the lighted cigarettes between lips of a multitude of walking soldiers. Knocking on the Fernando\u2019s back door we got what we wanted and Mr Fernando magnanimously walked us back to our door. I still picture that scene: the marching boots with no bodies seen, only the red brightening and dimming as cigarettes were smoked.",
    "Totally unaware of the dread suffered by the elders due to the soldiers\u2019 presence in vast numbers, we kids quite enjoyed showing the V sign to passing, open backed vans and trucks that traversed Peradeniya Road. We would stop our evening games in neighbours\u2019 homes and run out on the road with the sign for victory held above our heads with the first and second fingers raised. We were often rewarded for our \u2018patriotism\u2019 with the soldiers throwing us chocolates, sweets and packets of chewing gum (forbidden by mothers then as teeth damagers).",
    "Shipping to England was especially dangerous and thus resident British were greatly inconvenienced, being deprived of their annual furloughs in the home country and delays or non-arrival of newspapers and letters. We once were at morning Assembly in the KHS hall when Miss Allen announced the death of our Irish Vice Principal, sailing to UK when the ship she was on board was torpedoed.",
    "I suppose this restriction was suffered by planters in our tea estates, at that time all British. It was later that locals were recruited as \u2018creepers\u2019 and took over estates and enjoyed furloughs in Britain, traveling by ship.",
    "Things were hotting up world-wide with two ferocious wars on-going in two regions: Europe and the Far East. The Japanese armies had advanced almost to the Indian border. Ceylon was embroiled with SEAC stationed here and the Trincomalee harbor used for naval forays and as a refuge for attacked Allied ships. Colombo suffered an air attack on Easter Sunday April 5, 1942, the target of the raid being the destruction of the British Eastern Fleet in the Trincomalee Harbour. Much has been written about this and a later Japanese air raid.",
    "There was unease even in Kandy. My elder sister was married and living in Katugastota. This brother\u2013in-law, more a father to us siblings than an in-law, suggested we move to his sister\u2019s home where he and my sister were living then. Many schools closed temporarily and some opened branches in securer areas in the Hill Country.",
    "We moved to Ranawana, Katugastota, and lived with a family of five children. The generosity of the host family is remembered with joy and gratitude.",
    "And then on May 8, 1945, the war in Europe was over with Allied Forces marching as conquerors to Germany \u2013 VE Day. The war in the Far East ended on August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan signed by Emperor Hirohito. The day was named VJ Day.",
    "Gradually the situation in Kandy, especially, moved to how it had been before the war. We returned to our home on Peradeniya Road, Katukelle, to a secure life and resumed schooling which we had missed for months.",
    "Easter Sunday, April 21, 2019, is still painfully fresh in mind and kept in the news by the quest for the mastermind that goaded or encouraged the terrorist suicide bombing of three churches and three luxury hotels in Colombo. Some 269 people lost their lives, including at least 45 foreigners and three police officers and eight suicide bombers while 500 were injured.",
    "Neither the affected families nor the Catholic Church have had the comfort of closure of this most terrible tragedy. Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith keeps insisting on the truth being bared as he firmly believes there was a hidden hand behind the bombings \u2013 not solely that of the Islamic die-hards nor ISIS \u2013 but an instigating political push given them. The latest is ex Prez Sirisena declaring he knows who was, or whom were, the instigators of the massive massacre for personal gain. Sri Lanka needs to have the truth out and due compensation paid those who suffered.",
