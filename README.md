### Seven reasons why I would not vote for a socialist utopia

*2024-05-10 05:39:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Seven-reasons-why-I-would-not-vote-for-a-socialist-utopia/4-761621) · `en`

Effectively steering the economic agenda of an entire nation requires an entirely different skill set

There is a certain age that socialism sounds super sweet. Who wouldn’t appreciate a system in which everyone lives merrily, receives free education and healthcare, shares their food with others, and experiences a sense of community and compassion? Who would not want a highly paying government job whether you study hard or not?

In this ideal society, there are no grievances about the contributions made for the greater good. Individuals are duly recognised with bronze medals for their exemplary efforts. We hold admiration for the industriousness displayed in factories and fields, where the masses work diligently and joyfully express their solidarity through revolutionary songs. We applaud when a leader reminiscent of Lenin emphasises that the best things are for the children. Truly, this superlative utopia leaves no room for comparison.

The aim of these states is to partner with Sri Lanka and create a positive opinion in the eyes of the people and those in governance as they continue their tug-of-war with China

In the lead up to Sri Lanka’s Presidential election in October 2024, there have been numerous visits by foreign governments to create a good rapport with the various candidates. Visits by great powers to Sri Lanka appear to be a tradition before a national election or during global calamities. My analyses over the years indicate an increase in the frequency of interactions and their breadth during the visits.

In order to ascertain this tug-of-war, this article is divided into three sections: first, the QUAD visits; second, the Chinese engagements, and third Sri Lanka’s future in the Indian Ocean.

*2024-05-10 05:18:35* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Revitalising-Sri-Lanka-s-future-Path-forward-with-export-oriented-manufacturing-economy/4-761615) · `en`

The importance of entrepreneurs as the backbone of our economy should be recognised and honoured

Sri Lanka has been through an unprecedented macroeconomic crisis with a complete economic meltdown since 2022 resulting from years of financial mismanagement, and the current global recession resulted from the scarring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and many other factors. To date, the country indicates signs of stabilisation but, still faces challenges with elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labour market concerns.

Given these challenges, the Government needs to carefully plan monetary and fiscal policies and implement growth-enhancing structural reforms to emerge from the current economic crisis, while laying the foundation for improving long-term green, resilient, and inclusive growth prospects. Future generations desperately require us to develop our country to give them a chance to live a comfortable life when it becomes their turn.

### Plantation workers' salary increase -Harini Amarasuriya

*2024-05-10 02:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183101) · `ta`

Harini Amarasuriya criticizes the government's plan to increase plantation workers' daily wage to 1700 rupees, arguing it's a deceptive move. She suggests changing the basic salary instead. The government's gazette notification, she claims, is a ploy to mislead workers, as plantation companies are likely to challenge it. She also criticizes an amendment aimed at protecting night-shift women workers, arguing it fails to address their real issues like transport facilities.

🟩

Gazette Notification on Plantation Workers' Salary Increase Action. National People's Power Member Harini Amarasuriya said the government should change their basic salary if they need to carry out a salary increase.

He said this while addressing the debate on the Parliament on Thursday (9).

The government has issued a gazette notification to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to 1700 rupees. This is the play that deceives workers. If the government is increasing the salaries of plantation workers, they must change their basic salary and thereby convert the base salary to 1700 rupees.

On the contrary. Salary Increase is a play -labeled play by the president on May 1st. Everyone, including the President and the Minister of Labor, know that plantation companies go to court against the gazette notification. They know that this cannot be implemented.

So the salary increase for plantation workers is a gazette notification to mislead the plantation workers and deceive them.

Sri Lankans may be wary of trusting their instincts given their bad experiences with politicians. This is a country where the majority of the citizenry hasn’t had the fortune of receiving a university education. Hence, for some of them, trust must be built on instinct.

This instinct is the tool people relied on when electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa as president. He was the last Executive of this country who was elected through the vote of the people. The instinct in people that this president would deliver proved the former horribly wrong.

This is a country where its regime initiates programmes in a hurry and then repents. The latest is the new visa system where users are subject to paying higher fees. The new visa portal- which operates online- replaces the old system where visas were issued more efficiently through an Electronic Travel Authorization system. Now there is all-round criticism aimed at the new visa system.

With or without a ceasefire deal, Israel has vowed to launch its grand invasion into Rafah, the Gaza Strip’s southernmost 64-square-kilometre area, where more than 1.5 million repeatedly battered and displaced Palestinians are crammed. Israeli troops have moved into Rafah and are now controlling the eastern part of the Rafah border with Egypt.

Those who closely follow Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza know that Rafah has been under regular Israeli bombardments almost from the beginning of the war, even though the Benjamin Netanyahu government had declared southern Gaza, including Rafah, a safe zone and urged the people in northern Gaza to move there.

Dr. KK Arulanandan warns that prolonged high sea temperatures could destroy Sri Lanka's coral reefs, threatening marine life. Coral reefs require a stable 27-28°C to form, and excessive heat causes them to lose color and bleed, indicating destruction.

🟩

It is reported that if the current increased sea temperature lasts a month, the coral reefs around Sri Lanka will be at risk.

The newly appointed Director General of the National Water Research Research Development Management (Nara), Dr. KK Arulanandan, said this to an English media.

The temperature of the sea should be fluctuated at 27-28 degrees Celsius for the formation of coral reefs.

He pointed out that if the current increased temperature lasts a month or more, coral reefs are expected to be destroyed.

When the heat of seawater increases more than usual, corals lose their color and begin to bleed. This will help you know the destruction of coral reefs. If the coral reefs are destroyed, a large number of marine life, including fish, will be affected. ”. Remble

### Ignoring The Whale, While Hooking The Sprat

Every Party manifesto and every government statement, solemnly vows to eradicate poverty, but have not done so, for seventy six years, since Independence in 1948. The performance of the present government is no better. Since we are hailed (mostly by ourselves) as a “Star Class Democracy,” that has changed governments peacefully. Despite the record of (language riots of 1958), the attempted (coup of 1962) youth insurrections of (1971 and 1988 to 1989) and the civil war (1983-2009).

Changes of government “by the ballot, and not by the bullet”. One hopes that the failures are indicative of poor planning, and not the lack of skill in handling explosives. The fact that there have been repeated changes of governments, means that all political parties have to share the blame. I do not believe that any Party has “won” an election, but rather that the preceding one was kicked out by a disappointed electorate.

### Unraveling The Root Causes Of Sri Lanka’s Foreign Currency Crisis

Pre-1978, Sri Lanka upheld economic independence through stringent controls on trade and capital, fostering a production-based economy and eschewing foreign indebtedness. However, the victory of the United National Party in 1978 marked a pivotal shift, embracing free market ideology and neoliberal policies. This shift has brought forth a multitude of economic challenges. Certain individuals often labeled as economic parasites have taken advantage of free market ideology to infiltrate critical sectors such as finance, health, education, energy, media, agriculture, and land. Their primary focus is personal gain, disregarding the nation’s overall welfare. Through regulatory manipulation, this elite class exploits both public and private wealth, masking their actions as societal advancement while prioritizing their own interests.

### From Socialism To Success: Sweden’s Economic Evolution

*2024-05-09 18:58:50* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/from-socialism-to-success-swedens-economic-evolution/) · `en`

Both Sweden and Sri Lanka profess to follow Democratic Socialism. But Sweden has seemingly produced a more successful economy. This has led to the popularly held belief that Sweden is an example of Democratic Socialism done right. In this article a brief economic history of Sweden is provided (as published in “The Power of Capitalism” by Rainer Zitelmann). The details show that this popular belief is in fact incorrect.

In the early 19th century Sweden was a very poor country. This was due to the existence of guilds which hindered the freedom of trade and imposed price controls. However, in 1846 the guilds were abolished, and in 1865 complete freedom of trade resembling a free-market with low taxes was introduced. This led to 100 years of tremendous growth. This growth significantly exceeded other European countries such as Germany, Italy and France. Globally it was the second highest in per capita GDP, exceeded only by Japan, and twice as high as in the UK.
