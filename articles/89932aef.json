    "A circular economy seeks to create value of by-products or waste, that otherwise will be discarded and lost",
    "As we celebrate the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, we must understand that this is a global challenge, that affects all of us and we must all contribute to its solution. Whether we are policymakers, consumers, or food producers, the choices we make, can help shape a more sustainable future. Reducing food waste is not just a moral imperative; it is an economic necessity, especially when millions around the world face food insecurity",
    "On 29 September, we celebrate the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, a reminder of the urgent need to transform how we produce, consume, and manage food.",
    "Globally, we produce enough food to feed everyone. However, nearly a third of the food we produce is lost or wasted every year \u2013 1.2 billion MT of food, costing the global economy nearly $ 940 billion. This represents a significant waste of precious resources such as land, water, energy, labour, and capital. Today, the world uses 1.4 billion hectares of arable land and 24% of available freshwater to grow food that will never be eaten. If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing nearly 10% to global emissions. Just to give some perspective, throwing away one burger uses the same amount of water as a 90-minute shower, and a head of lettuce can take up to 25 years to decompose in a landfill.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s agricultural sector is a major contributor to the economy of the country but it has suffered over the years due to climate change, economic instability, inflation and lack of investment, among other factors. The economic crisis has worsened existing problems and contributed to a steep increase in food insecurity for the people of Sri Lanka. At the same time, significant quantities of food are lost and wasted at various points along the supply chain. Moreover, single-use plastics (SUP) remain a growing environmental threat, particularly within the food sector. Addressing all these challenges requires a comprehensive policy shift towards a circular economy.",
    "In Sri Lanka, Team Europe, including the European Union and its member states, is supporting a policy shift to improve waste and loss management in food systems. The European Union is providing 15 million euros and the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) is providing 1 million Euros for the \u201cCircular Economy in the Food Sector\u201d (CIRCULAR) project, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with Team Europe members, Expertise France (EF), and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) from Germany. The project aims to drive transformative change in the agri-food system by promoting circular economy interventions.",
    "The circular economy reimagines how we produce, distribute and consume our products, to minimise loss and waste, but also to regenerate our resources, land, water, energy, and to improve access to safe and healthy food for all consumers.",
    "When we think of food systems, we can see how a linear economy has devastating effects in food security and safety, depletes resources, polluting water and soil with a negative impact on yield and production. Intense use of chemicals in cultivation and processing of food products provokes a substantial loss of nutritious content, increases the need for packaging and transport and the final cost for consumers. All this leads to an increased amount of waste and loss of food at different stages of the supply and distribution chain and contributes to increase food insecurity.",
    "In a circular economy products are consumed, but also can be repurposed, reused and recycled to minimise loss and waste. A circular economy seeks to create value of by-products or waste, that otherwise will be discarded and lost. This by products and waste can be used to minimise the need for chemicals that may damage the water, deplete soils and compromise the health of consumers. They can also be used to produce new innovative solutions, related to energy, packaging, or materials to supply to other industries. Through the CIRCULAR program, we aim to harness this approach in the agricultural sector to reduce waste, improve food security, and contribute to sustainable development goals, particularly SDG 12.3 and SDG 2.1.",
    "The project focuses on two key areas: First, recovery and redistribution of safe, edible food that would otherwise go to waste, benefitting vulnerable communities and enhancing the resilience of local food producers. Second, supporting the adoption of sustainable models of food production, distribution, and consumption, while addressing the environmental challenges posed by single-use plastics in food packaging.",
    "Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture. In the wake of recent economic crises and its devastating effects of food insecurity, the country is in need of innovative solutions to build resilience in its food systems. The CIRCULAR initiative will focus on three districts\u2014Colombo, Nuwara Eliya, and Galle\u2014providing data-driven assessments of food loss and waste, to support its reduction and pilot socio-economic and technological innovations for the recovery of surplus food and conversion of bio-waste into valuable products like compost and bio-gas.",
    "This project is not just about mitigating food loss and waste; it is about creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient food system. It will support the adoption of digital tools to help all actors along the food chain to better identify, understand and address the root causes of waste. This will support the authorities to design and improve policies, growers in local communities to apply technical knowledge and innovative solutions to produce healthier and more nutritious food and regenerate and preserve resources, while improving their value-addition, access to finance and markets. The project will also contribute to the recovery and reuse of food waste, to improve access to food and food security of the most vulnerable communities and to reduce the environmental impact of the food supply chain.",
    "As we celebrate the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, we must understand that this is a global challenge, that affects all of us and we must all contribute to its solution. Whether we are policymakers, consumers, or food producers, the choices we make, can help shape a more sustainable future. Reducing food waste is not just a moral imperative; it is an economic necessity, especially when millions around the world face food insecurity.",
    "Team Europe and FAO are committed to supporting Sri Lankan citizens, food producers and policy makers on this journey to embrace a circular economy in the food and agriculture sector. However, this transformation requires the participation of all stakeholders\u2014from farmers and businesses to consumers and local governments. We invite everyone to contribute with their efforts to reduce food loss and waste, while building a more resilient food system, and ensuring that every Sri Lankan has access to safe and nutritious food.",
    "Today\u2019s food insecurity and climate change make it imperative that we all understand the complexities and severity of the problems associated to food loss and waste. Reducing loss and waste is essential to secure a sustainable future for all of us.",
    "CIRCULAR opens a new and inspiring opportunity for Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable development. By embracing a circular economy, Sri Lanka can reduce food waste, protect its environment, and strengthen its food systems, while improving health of consumers and protecting the most vulnerable in its population. Together, we can create a future where food is valued, resources are regenerated and preserved, and no one is left behind.`",
