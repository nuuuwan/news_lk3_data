*2024-03-04 14:50:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177876) · `ta`

The Ceylon Electricity Board's (CEB) Media Spokesman Priyantha faced criticism for derogatory comments about the upcountry plantation community. His remarks sparked controversy, leading to his resignation. The incident highlighted the disparity between the elite and the people living under the poverty line, with politicians and officials expressing concern over the lack of electricity and its impact on education.

### Government officials hating people's voice…!

*2024-03-04 14:41:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177874) · `ta`

### Can workers get the salary of the lease agreement?

*2024-03-04 14:37:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177873) · `ta`

Workers' salaries in lease agreements are a complex issue. The Ceylon Workers Congress and unions argue for higher wages, but companies warn of stopping welfare services if basic salaries increase. The 1995 lease agreement between the government and plantation companies led to a joint contract for workers' welfare, but it's unclear if this affects the lease agreement's terms. The 2003 Labor Welfare Joint Agreement, made every three years, includes provisions for fair additional allowances and specific conditions for workers. Despite these agreements, plantation workers' welfare has declined over the years, leading to calls for negotiations and reforms. The government has decided to extend the lease agreement, but unions argue that companies have not complied with agreed salaries.

🟩

Talks about the agony of plantation workers may have begun a goal. When the General Secretary and Minister of the Ceylon Workers Congress, Jeevan Thondaman, during a media briefing held last week, responded to this, the companies say that if the basic salary was paid Rs 1,700, other welfare services would be stopped.. If that happens, he said he would have to lease with companies in this regard.

The unions must understand that the workers' pain and the leasing agreement with the government with the government. At the same time, the unions have forgotten that there is a joint venture on the welfare of the workers.

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar Janaka Priyantha Bandara says that unverified reports have been received claiming that a group of eight Sri Lankans who were held hostage at a Cyber Slave Camp in Myanmar have been rescued.

In December, reports were rife about a group of Sri Lankans who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative job offers in the IT sector and were trafficked to Myanmar through its border with Thailand. These workers had reportedly travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).

The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myawaddy – an area infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group – were reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams.

### Globally, a rightward political shift is visible

*2024-03-04 13:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) · `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama’s re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

அக்டோபர் 7, 2023 அன்று ஹமாஸ் இஸ்ரேலைத் தாக்கியபோது, உலகின் அனுதாபம் இஸ்ரேலிய மக்களுடன் காணப்பட்டது. இது ஒரு பயங்கரவாதச் செயலாகும், என்பதுடன் அது முறைப்படி கண்டிக்கப்பட்டது.

நவம்பர் மாதத்திற்குள், இஸ்ரேலின் எதிர்த்தாக்குதல் கண்மூடித்தனமானதாக மாறியதால், உலகம் வித்தியாசமாக பிரதிபலிக்க ஆரம்பித்தது. பாலஸ்தீன அரசியல்வாதிகள் தங்களின் நாட்டை அபிவிருத்தி செய்வதற்கு அரபு நாடுகள் வழங்கும் ஆதரவையும் உதவியையும் பயன்படுத்தத் தவறியது, அதன் மூலம் ஹமாஸ் தமது நிலைப்பாட்டை உறுதிப்படுத்தவும், அவர்களின் நியாயத்தின் சட்டபூர்வதன்மையை குறைமதிப்பிற்கு உட்படுத்தவும் இடமளிப்பதுடன், மக்கள் படும் துன்பம் உலகம் புறக்கணிக்க முடியாத அளவுக்கு அதிகமாக காணப்பட்டது.

பின்னர் ஹூத்திகள் யேமனில் இருந்து பதிலளிக்க ஆரம்பித்தது, முதலில் இஸ்ரேலுடன் தொடர்புடைய கப்பல்களை குறிவைத்ததுடன் படிப்படியாக மேற்கத்திய அணிக்கு விரிவடைகின்றது. இந்த நெருக்கடிக்கு இணைந்ததாக, நாங்கள் சோமாலிய கடற்கொள்ளையர் மீண்டும் செயற்பட ஆரம்பித்தமையை கண்டோம்.

Colombo, March 04 (Daily Mirror) -  The skyrocketing prices of coconuts will have a serious effect on the packed rice and curry meals in the future, as most of the curries are prepared with the coconut cream, food industry trade unions said.

All Island Canteen Owners Association President Rukshan Harshana told the media yesterday the usual price of a coconut, which was at Rs.60 to 80, has increased to almost double. A coconut is currently sold between Rs.120 to 150.

He said the canteen and eatery owners are faced with a serious situation to prepare the rice and curry meal packets under the increased coconut prices, thus in uncertainty of having to sell meal packs for a very high rate.

The unexpected price hike of coconuts comes at a moment when everything else including rice, chicken, eggs and gas has significantly gone up.

Harshana warned that the prices of coconut oil will also go up in the coming days owing to the sudden hike of coconuts.

The net short position, including swaps disclosed by the central bank, grew by over almost 1.28 billion US dollars from December 2022 to 3,280 million dollars.

The gross position grew from 2,263 million dollars to 3,280 million US dollars over the year.

By December reported gross reserves of the central bank was 4,491 million US dollars, against swaps of 3,280 billion US dollars.

Records Rs. 75 .5 bn profit for group, Rs. 61.2 bn for Board

Even without favourable weather conditions, CEB would have made profits amounting to Rs. 40 bn

The financial performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is largely positive as it ended the financial year 2023 with a massive profit.

Unaudited interim financial statements filed to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) showed Rs. 75.7 billion profits for the Group, and Rs. 61.2 billion for the Board.

The improvement in the financial performance is largely due to the increase in rainfall from September, and the hike in electricity tariff that came in the fourth quarter (4Q23). However, as per the statements, even without the heavy rainfalls which reduced its reliance on oil and coal-based generation, CEB would have still made profits of about Rs. 40 billion.

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) say, impunity has over the years become institutionalised and systematised. Mechanisms to hold state actors to account for their actions have been eroded.

During the time of former President Rajapaksa, via amendments to the Constitution, checks on the arbitrary use of power were diluted, and institutions to protect the independence of the judiciary were tampered with.

As of February 2024, Sri Lanka lost another 38 elephants as a result of the Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC), elephant-train collisions, gunshot injuries and other natural causes.

In 2023, Sri Lanka made headlines as the country with the highest number of elephant deaths as 473 elephants succumbed to natural and largely unnatural causes. For years, Sri Lanka’s wildlife has been at the receiving end of poor infrastructure development, encroachment of lands and lack of collaboration among stakeholder institutions to minimize human-wildlife conflicts.

It is in this backdrop that the Ministry of Transport and Highways with the Sri Lanka Railways Department and the Protect Sri Lanka Organisation tied up to initiate the construction of Sri Lanka’s first wildlife underpass in Kasikote, Galgamuwa on March 1.
