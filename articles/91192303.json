It was definitely a bold move, and the crowd\u2019s reaction made it all worth it; felt like I was part of something bigger than just a show.",
    "My ideal vacation would be a trip around Sri Lanka. I\u2019d love to explore its beautiful beaches, like Mirissa and Unawatuna, where I could spend the day soaking up the sun and enjoying the waves. I\u2019m also really into street food, so I\u2019d make sure to dive into local treats, like kottu roti, and fresh seafood from the market.
