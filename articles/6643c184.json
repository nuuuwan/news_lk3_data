    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to appoint a committee to find solutions to goods imported through online platforms which are now stuck at Customs.",
    "The committee will provide short term \u2018operational solutions\u2019 to the clear goods and a long term regulatory framework, Cabinet spokesman Nalinda Jayatissa said.",
    "Sri Lanka Customs had earlier cleared goods imported via online platforms like AliExpress and Temu on the basis of weight.",
    "However, the shift to clearing the goods with taxes charged by HS Code had led to goods being stuck and port and AliExpress stopping its cheap shipping option to Sri Lanka.",
    "Most countries have a so-called de minimis limit of around 100 dollars or 150 Euro (it is 800 dollars in the US which has among the most extensive economic freedoms in the world), which can be imported without duty.",
    "In Europe de minimis imports are charged value added tax. (Colombo/July15/2025)"
