    "Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday expressed distress over the unfolding violence in Kathmandu, condemning the unrest and urging a return to peace and stability in Nepal.",
    "In a statement, he said he condemns all kinds of killings, including those of the youth that has occurred in Nepal, adding that the burning of a former prime minister\u2019s home and the killing of his wife was a \u201cdeeply tragic situation.\u201d He extended his condolences to the victims\u2019 families.",
    "Wickremesinghe noted that assaults on government officials, including the foreign minister, reflected a worsening crisis, stressing that women\u2019s rights had been gravely violated and that such events had damaged Nepal\u2019s standing abroad. He criticised police shootings as an \u201cunacceptable course of action,\u201d saying the unrest should never have been allowed to escalate.",
    "Referring to reports that the violence could have been contained without gunfire on the first day, he warned of the dangers of further deterioration. He also drew attention to the role of global social media platforms, stating: \u201cThe opportunity that American-owned social media companies like Google, Facebook, and YouTube have presented to overthrow governments in countries around the world cannot be underestimated.\u201d",
    "He argued that Nepal\u2019s turmoil was rooted in long-neglected issues, worsened by leaders prioritising day-to-day politics over structural solutions. This neglect, he said, had fuelled youth frustration, which was only aggravated by the government\u2019s sweeping ban on social media.",
    "The former president strongly denounced the arson attacks on Nepal\u2019s parliament and judiciary buildings, calling it \u201ca great disrespect to Nepal\u2019s democracy.\u201d He warned that the country risked being left \u201cwithout a constitution\u201d and said it was now the duty of the military, which has assumed control, to restore order and ensure elections are held under constitutional provisions.",
    "Reflecting on Sri Lanka\u2019s ties with Nepal, Wickremesinghe emphasised that the birthplace of the Buddha held a unique cultural and spiritual importance. He described the violence as \u201cbarbaric acts\u201d inconsistent with the country\u2019s heritage and urged Nepal\u2019s leaders to follow the Buddha\u2019s teaching to \u201cgather in harmony, discuss in harmony, and disperse in harmony.\u201d"
