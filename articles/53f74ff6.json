    "Jetwing acquired the Uva Ben Head Tea Estate in Welimada in 2022 with a mandate to produce premium artisanal teas while safeguarding the environment through organic farming and biodiversity conservation.",
    "The Uva Ben Head Estate, a 100-acre expanse previously reliant on inorganic farming methods, is undergoing a transformative journey under Jetwing\u2019s guidance. The estate is now a beacon of organic farming, with Jetwing introducing mixed cropping and phasing out chemical fertilisers and pesticides.",
    "The estate management has been committed to eliminating the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides through a phased reduction since acquisition in 2022, with the final application of these chemicals occurring in August 2023. The transformation includes the production of organic liquid fertilisers, composting, and the planned introduction of biochar. Additionally, the estate is optimising water usage through rainwater harvesting.",
    "To inform future decisions, the estate is conducting comprehensive soil and leaf analyses in collaboration with the Tea Research Institute. Furthermore, a biodiversity survey is being undertaken, led by University of Colombo Zoology and Environment Sciences Department Head Prof. Devaka Weerakoon, to evaluate the impact of organic farming and to develop strategies for resource optimisation and biodiversity enhancement.",
    "Jetwing\u2019s vision extends beyond agriculture to community development. The estate supports a vibrant community of over 300 individuals, providing employment opportunities and comprehensive training programs. Health initiatives and financial assistance programs reflect Jetwing\u2019s commitment to the well-being of its associates and their families.",
    "Currently, the harvested tea leaf is sold to third-party processors; however, plans for an on-site tea processing facility are underway, promising to enhance quality control and minimise environmental impact. The company\u2019s circular approach to sustainability is further exemplified by initiatives that support dairy farming among estate residents, fostering a symbiotic relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry.",
    "Nestled within the estate are the Jetwing Uva Ben Head Villa and Jetwing Welimada Villa, two homely planter\u2019s bungalows, offering guests an immersive experience in Sri Lanka\u2019s renowned tea country and providing employment opportunities for the local community. These villas are a testament to Jetwing Hotels\u2019 esteemed reputation for providing serene retreats that harmonise luxury with nature.",
    "The acquisition of the Uva Ben Head Estate and its subsequent conversion to organic cultivation represents a strategic expansion of Jetwing\u2019s involvement in the tea industry. The estate complements the company\u2019s inaugural venture, producing organic artisanal teas at Jetwing Warwick Gardens in Ambewela."
