    "The Chamber of Marine Industries of Sri Lanka (CMISL) has congratulated President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) on their success at the Parliamentary Election last week.",
    "\u201cThis achievement reflects the collective aspirations of Sri Lankans for transformative leadership and a renewed focus on sustainable economic growth,\u201d CMISL President Kaushal Rajapaksa said in a letter to President Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cThe CMISL is encouraged by your administration\u2019s commitment to fostering economic resilience, streamlining governance, and attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). We believe that expediting the implementation of the regulatory framework for the marine industry, already drawn up by the Deputy General of Merchant Shipping, is a crucial step to unlocking the full potential of this sector. A well-defined and operational framework will attract investments, reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, and set the foundation for robust growth.",
    "A key enabler for expanding the marine industry\u2019s international presence is the Port City Commission\u2019s offshore company status, which provides a significant advantage for global competitiveness. By leveraging this strategic status, Sri Lanka can position its marine industry as a regional leader in boat building, brokerage, leasing, and chartering, enabling the sector to align with global standards and capture new revenue streams. These efforts will also contribute significantly to advancing the nation\u2019s Blue Economy, unlocking sustainable opportunities from its vast maritime resources. The concept of \u2018Grow Boating\u2019 also aligns perfectly with this vision. By promoting boating activities, increasing leisure craft ownership, and fostering a nautical culture, we can enhance both domestic engagement and tourism. This initiative will pave the way for expanding associated industries such as marine tourism, water sports, and boating events, significantly contributing to revenue generation and job creation.",
    "Furthermore, activities such as watersports and sail training have immense potential to develop a skilled workforce, particularly among youth, while positioning Sri Lanka as a destination for unique maritime experiences. These initiatives underscore the broader goal of making the marine industry a pivotal driver of sustainable development and an integral part of the Blue Economy.",
    "The shipbuilding and ship repair sector continues to be an integral part of the industry, enabling Sri Lanka to generate substantial revenue and maintain its maritime capabilities. Colombo Dockyard, as a flagship contributor, demonstrates the potential of this sector in supporting the nation\u2019s ambitious targets of $ 1 billion in FDI and $ 1 billion in exports by 2029. Without a thriving shipbuilding and repair ecosystem, achieving this vision would be impossible.",
    "The CMISL is also advancing key initiatives, including the transformation of fishing harbours into dual-use mini-marinas, the promotion of Trincomalee as a hub for offshore industry development, and the enhancement of infrastructure to support slipways, repairs, and advanced technologies. These measures, coupled with the implementation of the regulatory framework, will enable Sri Lanka to harness its strategic location and maritime assets effectively.",
    "We stand ready to work collaboratively with your Government to bring these initiatives to fruition. By prioritising swift and decisive action, we can unlock the immense potential of the marine industry, positioning Sri Lanka as a leading maritime nation on the global stage.",
    "Once again, we extend our congratulations to the NPP on its remarkable success and look forward to contributing to a vibrant and sustainable future for Sri Lanka.\u201d"
