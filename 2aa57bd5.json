    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 A study by Sri Lanka\u2019s Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has found that that the recent value added tax (VAT) hike has not affected the price of several essential goods , an official said, claiming that the Central Bank\u2019s inflation target of 5 percent can still be maintained.",
    "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya responding to a question by opposition MP S M Marikkar said the Department of Census and Statistics has asked for more time to conduct its own survey on the impact of the VAT hike.",
    "\u201cThe market isn\u2019t as agitated about the VAT issue as much as parliament is,\u201d the state minister said.",
    "The CAA had urgently conducted a single-day survey on Tuesday January 09 covering retail outlets, hardware stores, bookstores, butchers and supermarkets in the Colombo 02 area, and found the following, according to Siyambalapitiya:",
    "Price as of January 09 of items whose VAT increased from 0 percent to 18 percent on January 01:",
    "Price as of January 09 of items whose VAT increased from 15 percent to 18 percent on January 01:",
    "Canned fish (425g):\u00a0 600 rupees before, 450 rupees now (due to other market forces)",
    "The state minister was responding to a series of questions by MP Marikkar, who represents the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), on the increase in monthly expenses for a family of four in the wake of the VAT hike, the government\u2019s solution to the increased cost of living with no corresponding rise in wages, and projections if any on the number of households that may fall below the poverty line as a result of the indirect tax.",
    "\u201cThe Department of Census and Statistics says they need a reasonable amount of time for these surveys. What they point out is that the market has not yet changed,\u201d said Siyambalapitiya.",
    "\u201cWe anticipate a 2 to 2.5 percent increase in inflation due to the VAT increase. But we have controlled that in various ways. For fuel, which influences everything, we reduced the Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL) by 7.5 percent and controlled it in some way. That\u2019s how the petrol and diesel price increase was contained to about to 20 to 29 rupees, otherwise it would\u2019ve gone up by over 60 rupees. PAL was reduced for gas too, and for fertiliser as well,\u201d the state minister said.",
    "\u201cWe anticipate a reduction in power tariffs too. We expect that we can maintain the 5 percent inflation target of the Central Bank,\u201d he added.",
    "The official further said that expenditure on the government\u2019s new Aswesuma welfare programme will increase to 210 billion rupees in 2024 from the 65 billion rupees spent the previous year, with the number of beneficiaries also expected to increase from 2 million to 2.4. New applications will be called from the first week of February, he said.",
    "\u201cYou won\u2019t talk about the items whose prices increased. For those items, people\u2019s purchasing power has declined. Giving Awesuma to 2.4 million people means these people have become beggars,\u201d said Marikkar.",
    "\u201cWe expect about 650 billion rupees in revenue from the VAT increase. It is part of the tax revenue of this country. But we have calculated the numbers. We think we can maintain inflation at 5 percent; what used to be at 70 percent. We have a programme to help anyone who falls below the poverty line,\u201d replied Siyambalapitiya.",
    "The opposition MP then claimed that announcements of a coming power tariff were a distraction.",
    "\u201cThe power tariff reduction is a carrot fed to the people, which incidentally is still not happening. That news is planted in the media to bury the news of the VAT increase,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI have answered all his questions. I think he\u2019s upset that the agitation he\u2019s expecting from the society is not happening. That\u2019s not my problem,\u201d responded Siyambalapitiya. (Colombo/Jan10/2024)"
