    "He emphasized that preliminary measures are being taken to reduce the electricity tariffs before February.",
    "\u201cThe PUCSL will study the data over the course of 20 days. Thus we believe that a tariff revision is possible before February. I cannot mention the percentage [by which the tariffs would be reduced]. The entire responsibility [regarding the tariff\u00a0revision] lies with the Public Utilities Commission.\u201d",
