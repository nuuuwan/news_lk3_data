    "Holds fifth AGM with Agriculture Minister K.D. Lalkantha as Chief Guest",
    "The fifth Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the All Island Dairy Association (AIDA) was recently held at The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in Colombo, with Agriculture Minister K.D. Lalkantha as Chief Guest.",
    "Speaking at the AGM, AIDA President Asoka Bandara thanked the Government for removing the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed on fresh milk from the last Budget.",
    "He explained the role of the AIDA, which represents the country\u2019s leading dairy collectors and product processors, producers such as large- and medium-scale farms, service providers of the value chain, as well as milk importers.",
    "He stressed that the Association as the main focal point is fully committed towards the country\u2019s dairy development process and is a willing partner to support the Government in achieving these objectives in collaboration with public sector institutions and Governmental authorities.",
    "AIDA stakeholders collect over 65% of the local milk produced predominantly by the rural dairy farming community, which produces the bulk of Sri Lankan fresh milk. Furthermore, some members have also invested and managed large- and medium-scale dairy farms and also represented by members involved in the importation of dairy equipment, powders, and other relevant inputs.",
    "Bandara highlighted the current challenges for the dairy industry, including high taxation for investments in large farms, the need to upgrade small farmers to commercially viable mid-sized farms, to ensure availability of high-quality fodder and concentrates for cattle feeding, an integrated approach for artificial insemination of cattle, and to improve the progeny of Sri Lanka\u2019s low-yielding cattle.",
    "Minister Lalkantha added that the vision and objective of the Government and his Ministry are in congruence with the views expressed by the AIDA President.",
    "Looking forward to the support extended in developing the industry through robust private-public partnerships, he also explained that making available State land for cultivation of fodder/maize could be carefully considered in an objective manner to alleviate the shortage of feed and feed ingredients.",
    "As the AIDA produces only 40% of the nation\u2019s fresh milk requirement, he welcomed the supportive gesture by the AIDA towards the Government\u2019s dairy development endeavours. The Minister will also focus on improving herd quality through National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) intervention and to increase the much needed production of fodder and maize.",
    "The AIDA will formally propose their action plan urgently to the Minister considering the impending national Budget timelines.",
    "The meeting was graced by all top AIDA members and Ministry officials, including NLDB Chairman Dr. B.S.C. Perera, NLDB Deputy Chairman Dr. W.M.D.S. Wanninayaka, and leading NGOs involved in the dairy value chain.",
    "The following members were elected to the AIDA Executive Committee for 2025/2026:",
    "Vice Presidents: Saranga Wijesundara (Kotmale Holdings PLC \u2013 Manufacturing and Processors); Sasanka Perera (Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) PLC \u2013 Producers and Collectors); Saman Perera (Fonterra Brands \u2013 Importers); and Andy Weerawan (Prima Group \u2013 Service Providers).",
