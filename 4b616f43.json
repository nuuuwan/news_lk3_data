    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 There will never be an alliance between Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the latter has told parliament, denying reports of a coming team-up of the two rivals.",
    "\u201cSome organisations that propagate falsehoods have gotten together, having taken money perhaps from the government, and are saying Ranil and Sajith are teaming up. Ranil and Sajith will never come together,\u201d Premadasa said speaking parliament Monday December 11 morning.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m saying this right here in parliament. I wish to tell these unscrupulous media organisations to not make these false statements,\u201d he added.",
    "Premadasa was responding to a purported report that President Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) and Premadasa\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), which broke off from the UNP, are considering burying the hatchet and reuniting to contest next year\u2019s elections as one party.",
    "There has been some speculation that senior members of the SJB, whose centre-right politics is not ideologically far removed from that of Wickremesinghe, are not opposed to the idea of working under the president.",
    "For his part, President Wickremesinghe continues to reiterate his calls for the SJB to support him in his International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reform agenda. He has repeatedly extended an open invitation to his erstwhile UNP colleagues to join him.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration currently comprises predominantly the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) whose MPs \u2014 134 of them \u2014 voted to make him president following the resignation of his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "The SJB and other opposition groups have accused Wickremesinghe of \u201cprotecting\u201d the Rajapaksa family that controls the SLPP in exchange for their support, an allegation that Wickremesinghe\u2019s defenders chalk up to realpolitik.",
    "At least three prominent members of the SJB have so far switched their loyalty to Wickremesinghe: Tourism Minister Harin Fernando, Labour & Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, and MP Vadivel Suresh who was named an advisor to the president just last week. (Colombo/Dec11/2023)"
