    "A Ceylonese student in London once took a bet of Stg. Pounds five with a friend that he would attend the Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace. He won the bet by getting a job with Lyons, the caterers for the party. He helped to carry the cookies and lay the tables.",
    "It was not through such a ruse that I attended the Paris Peace Conference in July 1946: yet it was the result entirely of my own initiative.",
    "Fifteen years ago, Ceylon was still a British possession, not much better than a Crown Colony. We did not send representatives to international conferences in our own right, and our war effort was not such as to justify our presence at a Peace Conference.",
    "It was by accident that I found myself in the Conference hall of the Luxembourg Palace, flanked on one side by a Mongolian gentleman in a tunic and with a small billy goat beard, who turned out to be Ho Chi Minh, and on the other side by a young Parisian midinette (Parisian seamstress) of the fashion house of Lanvin.",
    "Such accidents happen to itinerating journalists, and I was an itinerating journalist just then. I recall the incident now because it is so remote from current controversial matters that I can write without weighing my words. None of the persons whose names I mention is likely to take exception to what I say.",
    "I shall show presently that my proximity both to the midinette and the mandarin was innocent, and entirely unpremeditated. Indeed I was also close to Mr. Molotov and Mr. Vyshinsky, Mrs. Attlee and Miss. Bapsy Pavry, now the Marchioness of Winchester.",
    "How I came to find myself in this mixed company on a historic morning at the finest Medici palace in Paris \u2013 it was built by Marie de Medici, the widow of Henry IV of France \u2013 is one of those delightful muddles which can sometimes arise from an inadequate knowledge of the language of the country.",
    "Mario Scelba who succeeded de Gaspari as Prime Minister of Italy in 1954.",
    "On July 14th, the National Day of the French, I was at a dinner at the Moline Galette, when Mme Offroi, the wife of the head of the Information Department of the French Foreign Office introduced me to a book called \u201cla feerie cinghalaise\u201d. She also suggested that, if I wished to spend a pleasant month in Paris. I could get myself accredited as a special correspondent to the Peace Conference, which was due to begin in a fortnight.",
    "The company of famous newspaper men, good meals at reduced prices, the ballet and other entertainments laid on for correspondents as well as delegates \u2013 I was young enough then to be enthusiastic about such things. I could rely on the Offrois\u2019 to help me in Paris but nothing could be done without the sponsorship of the Foreign Office in London.",
    "I had a friend in Sir Henry Turner, Secretary of the Empire Press Union (who the other day fell off a boat and was drowned in the Thames), and he put me on to Mr. Ridsdale, the head of the new division of the Foreign Office. The rest was easy. (Four years later, when I also was an Information Officer, I was of some help to \u201cRids\u201d, when he came to the Colombo Conference with Mr. Ernest Bevin.) In due course I was informed by the Foreign Office that a seat was reserved for me in the diplomatic train on July 27 and facilities for my accreditation as a special correspondent to the Peace Conference had been arranged.",
    "The General Manager of the Southern Railway Company himself, in morning suit and top hat, saw the delegates and the correspondents into the train at Victoria. I remember that Mr. Barman, diplomatic correspondent of the BBC., and Mr. Strauss, diplomatic correspondent of the Manchester \u201cGuardian\u201d were in my compartment. They ignored me, but their conversation, which I could not but overhear, was interesting and useful to me.",
    "The next day I was in the Conference palace a full hour and a half before proceedings were to begin. I was determined not to miss anything. The Republican Guard were arriving. There were gendarmes at all entrances. Passing from one to another with my badge and card of admission, I managed to find my way into a gallery, a kind of box seat on the same level as the auditorium.",
    "The French officer no doubt thought that I was more important than I actually was, an illusion supported by the fact that I could not make myself understood in French. There I was alone in the distinguished visitor\u2019s gallery. It was the first and the last time I sat among the elite at the Conference.",
    "Presently, a smartly dressed young woman was shown to a seat next to mine. She was the midinette from Lanvin. She too had come early to make sure that she got a good seat. She had been given a ticket by an elderly Senator, or some highly-placed person at the Quai D\u2019Orsay. The delicate figure of Mr. Ho Chi Minh slipped into the seat next to mine on the other side. He had been invited to Paris to negotiate with the Government on the future of Indo-China. He is now President of North Vietnam.",
    "Miss Bapsy Pavry, a London socialite and daughter of a Parsi priest of Bombay, sat next to the midinette. In a saree of gleaming strawberry and gold she drew attention, and she turned round and spoke to Mrs. Attlee who was seated just behind her.",
    "The conference was opened by M. Bidault, Prime Minister and \u201cLe President du Government Provisoire.\u201d I cannot say that I was terribly excited at the time over the future of the world. I was interested in the people at the Conference. From my place by stretching my hand, I could have scratched the back of Mr. Molotov\u2019s head.",
    "It was the first time I had seen live Bolsheviks. Vyshinsky was always interesting. He was the Czarist advocate who was so useful to Stalin when he liquidated his enemies in the Presidium. Vyshinsky always walked from the Conference to his hotel. He knew Paris well in pre-Revolutionary times, and enjoyed the sights.",
    "Many of those who played a prominent part in the conference, like General Smuts, Ernest Bevin and Jan Masaryk, who died under strange circumstances, now belong to history. It was clear at the conference that the Cold War had already begun.",
    "As usually happens at these conferences, the lobbies and coulisses (the wings) were at least as interesting, if not as important, as formal meetings. Nowhere else could one have met the cream of the world\u2019s journalists. A.J. Cummings, Dedier of \u201cBorba\u201d, Iverach MacDonald of \u201cThe Times\u201d and a platoon of Americans. One of the most popular newsmen was Claud Cockburn, then a Communist and writing for the \u201cDaily Worker\u201d under the name of Frank Pithkearn. Mellow and middle-aged he is now one of the mainstays of \u201cPunch.\u201d",
    "Madame Tabouis haunted the room like a spirit from another world. She had grown up in a family of French diplomatists. A friend and confidante of statesmen she was in her day the best-informed journalist in Europe.",
    "I lived in a tiny hotel near the Odean Theatre not far from the Luxembourg Gardens, and was invited to dinner by an Indian doctor and his French wife in a typical Latin Quarter apartment reached by a winding and steep flight of steps. She had been a close friend and constant companion of a brilliant Ceylon student called Sathanathan who had died of tuberculosis. She wished to find out from me all about his family.",
    "Much as I liked to wander about the museums and galleries of Paris and sit in the sun under the chestnut trees of the palace gardens, my main concern was the Peace Conference, about which I was sending an article or two to Ceylon by air mail. It would be purposeless to recall the events of the conference. There was one incident, however, which affected me then, and which I cannot forget in view of subsequent events.",
    "I saw then under very special circumstances Signor De Gasperi. Eight years later, when I went to Rome as Minister, he was one of the first persons I was due to meet. He died before I could see him, and one of my first official duties was to attend his funeral. I am glad I was at the Conference as even though I could not then have expected to spend several years among the people for whom de Gasperi spoke.",
