    "Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara has gone on record as saying that former political leaders ruined the country and, therefore, they must not be looked after at the expense of the public. He has sought to justify the newly passed law that strips former Presidents of their perks and privileges. Interestingly, the JVP aligned itself with the political parties of the former Presidents it is now inveighing against. Some of the JVP seniors were in the Cabinet of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga\u2019s government from 2004 to 2005, and the JVP was instrumental in enabling Mahinda Rajapaksa to secure the executive presidency in 2005.",
    "It facilitated the victory of Maithripala Sirisena in the 2015 presidential election, and was on very intimate terms with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; it had representation in the National Executive Council of the UNP-led Yahapalana government, which was responsible for the Treasury bond scams. It had no qualms about throwing a lifeline to the UNP-led government, which President Sirisena tried to topple in 2018 after falling out with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.",
    "The JVP\u2019s reign of terror claimed thousands of lives and destroyed public assets worth billions of rupees in the late 1980s, but the state has looked after JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera\u2019s widow and her children since 1989. What have Minister Nanayakkara and JVP leaders got to say to this?",
    "Politicians are notorious for exaggeration and overgeneralisation, and Minister Nanayakkara is no exception. But there is a school of thought that the political leaders who have ruled this country during the past several decades are responsible for the current mess, and therefore state funds should not be used to maintain them.",
    "None of the former Presidents losing their perks and privileges will be driven to destitution. One can only hope that the government will not curtail security provided to them in a bid to settle political scores.",
    "Former Presidents\u2019 entitlements amounted to a negligible fraction of Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP, SJB MP Dayasiri Jayasekera told Parliament on Wednesday. However, the NPP government says what matters is not the amount of money but the wrong principle underpinning the practice of using state funds to maintain ex-Presidents. It was in a mighty hurry to pass the Presidential Entitlements (Repeal) Bill. Immediately after the Supreme Court decision thereon was conveyed to the Speaker, the Bill was taken up for debate and ratified. The Speaker signed it into law in double quick time.",
    "We suggest that the assets of all politicians, especially the ex-Presidents/Prime Ministers, their progeny, and former state officials be probed, and losses they have caused to the country, if any, be recovered from them. The JVP has unearthed the Batalanda Commission report on torture chambers that existed in the late 1980s, and is demanding legal action against former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, on the basis of its findings.",
    "So, the JVP\u2019s past crimes too must be probed. Most of all, huge losses the state suffered due to the JVP\u2019s terror campaign (1987-89) must be estimated and recovered. After all, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, speaking at a ceremony to mark the 159th Police Day, on 03 September, declared that serious crimes were not subject to a statute of limitations and remained prosecutable indefinitely, and his government would ensure that no crime went unpunished.",
    "The Opposition should pressure the NPP government to set up a special presidential commission of inquiry to probe the wanton destruction of public property, etc., in the late 1980s. Parliament is the best forum where this issue should be taken up. Unless the government cooperates, the Opposition should make the recovery of staggering losses caused by the southern terrorists a main plank of its election platform and seek a mandate from the people to achieve that end. No crime must go unpunished, as President Dissanayake has rightly said.",
