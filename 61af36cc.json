    "The Sri Lanka Police yesterday commenced a 24-hour public complaints desk and hotline to receive complaints relating to crimes committed against women and children.",
    "The initiative was launched by the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles at the Police Bureau for the Prevention of Abuse of Children and Women in Grandpass.",
    "The public can now contact the desk by calling hotline number 109, phone number\u00a0 0112 444 444 or email\u00a0 [email\u00a0protected] and submit complaints regarding crimes and incidents of sexual violence against women and children, domestic violence, child labour, cruelty to children.",
    "The Minister emphasised that victims, reluctant to go directly to police stations, can now lodge complaints via the provided email address and hotline numbers, ensuring their safety and well-being throughout the process.",
    "The desk will exclusively be staffed by female officers. The Minister highlighted that the decision to have female officers at the desk is rooted in the understanding that women may feel hesitant to openly discuss issues if a male officer responds to their call."
