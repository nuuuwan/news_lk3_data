Until about 50 years ago, a rice-and-curry lunch in Sri Lanka was incomplete without the side relish of jaadi theldala (sauteed cured fish). Some ate white rice with a piece of jaadi before serving other curries onto their plates. Amma (my mother) prepared a special Jaadi dish with tomatoes and large onion rings for Sunday lunch.

### The fig leaf of humanitarianism

*2024-05-11 21:23:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-fig-leaf-of-humanitarianism/) · `en`

As each day passes and the death toll rises in Gaza, the West’s complicity in Israeli atrocities becomes clearer and sharper. South Africa’s case against Israel is a clear indictment of the Global North’s inaction regarding those atrocities. Israel’s defence team has attempted to rationalise what Israeli forces are doing in Gaza, but this has effectively been undermined by the Israeli government itself: each day, its official social media channels tweet or post one ridiculous claim against not just South Africa, but also the ICJ.

Against this backdrop, it makes very little sense to continue defending a country against which half the world has rallied in solidarity. Even Sri Lanka’s decision to send vessels to the Red Sea and local youths to Israel does not diminish its continuing support for Palestine at the United Nations, and the Foreign Ministry’s support for a two-state solution, an end to all hostilities, and a humanitarian ceasefire.

### The Way of the Jackal: The Untold Story of Sri Lanka’s Wild Dog

*2024-05-11 20:32:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-way-of-the-jackal-the-untold-story-of-sri-lankas-wild-dog/) · `en`

Our jackal is the only island subspecies of the Eurasian Golden Jackal across its range. Historically, it was even considered a species endemic to Sri Lanka. It is the sole wild dog on the island and stands as the third-largest carnivore present; only second to the charismatic Leopard and the sluggish Sloth Bear. These features already make it an iconic species, but for some reason, it has been overlooked. Photographers have missed its stunning moves, artists have forgotten to paint it, tourists hardly ask for sightings, and scientists failed to study it. Instead, the narrative of our Nariya is abandoned to folklore—a cunning, selfish creature, a forgotten soul that nobody really likes

An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth could produce northern lights in the U.S. this weekend and potentially disrupt power and communications.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week.

NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit to take precautions, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“For most people here on planet Earth, they won’t have to do anything,” said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues.

### Risk for boys with bodice -powered sports materials

*2024-05-11 11:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183211) · `ta`

Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa warns that sports materials containing chemicals like lithium, silver oxide, and alkaline can pose a risk to boys, potentially causing severe damage if swallowed. The short esophagus can lead to these materials reaching the stomach, causing respiratory blockage and even death. Immediate hospitalization is advised, with honey administered as first aid.

🟩

The Assistant Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association, Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa, said that the children will be affected by the sports material.

He said that the games played by the boys may be swallowed, or that there are potentials, or the ear and nose, as the types of chemical compounds such as lithium, silver oxide and alkaline are in the form of button.

The reason is that the first part of our diet canal (esophagus) is naturally short, so that when swallowing the bark can go into the stomach and cause severe damage.

This can cause a sudden explosion in the stomach, causing respiratory tract blockage and death.

Therefore, the children should be taken to the hospital immediately if they get caught in such accidents. He said that until the first aid is taken to the hospital, two teaspoons of clean honey should be given to the affected children once in 10 minutes.
