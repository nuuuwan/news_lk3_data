GOSL decided to terminate the project with no alternative solution to the traffic congestion issue being proposed

On 27 December, the railway community in Sri Lanka as well as national-minded islanders commemorate the day on which the inaugural Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) train ran between Colombo Fort and Ambepussa (34 miles on the main line) in 1864.

A day before that, the same demographic remembers with grief and sorrow the cataclysmic effect of the Indian Ocean tsunami which devastated a 1,500 passenger train at Peraliya on 26 December 2004, taking a toll of over 1,000 lives in a disaster that saw an estimated 30,000 deaths.

To the credit of Sri Lanka Railways, the destroyed locomotive – a Class M2a EMD-G12 (‘Manitoba’), imported under the Colombo Plan in 1956 – was fully restored a few years later, and makes its regular run on ‘D-Day’ annually, heading Train No. 8051 (#51).

### Red baby elephants, Ranil as godfather and dangerous external liaisons

*2024-12-27 06:24:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Red-baby-elephants-Ranil-as-godfather-and-dangerous-external-liaisons/4-771051) · `en`

Sri Lankans have been politically scammed as never before. With AKD and the NPP, there’s been generational, gender and governance change, no structural reform (let alone ‘system-change’), and most crucially no change of economic policy paradigm and corporate/superrich bias. In an inversion of their mandate, there’s stark continuity in the economic policy framework that caused Sri Lanka’s debt crisis and perpetuates mass economic austerity.

As presidential candidate Anura emphasised improvement of human resources, upgrading of human capital, as his economic keystone, but his presidential policies have placed the keystone in the opposite direction, and his macroeconomic commitments are and cannot but be ruinous to human resources/human capital.

### Speakers of Sri Lanka: “Honourable” guardians of Parliament’s sovereignty

Season’s greetings to all readers! Let me begin the second part of this article on the speakers of Sri Lanka with a reference to former Speaker Asoka Ranwala. A source who is usually well-informed about matters concerning the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National People’s Power (NPP) got in touch with me a few days ago. He said that ex-Speaker Ranwala had indeed acquired a doctoral degree from Japan.

According to this JVP/NPP “partisan” source, Asoka Ranwala has indeed acquired a PhD from a Japanese institution of higher learning and is therefore entitled to the prefix “Dr”. Apparently Ranwala, a longstanding activist of the JVP, had “escaped” from Sri Lanka when the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime had cracked down hard on the JVP in the 1989-90 period. Ranwala had made his way to Japan and resided there for several years, stated this source.

### Bangladesh to re-investigate 2009 mutiny massacre, role of ‘foreign’ backers

Bangladesh on Thursday ordered a commission to investigate a failed 2009 army mutiny and subsequent crackdown, including the role of alleged “foreign” backers, the inquiry chief said.

The violent mutiny sent shock waves through the South Asian nation and ended with the army crushing the mutineers, with scores arrested and sentenced to death.

A previous official investigation into the mutiny which left scores dead blamed years of pent-up anger among ordinary soldiers, who felt their appeals for pay rises and better treatment were ignored.

But that probe was carried out during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister by a revolution in August, when she fled to old ally India.

Since her fall, families of soldiers killed in the violence have been campaigning to reopen the investigation.

They have repeatedly accused Hasina -- then newly elected -- of orchestrating a plan to weaken the military to bolster her own power in a country prone to coups.

*2024-12-26 12:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202188) · `ta`

போக்குவரத்து கடமைகளில் ஈடுபடும் பொலிஸ் உத்தியோகத்தர்கள் இரவு நேரங்களில் வாகனங்களை நிறுத்துவதற்காக சமிக்ஞை காட்டும் போது எவ்வாறு செயற்பட வேண்டும் என்பது தொடர்பாக பதில் பொலிஸ் மா அதிபரினால் பணிப்புரை விடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

போக்குவரத்து கடமைகளில் இரவு நேரங்களில் வாகனங்களை நிறுத்துவதற்காக சமிக்ஞை காட்டும் போது பல சந்தர்ப்பங்களில் பல்வேறு வகையான மின்விளக்குகளைப் பயன்படுத்துவதனால் மின்விளக்குகளின் வெளிச்சம் வாகன ஓட்டுநர்களின் முகத்தில் படுவதால், சில சந்தர்ப்பங்களில் வாகனத்தை கையாள்வதிலும் கட்டுப்படுத்துவதிலும் சிரமங்கள் ஏற்படுவதுடன், விபத்துகளும் ஏற்படுவதற்கான வாய்ப்புகள் உள்ளதாக தெரிவிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

போக்குவரத்து கடமைகளில் ஈடுபடும் பொலிஸ் உத்தியோகத்தர்கள் ஒளி பிரதிபலிக்கும் ஜாக்கட்டுகள் அணியாதிருப்பதனால் அவர்களுக்கும்  விபத்துகள் ஏற்படுவதற்கான வாய்ப்புகள் அதிகமாக உள்ளதாக தெரிவிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

அதனால், இன்று வியாழக்கிழமை (26) முதல்  போக்குவரத்துக் கடமைகளில் ஈடுபடும் பொலிஸ் உத்தியோகத்தர்களுக்கு விடுக்கப்பட்ட அறிவுறுத்தலுக்கு அமைவாக  செயற்படுமாறு பதில் பொலிஸ் மா அதிபர் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

පාතාලය සහ මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ජාවාරම තුළ වැටුප් ලබන පොලිස් නිලධාරීන් සිටින බව මහජන ආරක්ෂක නියෝජ්‍ය අමාත්‍ය නීතිඥ සුනිල් වටගල මහතා පවසයි.

එහිදී ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ පාතාලය සහ මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ජාවාරම තුරන් කිරීමට ගෙන ඇති ඇතැම් පියවර මාධ්‍ය ඉදිරියේ හෙළි කිරීමට නොහැකි බවය.

"පාතාලය, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ජාවාරම යට පඩි ගන්න පොලිස් නිලධාරීන් ඉන්නවා. අපිට රුවන්වැල්ලේ මුළු පොලීසියම වගේ මාරු කරන්න සිද්ධ වුණා. බුද්ධි තොරතුරු අරගෙන. ඒ විතරක් නෙමෙයි අවිස්සාවේල්ලේ. මේ අය ජාලයක්. පාතාල සල්ලි පොලීසිය අතට යනවා."

"අපි පොලිස්පතිව ගෙනල්ලා සාකච්ඡා කළා. දැන් පාතාලය මෙහෙයවන්නා මතුගම ඉන්නේ."

"අපි මේක ප්‍රශ්නයක් විදියට දකිනවා. අපි ගත්තු සියලුම ක්‍රියාමාර්ග මාධ්‍ය හරහා හෙළිකරන්න අමාරුයි. මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය සහ පාතාලය සම්බන්ධයෙන් අමාත්‍යංශ මට්ටමින් තීන්දු තීරණ ටිකක් අරගෙන තියෙනවා. ඒවා ක්‍රියාත්මක කිරීමේ වගකීම දීලා තියෙන්නේ පොලිස්පති ඇතුළු කණ්ඩායමට."

"අපි සියලුම පොලිස් නිලධාරීන්ට කියන්නේ මහජන වරමට ගරු කරන්න කියලා."

"ඊයේ පෙරේදා ආයෙත් පාතාල සිද්ධි ඉස්මතු වුණා. මේක ඇතුළේ පටු අවස්ථාවාදී දේශපාලනයත් තියෙනවා."

### වසර 05කට පසු සංචාරකයින් ලක්ෂ 20 ඉක්මවයි

*2024-12-26 11:37:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/204736) · `si`

2024 වසරේ විසි ලක්ෂ වෙනි සංචාරකයා අද (26) දින පෙ.ව 10.49ට බණ්ඩාරනායක ජාත්‍යන්තර ගුවන්තොටුපොළට පැමිණියේය.

විසි ලක්ෂ වැනි සංචාරකයා පිළිගැනීමට සංචාරක නියෝජ්‍ය අමාත්‍ය ආචාර්ය රුවන් රණසිංහ මහතා සමඟ සංචාරක ප්‍රවර්ධන කාර්යංශයේ සභාපති බුද්ධික හේවාවසම් මහතා ගුවන්තොටුපොළට පැමිණ තිබුණි.

සංචාරකයා පිළිගැනීම සඳහා විශේෂ උත්සවයක් ද ගුවන්තොටුපොළේ Silk Route Loungeහි ශ්‍රී ලංකා සංචාරක ප්‍රවර්ධන කාර්යංශය සංවිධානය කර තිබුණි.

මෙය වාර්ෂික සංචාරක පැමිණීම ලක්ෂ 20 ඉක්මවන සිව්වන අවස්ථාව වන අතර මීට පෙර ලක්ෂ 20 ඉක්මවා තිබුණේ 2016, 2017, 2018 වසරවල දී පමණි.

2018 වසරින් පසුව වසරක් තුළ වැඩිම සංචාරකයින් පැමිණීම වාර්තා වන්නේ මේ වසරේදීය.

දෙසැම්බර් මාසයේ පළමු දින 26 තුළ සංචාරකයන් 19,5127ක් පැමිණ ඇති අතර දෙසැම්බර් 31 මධ්‍යම රාත්‍රිය වන විට සංචාරකයන් 250,000 ඉක්මවනු ඇතැයි අපේක්ෂා කෙරේ.

මීට පෙර එක් මසක් තුළ සංචාරකයන් 250,000 ඉක්මවා තිබුණේ 2019 පෙබරවාරි මාසයේ පමණි.

පාස්කු ප්‍රහාරය, කොවිඩ් වසංගතය සහ ආර්ථික අර්බුදය හේතුවෙන් සංචාරක කර්මාන්තය බිඳ වැටුණු අතර නව රජය පත් වීමෙන් පසු සංචාරක කර්මාන්තයේ ශීඝ්‍ර වර්ධනයක් පෙන්නුම් කරයි.
