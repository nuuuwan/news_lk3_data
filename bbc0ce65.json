    "The Sri Lankan government has unreservedly rejected the reference to a Tamil Genocide Remembrance Day in the statement issued on 23 July 2023 by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
    "\u201cCanada's continued reference to a false, distorted narrative of the past conflict in Sri Lanka is aimed solely at achieving local vote-bank electoral gains, and is not conducive to broader goals of communal harmony,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.",
    "Sri Lanka urges Canada and its leaders to support Sri Lanka in its efforts to ensure stability, progress, peace and reconciliation among all communities in all parts of Sri Lanka, as well as among communities of Sri Lankan heritage overseas, it added."
