    "\"You must have seen the SJB today cheerfully claiming at an SJB rally in Polonnaruwa that a JVP member had joined the SJB. This will create big news on television today. All SJB leaders embraced him happily. I know who he is. He is Hitihamilage Saman Kumara, who submitted his nominations for the Local Government elections to contest for the Bendiwewa Division of the Polonnaruwa Municipal Council under the SLFP ticket. The SLFP member has become a JVP member for the SJB. They are anyhow trying to hoodwink the people,\" he said."
