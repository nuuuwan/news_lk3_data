    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A tender for a 50 MegaWatt wind power plant by state-run Ceylon Electricity Board has been blocked to prevent sharply lower power purchase prices from competitive bidding being revealed to the public, opposition legislator Kabir Hashim charged in parliament.",
    "A technical evaluation of three companies which had submitted bids had been completed according to information coming to him, Hashim told parliament Wednesday.",
    "\u201cThe financial bids were due to be opened on May 17 based on information we are receiving,\u201d Hashim said.",
    "\u201cBut due to pressure from certain officials we are learning that there is an attempt to cancel the financial bid. I am asking why the bid was not opened on May 17.",
    "\u201cWe learn that the Sustainable Energy Authority Chairman and officials have engaged in a big operation to stop this. I do not know who these people are representing.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis is something that is required for the country. We believe the wind power unit could be purchased at a price below 6.0 cents t under competitive tender.",
    "\u201cThis tender has been blocked to stop this. So, blocking this is big problem.\u201d",
    "\u201cI do not know whether some corrupt officials are connected to some companies and acting on behalf of these companies (kade yanawader danney ne). I am asking the chairman of the Committee on Public Finance, Harsha de Silva, to summon the officials and ask them to open the bids.\u201d",
    "Hashim said he had urged Sri Lanka authorities in parliament itself on earlier occasions not to agree on a power purchase price for a 484MW plant by India\u2019s Adani group which came without tender until competitive bids for the smaller Mannar plant were opened.",
    "Related Sri Lanka to buy wind power from Adani for 8.26 US cents",
