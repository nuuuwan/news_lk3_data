    "Acting on a tip off, police say they tracked the 34-year-old to the outskirts of Kathmandu and \u201carrested him while he was trying to flee,\u201d the statement added. They say they also seized more than a dozen mobile phones, five laptops and tablets, and more than $200,000 in Nepali and foreign currencies at his home.",
    "This comes nearly two decades after he first gained international attention. In 2005, at the age of 15, he retreated into the jungle to pray for 10 months, local media reported at the time. His followers once claimed that he did so without food, sleep or water.",
    "Those claims were never independently verified, but it led some to laud him as the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama, who was born in Nepal some 2,500 years ago, and later became known simply as Buddha, meaning \u201cenlightened one.\u201d",
    "Bomjan\u2019s \u201cBuddha Boy\u201d moniker helped to further his fame, as thousands from across the country and neighboring India traveled to see him while he was in the jungle.",

    "But in recent years, Bomjan has been dogged by allegations of wrongdoing. His ashram was raided in 2019 while investigating the disappearance of four of his followers.",
    "Police on Wednesday said \u201cfurther investigations and searches are being conducted regarding the followers who have disappeared from Bomjan\u2019s ashram at various times.\u201d",
    "The sexual abuse charges relate to a nun, who in 2018 publicly accused him of raping her at one of his ashrams when she was a minor.",
    "At the time, officials at Bodhi Shrawan Dharma Sangha, the organization that manages Bomjan\u2019s ashrams, denied the rape allegations in a news conference, calling them \u201ccompletely made-up.\u201d"
