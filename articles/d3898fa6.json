  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has formally requested President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to grant permission for its officials to meet with Rohingya refugees detained in the country, to assess their situation.",
    "HRCSL Chairperson Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya has made this request in writing, citing the Commission\u2019s mandate to monitor the welfare of persons held in detention.",
    "The development follows the rescue of 115 Rohingya refugees, including women and children, by the Sri Lankan Navy off the coast of Mullaitivu recently. The refugees, who arrived by boat, are currently held at the Mullaitivu Air Force Base.",
    "On 26 December, an HRCSL delegation had visited the Air Force Base intending to investigate the condition of the detainees. However, Air Force officials denied access, stating that approval from the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration was required.",
    "The HRCSL said it subsequently sought permission from the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, who clarified that authority to grant access lies with the Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Minister. The Department of Immigration and Emigration had noted it does not have the jurisdiction to permit such access.",
    "Highlighting the critical situation, the HRCSL emphasised that over 40 of the refugees are young children, and their welfare requires urgent attention. The Commission underscored its statutory power to ensure the humane treatment of detainees in any holding facility, regardless of the circumstances of their detention.",
    "The HRCSL in its communique has urged the President, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Tri-Forces and Defence Minister, to issue directives ensuring unhindered access to the refugees for its officials. The letter calls for immediate action to uphold the rights and welfare of the detained asylum seekers, as stipulated under both national and international standards."
