    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly on Friday that Israel \u201cmust finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza, giving a defiant U.N. speech despite growing international isolation over his refusal to end the devastating war in Gaza.",
    "He spoke after dozens of delegates from multiple nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly hall en masse Friday as he prepared to speak.",
    "As the Israeli leader spoke, unintelligible shouts echoed around the hall. Applause rang out in other quarters as he spoke. The U.S. delegation, which has backed Netanyahu in his campaign against Hamas, stayed put. The few world powers in attendance, the United States and the United Kingdom, did not send their most senior officials or even their UN ambassador to their section. Instead, it was filled out with more junior, low-level diplomats.",
    "\u201cAnti-semitism dies hard. In fact, it doesn\u2019t die at all,\u201d Netanyahu said. Netanyahu routinely accuses his critics of antisemitism.",
    "As he has often in the past, Netanyahu held up a visual aid \u2014 a map of the region titled \u201cTHE CURSE.\u201d He marked it up with a large marker. He ascended the podium wearing a special hostages pin with a QR code that leads to a site about Oct. 7 that was established specially for international public diplomacy needs. The members of the Prime Minister\u2019s delegation, ministers and those accompanying him are also wearing identical pins.",
    "Netanyahu also frequently praised President Donald Trump, his chief ally in his political and military approach in the region.",
    "In an \u201cunprecedented operation,\u201d the Israeli army will take over the mobile phones of Gaza residents and Hamas operatives and his speech will be broadcast live through the mobile devices.\u201d",
    "Netanyahu faces international isolation, accusations of war crimes and growing pressure to end a conflict he has continued to escalate. Friday\u2019s speech was his chance to push back on the international community\u2019s biggest platform.",
    "Netanyahu\u2019s annual speech to the U.N. General Assembly is always closely watched, often protested, reliably emphatic and sometimes a venue for dramatic allegations. But this time, the stakes are higher than ever for the Israeli leader.",
    "In recent days, Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and others announced their recognition of an independent Palestinian state.",
    "The European Union is considering tariffs and sanctions on Israel. The assembly this month passed a nonbinding resolution urging Israel to commit to an independent Palestinian nation, which Netanyahu has said is a non-starter.",
    "The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant accusing Netanyahu of crimes against humanity, which he denies. And the U.N\u2019s highest court is weighing South Africa\u2019s allegation that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, which it vehemently refutes.",
    "Against that backdrop, Netanyahu sounded resolute Thursday as he boarded a plane in Israel to head for the U.N.\u2019s annual meeting of top-level leaders in New York.",
    "\u201cI will tell our truth,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cI will condemn those leaders who, instead of condemning the murderers, rapists and burners of children, want to give them a state in the heart of Israel.\u201d",
    "At a special session of the assembly this week, nation after nation expressed horror at the 2023 attack by Hamas militants that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, saw 251 taken hostage and triggered the war. Many of the representatives went on to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and influx of aid.",
    "Israel\u2019s sweeping offensive has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in Gaza and displaced 90 percent of its population, with an increasing number now starving.",
    "While more than 150 countries now recognize a Palestinian state, the United States has not, providing Israel with vociferous support. But President Donald Trump pointedly signaled Thursday there are limits, telling reporters in Washington that he wouldn\u2019t let Israel annex the occupied West Bank.",
    "Israel hasn\u2019t announced such a move, but several leading members in Netanyahu\u2019s government have advocated doing so. And officials recently approved a controversial settlement project that would effectively cut the West Bank in two, a move that critics say could doom chances for a Palestinian state. Trump and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet during his visit.",
    "Back in the Mideast, in addition to the phone takeover, Israel said Friday it would broadcast Netanyahu\u2019s speech from southern Israel into Gaza, carrying his remarks across the border to Palestinians in the besieged enclave. His office \u201cinstructed civilian groups in cooperation with the army to place loudspeakers on trucks on the Israeli side of the border,\u201d it said in a statement, noting that the broadcasts would be arranged so they would not endanger soldiers.",
    "Netanyahu was preceded Thursday by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who addressed the General Assembly via video, since the U.S. denied him a visa. He welcomed the announcements of recognition but said the world needs to do more to make statehood happen.",
    "\u201cThe time has come for the international community to do right by the Palestinian people\u201d and help them realize \u201ctheir legitimate rights to be rid of the occupation and to not remain a hostage to the temperament of Israeli politics,\u201d he said.",
    "Abbas leads the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers portions of the West Bank. Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza in 2006 before seizing control from Abbas\u2019 forces the following year.",
    "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, then withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinians want all three territories to form their envisioned state, part of a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d that the international community has embraced for decades.",
    "Netanyahu opposes it robustly, maintaining that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas."
