    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has filed a fundamental rights petition in Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court seeking an order to reduce electricity tariffs, reports said, even as an early downward revision is anticipated mid-January.",
    "In his petition, Premadasa has named the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Minister of Power & Energy, the Secretary to the Minister of Power & Energy, and the Attorney General as respondents.",
    "Premadasa has suggested that an unprecedented increase in costs of energy and electricity against the backdrop of the country\u2019s worst financial crisis since Independence was the result of a series of malicious, unlawful, or negligent actions by the authorities.",
    "Noting that every citizen, under and in terms of article 14(1)(g) of the constitution is entitled to the freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in any lawful occupation, business, trade or enterprise, the petitioner said the Parliamentary",
    "Sectoral Oversight Committee on Alleviating the Impact of the Economic Crisis has found that businesses that suffered from the crisis are now in further turmoil due to the rise in electricity prices.",
    "Citing the findings of the committee, Premadasa has highlighted possible violations of fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution.",
    "In this light, the petitioner has sought determinations from the country\u2019s apex court that one or several of the respondents have infringed on the rights of the petitioner or of the citizens of Sri Lanka, among other orders. An interim order to reduce electricity costs or tariffs is also being sought.",
    "Meanwhile, Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said in December that Sri Lanka may have an early power tariff revision mid-January 2024 that will see electricity rates reduced to reflect the increased use of hydropower generation made possible by unusually high rainfall.",
    "Wijesekara said, however, that he is not in a rush to make a premature announcement as it will be up to the CEB and the PUCSL, the regulator, to analyse the data provided by the Departments of Meteorology and Irrigation and arrive at a decision.",
