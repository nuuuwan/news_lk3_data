### Sri Lanka settles USD 60 million Iranian oil debt with tea

Sri Lanka Tea Board has announced that USD 60 million of the USD 251 million owed by Sri Lanka to Iran for fuel imports since 2011 has been paid through tea exports. This initiative follows a strategic agreement signed between the Sri Lankan and Iranian governments to use tea exports as a method of settling the debt, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries said in a statement.

The payments arrears for fuel imports were accumulated over several years due to various economic challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic’s severe impact on the economy, European sanctions imposed since 2011, the collapse of the tourism industry following the Easter attacks, and the overall economic downturn, which led to a shortage of dollars hindering the payment process, the statement added.

### Gambia’s parliament upholds ban on female genital mutilation

Lawmakers in the West African nation of Gambia on Monday rejected a bill that would have overturned a ban on female genital cutting. The attempt to become the first country in the world to reverse such a ban had been closely followed by activists abroad.

The vote followed months of heated debate in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people. Lawmakers effectively killed the bill by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote.

The procedure, also called female genital mutilation, includes the partial or full removal of girls’ external genitalia, often by traditional community practitioners with tools such as razor blades or at times by health workers. It can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications but remains a widespread practice in parts of Africa.
