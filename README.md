### 2025-09-12 (Friday)

### Public property, ours or theirs?

*2025-09-12 23:23:23* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Public-property-ours-or-theirs/4-781611) · `en`

It is no secret that in nearly all contracts of the State, the unseen hand is that of the politician in power

We do not think that offences against public property, giving the concept a wider interpretation, have lessened in any measure. What has happened is that the very law makers have found ways and means of interpreting the concept to their advantage, legitimising their untrammelled abuse of public affairs and public money. Their colossal excesses in the use of public money are not considered offences against public property, but attendant to the exercise of political power, therefore legitimate

“The best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly” – Abraham Lincoln

“Something is rotten in the State of Denmark” – Shakespeare (Hamlet)

As the dust settles on the hullabaloo surrounding the arrest of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we the public, are left wondering what all the fuss was about.

### Strike on Doha, strike against the order: Time for meaningful response

*2025-09-12 23:19:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Strike-on-Doha-strike-against-the-order-Time-for-meaningful-response/4-781609) · `en`

By striking in the heart of Doha, Israel has not only targeted individuals but also the concept of a safe space for mediation

The Doha strike is therefore more than a tactical raid aimed at Hamas leaders; it is a strategic test for the international system. The question is not only whether Israel will pay a price, but whether the global community is willing to defend the principles it professes to uphold. If the answer is no—if words once again substitute for deeds—then every state, large or small, should reckon with what that precedent means for its own security. Today it is Qatar that has seen its sovereignty breached. Tomorrow it could be any nation whose territory offers refuge, real or perceived, to an adversary of a more powerful neighbour

### Gaza genocide: Global North’s premeditated crime

US and European corporations profiting already out of the genocide are going to be the same ones which would be making even more profit by rebuilding Gaza into another Riviera once all Palestinians are either ‘spirited away’ or killed or starved to death by Netanyahu

UN and its aid agencies are pronouncing condemnation after condemnation and reading out media statements, and while UK, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and about 20 other countries including China are once again repeating the stale two-state solution and resolving to recognise Palestine as an independent state, none of them are prepared to intervene with force and stop the carnage and starvation of Palestinians. Their complicity in this crime is premeditated

Governments must continue investing in children’s nutrition, allowing every child in the region to grow up healthy and strong

Every child has the right to eat well so that he or she can grow up healthy in body and mind. When children get the right nutrition, they are full of energy and better able to learn, play, and chase their dreams. Leadership all over South Asia must prioritise collective action to overcome the triple burden of malnutrition so that, together, we can raise a generation of productive, thriving children who can build a strong and prosperous region. No company should profit at the cost of children’s health. Governments must put stronger protections in place so that children grow up surrounded by healthy food choices, not junk food marketing – UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia Sanjay Wijesekera

Unhealthy food environments are fuelling a worsening nutrition crisis for children in the region

### When politics meets drug trade: Sri Lanka Customs under fire

*2025-09-12 23:12:00* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/When-politics-meets-drug-trade-Sri-Lanka-Customs-under-fire/14-781605) · `en`

The Middeniya–Thalawa chemical haul shows how deeply narcotics have penetrated our borders. Unless Sri Lanka Customs comes clean on red-flagged containers, public trust is bound to collapse.

The recent seizure of 50,000 kilograms of precursor chemicals in Middeniya–Thalawa is not simply a policing triumph—it is a stark warning. Chemicals of this scale cannot move into the country unless Sri Lanka Customs, our frontline border agency, has failed in its duty of care.

Allegations of political links make the scandal even graver. One chief suspect, a former SLPP local politician, is accused of transporting enough chemicals to produce 200 kilograms of methamphetamine (“ice”) worth over Rs. 2 billion. This raises a disturbing question: how did such consignments bypass Sri Lanka Customs’ controls in the first place?

### Former chief justice Karki named Nepal’s first female leader after unrest

Sushila Karki, a former chief justice, will become the first woman to lead Nepal, to be sworn in as interim leader later on Friday after violent anti-graft protests forced Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign, the president’s office said.

President Ramchandra Paudel’s office announced Karki’s appointment following negotiations between Paudel, army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel and the protesters who led Nepal’s worst upheaval in years.

Fifty-one people were killed and more than 1,300 injured this week in the anti-graft protests by the ‘Gen Z’ movement, named for the age of its mainly young supporters.

The protest was sparked by a social media ban that has since been rolled back. The violence subsided only after Oli resigned on Tuesday.

Karki, 73, would take the oath of office at 9:15 p.m. local time (1530 GMT), said Archana Khadka Adhikari, information officer at the president’s office. Two other ministers would also be sworn in along with her, local TV channels reported.
