    "In the 2024 GII, Sri Lanka ranks 89th, reflecting consistent performance in key areas. Despite recent economic challenges, the country has shown notable strengths in innovation outputs (82nd) and ranks an impressive 14th globally in ICT services exports. This demonstrates Sri Lanka\u2019s capability to leverage innovation effectively. GII Editor Sacha Wunsch-Vincent stated, \u201cSri Lanka is emerging as a key player in the global innovation arena, with our tech sector leading the way in ICT services exports. Our focus on sustainability and building a strong knowledge base positions us for growth in the industries of the future. The innovation momentum is clear\u2014Sri Lanka is ready to embrace the next phase of digital transformation.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s ICT sector, powered by leading entities like Sri Lanka Telecom and Dialog Axiata, has been instrumental in expanding digital services and infrastructure, establishing the country as a regional telecommunications and ICT export leader. Additionally, Sri Lanka ranks 30th globally in ecological sustainability and an impressive 6th in GDP per unit of energy use, reflecting a commitment to optimising energy consumption as part of broader sustainability initiatives.",
    "The GII also identifies areas for improvement, particularly in human capital and research (110th) and market sophistication (109th). Low levels of education expenditure (127th) and venture capital investment (101st), along with limited university-industry collaboration, underscore areas for further development to strengthen the country\u2019s innovation potential.",
    "As a valuable tool for policymakers, the GII provides crucial insights to build resilient innovation ecosystems. By highlighting Sri Lanka\u2019s innovation strengths and areas for growth, the GII helps guide policy decisions and resource allocation, supporting the nation\u2019s journey toward economic recovery and enhanced global competitiveness.",
    "The launch event will provide a unique platform for discussions on Sri Lanka\u2019s innovation priorities and strategies for leveraging innovation in economic recovery."
