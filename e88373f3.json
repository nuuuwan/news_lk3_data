    "William  Shakespeare wrote in his play \u201cJulius  Caesar\u201d thus \u2013 \u201cHis life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, This was a man.\u201d . Much hackneyed as they may be , these enduring words of the Bard of Avon aptly describe veteran journalist Gamini Weerakoon who breathed his last on 11 November 2023.His funeral was held at Kanatte on Sunday Nov 12.",
    "Gamini Weerakoon known to his friends and colleagues as \u201cGamma\u201d was an integral part of Sri Lanka\u2019s English journalistic realm for more than five decades. He entered journalism  as a news reporter and gradually  rose up  from the ranks to retire as Editor. He served in many capacities such as reporter,  sub- editor, feature writer,news editor,deputy editor, editor, columnist and consulting editor in his eventful career. Until the very end he was in harness as a journalist  by writing the weekly column titled \u201cDoublespeak\u201d for the \u201cSunday Times\u201d.",
    "Though his entry into Journalism was through \u201cLake House\u201d Gamma spent the greater part of his  journalistic life at Bloemendhal road with Upali newspapers. It was there that he excelled  as editor for more than two decades. \u201cThe Island\u201dof  13 Nov 2023 published an editorial titled \u201cWhen great Oaks fall\u201d about the former editor. The editorial sums up Gamini Weerakoon\u2019s contribution to Journalism concisely. Here are some excerpts \u2013",
    "\u2018Fondly known as Gamma to his fellow scribes, Weerakoon left Lake House in the early 1980s to join the team Upali Wijewardene handpicked to launch The Island. He played a key role in crafting a new brand of journalism, which quickly gained immense popularity. He succeeded Vijitha Yapa as the editor, and his was a memorably long innings in journalism. He elevated the quality and effectiveness of Sri Lankan journalism and inspired others to strive for similar levels of achievement.\u201d",
    "\u201cGamma excelled in editorial writing. He wrote beautifully, forcefully, and persuasively, and his no-holds-barred editorials were simply out of this world; they were loaded with facts and figures, which he clinically analysed with wit and humour thrown in for good measure; they contained very powerful messages that naturally made the conceited rulers of the day furious. The Island became a marked target as a result.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Island bore the brunt of the fury of violent politicians who acted with impunity, but Gamma was not deterred. He would harden under pressure as all good journalists usually do. It was not occasionally that Gamma had a brush with those in authority. He had the pugnacity of a pugilist, and readily pitted himself against the pompous moneybags and self-important politicians, but he was a kind-hearted gentleman, whose integrity was never in question.\u201d",
    "\u201cHaving cut his teeth on journalism during the hot metal printing days, Gamma shepherded The Island into the digital age. He was a multifaceted personality, and his interests were numerous although he basically confined himself to international affairs, politics and economics, as a prolific writer.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe tenaciously campaigned for media freedom.Gamma did not officially label himself as a media trainer but he mentored quite a few journalists during his UNL days, and many of them have joined other publications or pursued careers in media-related fields.Veteran scribes who have been enriching journalism for decades are like great oaks that leave lasting voids when they fall. Gamma was unarguably one of them.\u201d",
    "Gamma\u2019s demise revived memories of those happy days at Bloemendhal road for me and several other former Island journalists. Even as we communicated with each other about Gamma, a few asked me whether I was going to write about him. I said that I was working on a political article and that I may write about Gamma later on. My friends  wanted me to write on Gamma this week itself. One said\u201d You wrote so many articles about politicos. You must write about Gamma and about yourself.  After all he is a journalist and you both were quite close, no?That clinched it. I shelved the article I was working on. This week\u2019s article is all about Gamini Weerakoon.",
    "Gamini Weerakoon came into my life  42 years ago in  1981 when I joined \u201cThe Island\u201d as a Staff Reporter on November 16th. As stated earlier he was known popularly as \u201cGamma\u201d derived from his name Gamini. However Gamma is the third letter of the Greek alphabet and also denotes the third in a  position, order or class.",
    "\u201cGamma\u201d Weerakoon was the third in the editorial hierarchy of \u201cThe Island\u201d when I joined the newspaper. The first two were the  Editor Vijitha Yapa and Deputy Editor Dalton de Silva. Gamini Weerakoon ranked third as the News editor. However Dalton de Silva quit early to be the Reuters Bureau chief in Colombo. Gamma functioned as both News Editor and acting deputy editor for some time prior to being appointed formally as Deputy Editor. Later  he succeeded Vijitha Yapa as Editor. I have worked under him as a journalist in his three capacities of News Editor,Deputy Editor and Editor.",
    "At the outset I would like to relate the circumstances under which I started working for  the Island in 1981. I was then a journalist   in the Tamil Daily\u201dVirakesari\u201d. Although  I was a Staff reporter at the Editorial in Colombo, I had  been stationed in Jaffna since July 1981. This was because the \u201cVirakesari\u201ds  veteran Jaffna correspondent Sellathurai had been hospitalized with a serious ailment. Since Jaffna was of crucial importance to a Tamil newspaper, I was sent there  from Colombo to hold the Fort.",
    "The \u201cSunday Island\u201d was launched in October 1981. The Daily Island was to be launched on Nov 16. The paper was looking for a journalist to report from Jaffna as a staff correspondent. My friends Ajith Samaranayake and Ravindran Casinader  who had begun working for \u201cSunday Island\u201d had recommended my name. I was already acquainted with Vijitha Yapa when he was the media liaison officer at the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) headed by Upali Wijewardene. So I came down to Colombo from Jaffna for an interview at Upali newspapers Ltd.",
    "The interview was a life-changing one. I was interviewed by Vijitha Yapa and Gamini Weerakoon. They wanted me to work as the staff correspondent for the paper in Jaffna. I declined the offer and said that I wanted to work in Colombo and not Jaffna. At that point Gamma got up abruptly  and started leaving but Vijitha continued to talk to me and asked me what I wanted to do in Colombo.",
    "Weerakoon tarried at the door and told Yapa \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in wasting time Vijitha, we want someone in Jaffna but he doesn\u2019t want to be there. So we better look for someone else\u201d. But Yapa replied \u201cThat was our idea but he has another idea. We\u2019ll try and work something out\u201d. Gamma just shrugged his shoulders and left but Vijitha continued to engage with me. The end result was that I ended up working for \u201cThe Island\u201d in Colombo instead of Jaffna. This was all due to Vijitha Yapa\u2019s accommodative flexibility.",
    "Though Gamma was reluctant to take me on initially, things changed after I starterd working under him. Both Yapa and Gamma wanted me to concentrate on Tamil affairs in writing for the papers. I was hesitant as I feared my copy may be altered  due to political reasons. Both assured me that would not happen as long as I reported the facts accurately. I agreed to do the Tamil round.",
    "I plunged in to work and began enjoying my entry into English journalism. I relocated from Wellawatte to Kotahena to be within walking distance of Upali newspapers. With rising armed militancy, the \u201cTamil round\u201d in news reporting became turbulently exciting.  I worked hard and wrote many news stories. Many of them were the lead stories. Gamma as news editor  was pleased and began to rely on  me very much.",
    "One day he joked \u201cMy friends are saying the paper  is not \u201cThe Island\u201d but \u201cThe Peninsula\u201d because your by-llnes are dominating the front page\u201d.I reminded him jovially that he did not want to hire me in the first place. He responded by saying that he wanted reports from Jaffna then  and pointed out that Iwas writing the Jaffna stories from Colombo now.He added as an afterthought \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were an Old Thomian then\u201d.",
    "Gradually Gamini Weerakoon and I became very close to each other. Even though we had different political views there existed a bond of friendship between us that baffled many.Gamma in many respects was an enigma.",
    "Gamini Abhaya Weerakoon was born on 19 March 1941. His family was residing in Mt.Lavinia then and young Weerakoon had both his primary and secondary education at the school by the sea. It was as a Thomian that he acquired his lifelong pet name \u201cGamma\u201dderived from Gamini.",
    "He was a member of the triumphant rugby team of 1961 captained by Tony Sirimanne. Gamma was a unility player in the pack and played in several positions such as lock,prop, second row and wing forward. Among fellow team mates were Wilhelm Koch and Maurice Fairweather.  Gamma won a few field events in Athletics  too.",
    "He entered the Science faculty of the Colombo University as a BSc student but never completed his degree.  Gamma  told me once that he engaged in all types of activity in campus except academic pursuits and was notorious for cutting lectures. This was corroborated by a cousin of mine who was Gamma\u2019s contemporary at Varsity. (my cousin too did not get his degree).",
    "The transition from undergrad to journo was related to me by Gamma himself. When he reached a dead end as a BSc student, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam known as Neelan had  come  to Gamma\u2019s aid. Neelan took Gamma to the then Law Faculty Dean Prof.T.Nadarajah who kindly facilitated a transfer for Gamma  to the law faculty. Unfortunately his new avatar as law student did not last long",
    "There was an illness resulting in a  throat operation due to which Gamini Weerakoon\u2019s voice got affected. Though it improved greatly later, Gamma was terribly embarrassed in the initial stages. As he told me once \u201c I wanted to be an articulate advocate like GG or Colvin making thundering arguments in my powerful voice but  now it had been reduced to a pipsqueak. So I thought there was no point in becoming a lawyer\u201d. Gamma began exploring other possibilities.",
    "Journalism beckoned! Gamini Weerakoon had displayed a flair for writing at school. He was recruited  as a reporter  in 1966 by the legendary Denzil Peiris the then editor of \u201cThe Observer\u201d published by Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd.(ANCL).  It is the practice in newspaers to allocate specific areas or spheres to reporters to cover \u2013 apart from general assignments \u2013  as part of their journalistic duty.",
    "The second half of the sixties in the 20th century was a period of youth unrest and student turbulence globally. Sri Lanka known then as Ceylon was no exception. The United National Party(UNP) Government under Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was in power then. The Education Minister was the controversial IMRA Iriyagolla. There were only two universities then in Peradeniya and Colombo and the Education minister was in charge of schools as well as universities. There was much friction among the undergrads,a cademic staff and ministerial authorities. The student unions were highly politicised and inclined towards the left.",
    "The recent undergrad Gamma was assigned the Higher education or campus round to cover as a reporter. It was a very wise and appropriate decision by the Editor. Gamma\u2019s campus contacts were huge and wide. Besides he was able to saunter around varsity precincts like an undergrad. The result was a wide range of news stories many of them scoops and exclusives . Gamini Weerakoon made his mark as a reporter. He also realised that his life\u2019s vocation was journalism.",
    "Apart from the campus round , Gamini reported on other matters  including general politics. He also served as a courts reporter and Parliament affairs reporter at times .  He wrote news features too.After a short  stint at subbing, Gamma became News Editor. In 1973 \u201cLake House\u201dwas taken over by the United Front Govt led by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. There were drastic changes and Gamini became the \u201cDaily News\u201d news editor.",
    "Meanwhile there was romance in the  Beira lake air. Gamma wooed and won the hand of  Lake House journalist Rajitha Unantenna. Rajitha\u2019s father was PB Unantenna , a member of Parliament representing the Hanguranketa constituency in the Central Province. PB Unantenna had been elected from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) in the 1970 elections. He had earlier contested in 1960 and 1965 and lost.",
    "The newly weds took up residence right across Lake House at Regent flats near the Regal theatre. Their only  daughter Surangi was born. It was then that Gamma bought his famous orange  coloured Volkeswagon I think.",
    "In July 1977 the UNP led by Junius Richard Jayewardene came to power in a landslide victory. However  Lake House  was not given back to the rightful owners although JR himself was related to the Wijewardene family. In 1978  , Kotte MP and incumbent speaker Anandatissa de Alwis was appointed Minister of State ( this was a cabinet post different to the present ministers of state). The state owned media came under his purview. Once again there were changes in Lake House, Veteran journalist and the then Reuters Correspondent Clarence \u201cClarry\u201dFernando became \u201cDaily News\u201dEditor.Incidently Anandatissa de Alwis was Clarry\u2019s brother in law.",
    "Gamini Weerakoon found himself sidelined and somewhat stifled under the new dispensation.So when Upali Wijewardene launched a newspaper,Gamma  perceived it as an opportunity to move out of Lake House. What happened thereafter would be related in the second and final part of this article .",
