    "Salesforce AI Research has unveiled new innovations to help enterprises deploy AI agents that are capable, consistent, and trustworthy.",
    "At the center is CRMArena-Pro, a simulation environment that tests agents in complex, multi-turn scenarios such as sales forecasting, service triage, and CPQ processes. Acting like a digital twin of a business, it introduces real-world \u201cnoise\u201d to measure accuracy, efficiency, and resilience before agents go live, enabling organizations to strengthen performance and trust.",
    "To measure readiness, Salesforce launched the Agentic Benchmark for CRM, the first evaluation tool built specifically for enterprise workflows across five metrics: accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and sustainability. With new models emerging rapidly, this benchmark helps CIOs select the right AI systems while balancing performance with environmental impact.",
    "Complementary tools MCP-Eval and MCP-Universe expand assessment capabilities. MCP-Eval enables scalable testing across synthetic tasks, while MCP-Universe stress-tests agents in real-world scenarios. Together, they provide enterprises with a dual framework for broad evaluations and deeper diagnosis of challenges such as long-context reasoning and adapting to unfamiliar tools.",
