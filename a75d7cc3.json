    "Galle Cricket Club has landed the only Sri Lankan player to have played Australian Big Bash League (BBL) in the recent times, Ruwantha Kellepotha for the Major League Tournament 2023.\u00a0 The 31-year-old all-rounder who represented Melbourne Renegades in the BBL also went on to make his debut for Victoria in the Shefield Shield becoming the only Sri Lankan to do so since Gamini Goonasena who had played for New South Wales in 1960s. Kellepotha who had previously played first class cricket in Sri Lanka, has now opted to play for Galle Cricket Club and the all-rounder was able to live up to the expectations when he made unbeaten 87 not out Friday (23) before following it up with three wickets on Saturday (24) including the price scalp of Avishka Fernando of Sinhalese Sports Club.
