    "In a significant development for Sri Lanka\u2019s Fairtrade sector, a stakeholders\u2019 meeting was recently held in Colombo in December 2024, organised by the Export Development Board (EDB) and the Fairtrade Network of Asia Pacific Producers (NAPP), Sri Lanka. The meeting aimed to discuss the main projects currently executing, future of Fairtrade in Sri Lanka, issues pertaining to the sector and its expanding international presence.",
    "The event brought together high-level representatives from various Sri Lankan and international Fairtrade organisations, including EDB Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mangala Wijesinghe; Director General C.D. Dharmasena; Fairtrade NAPP Chief Operating Officer Bindu Sukumarapillai; Regional General Manager for South Asia Subhra Tudu; Fairtrade Original Netherlands Development Manager Martin Boon and, key stakeholders from Government institutions such as the Department of Commerce, Sri Lanka Tea Board, Coconut Development Authority, National Craft Council, Department of Agriculture and Industrial Technology Institution also participated, demonstrating broad support from both the public and private sectors.",
    "The main focus of the meeting was the Framework of Cooperation (FoC) \u2013 an agreement designed to strengthen Fairtrade networks, expand market access for Sri Lankan Fairtrade products, and enhance collaboration between Sri Lanka and international Fairtrade bodies. The FoC aims to promote Sri Lanka\u2019s Fairtrade-certified products, including tea, coconut-based goods, spices, and handicrafts in global markets.",
    "The Framework of Cooperation (FOC) is a platform where participants could raise their concerns that require Government attention to help recovery, promote sustainability, and boost the export of Fairtrade products.",
    "The EDB, as the primary signatory for Sri Lanka, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the FoC. The agreement, which received Cabinet approval in December 2023, was formally signed in January 2024. The initiative is expected to boost Sri Lanka\u2019s exports, align with global sustainability goals, and improve trade terms for local producers.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Fairtrade-certified products have seen increasing demand, particularly in the European Union (EU), due to their sustainable production practices and the ethical treatment of workers. Products such as tea, spices, and handicrafts are now highly sought after, as consumers in developed markets look for goods that reflect sustainability and corporate responsibility. In 2022, Sri Lanka\u2019s Fairtrade-certified exports generated approximately Euro 1 million. With 72 export companies and nearly 28,000 farmers involved in Fairtrade production, the country is well-positioned for further growth in the global market.",
    "The meeting underscored the importance of Fairtrade in promoting sustainable development. By ensuring fair wages, better working conditions, and improved market access, Fair trade helps reduce poverty while supporting both social and environmental sustainability. The initiative also aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), offering a win-win scenario for producers and consumers alike.",
    "In his keynote address, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) Chairman emphasised the country\u2019s growing recognition as a reliable source of ethically produced goods. \u201cSri Lanka is gaining a reputation for ethical trade, and we expect more producers to adopt Fairtrade standards as global demand continues to grow,\u201d he stated.",
    "Looking ahead, the Framework of Cooperation (FoC) is expected to increase Sri Lanka\u2019s Fairtrade exports, particularly to the EU, by diversifying product offerings and expanding market access. The initiative is also anticipated to provide significant socio-economic benefits, especially for small-scale producers across the country.",
    "As the meeting concluded, participants reaffirmed their commitment to advancing the Fairtrade movement in Sri Lanka and strengthening international trade links. The EDB is optimistic about the potential for increased exports, foreign exchange earnings, and improved living standards for local farmers and workers.",
    "With growing international demand for ethically sourced products, Sri Lanka is poised to seize the opportunities offered by Fairtrade certification, further benefiting its economy and the livelihoods of small-scale producers across the country."
