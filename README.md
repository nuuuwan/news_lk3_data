AKD with Senior Economic Advisor and Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

Act I: Ranil Wickremesinghe (and his CBSL chief) turn the debt problem into a ticking debt-bomb with the ISB surge at tail-end of Prime Ministerial tenure (2015-2019). (https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/the-real-cause-of-sri-lankas-debt-trap/)

Act II: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ignores the ‚ÄòChina card‚Äô of ongoing discussions for debt-rollover, inducts new technocrats and pivots to the IMF option. Ranil Wickremesinghe, nominated not elected to Parliament, is appointed by besieged Gotabaya as PM and selected by the SLPP-dominated parliament as President, defeating the competing candidate-- their dissenting colleague and Mahinda‚Äôs ideologue in 2005 and 2010, Dullas Alahapperuma. (Insiders say RW was Basil and Gota‚Äôs choice; Mahinda tells media he voted for Dullas.)

Sivajilingam in the north. Social activists are arrested under the Terrorism Act in the South. Why this dual stand. Consult the Attorney General during these arrests.

I congratulate the government headed by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. I also thank the people of Kurunegala Electoral District who supported me amidst massive political challenges.

Prior to 2015, a massive voice was raised among the people on racism, religion and corruption. If the Ranil -Maithri government came to power in 2015, the country would have improved.

Religious leaders advised Gotabhaya Rajapakse to manage this country to become Hitler. But he was spontaneously stupid. In the end, the country opposed the worst crises.

It was in this context that the people of the country formed the power -led government. Remember that there is no way. The authority is like swing.
