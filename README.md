### காங்கிரஸ்களின் பின்னடைவு : முஸ்லிம்களுக்கான தனித்துவ அரசியலின் எதிர்காலம்?

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s former defence minister was arrested on Sunday over his alleged role in Yoon’s declaration of martial law last week, prosecutors said.

Yoon survived an impeachment vote in the opposition-led parliament late on Saturday, prompted by Tuesday’s short-lived attempt to impose martial law, but the leader of his own party said the president would effectively be excluded from his duties before eventually stepping down.

The leader of Yoon’s People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, in a joint press conference with the prime minister, said on Sunday that Yoon will not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early resignation.

Ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who stepped down on Wednesday after Yoon rescinded martial law, was seen as a central figure in the debacle. He had proposed martial law to the president, according to a senior military official and the impeachment filings.

### A Possible Transformation

These are unprecedented times in Sri Lankan Political history. A hopeful, and idealistic left wing party has captured not only the presidency, but a solid two-thirds majority in parliament. For the first time, Sri Lanka will get to see what a left wing party does with the power to completely remake the political landscape.

But one does not have to speculate as to what the policy direction of the country will be. The NPP presidential manifesto is publicly available. Over the course of over 130 pages, it lays out in detail what the legislative priorities of this administration are. I took the liberty of reading this document, and as an American-born leftist, I am deeply impressed.

### Two Bhikkhunis – one ancient, the other of the recent past

*2024-12-08 04:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/two-bhikkhunis-one-ancient-the-other-of-the-recent-past/) · `en`

December to me is the month to celebrate women. I presume the reason is that I revere Sanghamitta Theri, daughter of Emperor Asoka, who on request of King Devanampiya Tissa (250 – 210 BC) on behalf of the women in his court, came to Lanka. She brought a sapling from the Gaya Bo Tree under which Siddhartha Gautama solved the riddle of samsaric existence and found a solution. She also started the Bhikkhuni Order in this country; the request being made by Queen Anula, sister-in-law of King Devanampiya Tissa.

Theri Sanghamitta’s arrival in a then port in the Jaffna Peninsula now known as Jambakolapatuna and her being conducted in procession to Anuradhapura occurred in the month of December, hence our observance of Unduvap Poya this month along with Sanghamitta Day.

### Ranil’s ascent in the UNP to become PM after the Premadasa assassination

On September 21, 2024, Sri Lanka will hold (Note: this was written before the election) its ninth presidential election. Unlike all previous such polls, which were in effect two-way battles between the governing party and the main opposition party, this is a three-way contest between Wickremesinghe, Premadasa of the SJB and Dissanayake of the JVP – the latter heading a coalition dubbed National People’s Power (NPP).

But the election is taking place on a battleground largely of Wickremesinghe’s making. The 21st Amendment he pushed through gave birth to an independent Election Commission. He also enacted a campaign finance law that enables the commission to decide the amounts candidates can spend and to enforce these limits. The commission is conducting this election with unprecedented even-handedness and applying long-ignored election laws – including against Wickremesinghe’s own campaign.

Wickremesinghe’s deal with the IMF earlier came under severe opposition criticism;

### A CONSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT

*2024-12-08 03:28:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-constitutional-blueprint/) · `en`

Shortly before the Presidential Election, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the NPP, committed himself to the abolition of the office of Executive President. Following his election by the people to the office of President of the Republic, and the overwhelming majority which his party received in the general election, it may be confidently assumed that steps will shortly be taken to implement that commitment.

The events that followed the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 2015 demonstrated the futility of the partial abolition of the Executive Presidency. That amendment, while requiring the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, enabled the incumbent President (through a transitional provision) to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and also hold three key portfolios. When a few months later Parliament was dissolved, the general election was conducted under laws which had been formulated to complement an executive presidency.

### An impusive visit to George Keyt nearly 40 years ago

*2024-12-08 03:13:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/an-impusive-visit-to-george-keyt-nearly-40-years-ago/) · `en`

A few Sundays ago (this article was written in July 1985) I travelled through the fertile lands of the Dumbara valley and passed through Kundasale, Arangala, Gammaduwa (with its Buddhist Temple of unique design) and Sirimalwatta, to Gunnepana.

The purpose was to see, in person, George Keyt, whose great artistic achievements and invaluable contribution to art in Sri Lanka were so beautifully presented recently in a telefilm Directed by Tissa Liyanasuriya with the script by Tissa Devendra. Up to the time of this TV program it was a hope that a chance meeting would materialize, but it became an urgent need after that.

The drive was tortuous, the roads being more like gullies than even cart tracks. But what bothered me more was a faint recollection of a conversation I cannot remember where, which left with me the impression that the artist does not welcome visitors. However, since the decision had been made I kept going stopping frequently for directions.

தென் கொரிய ஜனாதிபதி யூன் சுக் யோலை பதவி நீக்கம் செய்யும் பிரேரணை மீதான வாக்கெடுப்புக்கு முன்னதாக ஆளும் கட்சியைச் சேர்ந்த மூன்று பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர்களைத் தவிர ஏனைய அனைவரும் வெளிநடப்பு செய்திருந்தனர்.

எவ்வாறாயினும், குறித்த பிரேரணையை மூன்றில் இரண்டு என்ற பெரும்பான்மையில் நிறைவேற்றுவதற்கு தென்கொரியாவின் எதிர்க்கட்சி தவறியுள்ளது.

கடந்த செவ்வாய்க்கிழமை இரவு தென் கொரியா ஜனாதிபதி யூன் சுக் யோல் அவசரமாக இராணுவச் சட்டத்தை அறிவித்தார்.

இதனையடுத்து, தென் கொரியாவின் சியோலில் உள்ள தேசிய பாராளுமன்றத்துக்கு வெளியே பல்லாயிரக்கணக்கான மக்கள் ஜனாதிபதியை நீக்கம் செய்யக்கோரி ஒன்று திரண்டனர்.

இந்தநிலையில், குறித்த இராணுவச் சட்டத்தினை அமுல்படுத்தவதற்கு எதிராக பாராளுமன்றில் தீர்மானம் நிறைவேற்றப்பட்டதுடன், அவரை பதவி நீக்கம் செய்வதற்கான பிரேரணையொன்றை எதிர்க்கட்சிகள் கொண்டுவந்தன.

எனினும், ஜனாதிபதி யூன் சுக் யோல், இராணுவச் சட்டத்தை அறிவித்ததற்காக நேற்று பொதுமக்களிடம் மன்னிப்புக் கோரியதுடன், மீண்டும் அதனை அமுல்படுத்தப் போவதில்லை எனவும் அறிவித்திருந்தார். (a)

### Settling in Guyana – My New Home

*2024-12-08 01:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/settling-in-guyana-my-new-home/) · `en`

After two days of air travel with stops in the Middle East, Europe, and the Caribbean, I was thrilled to land in South America for the first time on the evening of March 20, 1994. My first impressions of Guyana’s only international airport – Timehri International Airport (now Cheddi Jagan International Airport) – were a mixed bag. Half of the Guyanese I encountered at the airport bore a resemblance to me, as they were of East Indian origin or Indo-Guyanese. Most of the immigration, customs, and police personnel were Afro-Guyanese.
