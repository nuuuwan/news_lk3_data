### In Memory Of Comrade Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne: Language As An Aspect Of Sri Lanka’s National Question

*2024-07-28 11:42:41* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/in-memory-of-comrade-dr-vickramabahu-karunaratne-language-as-an-aspect-of-sri-lankas-national-question/) · `en`

Comrade Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne’s legacy deserves recognition through thoughtful analysis. In response to my recent article titled “41 Years to Black July – Our Voices Towards Meaningful Reconciliation,” I propose addressing a critical issue.

Comrade Karunaratne’s political journey began within the Lanka Sam Samaja Party (LSSP). However, in 1972, he parted ways with the LSSP when it joined forces with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The 1972 republican constitution, drafted by the SLFP, inadvertently transformed Sri Lanka into a Sinhala Buddhist state, marginalising the Tamil community. Subsequently, the 1978 Constitution, enacted during Prime Minister JR Jayewardene’s regime (with current President Ranil Wickremesinghe as a cabinet minister), further entrenched Sinhala separatism, further alienating Tamil speakers.

Defending champions India will look to translate their overwhelming dominance in the Women’s Asia Cup to a record-extending eighth title while facing a feisty Sri Lanka in the final here on Sunday.

India have lorded over their opponents in this continental showpiece – hammering Pakistan by seven wickets and followed it up with facile wins over UAE (78 runs), Nepal (82 runs), and Bangladesh (10 wickets). India’s top-order batters and bowlers fired in tandem, not giving their rivals even an iota of chance to mount a fight.

Openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma have scored well in excess of 100 runs and at a healthy strike-rate of over 140, giving India solidity and quick starts alike at the top.

But the management could be even more pleased with the way bowlers responded to the challenge, particularly Deepti Sharma and Renuka Singh.

Deepti is the leading wicket-taker of this event with nine wickets and Renuka is third on the chart with seven scalps.
