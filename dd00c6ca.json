    "COLOMBO (News 1st); National carrier SriLankan Airlines continues to navigate a challenging landscape, with multiple grounded aircraft and a significant shortage of technical personnel adding to existing financial difficulties.",
    "On December 17th, an A330 aircraft bearing the flight number UL 563 departing from Katunayake to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris experienced a technical fault, reportedly related to damage to the brakes and axle.",
    "The aircraft remains grounded at Charles de Gaulle with a scheduled return to Sri Lanka on December 18th.",
    "This incident marks the ninth aircraft currently sidelined from SriLankan Airlines operations.",
    "Five of these remain grounded due to lacking essential equipment, while two undergo maintenance. Airline sources indicate a lack of manpower further hampers maintenance efforts, delaying the return of these aircraft to service.",
    "Engineer and technician shortages have been an ongoing concern for SriLankan Airlines. Since January 2022, the company has lost 138 experienced technicians through resignations, promotions, and retirements. The attractive aviation market coupled with the country's economic situation has reportedly motivated many to seek opportunities elsewhere.",
    "Currently, SriLankan Airlines operates with approximately 380 flight technicians against a required 475, with the number of experienced technicians further limited to around 280. The company's licensed aircraft engineers also face similar pressures, with 40 of their 160 members recently leaving the country."
