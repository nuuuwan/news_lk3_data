‚ÄúEspecially on current taxes, including VAT and other taxes, on revenues and how to achieve them,‚Äù Minister Herath said.

Sri Lanka has to have a budget for 2025 to set revenue and primary balance targets for June 2025, which are quantitative performance criteria when negotiating the next staff level agreement.

The IMF is quite keen on boosting revenues rather than cutting spending. Spending cuts can also achieve the primary deficit.

Sri Lanka was supposed to conduct a review on June 2024 data around September but the elections had delayed the review.

In the earlier program the December data had been set (some of which were to be firmed on this review) but the new administration is planning a vote on account while working on next years budget.

The 10th of September (World Suicide Prevention Day) and the hive of activity that surrounds it each year, has gradually begun to fade; from social media, and from our collective memory. However, there are still red-hot smouldering embers, brightly ablaze in the lives of those affected by mental illness and suicide, including those bereaved by suicide loss.

Prevention in the context of recognising warning signs and risk factors, reducing access to means and reaching out for support, helpline numbers, asking the suicide question, etc. in connection with intervention were widely discussed; in panel discussions, news articles, and social media platforms. However, a key concept discussed in the literature about suicide prevention was/is neglected; and that is postvention.

In brief, international marketing is the process of planning and conducting transactions across national borders to create exchanges that satisfy the objectives of individuals and organisations.

It comes in forms of export/import trade to licensing, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries, turnkey operations, and management contracts.

With the prevailing economic crisis in Sri Lanka and depreciation of the rupee, the only way to address this issue is to increase exports. Sri Lanka exports amounted to Rs. 4,234,913 in 2022 according to Central Bank of Sri Lanka statistics.

In this post-crisis milieu, Government has a difficult balancing act to ensure a positive trade balance, manage its primary account considering IMF expectations, all whilst providing relief to a burdened public in the run up to 2028, when debt payments must resume. Reform should encompass better governance ‚Äì combat corruption, drive exports and investment, stop wastage and a review of tax and industrial policy to strengthen returns. The Government led by the new President must adopt a fact-based approach towards policy, as opposed to strategy and actions that were often driven by political whims and favouritism.

Former JAAF Chief says job of Government is to protect both the employer and employee

The Sri Lankan apparel sector has faced many challenges in recent years. Beyond the well-documented local challenges, the industry has also had to grapple with challenges originating from afar such as COVID-19 and the resultant economic uncertainties in the subsequent years and the geopolitical tensions which have added to the complexities surrounding global maritime logistics which have a direct impact on Sri Lanka‚Äôs favourability as a production location. As international demand waned, many manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized businesses, were forced to reduce operations. However, outdated termination laws in Sri Lanka have hindered local industries‚Äô ability to adapt, leaving many with no choice but to shut down their factories entirely.

A sustainable debt strategy rooted in transparency and collaboration with international stakeholders is essential to restore economic confidence and secure a brighter future for Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt burden has been a persistent challenge, driving the country into numerous fiscal crises over the past few decades, including the 2022 crisis that brought the country to bankruptcy. The country‚Äôs high levels of external and domestic debt have been exacerbated by political mismanagement, economic shocks, COVID pandemic, and global financial pressures. The recent crisis underscores the need for a comprehensive debt sustainability strategy, particularly with a new President in place. Several key options could help Sri Lanka better manage its debt, support long-term economic stability, reduce money printing and regain investor confidence to attract top FDI.
