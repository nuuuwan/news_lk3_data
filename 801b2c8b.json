    "In a bid to reinvigorate regional cooperation, Nepal and Sri Lanka pledged to work together to strengthen the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).",
    "The announcement came during a joint press meet by Nepal\u2019s Foreign Minister NP Saud and his Sri Lankan counterpart, Mohamed Uvais Mohamed Ali Sabry, after a day of fruitful discussions in Kathmandu.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve had serious and cordial discussions on strengthening SAARC and BIMSTEC,\u201d said Saud, emphasizing the need for progress through collective agreements. \u201cCooperation in the United Nations and other multilateral forums was also high on the agenda,\u201d he added.",
    "While both ministers acknowledged the positive state of bilateral relations, focusing on areas like trade, investment, and connectivity, they stressed the importance of looking beyond bilateral interests. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified mutual areas of understanding and interest for further cooperation,\u201d stated Saud, highlighting the traditional bonds of friendship between the two nations.",
    "Sabry echoed Nepal\u2019s commitment to regional collaboration, specifically mentioning education, health, employment, and tourism as key areas for joint initiatives. \u201cWe\u2019re placing special emphasis on regional programs like SAARC and BIMSTEC,\u201d he affirmed, pledging special efforts to encourage Sri Lankan citizens to visit Nepal.",
    "Further strengthening tourism ties was also on the table, with both ministers expressing enthusiasm to work together in promoting travel between the two countries. \u201cToday\u2019s discussions were very positive,\u201d concluded Sabry, reiterating the shared goal of expanding Nepal-Sri Lanka relations.",
    "With Nepal and Sri Lanka joining hands, a renewed sense of optimism permeates the regional landscape. Whether this marks a turning point for SAARC and BIMSTEC remains to be seen, but the renewed commitment from close partners offers a glimmer of hope for a more connected and prosperous South Asia."
