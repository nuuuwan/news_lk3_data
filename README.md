### Extreme Asian heat spurs LNG demand ahead of summer months

Extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region as importers seek cargoes ahead of summer, with imports in South Asia hitting records.

This could tighten available supply and further lift Asian spot prices that have already gained a third since April, with heatwaves across South and Southeast Asia boosting air-conditioner use and other cooling demand. Prices are now at a near six-month peak at $12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and are expected to remain elevated.

“Spot prices are now driven by Asian demand. Temperatures in South Asia are rising due to a heatwave, increasing power demand,” said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE.

While China may still see lower demand compared with its record breaking shipments in 2021, demand from India and the rest of Asia has compensated for any drop-off, Adibi said.

The Colombo High Court today (31) ordered the release of former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Ajith Nivard Cabraal and three other defendants in a case filed against them alleging financial losses caused to the government of Sri Lanka through investments in Greek treasury bonds in 2012.

The attorneys who appeared on behalf of the former CBSL chief had raised objections that the relevant case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) cannot be maintained.

The Colombo High Court Judge Adithya Patabendige, who accepted the relevant objections ordered the release of Ajith Nivard Cabraal and the co-defendants of the case.

The defendants were accused of causing a loss of over Rs. 1.8 billion to the Sri Lankan government through the Greek T-bond investments in 2012.

On 03 May 2024, Cabraal’s attorneys raised preliminary objections, leading to today’s decision to dismiss the case and the release of the defendants.
