    "The Safety Index by Country 2025 Mid-Year, published by Numbeo, a global data aggregator, has ranked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the safest nation in the world. (Note: Andorra, a small, landlocked, independent European coprincipality, is projected to overtake the UAE in the Numbeo 2025 full-year rankings.) The UAE has achieved the highest global ranking in safety due to its effective governance and commitment to public security, but it faces formidable challenges posed by regional instability.",
    "Interestingly, the affluent western nations, hailed as global leaders in public safety and quality of life, are lagging far behind the UAE, and scores of other nations including Sri Lanka! The United States is ranked 89th and the United Kingdom 87th! Their low rankings have been attributed to rising violent crimes in certain urban areas, concerns about public security, especially in densely populated cities, increased reports of theft, robbery, and property crime, and challenges in community policing and social cohesion. Widespread public distrust in law enforcement and deficiencies in safety perception has also had their toll on the rankings of these two nations. Thus, it may be seen that affluence alone does not guarantee public safety.",
    "It is commonly thought that the UAE has succeeded in keeping the crime rate low and ensuring public safety solely due to its strict laws that have drawn heavy criticism from the UN agencies, and international human rights outfits, such as Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch. They have no doubt helped reduce crime significantly, but there are other key factors that have enabled the UAE to make itself safer and more socially cohesive than even its western counterparts; they include advanced security infrastructure, clear legislation, zero-tolerance enforcement, economic stability, expanding job market and generous social welfare services. It is a combination of these factors that has helped the UAE reach the number one position in the Numbeo Safety Index 2025 (Mid-Year). Sri Lanka, which holds the 61st position, finds itself among the countries with moderate safety levels in the world. It was ranked 59th last year. This drop in Numbeo safety ranking indicates a negative shift in how people rate crime and public safety in Sri Lanka, and it runs counter to the incumbent NPP government\u2019s much-advertised election pledge to neutralise the nether world of crime and drugs in just two months. Hardly a day passes without a shooting incident being reported. About 70 incidents of gun violence have claimed nearly 38 lives so far this year, according to media reports.",
    "Why do the Numbeo safety rankings matter? The international community takes them seriously. The Numbeo Safety Index is a widely referenced measure of safety and security the world over, and it is thought to reflect how safe residents and visitors feel in the countries surveyed. Its rankings are known to influence travel planning, business decisions, public policy and expatriate choices. A country, like Sri Lanka, desperate to develop tourism and attract foreign direct investment must strive to improve its global safety rankings.",
    "The irony of the UAE\u2019s climb to the top of the Numbeo Safety Index (Mid-Year) and Sri Lanka\u2019s slide, albeit marginal, may not have been lost on those who are concerned about the rise in underworld activities here. Most of the crime syndicates responsible for violent incidents in this country are led by wealthy Sri Lankan criminals operating from Dubai, where they have fled and taken up residence. Only the Sri Lankan crime bosses who happen to be on the wrong side of the law are arrested in Dubai and sent back; others are living in clover there. With such dangerous elements on its soil, how come the UAE has been ranked the safest country in the world? A plausible explanation may be that the Sri Lankan criminals and their foreign counterparts behave in Dubai for fear of being arrested and bundled off to their home countries.",
    "One can only hope that the UAE will use its advanced security infrastructure and highly trained police personnel to arrest the foreign criminals residing in places like Dubai and extradite them, thereby helping make other countries, like Sri Lanka, safe.",
