### Pakistan military court jails 25 over 2023 attacks

*2024-12-21 14:13:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104396/pakistan-military-court-jails-25-over-2023-attacks) ¬∑ `en`

Twenty-five civilians were sentenced by a Pakistani military court to periods of two to 10 years of ‚Äúrigorous imprisonment‚Äù in connection with attacks on military facilities in 2023, the armed forces‚Äô media wing said on Saturday.

The ruling underscores concerns among supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan that military courts are going to play a bigger role in cases involving the 72-year-old, who is facing multiple charges including allegedly inciting attacks against the armed forces.

Thousands of Khan supporters stormed military installations and torched a general‚Äôs house on May 9, 2023 to protest against the former premier‚Äôs arrest by paramilitary soldiers. At least eight people were killed in the violence.

The military‚Äôs Inter-Services Public Relations office said the sentences handed down on Saturday were an ‚Äúimportant milestone in dispensation of justice to the nation‚Äù.

The Sri Lankan cricket team departed for New Zealand last night (20) to compete in a three-match T20 and ODI series.

Speaking to the media before leaving the island, Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka addressed the decision to omit young spinner Dunith Wellalage from the squad, citing the need for an additional fast bowler to adapt to New Zealand‚Äôs pitch conditions.

Explaining the rationale behind the selection, Asalanka said, ‚ÄúDunith was dropped because we wanted to include an extra fast bowler for the conditions in New Zealand. It was a very tough decision for me, the selection committee, and the coach. Sometimes, such calls have to be made when playing on pitches like those in New Zealand.‚Äù

Asalanka also commented on the team‚Äôs preparation and morale ahead of the challenging tour. ‚ÄúThe players are in good spirits. Their performances in the recent T10 series were commendable, with players contributing through runs and wickets. This has been good preparation for the team,‚Äù he said.

### Two dead, dozens injured in car attack on German Christmas market

Two people have been killed, including a child, and dozens injured after a car drove into a crowd at a Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, officials say.

In a statement, authorities said 68 people had been injured, 15 of whom seriously.

Reiner Haseloff, the premier of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, told reporters at the scene that the suspect - who has been arrested - was a 50-year-old Saudi citizen who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had worked as a doctor.

He said a preliminary investigation suggested the alleged attack was acting as a lone wolf and that he could not rule out further deaths due to the number of injured.

The suspected attacker‚Äôs motive is unclear, and he has no known links to Islamist extremism.

Footage from the scene shows numerous emergency services vehicles attending while people lay on the ground.

Unverified video on social media purports to show a car ploughing into the crowd at the market.

### Fitch upgrades Sri Lanka to ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô

*2024-12-21 08:26:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104387/fitch-upgrades-sri-lanka-to-ccc) ¬∑ `en`

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lanka‚Äôs Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô from ‚ÄòRD‚Äô (Restricted Default), citing the completion of the international sovereign bond restructuring and an improved outlook for macroeconomic indicators.

Fitch typically does not assign an Outlook to sovereigns with a rating of ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô or below.

Fitch has also upgraded the Local-Currency IDR to ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô, from ‚ÄòCCC-‚Äô, to align with the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, as the risk of another default on local-currency debt has been reduced by the completion of the international sovereign bond restructuring and an improved outlook for macroeconomic indicators.

Sri Lanka completed the local-currency portion of its domestic debt optimisation in September 2023, following the exchange of treasury bills and provisional advances held by Central Bank of Sri Lanka‚Äôs into new treasury bonds and bills.

The Meteorology Department says several spells of showers will occur in Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in Eastern, Central and Uva provinces and in Hambantota and Polonnaruwa districts during the evening or night.

Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva and Eastern provinces during the morning, the Met. Department added.

Thus, the general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.

### Fitch upgrades Sri Lanka out of default despite holdout Hamilton Reserve

*2024-12-21 07:57:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/fitch-upgrades-sri-lanka-out-of-default-despite-holdout-hamilton-reserve-195663/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT- Fitch Ratings said it was upgrading Sri Lanka‚Äôs foreign currency rating out of restricted default (RD) status, to CCC+ after 98 percent of bondholders accepted an offer to restructure defaulted bonds with new securities issued on December 20.

‚ÄúThe upgrade of the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR (issuer default rating) reflects Fitch‚Äôs assessment that Sri Lanka has normalised relations with a majority of creditors, after the announcement of final results of the invitation to exchange the outstanding stock of international sovereign bonds‚Ä¶‚Äù the rating agency said.

‚ÄúOne bond series with non-aggregated collective action clauses did not meet the required 75 percent level.

‚ÄúWithout this bond series, the acceptance results imply a restructuring of 96% of total commercial external debt.‚Äù

The series that did not meet the threshold was a 2022 bond where Hamilton Reserve, a holdout investors hold about 25 percent of the outstanding.

Sri Lankan Pres. Dissanayake's India visit focuses on economic aid, trade cooperation, security assurances, BRICS membership, Tamil rights, and fisheries disputes. Key: no use of Sri Lankan land against India, support for Tamil aspirations, and resolving fishermen conflicts.

üü©

There were two reasons why President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India and his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gained much importance in the media.

The first is the leader of a party that was one of his major policies of Indian opposition. They had long traveled with that policy. It is through it that the party strengthened.

The second, his JVP. Was identified as a Chinese pro organization. The reflection of the Chinese Tutu in Colombo on the victory of the National People's Power in the general election also strengthened this view.

During his visit to New Delhi, President Dissanayake revealed the most relaxed diplomacy in the wake of the intensification of Sri Lanka -based Chinese -Indian power competition.

The attitude of Dissanayake was seen as the one who accepted the importance of India in the South Asian region. That is, the history of the JVP in the past has been confirmed during this visit that the President is changing the severe course of India.

Social aspects of dementia are becoming increasingly important as part of a wider shift in emphasis from cure to care

Dementia indeed is a very sad disease where the personality, habits and the routine of a loved one could drastically change, and family members would find it extremely stressful to recognise and deal with this ‚Äúnew person‚Äù who has evolved from the one they once knew. Dementia persons are by and large helpless and need care for even the most mundane tasks. In increasingly changing extended family life situations where home care for dementia patients has, and is becoming a major challenge, anecdotal evidence relating to how even dementia afflicted parents have been driven away from their homes or kept locked in rooms, are abound

To achieve lasting growth and better manage its debt, the country must implement critical structural reforms

With a new Government in power, Sri Lanka finds itself grappling with immense economic challenges. The burden of enormous debts continues to weigh heavily on a fragile economy, necessitating robust growth to overcome these hardships. However, achieving such growth is complicated by a governmental predisposition toward centralised economic control, rooted in socialist-communal ideologies.

These challenges are not unique to Sri Lanka; they echo the historical pitfalls of centralised economic systems. This essay explores three illustrative examples from history: The failed socialism of the Plymouth Colony, the rapid recovery during the Forgotten Depression of 1920-1921, and the transformative innovation of the Gilded Age.
