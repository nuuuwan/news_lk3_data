    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s new government is compelled to continue the same fuel price formula implemented under the previous government, Cabinet Spokesman Vijitha Herath said, backtracking from the earlier stance.",
    "When the fuel prices were reduced last month, Herath said the fuel price formula was not used to compile the prices.",
    "\u201cWe are compelled to go with the price formula due to previous agreements,\u201d Hearth told the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing in Colombo on Wednesday.",
    "President Anura Dissanayake and his Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) members before the September 21 election, accusing the previous government, said people have been paying higher price for fuel because of exorbitant taxes and some commissions for politicians.",
    "Some JVP members said the price of fuel could be reduced by as much as one-third of the current price.",
    "However, after coming to power, the Dissanayake government was able to reduce the widely used petrol price by 6.4 percent and diesel price by 7.8 percent in October. The government kept the prices unchanged for October.",
    "When state-run fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairman D J A S De S Rajakaruna when asked by the media about the commission said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I will have to find out. However, we will have to probe the higher premium we saw soon after the economic crisis.\u201d",
    "Analysts say people are not worried about the implementation of the new government\u2019s election promises yet and ready to give more time after the November 14 parliamentary polls. (Colombo/November 07/2024)"
