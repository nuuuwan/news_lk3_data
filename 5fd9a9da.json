  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u201cThis whole inward looking, statist, socialist ideology has existed ever since the assassination of President Premadasa. In 1994, the Chandrika-JVP alliance started doling out jobs, starting more loss-making state-owned enterprises, cutting taxes, giving tax breaks, not focusing on exports, taking money from all kinds of people and building useless infrastructure projects, getting further and further into debt\u2026From 1994 onwards there was a change in ideology\u2026\u201d",
    "As a political scientist I regard the evolution, transformation and development of the JVP, which includes the growth of its broad Movement the NPP, as a tribute to the capacity of Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic system. In this unprecedented crisis, our long-standing democratic system has processed and produced a new national option: a pluralist, democratic Left alternative which has the potential to fill the vacant social democratic space. It must be welcomed, encouraged and critically supported.",
    "However, the Establishment, the collective Right\u2014UNP, SLPP, SJB\u2014is reacting hysterically.",
    "The JVP-NPP\u2019s view \u201cis backward extreme Communism!\u201d an SJB lawyer and former UNP Deputy Minister aggressively, repeatedly admonishes a young NPP spokesperson on a TV panel discussion. \u201cHow can the same JVP which destroyed infrastructure in 1988-89, develop the economy today?\u201d shrieks a senior SJB politician.",
    "How can the UNP (including loyal UNPers until 3 years ago) which permitted and participated in Black July 1983, banned the JVP, and caused two civil wars thereby wrecking the economy, develop the economy today?",
    "Why did President Premadasa publicly offer Rohana Wijeweera\u2019s JVP three Cabinet portfolios precisely in 1989?\u00a0 If the JVP leadership had the Realism and political maturity to accept, they would\u2019ve been in Premadasa\u2019s Cabinet, however \u201cextreme Communist\u201d their views and violently destructive their practice until then.",
    "Ideology is being reinjected into economics, pumping toxicity into the realm of policy, not by the leftwing JVP-NPP but rather by Dr. Harsha de Silva, recently proclaimed by the Opposition Leader as the one who will present the Budget next year. On December 21st 2023, Harsha declared on X:",
    "\u201cCountless inquiries about our vision for Sri Lanka with SJB, and here\u2019s the answer. Our roadmap for a future government is geared towards reviving Sri Lanka\u2019s economic engine and igniting essential growth for Lanka\u201d.",
    "Harsha does NOT say \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 or \u2018growth with equity\u2019, but merely \u2018growth\u2019, which puts him way behind the global consensus in economics from the White House to the family of UN agencies.",
    "Harsha\u2019s X contains a video clip from a recent TV interview which summarizes his ideas. Here are highlights:",
    "\u201c\u2026The socialist agenda has ruined this country\u2026We have gotten used to handouts by the state. That has to change\u2026If the people see that the government has an ideology and a team that can work with the rest of the world\u2026It has to take its course. We have to go through some hard times ahead\u2026We have written a Blueprint-1, we have updated to Blueprint-2 and I have written, we are working on and will release Blueprint-3 by February-March.\u201d",
    "Face to Face | Alternative to these taxes | Dr. Harsha De Silva | 19th December 2023 (youtube.com)",
    "The economy was ruined during the Gotabaya presidency, but where does \u2018the socialist agenda\u2019 come in? With his (Reaganite) Arthur Laffer \u2018supply-side\u2019 tax-cuts, Gotabaya\u2019s policy wasn\u2019t driven by any kind of socialist agenda.",
    "For Harsha, \u201cthe socialist agenda\u201d which \u201chas ruined this country\u201d is synonymous with \u201chandouts by the state\u201d which \u201cwe have gotten used to\u201d. He should pause to ponder on who introduced \u2018free rice\u2019. It was that notorious adherent of the \u2018socialist agenda\u2019, Prime Minister DS Senanayake.",
    "Harsha doesn\u2019t prioritise policy. In his video clip he says: \u201cIf the people see that the government has an ideology and a team that can work with the rest of the world\u2026\u201d. He prioritises \u2018ideology\u2019 and a \u2018team\u2019. The virtue of his team is that it \u201ccan work with the rest of the world\u201d. What he means by \u201cwork with the rest of the world\u201d was evident when the team he belonged to halted the Port City project in 2015, disconnected our growth engine (Chinese projects), racked up unpayable bills, and finally ceded China a larger footprint for a longer time in Hambantota than Mahinda did.",
    "Our most successful Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel did not share the ideology of the UNP he joined in 1977. He shared its policy, having co-designed it with JR Jayewardene. Our most successful developmental president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, a populist, did not share the ideology of JR Jayewardene, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake.",
    "In an interview in our sister-paper Harsha makes it clear that the main culprit who implemented a \u2018socialist agenda\u2019 was not Gotabaya or even Dr. N.M. Perera.",
    "Most rightwing critics target Dr. N.M. Perera, but while his ideology was socialist, his economic policy wasn\u2019t. It was a state capitalist, import-substitution industrialisation (ISI) model which was the norm among decidedly non-socialist regimes in the Third World in those decades.",
    "As Prof. Rohan Samarajiva who was a member of the Communist Party\u2019s student wing at the time would confirm, young Communists launched a countrywide poster campaign attacking NM for rushing to the IMF and World Bank almost as he was appointed but omitting to visit socialist states to secure economic support. He avoided it for years. NM was also the author of the White Paper on Foreign Investment in 1972, while his successor Felix Dias Bandaranaike presented the Foreign Investment Guarantee Law in 1975.",
    "Ceylon\u2019s \u2018father of Marxism\u2019 Phillip Gunawardena, appointed Dudley Senanayake\u2019s Minister of Industries (1965-1970) sought and obtained more support for industrialisation from the socialist bloc than did NM.",
    "NM wasn\u2019t responsible for today\u2019s calamity because the country had switched to an Open Economy in 1977.",
    "Who then is the archvillain whose adherence to \u201csocialist ideology\u201d \u201cruined this country\u201d? Here\u2019s Harsha\u2019s Holmesian unearthing:",
    "\u201cThis whole inward looking, statist, socialist ideology has existed ever since the assassination of President Premadasa. In 1994, the Chandrika-JVP alliance started doling out jobs, starting more loss-making state-owned enterprises, cutting taxes, giving tax breaks, not focusing on exports, taking money from all kinds of people and building useless infrastructure projects, getting further and further into debt.",
    "But our competitors at the time, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia continued the momentum Mr. Premadasa had. Mr. Wickremesinghe was his industries minister. This momentum came from Mr. Jayewardene\u2019s ideological shift that we have to look outwards and create efficiencies in the market, give the private sector the space to play and an outward looking private enterprise driven economy.",
    "From 1994 onwards there was a change in ideology. From 2004 onwards it got worse\u2026Mr. Premadasa believed in exports. But that was forgotten with the introduction of an inward-looking, statist, populist, unsustainable, socialist policy.\u201d",
    "You couldn\u2019t get clearer \u2013 and crasser--than that. Harsha alleges the \u201cinward-looking, statist, socialist\u201d agenda was introduced by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 1994 in alliance with the JVP (\u201cin 1994 the Chandrika-JVP alliance\u2026\u201d). However, the Provisional Government in which the JVP shared power, held portfolios and had a voice in policy was formed only in 2004, not 1994, and lasted a mere 8 months.",
    "The country\u2019s deviation and deterioration had two marker years according to Harsha: 1994 and 2004. In both cases it was CBK who was President. MR was elected only in December 2005.",
    "This is dangerous \u201cBS\u201d --to use one of Harsha\u2019s favourite concepts. Let alone his imaginary socialism, it was Chandrika who broke the SLFP away from her mother\u2019s \u2018self-sufficient\u2019/ \u2018closed economy\u2019 model and attendant \u2018economics of scarcity\u2019 which had kept the SLFP unelectable for 17 years.",
    "Ideologically, CBK espoused Anthony Giddens\u2019 Third Way, as did Tony Blair and New Labour, rupturing with any residues of a \u2018socialist agenda\u2019. Economically, she embraced renowned economist Richard Jolly\u2019s concept of \u2018capitalism with a human face\u2019, Lankanised as the \u2018Open Economy with a human face\u2019. CBK\u2019s Economic Council was led by Dr. Lal Jayawardena, later head of the UN\u2019s World Institute for Development Economic Research (WIDER) in Helsinki. AS Jayawardena, civil servant and economist with postgraduate degrees from the LSE and Harvard, headed the Central Bank. He was incomparably superior to Ranil\u2019s choice and Harsha\u2019s economic teammate (whom he has yet to criticise), Arjuna Mahendran.",
    "Harsha accuses the post-Premadasa, post-UNP administration of 1994 of being \u201cinward-looking, statist, populist, unsustainable, socialist\u201d unlike Premadasa. He exhibits ignorance. Presented with numbers proving the state-owned hill-country plantations were a drain on the state\u2019s coffers, and urged by Paskaralingam and the corporate sector to privatise them, Premadasa characteristically countered with a progressive-centrist alternative. He granted management contracts, NOT ownership, to private companies for just 5 years (renewable); rejected foreign private companies as solution; and stipulated that only local private companies could bid even for management contracts.",
    "\u2018Statist, inward-looking, socialist\u2019 CBK killed-off the Land Reform of 1975 (Round 1 was 1972) by her mother, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. CBK dismantled Premadasa\u2019s \u201cwalls\u201d and threw open the tea estates for private ownership including by foreign (mostly Indian) companies.",
    "Chandrika\u2019s presidency (and Minister Mangala Samaraweera, a Chandrika stalwart) successfully de-regulated the Telecommunications sector.",
    "Liberal Party leader Dr. Chanaka Amaratunga charged that 60% of the economy remained in state hands under JR Jayewardene. The Accelerated Mahaweli project was state-led. Chandrika\u2019s economic policy regime was well to the right of the patriotic-populist Premadasa. If Harsha de Silva thinks CBK\u2019s 1994 administration was \u201cinward-looking, statist, populist, socialist\u201d, he is the most extreme right-wing economist we\u2019ve had in post-Independence Lankan politics.",
    "\u201cFor the last 30 years these introvert, inward-looking, statist, socialist, populist, give-people-no-tax kind of convoluted ideology made Sri Lanka the sick man of Asia\u2026!\u201d (ibid)",
    "For \u201cthe last 30 years\u201d we were led by Presidents Wijetunga, Chandrika, Mahinda, Sirisena and Gotabaya. Gota was an ultranationalist, Islamophobic, Trumpian crackpot who was evicted by the people in 2 years. For the other 28 years, it was DBW, CBK, MR and MS who presided. Did they all follow an \u201cintrovert, inward-looking, statist, socialist, populist, give-people-no-tax kind of convoluted ideology\u201d?",
    "None of these 4 post-Premadasa, pre-Gotabaya Presidents contributed to the current economic collapse with the debt crisis as driver, as did Ranil\u2019s UNP administration 2015-2019 with its huge borrowings from the private international money-markets, the settlement of which will burden us impossibly from mid-2024. Harsha was on that \u2018team\u2019 and defends the ISB surge.",
    "Of these \u201clast 30 years\u201d, there were two significant stretches during which the economy was run by the UNP led by Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister: 2001-2004 and 2015-2019. Why was Ranil tossed out twice, by elected Presidents of those periods a decade apart, and more pertinently, why did he lose every election he faced immediately after he was tossed out? The citizens rejected his economics. Ranilnomics--neoliberal globalisation--drastically shrank the UNP\u2019s and the (co-habiting) SLFP\u2019s social bases.",
    "Harsha has a pathological hatred of \u201csocialists/socialism\u201d. Meditating on the following questions may prove therapeutic:",
    "Why did JR Jayewardene pick left-leaning Ronnie de Mel as Minister of Finance in 1977, over economic right-wingers, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake?",
    "Why was President Jayewardene\u2019s 1978 Convocation address to the University of Colombo on the thematic subject \u2018Democratic socialism\u2019?",
    "Why did President Jayewardene re-title the Republic of Sri Lanka, the Democratic Socialist Republic?",
    "Why did R. Premadasa as an Opposition MP, move an amendment to the Land Reform of 1972, urging that the land ceiling be reduced to 5 acres?",
    "Why did he proudly recall it while launching the Presidential Task Force on Land Redistribution in 1989, dedicated to the goal of redistributing state land strictly to the landless (NOT private business) for the purposes of agriculture and/or housebuilding?",
    "Why did Premadasa\u2019s April 4th 1973 speech to the Rotary Club of Colombo West, state as the desirable goal \u201cSocialism without ulterior motivations and external interferences\u201d?",
    "Why was it republished in the Daily News in 1991 when he was SAARC chairperson with the references to \u201cSocialism\u201d retained?",
    "Why did Prime Minister Premadasa author (1987) a laudatory Introduction to leftist Janadasa Pieris\u2019 Sinhala translation of Gorbachev\u2019s Perestroika, a book devoted to \u2018reformed, renovated, democratic Socialism\u2019?",
    "Why weren\u2019t accusations of \u2018extreme socialism\u2019, \u2018extreme Communism\u2019 ever hurled by President Premadasa at Wijeweera\u2019s JVP during the bitter civil war?",
    "Why was the key speaker at every opening of President Premadasa\u2019s 200 Garment factories program, not Industries Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe but Ossie Abeygoonesekara, leader of the socialist SLMP and Presidential candidate of the United Socialist Alliance?",
    "Why did the architect of the Open Economy of 1977, Ronnie de Mel, in conversation on his 91st birthday, urge Sajith Premadasa (accompanied by Harsha) to revive the Open Economy by \u201cinfusing it with a strong dose of socialist values as befits our country\u2019s multireligious egalitarian ethos\u201d?",
    "Completely contrary to President Premadasa\u2019s famous 3 Cs formula, \u2018Consultation-Compromise-Consensus\u2019, Harsha advocates political alignments on the basis of \u201cbelieving\u201d in the SJB\u2019s \u201ceconomic ideology\u201d:",
    "\u201c\u2026What is important is the ideology. Not only RW, if they are not crooks, racists and if they believe in our economic ideology we will join with all good people in Parliament.\u201d (ibid)",
    "\u201cNot crooks\u201d? Harsha\u2019s generous exemption despite the Central Bank bond scam, is rich (pun intended). He is happy to \u201cjoin with\u201d Ranil on the basis of shared \u201cbelief\u201d in economic ideology. All you need is to believe in \u201cour\u201d --meaning his, Harsha\u2019s-- economic ideology (him being chief author of the SJB\u2019s \u2018Blueprints\u2019).",
    "\u201cI have taken a massive responsibility in getting this country out of this mess. I have analytically been able to bring both the government and opposition together to do tough reforms. It\u2019s easy to oppose everything, but I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m doing politics to not just be a minister. I want to fix this nation.\u201d (Ibid)",
    "With his \u2018economic ideology\u2019, if Dr. Harsha de Silva gets to be Economic tzar, this nation will be in a fix for sure.",
    "Sajith\u2019s father instructed that before he left for the LSE, he should call on Godfrey Gunatilleke, Sri Lanka\u2019s finest development thinker. Similarly, Sajith should instruct his Economic Council to diligently study:",
    "\u2018Towards a Sri Lankan Model of Development\u2019, writings (1975-2015) by Godfrey Gunatilleke; especially Part 5, \u2018A Vision for Sri Lanka 2025 & 2035: Sri Lanka\u2019s Transition from High Human Development to Very High Human Development\u2019. (https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/catalog/7499708)",
    "Prime Minister Premadasa produced his winning 1988 presidential election policy platform in 8 rounds of drafting in adjacent suites in a Hong Kong hotel on his way back from Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China. He first visited Soviet Russia and Mao\u2019s China in 1957 and published a booklet.",
    "Premadasa\u2019s co-author for the 1988 policy platform was Oxford-educated civil servant Susil Sirivardhana, attendee at Kissinger\u2019s Harvard seminar, policy intellectual of radical socialist (Maoist-Fanonist) convictions, former 1971 revolutionary, and ex-political prisoner.",
    "For Premadasa, any notion of Lalith Athulathmudali and/or Gamini Dissanayake, right-wingers from Jayawardene\u2019s 1977 UNP \u2018team\u2019 authoring/co-authoring his presidential policy manifesto would have been abhorrent; unthinkable."
