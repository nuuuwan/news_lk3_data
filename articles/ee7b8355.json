    "Police said dairy farmers raising cows all over the country had complained that their cows were being stolen by cattle thieves on various occasions.",
    "They said that various requests were also received from government officials in relevant fields in this regard. Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon, after examining relevant statistics and discussing with senior police officers, including those from the Civil Defense Security Department, had conducted an investigation into this matter.",
    "Analysis revealed that the North-Central Province is the hotspot for cattle thefts, although incidents have also been observed in the North-Western and Southern Provinces. Between January 1, 2023 and January 24, 2024, a total of 575 cows were reported stolen, with 336 thefts recorded in the North-Central Province alone. The total value of the stolen cattle exceeded Rs. 105 million, based on complainants' assessments.",
