    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s health authorities say compared to 2021, there was a 48 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV in this country in 2022.",
    "\u201cThere have been reports of HIV infection among young people between the ages of 15-24. Last year (2022), 73 of the 607 HIV infected people detected were in the 15-24 years age group,\u201d venereologist Dr Thilani Ratnayake said.",
    "As there was still no vaccine or medicine developed to cure an HIV infection, early detection and treatment of the condition was key to live normally, Dr Ratnayake said at an awareness event to mark World AIDS Day on December 1.",
    "\u201cWe have introduced self-test kits which allow those who are concerned they might be infected to do their own HIV test. Like the Covid test, this is an oral swab test. You will know the results within minutes.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese self-test kits are now available through our clinics, and we provide a home delivery facility.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn addition to this, there\u2019s a web-based app, called Know4sure, which provides HIV information, an assessment tool to determine whether one is at risk, reservation of a clinic appointment, and the facility of ordering a self-test kit.\u201d",
    "Once detection is made, the next step is to prevent spreading. Dr Ratnayake said the 41 state-run STD clinics in the country all provide free condoms, at a considerable cost to government.",
    "\u201cBy not detecting HIV early, one has to face becoming sick without knowing it, as well as infecting someone else.\u201d",
    "As with most diseases, early detection is key to successful treatment.",
    "\u201cTreatment methods have been introduced to live a normal life with the disease under control. An HIV preventive treatment called PrEP is now available under medical supervision. You can get this treatment from STD clinics all over the island. This is a very effective method for those at high risk of HIV.\u201d",
    "When the virus level is reduced by treatment, the possibility of it being transmitted to another person is also reduced, Dr Ratnayake pointed out.",
    "A preventive treatment method is also available. This should be administered within 72 hours.",
    "World AIDS Day is observed to remember those who lived with and died due to the HIV virus, to prevent marginalization of those infected, and to spread awareness about the disease.",
    "This year\u2019s theme is \u201cEmpower the community and prevent AIDS\u201d.",
    "\u201cNo one should face HIV alone. Building strong support networks within communities is a beacon of hope. Let\u2019s foster empathy, understanding, and inclusivity to dismantle the isolation that often accompanies an HIV diagnosis.\u201d health minister Ramesh Pathirana said on X (twitter). (Colombo/Dec1/2023)"
