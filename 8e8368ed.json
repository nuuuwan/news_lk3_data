  "original_title": "How I was Arrested by the CID and Detained  on  the 4th Floor.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Thirty-six years ago in  October 1987, I was arrested  by the Sri Lankan Police and detained at the Crminal Investigation Department(CID) Office on the fourth floor of the Police secretariat in Fort, Colombo. I was then working as a journalist for \u201cThe Island\u201d in Colombo. I  was also the Sri Lanka Correspondent of the Indian English daily \u201cThe Hindu\u201d and newsmagazine \u201cFrontline\u201d. The United National Party (UNP) Government headed by President Junius Richard (JR)  Jayewardene was in power then.",
    "President Jayewardene and the then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had signed  an agreement  on 29 July 1987. This historic agreement referred to as the Indo-Lanka Accord   temporarily ended the conflict between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Tamil militant organizations  including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE).  An Indian  Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was  stationed in the Northern and Eastern provinces of the Island",
    "Fighting  broke out between the IPKF and LTTE  on  10 October 1987. I was in Jaffna at that time and witnessed first hand the eruption of war. I returned to Colombo on 21 October and wrote   articles and news stories in detail about what was happening in Jaffna for the \u201cSunday Island\u201d of 25 October 1987. An exclusive interview with the then LTTE deputy -leader Gopalaswamy Mahendrarajah alias \u201cMahathaya\u201d was also published. My writings about prevailing realities in Jaffna contradicted  the \u201cofficial version\u201d then being trotted out by the powers that be about the war against the LTTE.",
    "I was arrested by the Police on Monday 26 October and detained at the  then CID Headquarters on the 4th floor of the Police Secretariat in Colombo 1. Recently a post-graduate student, interviewed me about the circumstances of my arrest and detention for her PhD thesis on media suppression in Sri Lanka. I had written about my arrest related  matters  in detail , 26 years ago for \u201cThe Island\u201dnewspaper and had to wander down memory lane again. It is against this backdrop that I re-visit my arrest and detention in  Oct 1987 with the aid of earlier writings in this article. It is a first-person account of my experiences.",
    "The \u201cSunday Island\u201d edition of October 25th 1987 was virtually a Jaffna special focussing on the Indian army campaign against the Tigers in the north. The lead story was an on the spot account written in detail by me. There were also two articles. One was the extensive interview conducted with Mahaththaya the LTTE deputy leader. The second was the first instalment of an in depth series on the Jaffna war titled \u201cJaffna in flames\u201d. Both were my pieces. In addition there were many photographs in colour and in black and white of the action in Jaffna brought by me. There was also a letter outlining in detail the problems faced by the people of Jaffna in the wake of the Indian army campaign. This letter  was signed by 14 top Govt officials in Jaffna. I had  obtained a copy from the then Jaffna GA M.Panchalingam. All these were exclusives for The Island. The paper was in great demand  and by Sunday afternoon was sold out in Colombo and the suburbs.",
    "On Sunday evening an Indian Journalist friend Mazumdar , the All India Radio(AIR)  correspondent in Colombo telephoned me. He warned me that the Indian High Commission people were agitated and angry about me. \u201cThey are fuming and may try to fix you\u201d he said.",
    "On the following day my Sri Lankan journalist friend Rita Sebastian writing for the \u201cIndian Express\u201d paper also called me. Mentioning some Indian Diplomats by name this colleague said \u201cthey are ranting and raving at you.\u201d",
    "Rita also said that the Indian High Commission had suspended it\u2019s usual evening press conference on the war dubbed by Journalists as the Four PM Folly. These  press conferences had been painting glowing pictures about the situation in Jaffna. The Island reports   by me had exposed the real situation and the regular Indian  press conference had lost  credibility.",
    "The Indian diplomats also feared a barrage of questions by the International media based on my news  reports. Already the International media was quoting \u201cThe Island\u201d on the Issue. Also some Western journalists like John Rettie of the BBC  and Barbara Crossette of \u201cNew York Times\u201d had quoted me in their despatches.",
    "Veteran journalist  Mervyn de Silva  who had  good contacts at the Indian High Commission invited me for lunch on that Monday the 26th. After congratulating me on the Journalistic scoops, he too advised me to be careful. Mervyn said something like this \u201d Ever since this war began we have been regaled with sunshine stories about Jaffna from the Indian side. They made us believe that hundreds of Tigers were being killed in Jaffna and that civilians were not being harmed at all. Now the true picture has emerged. So you had better watch your back. If I were you I\u2019ll try and make peace with Mani, Hardeep and Lakshmi.\u201d Mani, Hardeep and Lakshmi refer to the then  Indian High Commissioner Jyotindra Nath Dixit, Political secretary Hardeep Singh Puri and Information Secy Lakshmi Puri respectively.",
    "When I returned to the Island editorial one of the messages waiting for me was from   a \u201c Mr. Perera.\u201d Apparently he wanted to meet me on an urgent matter. I tried calling the Indian diplomats but I could not get through to them.. A little later Mazumdar of AIR  called me again  and said \u201cMani(Dixit) contacted the old boy(JRJ) on your matter last night(Sunday). There may be fireworks\u201d.",
    "Any possible qualms that I may have had began evaporating as colleagues at The Island and Divaina continued to be hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise for my journalistic scoops. I enjoyed that.There were  also numerous congratulatory telephone calls from both friends and unknown readers. Many foreign correspondents were phoning and asking for appointments. Some overseas media organizations  were  interviewing  me by telephone.  My feel good factor was at its highest and I was really on top of my small world.",
    "I was at my desk writing out   an interview with the EROS leader Balakumaran that I had obtained in Jaffna when the security people at the guardroom rang and said that a Mr. Perera was waiting at the gate. I asked them to send him to reception but was told that he did not want to come in. So I went to the gate.",
    "The youngish looking \u201cPerera\u201dspoke softly in Sinhala and whispered \u2018We are from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) Our central committee member is in the car. Can you please interview him? . The JVP was then a proscribed organization fighting an anti-Indian war of its own by killing Sinhala persons in the south.",
    "Suspecting a hoax I said \u201cWhy are you asking me a Tamil journalist who is  not very fluent in Sinhala? He replied \u201cAt this point of time we cannot trust a Sinhala journalist. We need a Tamil Journalist. We saw your interview with Mahaththaya and thought you will be appropriate. Our central committee member knows English well and you can talk to him\u201d",
    "I then said that I must consult my editor  Gamini Weerakoon and get his go ahead. \u201cPerera\u201d replied, \u201d Meet our central committee man first. If you are satisfied then tell the editor. Also it may be difficult to arrange for another time. If you want an interview take it now. Later even if your editor refuses to carry the Interview we will understand \u201c. It had also started drizzling.",
    "There is a Christian Hymn which begins \u201cOnce to every man and nation comes the moment to decide\u201d. This was my moment of decision. I decided to go for it.  I said \u201cYes but can you arrange an Interview with Rohana Wijeweera (JVP leader) or Upatissa Gamanayake(JVP secy)? The journalistic impulse that governed most of my actions felt that an interview with one of them would be another scoop. Again the reply was talk to our central committee member and he will arrange it.",
    "The ongoing drizzle was now increasing in volume. \u201cPerera \u201dsaid \u201cThere is going to be a shower. Why not get into our car and talk? I nodded and we ran across to the two door orange Volkeswagon parked opposite the eating house  known as \u201cKaputa kade\u201d . I was asked to get into the back seat. After getting in and  sitting, I realised that I could not get out of the car even if I wanted to. I was slightly uneasy but not very much.",
    "I was introduced to the Central committee member  who called himself \u201cKeerthi sahodaraya\u201d(comrade Keerthi) to whom I put forward my request about an interview with the JVP leaders. He said I may be able to get Comrade  Rohana  for you. But you have to come with me now to a place in Fort from where I will phone someone. If you are lucky you may be able to get the Interview tonight itself\u201d.It seemed to be a now or never situation. It was risky. My adventurous spirit impelled me onwards, YES I said. So I left with them instead of going back to the Editorial and informing the editor or somebody else. In retrospect a big mistake.",
    "In the car I began chatting to the so-called JVPers. I began to feel that something was not quite right. They seemed more like Police or security personnel. Suddenly a frightening  thought struck me. The death squad phenomenon was beginning to rear its ugly head then. Was I  a target because of my reporting ?  Am I going to be bumped off?",
    "Nobody knew where I was  or with whom I was going. I was worried now but nothing was to be done. As the  car circled around Fort I said in Sinhala \u201c You all are not JVP You all are Policemen.\u201d The three men laughed  but said nothing. The car turned into Police headquarters premises. I was taken into the CID directors office.",
    "Strange as it may seem, I heaved a sigh of relief. I now felt that I was not being subject to any unofficial activity.  I was not going to be a victim of an \u201cunofficial\u201d execution. Whatever happened ,unpleasant as it may be,  was going to be official.",
    "The CID director then was DIG Bennet Perera. He  read out sections from the Prevention of Terrorism Act(PTA) and the Emergency regulations.He said that  I had met with Mahaththaya a terrorist leader and had not informed the Police. This was a violation of the PTA he said.",
    "I replied that I had in 1984 and 1985 met several Tamil armed group leaders in Madras and Interviewed them.Before undertaking that  venture I had consulted former National Security minister Lalith Athulathmudali who assured me that the relevant PTA provisions would not apply to Journalists.Likewise no action of that type was taken when some of the interviews appeared in the Island.",
    "I also said that I was the first Sri Lankan Journalist to interview the Tamil group leaders. Subsequently other reporters too had done so. No action had been taken against them too. So why was I being singled out now ?I queried. In any event why not the CID chief clarify the issue from Lalith Athulathmudali himself? I was told that Lalith was convalescing after the Parliament Bomb attack and could not be reached.",
    "I then pointed out that politicians like Vijaya Kumaratunga and  UNP Yatiyantota MP Vincent Perera had gone to Jaffna and met the LTTE Jaffna commander Krishnakumar alias Kittu. They were not penalised in anyway, I pointed out. Thereafter I  said that as far as I was concerned I had nothing to hide and that I had written about my meeting Mahaththaya publicly. I was also continuing my writing on the Jaffna trip   and more details would be revealed in due course. All what happened would be disclosed openly.  There was nothing illegal or underhand  in what I was writing I emphasised.",
    "I was then shown a letter purportedly written by then Defence Secretary Gen. Sepala Attygalle. The letter referred to my interview with Mahathaya and said that some details about the murder of the Rupavahini crew by the LTTE could be obtained from me. Four  Sinhala employees of Rupavahini TV had been murdered by the LTTE in Jaffna. Attygalle\u2019s  letter instructed  the Police to question me further on this matter.",
    "What happened thereafter will be related in the second part of this article.",
