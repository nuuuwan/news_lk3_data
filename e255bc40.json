  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cop28 global climate summit has reached a historic deal hailed by the United Nations as \u201cthe beginning of the end for the fossil fuel era\u201d.",
    "After more than 24 hours of fraught negotiations, an agreement was made to start transitioning away from all oil, coal and gas this decade, with a view to reaching net zero by 2050. The world currently is far off course from this target.",
    "The pledge, signed by 200 countries in the final conference session on Wednesday morning in Dubai, also recognised the \u201cneed for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions\u201d.",
    "As the UAE\u2019s Cop28 president Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber banged the gavel to signal agreement, delegates from around the world rose to their feet, clapping and hugging each other. But there was dissent from a number of countries, including the small island nations who condemned the final text as a \u201clitany of loopholes\u201d.",
    "Phasing down coal usage and limiting the number of new and unabated coal power stations",
    "Transitioning away from fossil fuels in a \u201cjust, orderly and equitable manner\u201d to achieve net zero by 2050",
    "Describing the deal as the \u201cUAE Consensus\u201d, the Cop president said it was a plan \u201cled by the science\u201d with commitments to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
    "\u201cWe have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement for the first time ever,\u201d added Mr Jaber, who is chief executive of the UAE\u2019s state oil company.",
    "The UN welcomed the move, with its climate secretary Simon Stiell saying Cop28 had needed to send a signal on humanity\u2019s core climate problem: \u201cfossil fuels and their planet-burning pollution\u201d.",
    "\u201cWhilst we didn\u2019t turn the page on the fossil fuel era in Dubai, this outcome is the beginning of the end,\u201d he said. The price of crude oil took a dip soon after the announcement was made.",
    "The final text was a strengthening of language after an initial draft of the deal had removed any reference to \u201cphasing out\u201d fossil fuels, with the US and China claiming it was due to their intervention that negotiations got moving again.",
    "UN secretary general Antonio Guterres had a stark message for those who blocked the inclusion of a call to \u201cphase out\u201d fossil fuels, with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Russia, and members of the Opec+ group of oil-rich nations among those named publicly for opposing this language.",
    "\u201cWhether you like it or not, fossil fuel phase-out is inevitable. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come too late,\u201d he said.",
    "Despite the historic shift on fossil fuels, there were many left deeply disappointed by the agreement. More than 100 countries, including the coalition of small islands and others facing extreme impacts, had called specifically for the \u201cphase-out\u201d or \u201cphase-down\u201d of fossil fuels to be included.",
    "Anne Rasmussen, representative for Samoa speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said they were \u201cconfused about what just happened\u201d and that they were not in the room when the text was adopted.",
    "\u201cThis process has failed us,\u201d she said, describing the document as a \u201clitany of loopholes\u201d. Her remarks were met with cheering and a longer standing ovation than the original fossil-fuel announcement.",
    "Mr Jaber, who did not rise to clap, said that the AOSIS statement would be added to the record. Delegates largely acknowledged that the Dubai agreement \u2013 which required consensus of all countries, from the greenest to the oil-rich powers \u2013 was a step forward but that much more needed to be done to support and protect the most vulnerable.",
    "It had been an exhausting and emotional marathon slog to reach this point after the summit ran nearly 18 hours past its official end time. On Monday, a previous draft had provoked fury over its significantly weaker language.",
    "John Kerry, the US special climate envoy, said developing countries needed to be supported \u201cevery step of the way\u201d to build their clean energy systems.",
    "UK climate minister Graham Stuart, back at Cop28 after a brief 7,000-mile round trip to London on Tuesday to back prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s Rwanda deportation bill, called for keeping 1.5C as the \u201cNorth Star\u201d.",
    "He heralded the loss and damage fund, set up on the first day of the conference, as \u201clong overdue\u201d. But he said there was disappointment that more had not been done on coal in the Dubai text, an issue that the UK has championed at Cop28.",
    "Germany\u2019s climate minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking on behalf of the European Union, acknowledged the small islands, pointing to Samoa and the Marshall Islands, and said that the bloc had decided on a phase-out of fossil fuels to meet the 1.5C goal.",
    "\u201cWe feel you, we see you,\u201d Germany\u2019s representative said. \u201cWe know for your children that this [agreement] might not be enough."
