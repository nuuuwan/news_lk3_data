  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) urged the health authorities to immediately conduct an impartial investigation into the death of a three-year-old boy, who died following a kidney operation at the Lady Ridgeway Children\u2019s Hospital (LRH).",
    "GMOA Media Spokesman Dr Chamil Wijesinghe told Daily Mirror, \u201cIt's unfair for both parties namely victims and medical officers to draw early conclusions on the incident without a comprehensive analysis.\u201d",
    "\u201cHence, it's essential to promptly launch a probe into the incident so as to ascertain the actual cause of death,\u201d Dr Wijesinghe stressed.",
    "Meanwhile, the parents of the deceased child have accused the doctors of negligence, who identified that the child had developed acute kidney disease and thus advised the removal of the left kidney.",
    "Nevertheless, the child's parents claim that the doctors later informed them that the healthy right kidney was also removed during the procedure.",
    "Moreover, it is reported that the child, without any functioning kidneys, required haemodialysis until a suitable kidney could be transplanted. Tragically, the child passed away after contracting a harmful germ.",
    "The deceased, a resident of Kotahena area was receiving treatment in the Intensive Care Unit of LRH and died on Friday (28).",
    "Daily Mirror's continuous attempts to contact a responsible official from the Health Ministry and LRH Director failed. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
