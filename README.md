### Sajith’s favourability rating improves; AKD and RW lag

The public had a negative opinion of all leading Presidential candidates, but A.K. Dissanayake had the least negative rating.

In IHP SLOTS polling for August 2024, the net favourability rating of SJB leader Sajith Premadasa improved to -32 (+10 points compared to July). Meanwhile, NPP/JVP leader A.K. Dissanayake and President Ranil Wickremesinghe saw their favourability ratings drop to -21 (-16 points) and -33 (-4 points) respectively. The favourability rating of Namal Rajapaksa, the SLPP Presidential Election candidate, was -89 in August.

Favourability estimates for each month are based on 100–500 interviews conducted during that month and a few weeks before and after, ensuring a minimum set of responses for key party leaders. The August 2024 estimates are based on 517 interviews for Sajith Premadasa, 491 for A.K. Dissanayake, 530 for Ranil Wickremesinghe, 639 for Namal Rajapaksa, and 384 for Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

### Second preference vote is second round in Presidential election

*2024-09-14 00:45:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Second-preference-vote-is-second-round-in-Presidential-election/4-766737) · `en`

It may be important to pay attention to the second and third preferences in the current Presidential election, which seems to be a three-way battle

Presidential elections of most major democracies are held using two-round systems. It is a more democratic variant of the one-round first-past-the-post systems. Even in a two-round system, if a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes in the first round, there is no need for a second round. If no one gets more than 50%, only the first and second candidates will qualify for the second round.

Sri Lanka’s presidential election system is a unique one. It seems to be a composite of three systems that are currently used internationally to make the first-past-the-post systems more democratic. The three methods are – Supplementary Vote, Ranked Choice and Two-Round methods. For now, I think it’s more practical for us to think of our system as a variant of a two-round system.

Yes *“We did not focus on sustainable social responsiveness and thus there is dissent. We were not sincere and purposeful regarding interreligious, inter-communal, interracial harmony, resulting in intellectual capital flight – brain drain. There are many grievances among those who remained onshore. Reparations, Compensation, genuine initiatives towards National Harmony, are now a National Imperative.”*

### Far horizons

In the Presidential election to be held in a few days, this country faces its first test of public opinion since the Aragalaya

“There was one daily newspaper in the Ivory Coast, at least, only one came my way. It was called Fraternite’ Matin. Every day on its front page, in the top left-hand corner, it carried a ‘thought’ of the President’s. The thoughts were mainly about development and the economy; and so were big front-page stories”

Of all the extra-parliamentary convulsions that have happened all too regularly in this country since independence, the mass protest movement which occurred two years ago, commonly referred to as the ‘Aragalaya’ (struggle), is certainly unique.

Pelwatte and Sevenagala sugar factories are supposed to carry a stock of 1.3 million litres unable to sell

A friend had sent me an extract of a statement made by State Minister for Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama titled ‘Sri Lanka state sugar firms drowned in unsold ethanol’.

The two sugar firms referred to are Pelwatte and Sevenagala sugar factories. They are supposed to carry a stock of 1.3 million litres unable to sell.

He attributes this problem to the economic crisis and tax hikes.

In 1968 I took over as Distillery Manager at the then Government-owned distillery at the Kantale Sugar Factory. That is the reason for my friend to refer this to me to comment.

The Sihala Urumaya (SU) was formed in April 2000 on the basis that while Tamils and Muslims demonstrably had political parties to safeguard their interests, the majority community suffered from a lacuna in this regard. But the SU may have conveniently – or cynically – overlooked how the United National Party (UNP) as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) openly catered primarily to the wellbeing of the island’s Sinhalese Buddhists, and arguably shared the dubious honour of pioneering ‘political Buddhism’

### Sri Lanka Lifts Import Restrictions on Motor Vehicles Effective October 1, 2024

The government has announced the lifting of the temporary suspension on motor vehicle imports, effective October 1, 2024. This decision comes after over four years of stringent import restrictions that were initially imposed to safeguard the country’s foreign exchange reserves during the economic crisis.

The import ban, introduced in March 2020, was aimed at curbing the outflow of foreign exchange amidst the country’s deepening economic troubles. With the ban now lifted, Sri Lanka will begin importing motor vehicles again, starting in stages, as part of a broader economic recovery strategy tied to the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

### ‘Nothing will be derailed but everything would be humanized’ – Sajith on renegotiating IMF deal

Sri Lanka’s main opposition leader said he’ll reopen negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on its $3 billion loan if he wins next week’s presidential election to ease the financial burden on working class people.

Sajith Premadasa, 57, wants rich individuals to bear more of the cost of the economic adjustment that came with the bailout program. The austerity measures that were imposed, such as tax and electricity-price hikes, and the debt restructuring, have made the incumbent leader Ranil Wickremesinghe deeply unpopular, creating a tight race for the Sept. 21 vote.

“We will make sure there is justice and fairness,” Premadasa said in an interview in his Colombo office. “The burden should be shared by the super rich, not the working class poor.”
