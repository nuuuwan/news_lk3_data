### Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid

*2024-12-24 19:11:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104476/global-hunger-crisis-deepens-as-major-nations-skimp-on-aid) · `en`

It’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.

The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60% of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.

The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46% of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.

முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதிகளின் பாதுகாப்பு மற்றும் வழங்கப்படுகின்றன சிறப்பு சலுகைகளை குறைப்போம் என்று நாட்டு மக்களுக்கு வாக்குறுதியளித்தோம். நாட்டு மக்களும் இதனை முழுமையாக ஏற்றுக் கொண்டார்கள். துறைசார் நிபுணத்துவ குழுவின் அறிக்கைக்கு அமையவே முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதிகளுக்கு வழங்கப்பட்டிருந்த இராணுவ பாதுகாப்பு மீளப்பெறப்பட்டு, போதுமான அளவுக்கு பொலிஸ் பாதுகாப்பு வழங்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

*2024-12-24 17:12:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/202051) · `ta`

பாராளுமன்றத்தில் எதிர்க்கட்சியின் பிரதம கொறடா பதவிக்கு சிறுபான்மை பிரதிநிதியொருவரின் பெயரைக் கூட பரிந்துரைக்காத ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்திக்கு 'கிளீன் ஸ்ரீலங்கா' வேலைத்திட்டத்தில் சிறுபான்மையினர் உள்வாங்கப்படவில்லை என்ற குற்றச்சாட்டை முன்வைப்பதற்கு தகுதியில்லை. அது முழு இலங்கையருக்குமான வேலைத்திட்டம் என்பதால் இன, மத பேதமின்றி எவரும் அதில் இணையலாம் என அரசாங்கம் அறிவித்துள்ளது.

அமைச்சரவை தீர்மானங்களை அறிவிக்கும் ஊடகவியலாளர் மாநாடு செவ்வாய்கிழமை (24) இடம்பெற்ற போது அமைச்சரவை பேச்சாளர் நளிந்த ஜயதிஸ்ஸ இதனைத் தெரிவித்தார்.

'கிளீன் ஸ்ரீலங்கா' வேலைத்திட்டத்தை முன்னெடுப்பதற்காக 18 பேரடங்கிய குழு நியமிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. பாதுகாப்பு படை உள்ளிட்ட துறையுடன் தொடர்புடையோர் அக்குழுவில் நியமிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளனர். ஜனவரியில் இக்குழுவின் சில வேலைத்திட்டங்கள் ஆரம்பமாகும்.

ஓரிரு மாதங்களுக்கு அல்லது ஒரு வருடத்துக்கு மாத்திரமின்றி ஜனாதிபதியின் கண்காணிப்பின் கீழ் நீண்டகால வேலைத்திட்டமாக இதனை முன்னெடுப்பதற்கு திட்டமிடப்பட்டுள்ளது.

### Untold Lessons: Economic Insights From History For Sri Lanka’s Crisis

*2024-12-24 16:51:35* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/untold-lessons-economic-insights-from-history-for-sri-lankas-crisis/) · `en`

With a new government in power, Sri Lanka finds itself grappling with immense economic challenges. The burden of enormous debts continues to weigh heavily on a fragile economy, necessitating robust growth to overcome these hardships. However, achieving such growth is complicated by a governmental predisposition toward centralised economic control, rooted in socialist-communal ideologies.

These challenges are not unique to Sri Lanka; they echo the historical pitfalls of centralised economic systems. This essay explores three illustrative examples from American history: The failed socialism of the Plymouth Colony, the rapid recovery during the Forgotten Depression of 1920-1921, and the transformative innovation of the Gilded Age.

These examples are not often the subject of discussion by contemporary economists, but they offer valuable insights into the perils of excessive government control and the potential of free-market principles to foster prosperity.

### South Korean opposition puts off plan to impeach acting president Han

*2024-12-24 16:16:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104473/south-korean-opposition-puts-off-plan-to-impeach-acting-president-han) · `en`

South Korea’s main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened.

The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived bid to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that he partly blamed on the opposition’s propensity to impeach government officials.

Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday.

The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol’s failed bid to impose martial law.
