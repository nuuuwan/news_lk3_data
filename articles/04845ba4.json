    "U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung has clarified that the United States has not issued a travel ban on Sri Lanka and that the security alert issued recently was only for Americans to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice.",
    "Speaking during an event on Monday (28), she stated that one of her duties as a US Ambassador is to ensure the safety and the security of American citizens here in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cGlobally, all around the world our US Embassies operate under what\u2019s called a duty to warn. If we become aware of a credible, specific security threat, we are required to share that information with our staff, US citizens and the host government,\u201d Chung stated.",
    "She stated that their no double standard policy also means that anytime they alert embassy staff about a specific security concern, they are required to inform US citizens as well.",
    "\u201cThis approach is also standard practice worldwide. When we became aware of a specific threat in the Arugam Bay area we shared these known details with Sri Lankan authorities, who responded quickly.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe continue to actively coordinate with them on a daily basis and we value our partnership with Sri Lanka\u2019s leadership and security officials whose commitment to safety and transparency is notable,\u201d she further said.",
    "The U.S. Ambassador emphasized that she also wanted to correct some misinformation being spread.",
    "\u201cThere is no travel ban on Sri Lanka. Our security alert last week is for Americans to avoid Arugam Bay until further notice. But our overall travel advisory for Sri Lanka remains exactly the same at \u2018Level 2\u2019, which has been so for many years.\u201d",
    "She pointed out that this is similar to advisories of many other popular destinations including the Maldives, France and Italy which are all the same at \u2018Level 2\u2019. \u201cSri Lanka remains at \u2018Level 2\u2019,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cWe know that continued safety and stability are essential for a thriving tourism sector which we support absolutely. So, we are fully committed to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts to create that secure welcoming environment for all,\u201d Ambassador Chung added."
