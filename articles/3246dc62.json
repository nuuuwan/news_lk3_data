    "Responding to questions from journalists, the Prime Minister stated, \u201cWe, as teachers, parents, and students, have grown accustomed to an education system designed primarily around examinations. However, with this module-based system, students will engage in diverse learning activities and undergo continuous assessments.\u201d",
