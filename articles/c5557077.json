    "The UK, Australia, Canada and Portugal formally recognised a Palestinian State on Sunday, a move that will be followed by several European nations at a United Nations conference in Paris this week.",
    "The meeting, co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is expected to see France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Andorra, San Marino and Malta extend recognition. More than three quarters of the UN\u2019s 193 members already recognise Palestinian statehood. Countries that have not taken that step include the United States, Israel, Italy and Germany."
