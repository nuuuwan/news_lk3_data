"In T20s we need a wicket-taking option, which is why we opted for Jeffrey (Vandersay) over someone like Dunith (Wellalage)," Tharanga said.

Central bank officials must have a wider understanding than the economy.Their education must include social science, such as human behavior to understand the social impacts of sociology, peace and conflict studies and the social impacts of their decisions.

The current decision -making process is the risk of maintaining social unrest due to lack of this broader understanding.This recent incident, which was brought to light through social media, illustrates this.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which is considered a professional organization that supports policymakers, has contributed to the current economic situation to affect other social development indicators.

### France becomes only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as constitutional right

*2024-03-05 09:04:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97734/france-becomes-only-country-to-explicitly-guarantee-abortion-as-constitutional-right) · `en`

French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in France’s constitution, making it the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

The historic move was proposed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years, and the vote during a special joint session of France’s parliament drew a long-standing ovation among lawmakers.

The measure was approved in a 780-72 vote in the Palace of Versailles. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975.

Many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. While a small group of protesters stood outside the joint session, there were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by Macron within hours of the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.

Electricity connection to a cluster of villages in Thantirimale, Anuradhapura has been disconnected leaving consumers in the lurch.

The area people, mostly dependent on agriculture, complain that they are unable to pay for electricity because of the tariff hikes introduced last year. They say electricity is beyond their means because of poverty they are now engulfed in following the economic crisis.

People in the villages such as Ihala Goneva, Sandamaleliya and Thambiyawa, are grappling with this issue. They also face issues related to food security and are victims of the human-elephant conflict.

S. Padmini, 32, a villager of Thambiyawa, said her husband is now a wage earner with a daily income of Rs.2500. She said her husband had to cycle at least 15-20 kilometres a day in search of work.   “It is difficult for us to make ends meet,” she said.

Says in case of a delay, IMF is likely to provide breathing space

A potential delay in securing an agreement-in-principle (AIP) with Sri Lanka’s private bondholders is unlikely to impact the second review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, former Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.

Rothschild, the financial advisor to the bondholder group, is currently studying the proposal and consequently, will present the proposal to the bondholder group with its recommendations, said the senior economist, addressing an informative forum organised by CA Sri Lanka in Colombo yesterday.

While this process could take some time, he was confident that the bondholders, based on the recommendations of their advisors, would soon come onboard to reach an AIP with the government, possibly within the second review of the IMF programme.

Nationals from these countries planning to visit Sri Lanka need to apply for Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) before arriving, subject to granting of visa free of charge.

The scheme is valid until March 2024 while the visa is valid for 30 days, permitting double entry from the date of initial arrival to Sri Lanka. However, industry sources believe that the boost in tourist arrivals may encourage the visa free travel scheme to be extended further.
