    "The local poultry producers today agreed to reduce the local selling price of one kilogram of chicken by Rs. 100.",
    "The decision was announced following a discussion held at the Agriculture Ministry this morning with the aim of protecting the local poultry production industry and providing an opportunity for consumers to buy chicken meat at a minimum price.",
    "\"If chicken is imported, the local industry may collapse completely. So the responsibility of protecting this industry was discussed at length at the Cabinet meeting yesterday (July 31). The President instructed the Agriculture Department to discuss the price of chicken with the industrialists.",
    "\"The producers said the increase in the price of chicken in the market is due to the import tax of Rs. 75 imposed on imported maize, and that the tax should be reduced to Rs. 25. They agreed to reduce the price of a kilogram of chicken meat by Rs. 100.",
    "\"However, these businessmen pointed out that the prices of chicken meat can be further reduced next year. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
