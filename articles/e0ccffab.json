  "original_body_lines": [
    "When my son was 11 years old and in middle school, he chose to write about his grandfather, starting his essay with the statement, \u201cmy grandfather is an enigma.\u201d I am not sure whether to his young mind my father was so much a puzzle, being both a super -cool grandpa and an exacting teacher, or just simply unpredictable. My father was someone who could relate to his grandchildren only when they were old enough to debate the merits of the separation of state and church or play a championship game of chess. But he also had wonderful adventures which fired my son\u2019s young imagination.",
    "My father had an inquiring and brilliant mind which often led him to try new experiences. He was also not very practical. When we were living in Rome, he decided that he wanted to understand the underbelly of the Eternal City by canoeing down the Tiber, infested as it was with toxic chemicals, and a bilious green color to boot. He acquired an inflatable canoe and convinced his reluctant Japanese colleague and my mother to assist him in carrying out his mission.",
    "The river embankment is such that it is planted with dense thorny bushes and the drop to the water is several feet. By the time my father and his accomplice scrambled down the thorny precipice, the canoe had sprung a leak. My father did not want to give up his mission so he persuaded my mother to drive to the store, buy an inflator pump and drive to the Marconi bridge where she had to make a calculated throw so that he could grab the pump while he sailed past far below. All this she did, and my father and his colleague merrily sailed down the Tiber to the sea in a rubber canoe, admiring the weeping willows on the shore and pretending they couldn\u2019t smell the fetid water.",
    "These exploits eclipsed my teen and college years, and I wavered between being impressed with my father\u2019s exploits and mortified that he would be discovered by my friends. Let me tell you about the scene that was enacted just before this canoe ride. My father suffered from chronic back pain. To ensure that he could indeed sit in the canoe throughout the 15 km ride down the Tiber, he decided to \u201cpractice sitting\u201d in our living room.",
    "He placed the inflated canoe in the middle of our living room, sat down in position with paddles in hand, and then for a good measure, placed a straw hat on his head. Then, he pulled out the Economist and started reading. I had invited my Canadian friend to stay with us over the weekend. As I was taking my friend to the guest room, she spied the canoe scene in the living room. She didn\u2019t say anything till we got to the guest room, when she said in a strained voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know but there is a weird man in your living room who thinks he is canoeing in water.\u201d",
    "My father was an ardent sportsman. I was simply not. He tried his best to make me more agile, buying me my first pair of roller skates and bicycle, and insisting on tennis and swimming classes even before the crows were awake in Colombo. I tried to live up to his expectations but was never more than an unwilling participant. In the winters, we were taken skiing. Our trusty roulotte (camper) was taken up to Ovindoli in the beautiful Abruzzi hills near Rome, or to Monte Livata. My father insisted that we ski every single day that we were camped up there in the high Apennines. I hated the snow, the cold and the desolation, and mostly I hated being away from the city and my friends.",
    "We did marvelous trips around Italy and around Europe in the summer months. My father was a keen tourist and insisted we read up in advance on places and their history so that we absorbed every element of the trip. My young brother was always the family GPS and would sit in the back with the maps directing while my each of my parents took turns driving at breakneck speed on the autostrada, usually with our trusty roulotte careening along behind. When we arrived at the campsite, my father took great care to park in a place with a scenic view. Many times, this entailed us sleeping on uneven terrain with our feet higher than our heads. When we woke from our uncomfortable sleep, Dad would be exclaiming over the wonderful sunrise he witnessed over the lake/sea/mountain.",
    "I have always been a bit in awe of my father. He could argue on any international or domestic issue, being a well-travelled international civil servant; but he could also paint, play any instrument by ear and any sport that required a ball and a racket, or a bat. His interests knew no bounds, whether as a keen participant or an engaged onlooker. I was usually swept away by his enthusiasm. There were years when he recorded the best orchestras from Rome to Berlin and beyond, and played classical music at top volume throughout our home. There was a time when he decided that our Italian language skills would be put to good use by attending every opera and operetta that opened at La Scala. Looking back, I realize I had a privileged upbringing and that my father opened endless experiences for us, even if I did not appreciate them at the time.",
    "Those were also the years we spent in Trevignano, by Lago di Bracciano. My parents had an apartment on the top of the hill overlooking the lake and a plot of land by the water where we camped most of the time in our parked roulette as my father needed \u201cto hear lapping water.\u201d One year, my father decided that he wanted to grow a variety of jasmine-scented white grapes and make his own wine. He usually had the theory down pat, and so it was with viticulture; actual implementation meant that the family and the neighbors had to be enlisted to do the work. Harvesting was hard but as kids we loved donning Wellington boots and stomping on the grapes. Mercifully, our Italian neighbors knew just how much stomping and fermenting had to go into making half-drinkable wine.",
    "These weekly trips to Lago di Bracciano were his \u201cescape from FAO1\u201d as he called it. To prepare for the weekend trips, my mother would go into automatic gear: she had all meals planned for the family and car packed and ready for Friday evening departure for the lake. Sometimes, he would go alone. Once in the early days of acquiring his sailboat, he triumphantly sailed across the lake and reached the other side of this deep and huge volcanic lake when the sun was setting, only to realize that the wind had changed direction, and he had no idea how to return. Dressed only in his swimsuit he had to hitch a ride back to the roulotte and reached at 2 am. We were all in Rome and thankfully unaware of the excitement he had caused with our campsite neighbors.",
    "Dinner-time conversations in our home were hardly conversations. My father would lecture us on the woes of the peasants in South America or on how he got a piece of agrarian legislation through the parliament in Namibia. Sometimes in his stories he emerged as the ideological bad boy; and at other times the superior economist, but always whose theories were vindicated. Simply by osmosis I was educated in the vagaries of development and agrarian reforms.",
    "Truth be told, I would envy my friends who had family conversations around the table that revolved simply around their school day. Instead, at our table we were an audience to all my father\u2019s grandstanding; he came out of each story in the end as the victor, having trounced his colleagues on a policy issue in Bangladesh or Bhutan, swum through the Batticoloa floods, or endured a week-long trek among aborigines in the dense jungles of Sri Lanka, all the while suffering from dysentery.",
    "My father\u2019s abrasive brilliance did not diminish even at the age of almost 97 years. He passed away three months ago in Manila where he lived with us after my mother\u2019s death 17 years ago. Even in his last years he followed and commented on every hot and polemical development around the globe, his TV and computer working day and night. He was still able to analyze and dissect and hold forth eloquently on any subject, though I suspect his impaired hearing took away half his pleasure.",
    "I must admit that, at times, I was a little irritated to be lectured to, especially as he seemed oblivious to my being elderly and having my own experiences, and advanced degrees. For my father, as an intellectual giant and an ideologue, I think not one of his three successful children was able to match his singular achievements. For me, that is okay.",
