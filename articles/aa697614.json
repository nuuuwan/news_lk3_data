    "Former president and Leader of the United National Party Ranil Wickremesinghe last week urged voters to elect candidates with proven experience in managing economic crisis, at the upcoming general election.",
    "With Sri Lanka facing ongoing financial challenges, Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for seasoned leadership to guide the country forward.",
    "Making a special yet brief statement, he highlighted the importance of electing leaders who understand the intricacies of economic recovery.",
    "\u201cIn these difficult times, it is vital that we have leaders in parliament who know how to handle an economic crisis\u201d, he stated.",
    "Wickremesinghe urged voters across party-lines to support candidates who worked alongside him in the past two years as they played a key role in the recovery process and have the necessary experience.",
    "He appealed to those who didn\u2019t vote at the last election to cast their vote this time, stressing the importance of bringing in leaders to ensure the continuity of the debt sustainability programme, sustained recovery and putting the country on a growth trajectory.",
    "\u201cWithout experienced members of parliament participating in the decision-making process, the country cannot reach the economic targets in line with the IMF framework and its timeline\u201d, he warned.",
    "Underscoring the strength of the coalition that supported him at the last presidential election, he said, \u201d I took over the leadership of the country at a time it had declared bankruptcy. At that juncture, politicians of the UNP, Podu Jana Eksath Peramuna and SLFP came forward to shoulder that responsibility with me. Those who were on my team that steered the country through the crisis are now united under the New Democratic Front in the parliamentary race.",
    "They have the proven experience the current times demand from them as members of parliament.\u201d",
    "The former President also highlighted the challenges that the new government would face, particularly the need to increase state revenue to 15% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2028 when Sri Lanka must begin repaying its foreign debt. Currently, government revenue stands at 12% of GDP, and Wickremesinghe warned that the country must achieve 1% economic growth annually to meet the revenue target.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn such a context, I call on citizens to make their vote count in informed decision making because the right leadership is crucial to rebuilding the country\u2019s future,\u201d he said.",
