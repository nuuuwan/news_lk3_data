National Security Council discusses bomb threats impacting tourism in Sri Lanka. Threats divert flights, raise concerns about tourism industry. Authorities increase security measures. CID investigates aircraft bomb blasts.

üü©

The National Security Council headed by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake held a discussion on the continuous bomb threats and the impact of the tourism industry in Sri Lanka.

Informed sources said that continuing threats could affect tourists visiting the country and raised concerns about the future of the tourism industry.

Shortly after the aircraft entered the Sri Lankan air border, it was also revealed that the bomb was threatened. Since the nearby airport is located at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), all the affected flights are diverted to BIA for security testing.

In a recent incident, Sri Lankan law enforcement officials had to respond to two aircraft that had landed simultaneously by bomb threats.. However, with the available human resources, the authorities were able to manage the situation effectively.

The Canadian government alleged on Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, a close ally of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was behind the plots to target Sikh separatists on Canadian soil.

Canadian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison said to a parliamentary panel on Tuesday that he told the U.S.-based newspaper that Shah was behind the plots.

‚ÄúThe journalist called me and asked if it (Shah) was that person. I confirmed it was that person,‚Äù Morrison told the committee, without providing further details or evidence. The High Commission of India in Ottawa and the Indian foreign ministry had no immediate comment.

### Sri Lanka delegation discussed taxes, revenues with IMF: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì A Sri Lanka delegation had discussed taxes and revenue targets during a visit the International Monetary Fund headquarters in the US, Minister Vijitha Herath said.

‚ÄúEspecially on current taxes, including VAT and other taxes, on revenues and how to achieve them,‚Äù Minister Herath said.

Sri Lanka has to have a budget for 2025 to set revenue and primary balance targets for June 2025, which are quantitative performance criteria when negotiating the next staff level agreement.

The IMF is quite keen on boosting revenues rather than cutting spending. Spending cuts can also achieve the primary deficit.

Sri Lanka was supposed to conduct a review on June 2024 data around September but the elections had delayed the review.

In the earlier program the December data had been set (some of which were to be firmed on this review) but the new administration is planning a vote on account while working on next years budget.

Potential to create 800,000 plus local jobs, and accelerate gender equality achievements

From households to national economies, care work ‚Äì both paid and unpaid ‚Äì keeps the world and the economy moving!

Often framed as an act of love, a noble calling, a not so important sector, care work is frequently under-valued, unrecognised, not perceived as work nor economic activity. COVID-19 brought into sharp focus the crucial roles of caregivers and care workers, creating the momentum for the first UN International Day of Care and Support, observed on 29 October 2023. Unpaid household care workers and paid care workers in domestic work or in the care and health sector, are vital pillars of our societies and economies, yet these contributions are often dismissed.

The way we talk about suicide plays a vital role, as it has the potential to wound or heal, disenfranchise or empower, defeat or motivate, especially for survivors of loss

The 10th of September (World Suicide Prevention Day) and the hive of activity that surrounds it each year, has gradually begun to fade; from social media, and from our collective memory. However, there are still red-hot smouldering embers, brightly ablaze in the lives of those affected by mental illness and suicide, including those bereaved by suicide loss.

Prevention in the context of recognising warning signs and risk factors, reducing access to means and reaching out for support, helpline numbers, asking the suicide question, etc. in connection with intervention were widely discussed; in panel discussions, news articles, and social media platforms. However, a key concept discussed in the literature about suicide prevention was/is neglected; and that is postvention.

Showcasing Sri Lanka‚Äôs iconic destinations: A testament to the nation‚Äôs potential as a premier tourist hub, ready to captivate the world

In brief, international marketing is the process of planning and conducting transactions across national borders to create exchanges that satisfy the objectives of individuals and organisations.

It comes in forms of export/import trade to licensing, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries, turnkey operations, and management contracts.

With the prevailing economic crisis in Sri Lanka and depreciation of the rupee, the only way to address this issue is to increase exports. Sri Lanka exports amounted to Rs. 4,234,913 in 2022 according to Central Bank of Sri Lanka statistics.

Are we doing it right? Is this our potential? Is international marketing done in a proper way when it comes to branding Sri Lanka and its products and services to the world?

The stock market yesterday too continued on its bullish trend indicating that banking and financial sector counters are performing well. This is so because after the external debt restructuring process is concluded in November, the government could issue new sovereign bonds, replacing the previous/existing default bonds, thereby benefiting the local banking sector, market analysts said.

Following the conclusion of the external debt restructuring process in November, the local banking and financial sector is likely to get better options than other foreign banks in the sovereign bond issue exercise, thus resulting in attracting both, local and foreign investors, to those stocks, analysts said.

Amid those developments both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 135.5 points, while the S and P SL20 rose by 68.8 points. Turnover stood at Rs 3.96 billion with seven crossings.
