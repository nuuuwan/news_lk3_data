    "First Capital Holdings PLC, a subsidiary of JXG (Janashakthi Group) has stepped forward as the title sponsor of First Capital Startup Nation by Hatch, a transformative program that connects investors with Sri Lanka\u2019s most promising startups.",

Both organisations believe that true progress comes from empowering bold ideas and supporting entrepreneurs with the courage to build innovative solutions for the country and beyond. For Hatch, the initiative marks a natural next step. Over the years, it has been the first home for Sri Lanka\u2019s startup dreamers, providing a safe space where ideas grow into ventures and ventures evolve into stories of impact. Hatch has walked alongside founders, helping them secure funding, access markets and imagine a future beyond borders. For First Capital, the partnership represents an extension of its legacy. With more than four decades of building trust, creating access and fuelling progress in Sri Lanka\u2019s financial markets, the company now brings that spirit of investment to a more human level, backing the innovators who will shape the next chapter of the nation\u2019s story.",
    "First Capital Startup Nation by Hatch is designed to identify the top 10 startups in Sri Lanka from a competitive pool of more than 183 applications. The selected ventures will gain access to best-effort support to secure $100,000 in funding, as well as follow-on funding opportunities. Beyond capital, the program provides exposure, mentorship, and access to global investor networks. With a focus on solutions that address pressing local challenges, fast-growing early-stage startups with post-revenue traction, and B2C models with global expansion potential, the initiative seeks to position Sri Lankan startups on the international stage while contributing to economic growth at home. The program schedule includes startup onboarding, workshops and competitions from 16 to 25 September, investor networking, policy dialogues and roundtables on 29 and 30 September, and a grand showcase event, investor demo day and closing celebrations on 1 October.",
