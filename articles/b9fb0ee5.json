    "Many men often struggle to connect with their emotions, and unlike women, seldom have access to \u2018safe\u2019 spaces where they can freely express what\u2019s truly going on inside. A \u2018safe space\u2019 is a trusted environment devoid of judgments, for people to be themselves without fear of rejection or ridicule. A place with freedom, to share thoughts, ideas, feelings and experiences, to unlock inhibitions and grow. A\u00a0place of encouragement, acknowledgement and genuine support to explore who you really are.",
    "To address the stigma surrounding men\u2019s mental health and encourage open discussions about it, including toxic masculinity and ego.",
    "This idea might seem unusual, as society typically expects men to embody roles like \u201cthe strong one\u201d or \u201cthe provider,\u201d often urging them to endure challenges without voicing their struggles and to simply \u2018man up.\u2019 However, men are human too. Behind the smiles and the facade of having everything under control, many experience significant fear, anxiety and stress, particularly those who feel unprepared to handle their emotions. It\u2019s time to shift this narrative and normalize the creation of safe spaces for men. Importantly, the ratio of men to women who die by suicide in Sri Lanka is 5:1 and then suicide is not about dying but stopping the pain.",
    "According to Irvin Yalom MD, who has been a major figure in the field of psychotherapy, there are several key therapeutic factors that influence change in group settings. These factors, which emerge from interactions within the group, play a vital role in the healing process. Universality: The recognition that others share similar feelings, thoughts, and experiences can alleviate feelings of isolation and enhance a sense of belonging. Altruism: Helping and supporting others can boost self-esteem and provide a sense of value and purpose. Interpersonal Learning: Learning from the experiences of others and receiving feedback can enhance self-awareness and personal growth. Self-Understanding: By relating with others and reflecting on their experiences, individuals can gain deeper insights into their own feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.",
    "\u201cMen-In-Need\u201d aims to provide this space for \u201cMAN CAVE\u201d to facilitate confidential conversations for change and help rebuild, restore, rehabilitate and rejuvenate. Language will not be a barrier. People can benefit immensely from shared experiences in a group setting. Evidence has proved the interaction between group members is a driving force for change and growth. It is about ordinary people interacting, supporting, and learning from each other under the guidance of a trained facilitator. It will not only be a \u2018Colombo Centric\u2019 project. The dream is to have this Space also accessible all around Sri Lanka in major towns and help is needed from the community to make it a reality.",
    "The founder of this project, Jomo Uduman had this to say, \u201cMEN-IN-NEED is a response to the growing need for empathy, emotional and mental support for men in our country and is dedicated to provide a safe, supportive, caring and confidential space where men can meet, connect, communicate and feel understood while breaking the barriers of silence, fear, low self-esteem and stigma\u201d.",
