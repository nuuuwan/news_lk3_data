    "Petitioner Rauff Hakeem claims that the SLMC, led by him, supported SJB\u2019s presidential candidate, Sajith Premadasa, during the 2024 Presidential Election.",
    "He also stated that during the 2024 General Election, his party entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with SJB regarding the contesting of the General Election, on October 10.",
