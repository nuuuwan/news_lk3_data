### T20 World Cup 2024: Sri Lanka start campaign against South Africa today

June 3 - One of the most exciting matches in the T20 World Cup is that of Sri Lanka vs South Africa that will take place at the Nassau County International Stadium in New York.

Daily Mirror partners with BETSS for live coverage of today's match, starting at 08:00 PM Sri Lanka time.

Both Sri Lanka and South Africa have stars who shone in the recently concluded IPL. Matheesha Pathirana, who took 13 wickets for Chennai Super Kings at an economy rate of 7.68, will be a force to be reckoned with, as will be South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 479 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad as they secured a runners-up finish in the IPL final.

It’s not just Pathirana who brings express pace for Sri Lanka. Dishan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera can also bowl express pace. Nuwan Thushara, meanwhile, has had his highs and lows but his figures of 5/20 against Bangladesh in a T20I n March will act as an inspiration of sorts to do better.

With elections coming up in a few months’ time – notwithstanding Palitha Range Bandara’s outrageous remarks, to which Saliya Pieris, the former President of the Bar Association, responded thoughtfully – new coalitions and alliances are cropping up. These have pulled together the unlikeliest MPs and ideologues, who you’d never put together in the same room but who have, in the aftermath of the 2022 crisis, have unified around certain issues. Outside of the government, the consensus seems to be that we have yet to see a proper Opposition. This is the selling promise of these new coalitions: they tout themselves as that proper Opposition, the only political groups that matter.

### Australia lifts minimum wage as families grapple with higher living costs

*2024-06-03 10:42:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99615/australia-lifts-minimum-wage-as-families-grapple-with-higher-living-costs) · `en`

Australia’s independent wage-setting body on Monday raised the national minimum wage by 3.75%, largely in line with inflation, as families tackle soaring living costs.

The minimum rate will rise to A$24.10 ($16.05) per hour from July 1, resulting in an extra A$33 per week for about a fifth of the Australian workforce or about 2.6 million employees.

In its annual review, the Fair Work Commission said cost-of-living pressures have hit low-income employees the most, though inflation is considerably lower now than it was at this time last year, when it awarded an increase of 5.75%.

But the report said it was not “appropriate at this time to increase award wages by any amount significantly above the inflation rate principally because labour productivity is no higher than it was four years ago.”

Australian consumer price inflation rose at an annual pace of 3.6% in April, the highest level in five months, adding to risks the next move in interest rates might be upward.
