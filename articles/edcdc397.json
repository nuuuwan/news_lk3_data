    "The Doha summit stands as a potent act of collective diplomacy",
    "When Qatar hosted the Arab-Islamic emergency summit on 15 September 2025\u2014just days after an Israeli strike in Doha killed Hamas leaders and a Qatari officer\u2014expectations were high. Could this gathering produce more than a chorus of protest speeches? Would it reshape regional alignments, force policy shifts, or deepen legal and military responses? As the dust settles, Doha emerges as a significant diplomatic moment that combined high symbolism with cautious substance.1",
    "The first measure of success lay in the breadth of participation. Qatar secured an impressive roster of leaders from across the Arab and Islamic worlds.2 Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia\u2019 al-Sudani and Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif all arrived in person.3 For Qatar, whose sovereignty had been directly violated, such high-level attendance signalled a powerful endorsement of its grievance and a clear message of regional solidarity.",
    "Equally significant was the presence of countries that maintain formal ties with Israel. Senior delegations from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco\u2014states that had joined the Abraham Accords\u2014added weight to the gathering.4 Their decision to endorse a communiqu\u00e9 critical of Israel and to consider a \u201creview of diplomatic and economic ties\u201d reflected a subtle but important shift in the regional conversation. By convening the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in tandem with the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s Supreme Council, Qatar ensured that the summit carried institutional legitimacy beyond a one-off protest meeting.5",
    "The optics were unmistakable. The group photograph of leaders standing together in Doha conveyed a rare moment of unity, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Qatar after years of rivalry. Yet presence alone does not guarantee policy coherence. States arrived with different red lines and threat perceptions, and those differences inevitably shaped the final text.",
    "The summit\u2019s outcome document is the clearest indicator of what this diplomacy achieved. It opens with an unequivocal denunciation of the Israeli strike as a \u201cflagrant\u201d violation of Qatari sovereignty and the United Nations Charter, pledging \u201cabsolute solidarity\u201d with Doha.6 This framing elevates the incident from a dispute involving a non-state actor to a direct breach of state sovereignty\u2014precisely the legal terrain on which international action can be built.",
    "The communiqu\u00e9 also calls for \u201call possible legal and effective measures\u201d against Israel, including a review of diplomatic and economic relations and support for international legal proceedings.7 The accompanying GCC statement goes further, directing the bloc\u2019s Unified Military Command to activate joint defence and deterrence mechanisms\u2014language rarely used in recent years and potentially the summit\u2019s most concrete step.8",
    "At the same time, the document bears the marks of compromise. It contains no binding sanctions, no timelines and no collective commitment to sever ties or impose economic penalties.9 References to a political horizon and a two-state solution were retained only after careful wording, and Iran publicly distanced itself from those passages.10 Implementation remains undefined; the language provides flexibility rather than obligation.",
    "Despite these limits, the Doha summit produced notable achievements. For Qatar, the gathering reinforced its sovereignty claim and insulated it from isolation, ensuring that any further action\u2014legal or diplomatic\u2014carries broad regional backing.11 For the wider Arab and Islamic world, it expanded diplomatic space. States that balance relations with Israel and the West can now point to a region-wide mandate if they choose to recalibrate their positions.",
    "The emphasis on international law was not mere rhetoric. By explicitly endorsing legal action, the summit placed Israel\u2019s actions under a sharper legal spotlight and opened pathways to the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court.12 At the same time, the GCC\u2019s call to enhance joint defence gives the Gulf states a framework for practical coordination, a reminder that collective security is again on the agenda after years of drift.13",
    "Events in Washington and Doha shortly after the summit add another layer of significance. During a visit to Qatar following meetings in Israel, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed that Washington had not approved the strike and emphasized the inviolability of Qatari sovereignty.14 Rubio warned that there was only a \u201cvery short window\u201d to achieve a Gaza ceasefire and praised Qatar\u2019s role as mediator.15 Most notably, he announced that the United States and Qatar are close to finalising an enhanced defence cooperation agreement, signalling that the US intends to deepen its military partnership with Doha in response to the attack.16",
    "This development underscores that the summit\u2019s impact extended beyond the region. By drawing the United States into closer strategic alignment with Qatar, the Doha gathering has influenced the calculations of the very power whose ally carried out the strike.",
    "At nearly the same moment, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan concluded a Strategic Defence Agreement pledging that aggression against one would be treated as aggression against both.17 The pact goes beyond symbolism, committing the two states to joint defence planning and deterrence. For Riyadh, it represents a diversification of security partnerships beyond the traditional US umbrella; for Islamabad, it strengthens its role as a Gulf security partner and amplifies its own strategic significance.",
    "The agreement reverberates well beyond the Doha summit\u2019s walls. By binding the region\u2019s largest Arab economy to South Asia\u2019s only nuclear-armed state, it raises the cost of any future violation of Gulf sovereignty and points toward a more multipolar security architecture in the broader Middle East.",
    "Still, the limitations are clear. Diverging national interests remain the chief obstacle to collective action. Iran\u2019s rejection of two-state language underscores how difficult it will be to maintain unity beyond rhetorical condemnation.18 Many governments are constrained by ties to the United States and Europe, economic interdependence and domestic political considerations.19 For leaders facing their own fragile coalitions, dramatic gestures\u2014severing ties, imposing sanctions\u2014can carry steep internal costs.",
    "The reliance on careful verbs\u2014\u201dreview,\u201d \u201cconsider,\u201d \u201cpossible measures\u201d\u2014exposes the gap between symbolism and enforcement.20 Without timelines, verification or shared mechanisms, momentum may fade and the communiqu\u00e9 may come to be seen as another strong statement without follow-through.",
    "The true measure of Doha\u2019s success will unfold in the coming months. Signs to watch include whether the GCC\u2019s Unified Military Command moves beyond declarations into coordinated air-defence or deterrence exercises; whether states that maintain relations with Israel undertake tangible downgrades; whether Qatar or a coalition of Arab states file legal cases before international courts; and whether Washington and Doha translate the promised defence cooperation agreement into operational reality.21 External reactions\u2014including how India, Iran and Israel read the Saudi-Pakistan pact\u2014will further shape the region\u2019s strategic balance.",
    "The Doha summit stands as a potent act of collective diplomacy. It reaffirmed that the breach of a Gulf state\u2019s sovereignty cannot pass without unified censure and gave Qatar legal and political tools to pursue redress.22 It also signalled that the GCC, long criticised for inertia, is willing at least to contemplate a more robust security posture. The subsequent US moves and the Saudi-Pakistan defence agreement reinforce that this moment is shaping realignments beyond the Gulf.",
    "Yet the ultimate verdict depends on implementation. Without concrete actions\u2014legal filings, defence coordination, or measured economic steps\u2014the communiqu\u00e9s risk becoming another carefully worded protest destined to fade from headlines.23 Doha has provided the language and the platform; it remains to be seen whether the region\u2019s leaders\u2014and now their new partners\u2014will supply the resolve.",
