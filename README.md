### Yes, it’s Christmas time…

*2024-12-25 19:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/yes-its-christmas-time/) · `en`

It’s a well-known fact that with Christmas comes some kind of chaos. The build-up tends to be a blur of gift buying, party prepping and worryingly high workloads; it’s understandably difficult to find, let alone make, the time for yourself – but it’s important that you do…to make your skin healthier this Christmas

Drinking plenty of water is always important. Dehydrated skin can look dry and flaky, with more visible fine lines and wrinkles. Water also rids the body of toxins, which is especially useful if you are having those Christmas drinks and eating more processed foods than usual.

Remove dullness and reveal your inner radiance with a gentle exfoliating scrub. Opt for natural ingredients, like brown sugar, oats, or even coffee grounds mixed with honey. Massage in circular motions, focusing on areas like your nose, chin, and forehead. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat your skin dry.
