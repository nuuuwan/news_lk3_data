Police said the victims had previously been in a relationship and still lived together, and that the suspect had been staying with them at their west London apartment.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said “the evidence gathered so far does not suggest there was a homophobic motive” to the killings.

“I hope it will be of some reassurance that whilst enquiries are still ongoing and the investigation is at a relatively early stage, we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the two murders,” Valentine said.

The National People's Power is the main movement of the people's aspirations that emerged through the people's struggle in 2022.

Therefore, we urge you to win the forthcoming election and to address the national issues, including the ethnic problem that continues to create severe disagreements in the Sri Lankan community.

“The “Urumaya” Program was implemented in this country in 2002 and 2003 but was halted by a court decision.”

“The government took the land from the people to build the Kotmale Reservoir and the Theldeniya Reservoir, relocating those affected to these areas,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.

Ramanathan was elected to the seat largely by the votes of the Sinhalese. Admittedly, he was a brilliant speaker and had held the high office of Solicitor-General. He defeated Sir Marcus Fernando, a distinguished physician and a man of rare ability in many fields.

The 125th Anniversary of the birth of Ramanathan will fall on Friday April 16, 1976. As a young man he was a hard-working lawyer who was nominated a member of the Legislative Council at the age of 28 to succeed his uncle Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy as the ‘Tamil member’. He had to give up his seat when he was appointed Solicitor-General.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank was a net seller in forex markets in June 2024, official data shows, data shows after a build-up of excess liquidity from dollar purchases up to May.

The central bank sold 57 million US dollars to banks in June and did not buy any dollars, data shows, after buying 224.5 million US dollars and selling 32 million dollars in May.

There was a build-up of excess liquidity up to 200 billion rupees after dollar purchases in April and May.

When there is higher import demand, usually due a pick up in private or state enterprise credit or both, the flexible exchange rate slides triggering a confidence shock in both importers and exporters.
