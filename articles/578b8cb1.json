    "Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody says all employees notified to express their views within two months; stresses process is legal requirement and not move by Govt. to pressure workers",
    "Announces Govt. opted to offer more favourable package, extending Rs. 5 m VRS to all employees without discrimination",
    "Criticises certain trade unions, questioning whether their actions truly represented employee welfare or politically motivated",
    "Energy Minister Eng. Kumara Jayakody yesterday assured that the Government\u2019s restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will not undermine employee job security or labour rights, despite trade union concerns and ongoing protest threats.",
    "Addressing the media, the Minister explaining the reforms noted that the CEB currently consists of four key institutions \u2014 Generation, Transmission, Distribution, and Systems Administration \u2013 staffed by around 23,000 employees and fully State-owned under the licencing and regulatory oversight of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).",
    "\u201cIn addition, the CEB operates a retirement fund, the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and a separate funding company, where staff from the four core institutions are now being considered for redeployment,\u201d he added.",
    "The Minister noted that all employees have been officially notified and invited to express their views within two months, stressing that the process is a legal requirement and not a move by the Ministry or the Government to pressure workers.",
    "Jayakody pointed out that as per the existing and approved Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) includes compensation capped at Rs. 5 million for senior employees and Rs. 2.5 million for others. However, he said the Government has opted to offer a more favourable package in line with employee preferences. \u201cAfter considering the new reforms, the Government has decided to extend the compensation with Rs. 5 million for all employees keen on the VRS, as all employees are equally important to us,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister also said there is no pressure on workers, adding that they have been given two months to respond. \u201cWe did not and will never force anyone to like or dislike the VRS. Don\u2019t get carried away with false information,\u201d he added.",
    "Although a past Cabinet decision to cut 12,000 jobs at the CEB remains on record, Jayakody clarified that this has not been included in the present reform package. Instead, the restructuring is aimed at reducing inefficiencies, cutting dependence on expensive liquid-fuel power generation, and positioning the CEB to attract international financing, particularly from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).",
    "The Minister also criticised certain trade unions, questioning whether their actions truly represented employee welfare or were politically motivated. \u201cThey must be asked clearly if they represent the employees for their welfare, or if they just work for political parties to jeopardise the work at State institutions,\u201d he claimed.",
    "Despite Government assurances, trade unions have threatened protests over the reforms passed in Parliament last month. The action, led by the CEB Engineers\u2019 Union (CEBEU) and allied groups, follows an 11-day \u201cwork-to-rule\u201d campaign launched on 4 September.",
    "All trade unions of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) yesterday announced that they have intensified their strike action against the proposed division of the CEB into four parts.",
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers\u2019 Union (CEBEU), along with other affiliated unions, had initially decided to implement the strike in three phases. The first phase was initiated as a \u2018work-to-rule\u2019 trade union action.",
    "Although 11 days have passed since the strike commenced on 4 September, the CEBEU stated that the authorities have so far failed to engage in discussions to resolve their concerns.",
    "The Union further stated that it will make an announcement regarding the next phase and potential intensification of the strike following trade union discussions yesterday afternoon."
