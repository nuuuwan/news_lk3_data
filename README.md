இந்த சம்பவங்கள் நேபாள அரசியலில் பெரும் அதிர்வலைகளை ஏற்படுத்தியுள்ளன, மேலும் புதிய பிரதமர் சுஷிலா கார்கியின் தலைமையில் நாட்டின் நிலைமை எவ்வாறு மாறும் என்பதை மக்கள் கவனத்துடன் பார்க்கிறார்கள்.

The protest was sparked by a social media ban that has since been rolled back. The violence subsided only after Oli resigned on Tuesday.

Albania’s leader said Friday his new cabinet will include an artificial intelligence “minister” that will be in charge of running public funding projects and fighting corruption in public tenders.

Prime Minister Edi Rama said Diella, whose name means “Sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence.”

Rama said Diella would help ensure that “public tenders will be 100% free of corruption.”

Diella was launched earlier this year as a virtual assistant on the e-Albania public service platform, where she helps users navigate the site while wearing traditional Albanian folk costume.

Rama’s Socialist Party secured a fourth consecutive term after winning 83 of the 140 Assembly seats in the May 11 parliamentary elections. The party can govern alone and pass most legislation, but it needs a two-thirds majority, or 93 seats, to change the Constitution.
