    "Speaking to The Island Financial Review, Sustainable Ocean Alliance Sri Lanka spokesman Sudarsha De Silva said that the total commitments now reached an unprecedented USD 12.8 billion, with 31 countries contributing, and additional pledges anticipated in future.",
    "De Silva said furthermore, eight donor governments disclosed new commitments exceeding USD 174 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund and Special Climate Change Fund.
