### Donald Trump to impose 100% tariffs on films made outside US, threatens levy on furniture

*2025-09-29 19:23:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/113041/donald-trump-to-impose-100-tariffs-on-films-made-outside-us-threatens-levy-on-furniture) · `en`

US President Donald Trump said on Monday (Sep 29) he would impose a 100 per cent tariff on all foreign-made movies, an unprecedented move that threatens to upend Hollywood’s global business model.

The step signals Trump’s willingness to extend protectionist trade policies into cultural industries, raising uncertainty for studios that depend heavily on international box-office revenue and cross-border co-productions.

Trump announced the measure in a post on his Truth Social platform, claiming US movie-making is losing ground to international competition.

“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing candy from a baby,” he wrote.

However, it was not immediately clear what legal authority Trump would use to impose a 100 per cent tariff on foreign-made films.

### Oil prices drop 1% on expected global supply growth

Oil prices fell by more than 1 per cent on Monday as OPEC+ plans for another increase to oil output in November and the resumption of oil exports by Iraq’s Kurdistan region via Turkey raised the global supply outlook.

Brent crude futures dropped $1.01, or 1.4 per cent, to $69.12 a barrel by 1019 GMT after settling at their highest since July 31 on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down $1.11, or 1.7 per cent, at $64.61.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, is likely to approve another increase to crude oil production at its meeting on Sunday.

The group is expected to confirm an increase of at least 137,000 barrels per day for November as rising oil prices encourage efforts to regain market share, said three sources.

However, OPEC+ has been pumping almost 500,000 bpd less than its targets, defying market expectations of a supply glut.

### Violence against Mannar people

*2025-09-29 17:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226435) · `ta`

The oppressive violence against the people fighting for their existence in Mannar is the blatant manifestation of state terrorism that has once again staged on the Tamil people.. Said Srikanta.

He made this statement at a media briefing held at a private guest hotel on Mattin Road, Jaffna.

If the government did not accept the real justice struggle of the people against the Mannar wind power plant, it should have legally arrested the people involved if it was illegal.

But the state has no power to attack them and cause injuries.

In this context, the state -led government is in office for a year, we consider this wild darbar that is an example of the attitude of the government when the democratic struggles against the state are expanding.

And no one who respects the fundamental rights of the people can accept democracy to recognize or recognize this ritual.

Minister of State for Foreign and Foreign Employment Arun Hemachandra said that we have launched a monthly financial assistance program for the education of the children of diaspora workers through the Presidential Fund.

He said this while commenting on the student scholarship provided by the President's Fund to the education of the children of the diaspora workers.

As part of the political changes that have taken place since the new government came to power, we have launched a program to provide student scholarships to the children of migrant workers through the Presidential Fund.. The President's Fund is one of the people who need. It is not a boon.

Currently that era is over. At this time, there is a number of benefits to the people, and we see that there are many benefits to the people.

Moody’s Ratings on Monday affirmed the Government of India’s long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings and the local-currency senior unsecured rating at Baa3. The ratings agency also affirmed India’s other short-term local-currency rating at P-3. The outlook remains stable.

“The rating affirmation and stable outlook reflect our view that India’s prevailing credit strengths, including its large, fast-growing economy, sound external position and stable domestic financing base for ongoing fiscal deficits, will be sustained,” it said.

These strengths lend resilience to adverse external trends, in particular as high US (Aa1 stable) tariffs and other international policy measures hinder India’s capacity to attract manufacturing investment, it added. India’s credit strengths are balanced by long-standing weaknesses on the fiscal side, which will remain.
