Sri Lankan banks’ operating environment (OE) assessment and overall credit profiles will be supported by any improvement in the sovereign’s credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: RD, Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) following a completed debt restructuring, says Fitch Ratings.

“This is due to the strong link between sovereign financial health and banks’ operating conditions. We believe this would be positive for the National Ratings of Fitch-rated large Sri Lankan banks – albeit based on their creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers,” the rating agency said.

Sri Lankan banks’ current OE score of ‘ccc-’/stable is linked closely to the sovereign’s local-currency credit profile, given their predominant exposure to the domestic economy and government securities (local-currency treasury instruments: 33.4% of assets and foreign currency instruments: 3.4% at end-1H24) and lending to the broader public sector.

### Sri Lanka revealed as most popular solo travel destination for 2025

The appeal is clear, says Flash Pack: “Sri Lanka packs in all the punch of India – only on a smaller, more accessible scale, and delivered at a much slower pace.” The company highlights diverse experiences from “incense-swirled cities, buzzing with tuk tuks” to “misty highlands steeped in tea plantations” and dramatic coastlines.

“But where Sri Lanka really comes into its own,” the company adds, “is its easy-going balance of beaches, spoiling hotels and restorative, delicately spiced food.”
