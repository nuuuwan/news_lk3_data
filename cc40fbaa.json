    "Unimo Enterprises Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of United Motors Lanka PLC, recently introduced its locally assembled commercial truck JMC N720.",
    "The unveiling of the JMC N720 truck took place at the recently held \u201cIndustry Exhibition 2023\u201d, an event organized by the Industrial Development Board (IDB), held at the BMICH. Dignitaries present at the occasion included the Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Industries, Ramesh Pathirana and officials from the Ministry of Industry, representatives from the IDB and representatives from Unimo Enterprises.",
    "The newly launched JMC N720 is a brand new truck that addresses a significant demand in the market. With the current ban on imports, truck buyers were made to purchase used trucks which lead to many issues in running their business efficiently. The JMC N720 provides an ideal investment opportunity for individuals seeking to purchase a brand new truck ensuring reliability and eliminates the uncertainties associated with buying used vehicles. The brand \u201cJMC\u201d has proven itself as a reliable vehicle among both corporate and individual customers with over 1700 units operating in the country.",
    "The truck has a payload of 3 tones and is equipped with a proven 2771cc diesel engine coupled to a 5 forward gearbox providing ample power and efficiency. Truck is fitted with an aluminum body and has a cargo deck length of 12 feet. The truck comes equipped with power steering, air conditioning, radio/MP3/USB and central locking as standard equipment.",
    "With the Sri Lankan consumer as the central focus, the recently introduced JMC N720 will be a great asset to the local business community. In light of the economic crisis causing disruptions in vehicle imports, it becomes crucial for private companies to step up and ensure the uninterrupted flow of daily operations. Unimo will provide its proven after sales services through its 7 workshops strategically located across the island ensuring all maintenance and repair needs are met in any part of the country.",
