    "Says party has not selected Perera but his name was among few others being considered for candidacy",
    "Claims party however has not made a final decision yet and chosen candidate will be announced later",
    "Stresses party will name a candidate who it believes will be capable of rebuilding SL",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary Sagara Kariya-wasam yesterday claimed that prominent businessman and MP Dhammika Perera has requested the party to name him as its Presidential Candidate.",
    "Addressing a press conference, Kariyawasam said the party has not officially named Perera as its candidate for the upcoming poll but he was being considered along with three to four other nominations. \u201cBut he is definitely among these names. He has also expressed his interest. He will not be disregarded,\u201d he said.",
    "Kariyawasm made this statement in response to a question posed regarding media reports which claimed the party had picked Perera to contest at the Presidential Election under the SLPP ticket after he was seen attending the party\u2019s National Convention on 15 December. Perera was seen seated a mere two seats down from SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Rumours were also fuelled by reports indicating that the National Organiser post of the party, formerly held by Basil Rajapaksa, remained vacant while all other office bearer positions were filled recently.",
    "\u201cI cannot say these reports are either true or false. The reason is that as a party we are yet to decide who the Presidential Candidate will be,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Kariya-wasam, the party will name a candidate who it believes will be capable of rebuilding the country and taking it forward. \u201cWe will inform the public when it is decided,\u201d Kariywasam said.",
    "According to Kriyawasam, the formal declaration of the party\u2019s selected candidate for the 2024 Presidential election is anticipated to be disclosed closer to the election date."
