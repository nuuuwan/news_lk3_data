    "Referring to his recent statement made in Parliament that he would resign from his ministerial role if the necessary funds for purchasing medicines are not received, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said he would not quit as relevant funds have been allocated.",
    "Speaking to Daily Mirror, Rambukwella said,\u201d We had a meeting with the officials of the Treasury on the day itself I made this statement in Parliament where the funds to procure drugs and other critical medical equipment were guaranteed.\u201d",
    "\"As adequate funds have been allocated, there is no need for me to resign,\u201d he stressed.",
    "However, the Minister said some media had misinterpreted what he had said in Parliament. \u201cWhat I said was if funds are not received, hanging on to positions is not worth,\u201d he stated.",
    "When inquired about the drug shortage, he said about 100 drugs are not available at present; however, plans are afoot to address the shortage of drugs with the release of necessary funds. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
