    "OrphanCare, an independent Trust dedicated to supporting orphaned children and Colombo\u2019s renowned bakery establishment PaanPaan have joined hands in a transformative collaboration, aiming to uplift the lives of orphaned youth in Sri Lanka.",
    "Marking a ground-breaking initiative in local philanthropy, the partnership signifies an important step towards creating a positive impact on the lives of orphans as they transit from their care homes to adulthood.",
    "PaanPaan\u2019s unique approach involves donating a fixed amount for every loaf of their renowned Kade Paan sold, in support of OrphanCare\u2019s mission. This support is poised to create meaningful opportunities for orphaned children, facilitating access to education, skills development, and a brighter future. The partnership between OrphanCare and PaanPaan is not only a commendable move but also a strategic one. By dedicating a specific percentage of proceeds from their bread sales, PaanPaan showcases its unwavering commitment to furthering the Trust\u2019s efforts in empowering orphaned youth.",
    "\u201cThe heart of PaanPaan lies not just in crafting delicious bread but in nourishing our community,\u201d said PaanPaan\u2019s Director, Aboo Yusoof .\u201cBy partnering with OrphanCare, we are honoured to contribute to a cause that aligns with our core values of compassion and community engagement. All customers who purchase a loaf of KadePaan are contributing towards making a tangible difference in the lives of these young souls,\u201d he added.",
    "OrphanCare Head Azad Zaheed said: \u201cAt OrphanCare, our mission has always been to create a nurturing environment where orphaned children can avoid a second abandonment. We are profoundly grateful for the slice of kindness extended by PaanPaan, a visionary organisation that shares our dedication to creating positive change. Together, we aspire to touch the lives of these children and offer them a promising future.\u201d",
    "Established with Amana Bank as the founding sponsor, a notable feature of this initiative is that Amana Bank ensures that every donated rupee directly reaches the intended beneficiaries since all administrative and operational costs are fully borne by the Bank.",
    "The OrphanCare Trust is administered by a team of trustees who have a track record of passionate social service and includes the Trust Chairman, Ruzly Hussain (Founder of the Rotaract movement in Sri Lanka),\u00a0 Secretary P. Shireen Watson, Treasurer Jazri Magdon Ismail (Past President AAT), Deshabandu Tilak de Zoysa (Chairman Helpage Sri Lanka) Deshabandu Tilak de Zoysa, Harsha Amarasekera PC\u00a0 \u00a0 Chairman, Board of Trustees of Rotary Foundation USA and former President Rotary International, KR Ravindran, Sharad Amalean (Co-Founder MAS Holdings), Osman Kassim (Founder Chairman Am\u00e3na Bank), Tyeab Akbarally (Senior Director Akbar Brothers) and Mohamed Azmeer (Managing Director/CEO Am\u00e3na Bank).
