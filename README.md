ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka is expecting mission from the International Monetary Fund in two weeks, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told a campaign rally.

“In two weeks when the IMF team comes, we have to say that we will implement the agreement and to give the next instalment,” President Wickremesinghe told a rally in Homagama Wednesday.

*2024-09-19 05:49:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/us-federal-reserve-cut-rates-50pb-quantity-tightening-to-continue-179980/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The US Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points to target an overnight rate of 4.75/5.00 percent, with Chair Jerome Powell saying inflation and employment was balanced.

“Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” Powell told reporters after the rate cut.

“As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished and the downside risks to employment have increased.

“We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.”

The Fed’s ‘dual mandate’ is blamed for the current high inflation as well as the 1970s collapse of the Bretton Woods system and subsequent Great Inflation.

### IHP reveals election-eve MRP Presidential voting intent estimates

IHP’s SLOTS MRP estimates using interviews conducted to 13 September indicate that Anura      Dissanayake would have won the Presidential election on a count of second preference votes  if the Presidential election had been held in early September.

In the MRP estimates of the views of all adults, Anura Dissayanake led with 48%, followed by Sajith Premadasa on 25%, Ranil Wickremesinghe on 20%, and Namal Rajapaksa on 5%. These estimates were associated with a margin of error of 3–6% for the three leading candidates. The latest IHP MRP modelling indicates that there was a strong surge in favour of Anura Dissanayake since July, when he briefly trailed Sajith Premadasa in voter preferences.

These MRP estimates are based on a substantially revised MRP model (version 4.0) that is still in beta testing. Data came from 20,714 interviews conducted from 31 August 2021 to 13 September 2024, including 541 interviews conducted in September 2024.

### Elite establishment’s last stand

*2024-09-19 02:17:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Elite-establishment-s-last-stand/4-766866) · `en`

It was always going to come to this. The first Sri Lankan election in generations where even a remotely leftist party stood a chance of winning was always going to end with an almighty Red Scare. So it is that the presidential campaign of National People’s Power (NPP) candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is inspiring lurid visions of an impending violent, dystopian regime, splayed across news and social media. This is the prophecy of the Sri Lankan elite establishment, a select cross section of the country’s businesspeople, policymakers, professionals, journalists and academics who have been proximate to state power, especially in the last two years. Scrutiny of them and their crescendoing hysteria reveals much about how power and privilege work in Sri Lanka, and what happens when their wielders are threatened.

### Economic stakes of the 2024 Presidential election

As Sri Lanka gears up for elections, policymakers must avoid rash economic promises that risk a decade of lost growth and an era of relative decline.

As too often in the past, Sri Lanka appears not to have broken its damaging tendency towards ‘competitive populism’ ahead of elections. Fiscally profligate promises ranging from wage increases to loan write-offs and welfare handouts are being made in a bid to win votes. Such pledges often come with a hefty price tag that the country can ill afford, especially given its still fragile economic recovery.
