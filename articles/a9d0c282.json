  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly opposed the UK, Canada, and Australia\u2019s move to recognise Palestine and said that there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the Jordan River. In a strongly worded statement published in PMO, condemning the move, PM Netanyahu vowed to give a response to countries after his US visit.",
    "\u201cThere will be no Palestinian state. The response to the latest attempt to force upon us a terror state in the heart of our land will be given after my return from the United States,\u201d Netanyahu said. Netanyahu alleged that by recognising Palestine, they are \u201crewarding terror with an enormous prize,\u201d expressing his determination not to let this happen.",
    "\u201cI have a clear message to those leaders who are recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrendous October 7 massacre: You are rewarding terror with an enormous prize. And I have another message for you: It\u2019s not going to happen. There will be no Palestinian state to the west of the Jordan River. For years I have prevented the creation of that terror state, against tremendous pressure, both domestic and from abroad,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe have done this with determination, and with astute statesmanship. Moreover, we have doubled the Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria, and we will continue on this path,\u201d he added. Australia, Canada and the UK, in a coordinated effort, recognised the Palestinian State on Sunday, calling for a two-state solution.",
    "However, the triad said that Hamas must cease its existence immediately. \u201cAustralia formally recognises the independent and sovereign State of Palestine. In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,\u201d Australian Prime Minister\u2019s Office stated in a statement.",
    "The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned the action by the countries, stating that it would jeopardise the security in the region and is contrary to what it sought to achieve. \u201cIsrael categorically rejects the one-sided declaration of the recognition of a Palestinian state made by the United Kingdom and some other countries. This declaration does not promote peace, but on the contrary - further destabilizes the region and undermines the chances of achieving a peaceful solution in the future. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement."
