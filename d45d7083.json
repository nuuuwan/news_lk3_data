    "AIA renewed the partnership with and continues to support the Sri Lanka Cancer Society for the 5th year. With a steadfast commitment to helping people live healthier, longer, better lives, AIA continues to donate LKR 100 on behalf of every new policy sold since 2019, to the Sri Lanka Cancer Society.",
    "The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in this regard was signed between AIA CEO Chathuri Munaweera and Cancer Society Chairperson Anoja Karunaratne, at the Cancer Society Annual General Meeting, held earlier this year.",
    "Over the years, AIA\u2019s donations have played a crucial role in supporting the Cancer Society\u2019s mission in Sri Lanka. These funds are dedicated for the provision of care and solace to needy cancer patients and increasing awareness on the prevention and treatment of cancer, which is a growing health concern in the country. In fact, Non-Communicable Diseases such as Cancer continues to pose a substantial threat accounting for over 80% of deaths in Sri Lanka, which is well above the global rate of 74%.",
