    "The CII comprises of a group of leading civil society organisations, activists, and cross party political representatives, who came together in the aftermath of the aragalaya to promote national policies focused on social cohesion, economic inclusion, transparency and accountability, and inclusive political participation.",
    "In addition to the recently concluded forums in Matara and Kurunegala, CII also held town hall style forum with local community leaders in Jaffna on 26 October and in Kandy on 27 October.",
    "The event in Nuwara Eliya will\u00a0 be on 1 November, Monaragala on 2 November, Batticaloa on 3 November, Gampaha on 9 November, and Colombo on 10 November.",
    "Each event will focus on district specific issues, giving citizens the opportunity to engage with Parliamentary candidates and discuss topics vital to their communities.",
    "Keeping with its non-partisan approach CII has extended invitations to candidates from all major parties but owing to scheduling conflicts and the limited space within the campaign period it cannot assure participation from all major parties."
