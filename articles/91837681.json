    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala announced that drug-related raids will be carried out by alternative police divisions if the designated local units fail to act on credible intelligence.The Minister emphasized that Sri Lanka\u2019s drug crisis is evolving, with recent revelations confirming that synthetic narcotics like \u201cice\u201d are now being produced domestically, not just trafficked from countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Iran.\u00a0This shift has prompted a more aggressive and coordinated response from national authorities.\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that when information is given to the police, it ends up in the hands of the traffickers,\u201d the Minister said. \u201cWe are putting an end to that belief.\u201dAccording to Wijepala, police operations have intensified, with 22 metric tons of narcotics seized in the past year, alongside the recovery of over 2,000 illegal firearms.\u00a0The Minister made it clear that police divisions failing to act on intelligence will be bypassed, with other units instructed to carry out the necessary raids.\u201cWhen two or three successful operations are conducted by external units,\u201d he said, \u201cthe local officer-in-charge will have to ask themselves whether they still deserve that chair.\u201d"
