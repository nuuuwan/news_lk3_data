    "Fourteen people have died in Taiwan\u2019s popular tourist hub in the eastern county of Hualien, with 124 missing after a barrier lake in the mountains overflowed to deluge a town during a typhoon, the fire department said on Wednesday.",
    "Taiwan has been lashed since Monday by the outer rim of Super Typhoon Ragasa, now hitting China\u2019s southern coast and the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong.",
    "The barrier lake, formed by landslides triggered by earlier heavy rain in the island\u2019s sparsely populated east, burst its banks on Tuesday afternoon to send a wall of water into the township of Guangfu.",
    "The water hit like a \u201ctsunami\u201d, said a Guangfu postman who gave his family name of Hsieh, though he was able to flee to the second floor of the post office just in time. Later, he got home to find his car had been swept into the living-room.",
    "Fire officials said all the dead and missing were in Guangfu, where the waters swept away a major road bridge across a river.",
    "Wang Tse-an said his entire village of Dama, home to about 1,000 people in the township, had been flooded and many were still stranded.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s chaotic now,\u201d Wang, the village chief, told Reuters, adding that the most important task was to get people to safety in shelters, while supplies could not get through.",
    "\u201cThere are mud and rocks everywhere. Some flooding has subsided but some remains.\u201d",
    "Regions across Taiwan have dispatched rescue teams to Hualien, with the military sending 340 troops to help.",
    "In Guangfu, soldiers operating from an armoured personnel carrier to avoid the thick mud on the streets went door-to-door handing out water and instant noodles.",
    "Resources were insufficient to help relocate those with disabilities, said Lamen Panay, a Hualien councillor, who added that government evacuation requests before the flood had not been mandatory.",
    "\u201cWhen warnings were issued, the central and local government said people could evacuate vertically, but what we were facing wasn\u2019t something \u2018vertical evacuation\u2019 could resolve,\u201d she said, referring to guidance for people to head to higher floors.",
    "About 5,200 people, or about 60% of Guangfu\u2019s population, sought shelter on the higher floors of their own homes while most of the rest left to stay with their families, government data showed.",
    "The government estimated the barrier lake contained 91 million tonnes of water, enough to fill about 36,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools and the equivalent of a major reservoir in southern Taiwan.",
    "The lake overflowed to release about 60 million tonnes of water, the government said.",
    "China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office offered condolence in a rare sign of goodwill from Beijing, which has a deep dislike of Taipei\u2019s government.",
    "China views Taiwan as its own territory, despite the strong objections of the island\u2019s democratically-elected government.",
    "Hualien\u2019s wilderness beauty makes it one of Taiwan\u2019s top tourist draws. It is also home to many members of the island\u2019s indigenous groups, including the Amis.",
    "The typhoon brought about 70 cm (28 inches) of rain to Taiwan\u2019s east, though the populous west coast, home to the crucial semiconductor industry, was not affected.",
    "In 2009, Typhoon Morakot cut a swathe of destruction through Taiwan\u2019s south, killing about 700 and causing damage of up to $3 billion."
