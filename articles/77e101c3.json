    "Ceylon Energy, in partnership with HJT China, has announced the successful completion of the Maho and Ampara 33kV power distribution lines. These milestones mark a significant achievement within the broader Supporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project (SESRIP), a groundbreaking initiative designed to revolutionize energy distribution across Sri Lanka.",
    "SESRIP is a transformative electrification project, addressing the energy needs of some of Sri Lanka\u2019s most underserved regions. Covering an expansive 2,372 kilometers of low-voltage line extensions and incorporating 106 rural electrification schemes, the project represents a vital step toward ensuring reliable energy access across the nation. With a total length exceeding 270 kilometers and 13, 33kV switching gantries, SESRIP is set to provide dependable electricity to over 35,000 households, including those in the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces, as well as the Uva and North Central provinces, where electrification levels lag behind the rest of the country.",
    "At the core of SESRIP\u2019s mission is the enhancement of the medium-voltage network, which will significantly improve the quality and reliability of electricity supply to more than 493,000 consumers. This initiative is not just about expanding infrastructure; it\u2019s about fostering inclusivity, ensuring that all Sri Lankans, regardless of their location, have access to stable and reliable energy. Moreover, SESRIP aims to integrate renewable energy sources from various locations into the national grid, thereby reducing distribution power losses and contributing to the nation\u2019s sustainability goals. The SESRI project is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with a total investment of USD 42 million. Ceylon Energy and HJT China have been instrumental in bringing this ambitious project to life, showcasing their commitment to driving positive change and sustainable development across Sri Lanka.",
