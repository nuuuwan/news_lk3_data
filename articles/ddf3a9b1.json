The planned establishment of an R&D and testing facility by the Industrial Development Board (IDB) indicates a commitment to innovation and quality assurance within the industry, to further enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness in the global automotive market.

Sri Lankan companies with the IATF certification will have greater acceptance and trust from global brands for automobile assembly.\u00a0 \u201cThe consistent and collaborative policy of the Government is greatly appreciated by the automotive assembly industry. Global brands are also keen to invest in Sri Lanka because the country lies astride major supply chains linking trade between the east and west. More and more Sri Lankan consumers are also showing a preference for locally assembled vehicles. This is a great boost to the industry as it further creates engineering and technical-related jobs,\u201d Jayawardena said.",
