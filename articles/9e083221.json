  "original_body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); During the 41st meeting of the 60th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Sri Lanka formally rejected the resolution A/HRC/60/L.1/Rev.1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in the country. Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition, the resolution was adopted without a vote, supported by a coalition of 30 nations.",
    "The resolution, initially tabled on September 10 by the Sri Lanka Core Group\u2014consisting of Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and the United Kingdom\u2014was presented in revised form on October 1 by a broader coalition including Albania, Austria, Costa Rica, several European countries, New Zealand, and more. It calls on Sri Lanka to devolve political authority as mandated by its constitution, hold provincial council elections especially in the northern and eastern provinces, and ensure these bodies function effectively.",
    "Central to the resolution is a demand for thorough and impartial investigations into human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law, with full participation of victims and their representatives. It also urges the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, highlighting continued detentions under the law that disproportionately affect Tamil and Muslim communities, and calls for reforms to the Online Safety Act to protect freedom of expression.",
    "The United Kingdom praised Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments while urging them to convert promises into tangible actions, emphasizing the need for exhumations of mass graves, independent prosecution mechanisms, and an end to surveillance of human rights defenders. The UK representative expressed hope for the resolution\u2019s adoption without a vote.",
    "In contrast, the Chinese representative praised Sri Lanka\u2019s human rights progress and economic recovery, reaffirming support for its sovereignty and political stability. China opposed the resolution, describing the related mandate as ineffective and announcing its disassociation from the consensus.",
    "Other countries echoed varied positions: The Republic of Korea and Japan welcomed the government\u2019s reform efforts and supported the resolution\u2019s adoption by consensus. Gulf Cooperation Council member states highlighted Sri Lanka\u2019s social and legislative reform progress, stressing sovereignty and national ownership. Ethiopia and Cuba opposed external mandates, urging respect for national sovereignty and non-interference.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva criticized the extension of the OHCHR\u2019s external evidence-gathering mechanism, deeming it unprecedented and counterproductive to genuine domestic reconciliation efforts. Sri Lanka emphasized its commitment to national institutions to address past violations, calling for the resolution\u2019s rejection.",
    "Following the debate, the UN Human Rights Council President announced the resolution\u2019s adoption without a vote."
