  "original_body_lines": [
    "Minister of Trade, Consumer Affairs and Food Safety Nalin Fernando stressed that according to the existing price formula, the two LP gas companies should sell gas at the same prices and that legal action would be taken if this requirement is violated.",
    "He told the media that Litro Gas had taken steps to reduce its price but Laugfs Gas had not, and that he received complaints in this regard from the public and several organizations.",
    "\u201cThe difference of prices of a cylinder of domestic LP gas of the two companies is Rs. 708 which is an enormous difference. I had talks with the management of Laugfs Gas in this regard. They expressed diverse views. However, I advised them to reduce the prices soon to be on par with the prices of the other. The two companies should adhere to the price formula issued by the Ministry of Finance or else that company would be liable to legal action. Laugfs Gas has promised to show a positive response to this by Monday (24), the Minister said.",
    "He further said it was his duty to supply gas to the consumer at the barest minimum price. (P.H.P. Perera)"
