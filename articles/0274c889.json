    "JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) conducted a survey through \u201cProject for Strengthening Plastic Management Capacity\u201d launched in September 2023 on the current situations of plastic waste management, which was not grasped in the past. The main findings of the survey so far are summarized as below, while the survey will continue with more samples to improve its accuracy.",
    "\u2013 Plastic waste accounts for about 10% of the waste collected by local authorities, out of which about 70% is packaging plastic such as single-use plastic (SUP) shopping bags (40%) and lunch sheets (10%) (Western Province, weight basis).",
    "\u2013 The 49 recycling facilities surveyed nationwide have overall capacity to recycle 152 tons of plastic per day; however, the actual amount recycled is only around 100 tons per day. In addition to PET, PP (polypropylene, such as plastic chairs, sorted e-waste, household items, etc.) and PE (polyethylene, such as HDPE bottles, polysacks, LDPE household containers, plastic bags, etc.) are largely recycled.",
    "\u2013 The survey of public opinions on SUP in Western Province revealed that, except for shopping bags and lunch sheets, more than half of the respondents believe that SUPs are replaceable and unnecessary.",
