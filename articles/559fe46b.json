  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says tax of Rs. 65 per kilo on imported rice, which raises price from Rs. 150 to Rs. 230, has burdened consumers",
    "Points out Govt. has failed to eliminate the \u201crice mafia,\u201d despite earlier promises",
    "Accuses Govt. of favouring large-scale rice mill owners over consumers and farmers",
    "Alleges Govt. has implemented policies that harm ordinary citizens while benefitting capitalist class",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman has called on the Government to remove the Rs. 65 tax imposed on imported rice, leaving consumers struggling. Addressing a press conference yesterday, Rahman raised concerns over the ongoing rice shortage in Sri Lanka and criticised the Government\u2019s handling of the crisis.",
    "Rahman acknowledged the Government\u2019s decision to import rice to address the shortage caused by insufficient local production. However, he highlighted that despite the imports, rice remains unavailable at a reasonable price in many shops, leaving consumers struggling to access this staple food.",
    "Rahman accused the Government of failing to deliver on its promise to resolve the rice crisis and pointed to the imposition of a hefty tax of Rs. 65 per kilo on imported rice. He said that while the price of imported rice from India is Rs. 150 per kilo, the Government has raised the price to Rs. 230 after adding the tax. \u201cThe tax burden falls entirely on the consumers, who must pay 45% of the price of a kilo of rice as tax. Rice is not a luxury item, yet the Government has imposed an unjustifiable tax, profiting billions of rupees from the very people it claims to serve,\u201d Rahman said.",
    "He also criticised the Government for failing to eliminate the so-called \u201crice mafia,\u201d despite promises from the President and other officials. \u201cThe Government has instead aligned itself with large-scale rice mill owners, prioritising their interests over those of ordinary citizens and farmers,\u201d he alleged. Rahman drew attention to past practices, noting that previous administrations limited the import tax on rice to a maximum of Rs. 10 to ensure affordability for consumers. In contrast, he said the current Government, led by the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), has imposed an unprecedented Rs. 65 tax per kilo, claiming it would stabilise the market while benefitting certain businessmen close to the administration.",
    "The MP further criticised the Government for failing to correct the mistakes of previous administrations, despite its election promises to do so. \u201cThe NPP Government has betrayed the citizenry it vowed to represent, imposing higher taxes on rice than even the capitalist regimes of the past,\u201d he said.",
    "Rahman called on the Government to immediately remove the Rs. 65 tax on imported rice, arguing that it unfairly burdens consumers and benefits only large-scale mill owners.",
    "\u201cThis crisis highlights the need for genuine reforms to support the people, not policies that enrich a select few at the expense of the majority,\u201d he stressed."
