    "\u201cIn these difficult times, it is vital that we have leaders in Parliament who know how to handle an economic crisis. Whether you are in the opposition or part of the government, without this experience, you will fail to meet the country\u2019s goals,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",

    "\u201cA portion of those MPs and UNP officials who worked with me are now joining together in this election under the \u2018New Democratic Front\u2019. With their experience and dedication, they will ensure the success of this new parliamentary term,\u201d he added.",
