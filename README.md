A former Royal Australian Air Force King Air 350 arrived in Sri Lanka on October 24 following a ferry flight from Australia.

The aircraft, A32-673, was earmarked for donation to the Sri Lankan Air Force in May 2023. It will be supported in Sri Lanka for 12 months by Australia, before responsibility is turned over to the Sri Lankan Air Force.

It will be used to perform maritime domain awareness missions by the Sri Lankan Air Force, complementing a King Air 360ER provided by the US Government in early October.

A32-673 was fitted with an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance pod before delivery to the Sri Lankan Air Force.

In 2023, fourteen years after handing its four Beechcraft 350 Super King Air aircraft to Air Force, the Australian Army once again decided it needs a fixed-wing support capability.

### Sivaram: The government of President Anura Kumara, who has ordered a re -inquiry into the brutal kidnapping and murder

*2024-10-25 10:18:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197057) ┬╖ `ta`

Thank you for providing such detailed information about Sivaram, also known as Taraki. This appears to be a comprehensive biography of his life, covering his early years, education, involvement in politics and militancy, transition to journalism, and eventual tragic fate. 



Some key points that stood out:



1. Sivaram was born in 1959 and grew up in a Tamil elite family in the east of Sri Lanka.



2. He initially joined the LTTE but was rejected, then joined PLOTE and received military training in India.



3. He became involved in politics and military strategy teaching within PLOTE.



4. In 1989, he transitioned to journalism, starting as a contributor to The Island magazine under the pseudonym Taraki.



5. His articles sparked controversy and interest due to his deep knowledge of North-Eastern conflicts.



6. He faced threats and intimidation as a journalist, particularly related to his coverage of the Theraputtapaya Balakaya incident.



7. Sivaram was assassinated in 2005 at the age of 46.



It's remarkable how his journey took him from being involved in armed struggle to becoming a prominent journalist covering those very conflicts. His work undoubtedly shed light on important issues affecting Sri Lanka during his time.



Is there anything specific about Sivaram's life or legacy you'd like me to expand upon?

ЁЯЯй

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has often urged the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake that he will resume investigations into the massive corruption scandals and massacres that have been blocked or disrupted by those who have been in power in the past.

Recent events show that President Dissanayake and his government are concerned about their election promises. In this regard, they have begun to take the next step.

As the government has begun to take firm measures to ensure justice in these issues, the electoral opportunities of the ruling national people will be bright.

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appealed for not politicizing the survival Sunday attacks

He issued a special report and said that the AMJDA Alvis Report was not prepared to avenge the current Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security Ravi Seneviratne nor Shanani Abayasekara, former director of the Cijadi.

I received the report during the presidential election, but the former president said that I did not make the report public because of the lack of intention to relate the resurrection Sunday attack with politics.
