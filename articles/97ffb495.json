    "Forecasting geopolitics has been George Friedman\u2019s life\u2019s work; a historian renowned for his foresight into global shifts. In an era of global volatility, I had the opportunity to sit down with Friedman to discuss current world affairs, focusing on major powers such as the United States, Russia, and China. Notably, this was the first time he shared his insights on Sri Lanka, exploring its future in the context of a changing global landscape. As the founder of Geopolitical Futures and former chairman of Stratfor, Friedman\u2019s experience and knowledge provided a comprehensive view of how global powers are shifting.",
    "During our discussion, Friedman highlighted the surprising ways in which power dynamics have evolved, even beyond his own earlier predictions. Russia, deeply entangled in a prolonged war with Ukraine, and China, grappling with economic stagnation, have both faltered. In contrast, the United States, despite forecasts of decline, has reasserted itself with remarkable strength. According to Friedman, this resurgence is less about traditional hegemony and more about the unmatched economic and military power that the US continues to wield on the global stage.",
    "Friedman reflected on Sri Lanka\u2019s challenges as a small nation surrounded by larger powers like India, emphasizing the importance of strategic engagement. \u201cA small country will develop in the context of larger countries. India is your neighbour. And India, like the United States, is ruthless in how it does business,\u201d he noted. He advised Sri Lanka to avoid direct confrontations and adopt pragmatic strategies, while being transparent with its citizens. \u201cMany governments, let\u2019s say Sri Lanka, try to hide the pain\u2026 And then they get instability.\u201d Reflecting on its history, he lamented, \u201cSri Lanka was a country that never found its place as it became a nation,\u201d missing key opportunities to assert itself on the global stage.",
    "Friedman also pointed out that many political leaders don\u2019t approach governance with the mindset necessary for economic growth. \u201cPolitical leaders tend not to be business leaders. They don\u2019t think in terms of business,\u201d he remarked. This, he believes, is a major obstacle to economic development in countries like Sri Lanka. Understanding how global business operates is crucial for fostering prosperity, and governments need to make strategic decisions based on that knowledge.",
    "Despite the challenges Sri Lanka faces, Friedman expressed optimism about its future, highlighting the country\u2019s beauty and the fondness people who have visited it share. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends who went there. It was a beautiful country,\u201d he said. Sri Lanka, he believes, has great potential, but it must adopt long-term strategies and effective governance to realize it.",
    "Turning to his earlier predictions about global powers, Friedman reflected on his analysis of Russia, China, and the United States. While much of his focus on these nations was correct, recent developments have altered their trajectories in unexpected ways. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has stretched far longer than anticipated, and China, once seen as an unstoppable economic giant, now faces serious economic difficulties. As a result, rather than being weakened, the United States has emerged stronger than ever.",
    "\u201cThe US has actually increased its power,\u201d Friedman asserted, noting that America\u2019s dominance stems from its unmatched economic and military strength. Economically, he pointed out, \u201cChina\u2019s major importer of capital is the United States,\u201d further illustrating how reliant global powers are on the US. This dominance, however, does not reflect traditional hegemony. Friedman explained, \u201cI don\u2019t consider this hegemony. Hegemony means that we are trying to create governments here and there. The United States is simply the most powerful economic power and the most military power.\u201d For Friedman, this means the US doesn\u2019t need to impose its will through coercion, as other nations depend on its economic and technological infrastructure.",
    "A key aspect of Friedman\u2019s analysis is his dismissal of the idea that the US dollar could be replaced as the global currency, describing it as \u201cfanciful.\u201d He argues that trust in the US dollar, along with the infrastructure supporting it, ensures its dominance in global trade. \u201cEverybody accepts the dollar,\u201d he said, adding that its strength lies in its stability, not conspiracy or manipulation. According to Friedman, efforts to shift away from the dollar are mostly theoretical, as no other currency holds the same trust globally.",
    "Friedman\u2019s assessment of China is similarly pragmatic. While China has made significant strides in building its economy and military, Friedman contends that much of this growth was due to its relationship with the US. \u201cChina\u2019s economy took off because of the United States, because of American investment,\u201d he explained. As a result, any slowdown in the US directly impacts China. Militarily, China is in a defensive position, particularly in the South China Sea, where it seeks to deter American influence.",
    "Looking ahead, Friedman sees Poland emerging as a significant power in Europe. In his book The Next 100 Years, he predicted Poland\u2019s rise, which recent events, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have reinforced. Poland\u2019s strategic position and growing military strength, coupled with its close relationship with the US, make it a pivotal player in the region. \u201cPoland is now engaged in a massive military process. But it is also cutting free from Europe,\u201d he noted, pointing to its increased leverage.",
    "Friedman\u2019s approach to Russia highlights the country\u2019s historical insecurities and strategic miscalculations. Russia\u2019s fear of invasion, stemming from past experiences with Napoleon and Hitler, drives its actions, particularly in Ukraine. Friedman explained, \u201cRussia has been invaded twice\u2026 And in each case, they came up the same route towards Moscow.\u201d This deep-rooted fear led to Russia\u2019s aggressive response to Western influence in Ukraine, particularly after the 2014 uprising.",
    "George Friedman predicted Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, driven by its need to \u201cclose off Ukraine, make no attack possible,\u201d despite overestimating its military capabilities. He notes, \u201cSometimes the Russians make strategic decisions that they can\u2019t support with their military capabilities,\u201d pointing to the prolonged war in Ukraine as evidence of this miscalculation. Russia\u2019s failure to grasp its limitations and adversarial approach to potential allies isolates it globally. Turning to the European Union, Friedman calls it \u201cmisconceived,\u201d arguing, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a banking system that includes the Germans and the Italians.\u201d He highlights Brexit as proof that the EU\u2019s structure fails to accommodate its members\u2019 diverse needs, noting, \u201cThe British\u2026 could not live under the auspices of a central government.\u201d Ultimately, Friedman is \u201cvery negative about the ability of the EU to survive on this basis,\u201d questioning its long-term sustainability.",
    "George Friedman argues that Israel\u2019s intelligence failures stem from a deeper issue of focusing too much on military solutions and neglecting diplomacy. He believes Israel\u2019s reliance on military responses has perpetuated a cycle of conflict, stating, \u201cIsrael has got to\u2026 understand that a military problem does not have to be settled militarily.\u201d This, he claims, prevents Israel from turning adversaries into allies, as the US did with Japan after World War II.",
    "Friedman also critiques Israel\u2019s unwillingness to recognize its strategic failures. He observes, \u201cThe Israelis are not likely to recognize that they had a failure,\u201d pointing to missed opportunities to prevent conflicts, such as the rise of Hamas. He suggests that resolving the Palestinian issue is key to any long-term peace, stating, \u201cThere could be [a solution], but recognizing that the Arabs will not give up until the Palestinian problem is settled.\u201d",
    "On broader global issues, Friedman addresses the necessity of selective protectionism, arguing that it is essential for national sovereignty. He challenges the blanket condemnation of protectionist policies, noting, \u201cEach nation has different needs. It cannot throw its market open to everyone.\u201d While he acknowledges the benefits of free trade, Friedman believes a balanced approach is crucial for safeguarding critical industries. He also emphasizes the importance of patience in economic development, remarking, \u201cThey expect miracles. And they don\u2019t understand how long it took the United States or China or any of these other countries,\u201d highlighting the unrealistic expectations many nations have in their pursuit of rapid growth.",
