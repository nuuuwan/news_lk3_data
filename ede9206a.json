    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s existing Samurdhi programme can continue its broader mandate of lifting people out of poverty while the new Aswesuma scheme will concern itself with direct cash transfers to deserving people without the involvement of a third party, an official said.",
    "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said speaking at an event in Passara, Badulla, on Tuesday August 01 that Sri Lanka\u2019s existing welfare system, which he said had enabled political parties and individuals to add and remove beneficiaries as they saw fit, has now ceased.",
    "He conceded, however, that the new system is not without its issues.",
    "\u201cBecause this is a new system that changes the established one, it is not without its shortcomings. We plan to address these shortcomings in the near future and also work to provide more welfare to the most deserving people,\u201d said Semasinghe.",
    "Insisting that Samurdhi benefits are not being slashed, the state minister said paying welfare benefits was only a small part of Samurdhi\u2019s mandate.",
    "\u201cIt had a much broader scope. While allowing Samurdhi to continue its mandate to lift people out of poverty, welfare benefits are to be paid by a different institute,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe bank accounts of the selected applicants have yet to be opened. That will be done. What is being established here is a system for the funds to go to your account without the involvement of a third party,\u201d he added.",
    "The state minister tweeted on Monday that 1,280,000 families who are receiving Samurdhi have applied for Aswesuma, out of which 887,653 have qualified. It was decided by the cabinet of ministers to extend the Samurdhi allowance to 393,094 families who are not qualified but receiving Samurdhi until the appeals/objection process is concluded, he said.",
    "Up to 1,792,265 families are eligible for Aswesuma, of whom 9,046,612 of them are newly qualified for welfare benefits. Relief is to be provided for 2 million families and after consideration of appeals and objections, he said, it will be possible to reach the target.",
    "The elderly, kidney patients and disabled people receiving assistance will be paid without a change while arrangements will be made to provide elderly allowances through post offices and kidney and disabled allowances through divisional secretariats, said Semasinghe.",
    "\u201cThe 11,660 people in elderly homes, children\u2019s homes, disabled centers and religious places will receive allowances without a change until a new policy is formulated. The government requests the eligible people to open accounts as soon as possible to receive the benefits,\u201d he said.",
    "There has been criticismthat Samurdhi was earlier given to mainly politically connected persons, while many poor people could not get the payments unless they worked on election campaigns.",
    "Sri Lanka started Aswesuma, its new consolidated welfare payments scheme, after a large number of people were tipped into poverty when the rupee collapsed from the most aggressive macro-economic policy (rate cuts and tax cuts) employed by the country\u2019s economic bureaucrats since a money printing central bank was set up.",
    "Social Empowerment State Minister Anupa Pasqual told reporters on July 11 that the government launched the Awesuma programme in response to allegations that the existing welfare scheme system was too politicised, with criticism specifically levelled at the Samurdhi scheme.",
    "Aswesuma was launched by the Welfare Benefits Board following a proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, said Pasquel, adding that the president \u201cintends to create an entrepreneurial state instead of a welfare state.\u201d",
    "Welfare beneficiaries have been organising protests against alleged injustice in the evaluation process of Aswesuma, even as the government and opposition trade charges in what has now become a fresh political controversy following a significant rise in poverty. (Colombo/Aug02/2023)"
