### ‘From rags to riches’: Sri Lankan worker becomes millionaire doing cleaning jobs in Australia

The story of a Sri Lankan worker, who migrated to Australia less than a decade ago and has become a millionaire now, has taken the internet by storm. At the age of 25, Vinul Karunaratne has made enough money to quit and shift full-time to doing gig jobs.

Karunaratne moved to Australia in 2015 and started working at 7-Eleven stores. But in 2019, he started taking on end-of-lease cleaning jobs on Airtasker. It’s a Sydney-based online marketplace that enables people to outsource everyday tasks - such as cleaning, assembling furniture, or yard work - for others to complete in exchange for cash.

Karunaratne told local news channel 7News that he didn’t have much resources and equipment when he started. “When I started, I didn’t even have much equipment. I had a vacuum, mop, bucket, and some rags,” he said, adding, “That was the stuff I had at home.”

His hard work eventually paid off and he was soon able to ditch his job at 7-Eleven to shift full-time to Airtasker.

Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Response Team (SL CERT) has reported a significant rise in complaints related to online financial fraud in 2024.

According to SL CERT’s Senior Information Engineer Charuka Damunupola, over 340 complaints involving financial scams have been received so far this year.

“Up to September, we’ve received 7,210 complaints regarding online scams, with the majority of these linked to social media platforms. When we focus specifically on online-based fraud, around 20% of the complaints involve financial scams. This highlights a growing trend of internet fraud targeting online banking users,” Damunupola stated.

He further explained that many victims fall prey to scams due to a lack of attention to security measures, particularly with One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

“Many users do not take proper care in safeguarding their OTPs or fail to recognize fraudulent websites. This often results in them being caught in these online banking scams,” Damunupola added.

I refer to the media report attributed to Minister of Foreign Affairs & Cabinet Spokesman, Vijitha Herath that Messrs. Duminda Hulangamuwa and Prof. Anil Fernando have been appointed ‘Senior Advisors to the President on Economic Affairs & Finance’.

As a person who voted for President Anura Kumara Dissanayake who is also Minister of Finance, I am shocked to learn of the appointment of Duminda Hulangamuwa.

My vote for AKD was mainly due to my belief that he is sincere in combating corruption being at the center of his agenda.

The corrosive link between politicians/professionals/private sector is best exemplified by the call of business chambers led by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) to “call off mass protests” planned for 2 November 2022 by those seeking  economic and social justice and accountability for economic crimes after the ‘Aragalaya’ was violently dismantled by then unelected President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

(Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Israeli airstrikes had killed two successors to Hezbollah’s slain leader, as Israel expanded its ground offensive against the Iran-backed group with a fourth army division deployed into south Lebanon.

Netanyahu spoke in a video released by his office hours after the deputy leader of Hezbollah, which is reeling after a spate of killings of senior commanders in Israeli airstrikes, left the door open to a negotiated ceasefire.

“We’ve degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including (Hassan) Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of the replacement,” Netanyahu said, without naming the latter two.

Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to succeed Nasrallah, had probably been “eliminated”. It was not immediately clear whom Netanyahu meant by the “replacement of the replacement”.
