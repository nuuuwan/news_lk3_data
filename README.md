### Engaging civil society to further support education system in Sri Lanka

*2024-12-17 01:20:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Engaging-civil-society-to-further-support-education-system-in-Sri-Lanka/4-770600) · `en`

When reviewing civil society’s involvement in supporting the education system in Sri Lanka, we find that existing opportunities are minimum. It is not that civil society in Sri Lanka has not contributed – however given the vast potential for collaboration and partnership, impact has been limited, largely due to the ad hoc nature of interventions.

The role of civil society and contribution towards development cannot be undermined. Recently UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s remarks to the United Nations Civil Society Conference in support of the Summit of the Future on 14 May 2024, further reiterated the importance of this role: “Time and again, I have witnessed the enormous impact of civil society in every corner of the world. I see you easing suffering, pushing for peace and justice, mobilising for change.”

Organisational misalignment is the silent killer of a business’s effectiveness and prosperity

Achieving the level of organisational alignment needed to provide a competitive advantage is not an easy task in today’s fast-paced business environment. Businesses today are more complex than ever before. Market conditions and working environments are evolving at an accelerated pace, making it imperative for businesses to react and make decisions quickly. To respond successfully to change, organisations need a clear understanding of their processes, tools, and data and how they all fit together. If this does not happen effectively, an inevitable corollary is the formation of organisational silos

### Has NPP Government ever thought about cleaning this “vulgarised society”?

This country now needs a system of responsible governance that can clean up the State, and resurrect a decent and civilised society

Here in Sri Lanka, we need a government with a plan to arrest this massive breakdown of the social fabric. Breakdown in social responsibility, ethics, social values, discipline, respect and dignity of private and community life. It needs an integrated program to simultaneously clean up the whole State machinery as well. Make it clean and efficient in handling issues with social responsibility. Can the NPP Government therefore present its social development program in detail, including reforms they propose to clean up the State machinery?

As Sri Lanka charts its path toward recovery and development, the public sector must evolve into a catalyst for progress rather than a constraint

Sri Lanka’s public sector has become a focal point of intense debate, reflecting its critical role in governance, service delivery, and employment. However, its inefficiencies, fiscal burdens, and disparities in resource allocation have come under sharp scrutiny amid escalating economic pressures. The expanding public workforce, while offering job security and supporting livelihoods, poses pressing challenges that demand urgent attention. Modernising and innovating this pivotal sector, along with ensuring fair and effective resource distribution, is essential to overcoming these hurdles and steering Sri Lanka toward sustainable development.

Approximately one million commuters lose an hour in traffic on a daily basis

Adding insult to injury, during peak hours, these high-tech traffic lights are often switched off, with traffic police manually directing vehicles. This is not only a waste of investment but also doubles operational costs, as manpower replaces technology. Such inefficiencies reflect a broader systemic failure: investments made without proper monitoring or outcome evaluation

### Death toll in Gaza Strip from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000, Palestinians say

The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours.

The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2% of Gaza’s entire prewar population of about 2.3 million.
