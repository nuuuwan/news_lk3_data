However, Wickremesinghe will deliver a blow to all those who make such a claim, as he will seek another term. He will officially announce his candidacy next month,” Minister Nanayakkara told a media briefing.

“Wickremesinghe has proven his capability by accepting the Presidency at a difficult time for the sake of the county. He did so when many others avoided it. Many others ran away from the responsibility and only thought of their political future,” he added.

### The president's inherent involvement is essential for reconciliation

*2024-05-21 12:45:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184129) · `ta`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to resolve Sri Lanka's economic crisis and address ethnic issues, promising self-governance and economic reforms. His policies, including tax relief and privatization, face opposition but could secure his reelection. Despite commitments to reconciliation, recent police actions against Tamil memorials and student protests indicate ongoing tensions rather than progress towards peace. International scrutiny, including calls for apologies and investigations into human rights abuses, further complicates the situation. Wickremesinghe's tenure ends with unresolved questions about his ability to lead Sri Lanka towards lasting reconciliation and economic stability.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that he was elected as the president and that Sri Lanka was to restore Sri Lanka from its economic crisis and that he would work for the self -government to fulfill that obligation.. Thus, before the economic success, there were great speculations about the President's objectives on holding the presidential election.

Through his commitment to the president's faith in resolving the economic crisis, the truth of his claims can be found in the vigilant and unwavering economic policies of the people.. The president is relaxing in the imposition of high taxes beyond the limits of the people and the privatization of state institutions that are strongly opposed by most employees.

Both policies are so influential that he can be re -elected president in the upcoming presidential election.. But he stands firmly in them with great confidence.
