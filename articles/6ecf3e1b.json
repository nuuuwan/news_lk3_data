  "original_title": "President Dissanayake\u2019s speech at the National War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration Ceremony must be commended. While Sinhalese nationalists have strongly condemned his speech, it is unfortunate that Tamil political parties did not welcome it.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "While addressing the 60th anniversary celebrations of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) at the Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo on 14 May, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) spoke highly of the conscience that guided their movement. He said that throughout history, their conscience had shown them the right path and had given them the courage to face future challenges as well, adding that they were dedicated to protecting that conscience.",
    "One wonders whether the strain of conscience was the reason for President Dissanayake\u2019s hesitation in taking a firm decision in advance regarding his participation in the 16th National War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration Ceremony held in Battaramulla five days later on 19 May. It cannot be said that he would have taken a principled decision to avoid the annual event to honour war heroes.",
    "However, one does not know how many people believed the Government, which first announced that President Dissanayake and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya would not attend the commemoration event and that it would be led by Deputy Minister of Defence Major General (Retd) Aruna Jayasekara representing them, when it later denied that the announcement had been a result of miscommunication in the face of severe criticism from the Opposition and social media.",
    "In the end, the President could not avoid attending the commemoration. The JVP has always boasted that it encouraged and supported the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa to wage war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in full swing. As such, it is difficult to understand the reason for the initial reluctance of the present Leader of the JVP who is the Executive President of the country and the Commander-in-Chief of the three armed forces to participate in the event honouring soldiers.",
    "Although the late Somawansa Amarasinghe was the Leader of the JVP when it supported the war, there is no record that Dissanayake had a different view of the war\u2019s escalation. It must be remembered that it was under his leadership that organisations of retired soldiers and Police officers were formed in the National People\u2019s Power (NPP).",
    "At the same time, given the approach and actions of the JVP-led NPP Government in handling the problems of the minority communities during the last six months after it came to power, it is difficult to believe that the President would have shown any reluctance to participate in the War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration in order to avoid hurting the sentiments of the Tamil people, who have suffered more than any other community as a result of the three-decade war.",
    "In any case, there is no doubt that the President changed his mind in the face of criticism from nationalist forces. The events of the past week are the latest evidence of the extent to which the President will be forced to bow to the opposition of nationalist forces in dealing with the problems of minority communities, including the possible attempts at a political solution to the national ethnic problem in the future.",
    "Against a backdrop where Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism has become intertwined with triumphalism after the end of the civil war, it is politically untenable for either the President or the Government to do anything that might appear to insult the memory of the war heroes, whom the people of the majority community revere as those who sacrificed their lives to protect the country\u2019s unity and territorial integrity. It is, therefore, a matter of great mystery as to why the President has subjected himself to such impropriety in attending the war heroes\u2019 commemoration.",
    "Last year, the 15th National War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration was held under the patronage of then Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was not present, but his absence created not even a ripple. President Dissanayake\u2019s reluctance, however, has provoked strong opposition from nationalist forces.",
    "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader and former Minister Udaya Gammanpila even claimed that it was because of pressure from the Tamil diaspora and communal political forces that the President had first decided to refrain from participating in the war heroes\u2019 commemoration.",
    "The Rajapaksas, for the first time since stepping down from power, held a separate commemoration of the war heroes on behalf of their Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) titled \u2018True Independence of the Motherland\u2019.",
    "The Rajapaksas during their rule first engaged in majoritarian mobilisation using war, and after the end of the war, they did the same using war triumphalism. They will not miss out on any opportunity to whip up communalism that comes their way as they have no option but to resort to majoritarian mobilisation to return to power.",
    "The Rajapaksas are entertaining a belief that the Sinhalese people are indebted to them because the war was brought to an end during their rule. They also believe that no one has the \u2018legitimate right\u2019 to war victory except their family and the party. Despite losing popular support due to their misrule, the Rajapaksas still enjoy the confidence of Sinhalese nationalist forces.",
    "Although Government leaders have been declaring that they will never allow racism and religious extremism to take hold again, it is obvious that their actions are beginning to alienate them from minority communities.",
    "The Tamil nationalist parties in the north and east campaigned with the message that there was no difference between previous governments and the NPP Government in dealing with problems of minority communities, and the changed situation allowed them to win back support of the Tamil people at the local elections.",
    "However, while the NPP Government is facing popular discontent considerably over its inability to deliver on its election-time promises, it is careful not to alienate nationalist forces in southern Sri Lanka when dealing with minority issues.",
    "It is possible that Opposition parties and nationalist forces, unable to mobilise the masses against the Government on issues affecting all communities, including the economic crisis, may seek to embark on strategies against the NPP on the basis of communal politics. The criticism of the President in connection with the commemoration of the war heroes is proof of this.",
    "In any case, President Dissanayake\u2019s speech at the National War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration Ceremony is certainly to be commended. It seems that he is of the view that the event should not be treated as a celebration of war victory like the Rajapaksas did. But the nationalist Opposition and social media have been harsh on him in their criticism, the claim being that President Dissanayake has reduced war heroes to ordinary soldiers.",
    "The President eloquently spoke on the tragedy of the war and stressed that the highest form of justice the country could provide for those who gave their lives was to create enduring peace in this nation.",
    "\u201cThis commemoration is not merely a remembrance of the war\u2019s conclusion but also a pledge to unite all communities in building a nation rooted in brotherhood and harmony, rather than allowing divisions to reignite.",
    "\u201cWar is a tragedy. As a nation that has endured this immense sorrow, it is our duty to ensure that such a conflict does nor arise again. We must strive to build a society characterised by peace, unity, and compassion, replacing suspicion, anger, and hatred with brotherhood and love.",
    "\u201cNot only in the south, but also in the north, people hold up photographs of their husbands and children on the streets and mourn their deaths. To every parent, their child is precious. So, as a country that has faced such a massive tragedy, our responsibility is to prevent such a war from happening again.",
    "\u201cThis memorial reminds us that true homage lies in forging unity. Let us vow never to permit division again. Instead, let us build a society where brotherhood triumphs over enmity. True freedom of our homeland remains elusive; even after ending the war, we have yet to fully secure the complete liberation of our motherland.",
    "\u201cWe must build a society where our children will no longer live in fear of war. This is an incredibly difficult task, yet it is one we must successfully accomplish. Although this may not be the ideal moment, I feel compelled to say that in both the north and the south, the flames of ethnic conflict have been rekindled, fuelled not by any cause other than the struggle for power,\u201d the President stated.",
    "While honouring and remembering the soldiers who sacrificed their lives to end the war, the President\u2019s avoidance of mention of the war victory sets last week\u2019s event apart from other memorial events so far. While Sinhalese nationalist forces have strongly condemned his speech, it is unfortunate that Tamil political forces did not welcome it. The President\u2019s message must be properly understood: 19 May is not a day to celebrate war. It comes from a Sri Lankan President for the first time.\u2019"
