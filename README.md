*2024-12-11 18:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/foreigners-buy-over-33-mln-worth-sri-lanka-govt-securities-193642/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka witnessed more than $33 million offshore inflows into its government securities last week and the island nation has seen inflows for the 12th straight week, the Central Bank data showed.

Analysts said foreign investors speculate further rate cut in the central bank’s monetary policy rate and further appreciation in the rupee.

“So, foreign risk-taking funds are still buying Sri Lanka government securities. They are speculating further 150 basis point reduction in the market interest rates and more appreciation in the rupee,” a Colombo-based currency dealer told EconomyNext.

Sri Lanka has been maintaining deflationary policies and import curbs amid declining interest rates after the inflation hit record high of over 70 percent in 2022.

The Election Commission of Sri Lanka has issued a Gazette notification confirming that Faiszer Musthapha has been elected as a Member of Parliament through the National List of the New Democratic Front (NDF), which contested the 2024 General Election under the ‘Gas Cylinder’ symbol.

On Tuesday (10), it was reported that the New Democratic Front (NDF) has nominated Musthapha for the remaining National List seat out of the two won by the party in Parliament.

However, a dispute has emerged within the New Democratic Front (NDF) concerning the nomination of Faiszer Musthapha for a National List MP position with the coalition partners alleging that this decision has been made without consulting them.

The NDF, which contested under the ‘gas cylinder’ symbol in the 2024 general elections, secured two National List seats.

The other National List MP seat had been filled by former minister Ravi Karunanayake of the UNP, also under somewhat controversial circumstances.

### Myanmar’s economy set to contract as floods and fighting take heavy toll, the World Bank says

Myanmar’s economy is forecast to contract this year, the World Bank said Wednesday, as flooding and fighting take a severe toll nearly four years after the military ousted its elected government headed by Aung San Suu Kyi.

In an update issued Wednesday, the bank said about a fifth of all built structures and a tenth of Myanmar’s roads had been damaged by widespread flooding during heavy monsoon rains and a typhoon that swept through the country in September. About 2 million people were left homeless, the report said.

Meanwhile, fighting between the military and opposition forces remains fierce in some parts of the country, disrupting farming and manufacturing.

“The level and intensity of armed conflict remains high, severely affecting lives and livelihoods, disrupting production and supply chains, and heightening uncertainty around the economic outlook,” it said.

Overall, the report said the economy will likely contract 1% in annual terms in the April-March fiscal year.

Sri Lanka SLPP calls for suspension of diplomatic ties with MP over fake degree claims

🟩

The Sri Lanka PA (SLPP) Jaffna District Organizer Geetanath Kasilingam has said that the diplomatic community should temporarily suspend his contacts amid increasing allegations of the credibility of the educational qualifications of Parliament Ashoka Sabumal Ranwala.

During the recently concluded parliamentary elections, Ranwala had misrepresented his credentials by using the title "Doctor".

There have been accusations that the Speaker should not graduate from doctorate, which raises questions about his honesty and accountability.

"It is unacceptable to be a Speaker who portrayed fake qualifications," Kasilingam said. "The public should be interpreted on this obvious scam."

Kasilingam asked President Dissanayake to begin an immediate inquiry into the matter. He emphasized the importance of transparency and urged the authorities to quickly solve these issues to maintain the credibility of the parliamentary organization of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lankan cricketer Niroshan Dickwella’s ban from playing any form of cricket has been significantly reduced from three years to three months.

Accordingly, this makes him eligible to play all forms of cricket effective from today (11).

After the consideration of an appeal made by Dickwella, the appeal panel has declared that as per the medical evidence it is clearly established that the player has consumed a substance of abuse out-of-competition and that it is unrelated to sports performance.

Accordingly, the panel has stated that therefore, they are of the view that the player Niroshan Dickwella’s 3 years ineligibility period imposed by the disciplinary panel, should be reduced to 3 months ineligibility period, commencing from 13 August 2024.

Furthermore, the panel has mentioned that this decision balances the player’s right to fair consideration with the principles of anti-doping, ensuring fairness while maintaining the integrity of sport.

### Insurance regulation in Sri Lanka ‘developing with limited transparency’: Fitch Ratings

*2024-12-11 09:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/104157/insurance-regulation-in-sri-lanka-developing-with-limited-transparency-fitch-ratings) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s regulatory environment for the insurance sector is regarded as “developing with limited transparency,” according to Fitch Ratings.

In a report, Fitch cited the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka which oversees domestic insurers.

It introduced a risk-based capital (RBC) regime in 2015, which was fully adopted by insurers in 2016. The regime required insurers to maintain a minimum RBC ratio of 120%, and those with a ratio below 160% are required to submit a plan to improve their capitalisation levels.

The commission also enforces the segregation of life and non-life insurance businesses and requires all insurers to list on the local stock exchange to enhance transparency. However, exemptions are provided to insurers whose parent companies are listed on a recognised stock exchange.

Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Northern, North-central, Eastern and North-western provinces. Heavy showers above 100mm are likely at some places in Northern province.

Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places elsewhere during the evening or night, it added.

Misty conditions can be expected in Central, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva, Western and North-western provinces during the morning.

Thus, the general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.
