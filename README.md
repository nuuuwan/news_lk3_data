### Former Labour and Foreign Employment Minister defends E-8 visa program

Former Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday responded to allegations and defended his efforts to establish the E-8 visa program.

He emphasised that it was intended to create employment opportunities for Sri Lankans. “I personally went and requested these people to provide us with this E-8 visa category. Accordingly, they made arrangements to provide this E-8 visa category to Sri Lanka as well,” he explained. Nanayakkara’s response comes following accusations raised by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) yesterday.

He attributed delays in implementing the program to internal disruptions at the SLBFE, particularly in the weeks leading up to elections. “Due to the behaviour and actions of certain officers of the Bureau, it was finally not implemented. It can be implemented even now. If implemented, it is an opportunity to obtain thousands of new jobs,” he said.

Fort Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali yesterday directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to release a luxury V8 SUV belonging to former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe, currently under CID custody, back to its owner.

My father would want to be remembered for his unwavering faith, calm demeanour, and boundless kindness. He taught me to face adversity with grace, to be generous and kind, and to live a life of integrity. Though he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on in the values he instilled in all of us

This will be my first Christmas without my father, Eric Cooray, who passed away three months ago. Life has felt strange since that inevitable moment, one I always dreaded, while never anticipating just how difficult his loss would be to accept.

Almost every day starts and ends with thoughts of my father, from fond memories of my childhood to imagining how proud he would be of his beloved grandchildren. Throughout my life, he inspired me in countless ways. Even now, I draw so much strength from memories of him that it still feels like he is guiding me from the heavens, giving me the strength to keep moving forward.

Indeed, it will be remembered as a watershed moment, a turning point of our politics if only he succeeds in resolving his twin dilemmas – ensuring ethical governance, adopting pragmatic economics to break free from a “Sovereign Debt Trap.”

Gustave Le Bon (1841) who was a French social psychologist pioneered research on group behaviour, especially crowd behaviour. People with compatible needs and interests come together (convergence theory), purposefully and united, to have their views represented. Classical theories treat crowds as pathological (contagion theory). Crowds are seen as mobs, mobs that act irrationally.

Delivering his inaugural policy statement to Parliament, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake dealt mostly with the economy and, in particular, the IMF agreement. The problem he faces is that the former government agreed to terms with the IMF that did not consider the impact on the people, but gave priority to meeting fiscal targets. The President acknowledged that the government had no alternative but to continue with it as the country had gone too far down the road to change direction. He said, “The negotiations had already been ongoing for more than two years. If we were to restart discussions on the restructuring programme for an extended period it will be impossible for us to move the economy forward…”

Surely, racism has caused enough damage to us to warrant its erasure from our midst with the condemnation it deserves, without leaving it more room to further flourish in deceptively benign ways. As showcased by the November 14 election results, many Tamils and Muslims, not forgetting Catholics and Hindus, have voted to power the NPP, led by the JVP, which they might have previously labelled, and avoided, as a ‘Sinhalese’ party.

Sri Lanka: Protesters demand E8 visa for South Korea jobs. Foreign Employment Bureau denies opportunities. Government intervention sought.

🟩

Some people who are looking forward to working for South Korea for South Korea on the E8 visa have been fighting in front of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau in Battaramla, saying they have not had the opportunity to go to Korea due to the attention of the authorities.

Minister Vijitha Herath met with some of the protesters last Friday. In the meantime, the E8 Visa said that action would be taken to take the necessary measures to legalize South Korea.

However, the foreign employment work is hiding the opportunities for South Korea, so they are struggling to prolong the time as they have to go to work.

But it is illegal to send to business on E8 visa. The President of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau said it could not be allowed. As well as the console is not likely to get a visa without knowing. The Chairman of the Bureau said that there is no truth in reporting that we have got a career opportunity for South Korea.
