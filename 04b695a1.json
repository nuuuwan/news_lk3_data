    "President of the Welfare Society, which is a collective body of victims\u2019 families at St. Sebastian's Church, Katuwapitiya told Daily Mirror, \u201cIt is not surprising that these people had not paid the compensation on time as they are so used to neglect things.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is no big deal for those people who deliberately neglected the multiple warnings of a series of attacks to take a ruling of the Supreme Court for granted,\u201d he said.",
    "Leslie, a family member of a victim said, \u201cWe won\u2019t get our loved ones back. However, those responsible should pay the price for their negligence. At least they will feel the pain with the amount of money that they have to pay as compensation.\u201d",
    "Sudara Fernando, who lost his father Sudeera to the attacks, said, \u201cThese politicians and other responsible individuals are acting as if they had nothing to do with the Easter Attacks, which is in fact disgusting.\u201d",

    "W.P.A.W. Perera whose husband, M.J.Densil Fernando died in the Easter carnage, shared her views in tears saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want a rupee from the people who are responsible for the loss of life of my beloved husband.
