    "Says DLF will support NPP despite not receiving a formal response from party",
    "Claims recent electoral victory of leftist movement has prompted his party\u2019s decision to distance itself from MJP",
    "Stresses no point in aligning with alternative parties seeking to be in opposition",
    "Democratic Left Front (DLF) leader former MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara has announced his party\u2019s withdrawal from the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) and confirmed his party\u2019s support for the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in the upcoming General Election.",
    "Nanayakkara made the announcement at a media briefing yesterday, explaining that the recent electoral victory of the leftist movement has prompted his party\u2019s decision to distance itself from the MJP. \u201cThe election results were a resounding victory for the leftists,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere is no point in aligning with alternative parties. We must all unite and take this victory forward in the Parliamentary elections.\u201d",
    "Nanayakkara noted that continuing with the MJP was no longer feasible due to policy differences between the two parties. \u201cWe cannot pursue two different policies\u2014that of the MJP and the leftists, at the same time,\u201d he explained.",
    "Despite the DLF\u2019s decision to contest the General Election separately, Nanayakkara emphasised that his party will extend its support to the NPP. \u201cEven though we will be contesting on our own, our support is firmly with the NPP,\u201d he stated. \u201cTo our followers, we say, the vote given to us is a vote given to the NPP.\u201d",
    "Nanayakkara also revealed that while efforts were made to collaborate with the NPP during the Presidential election, the attempt was unsuccessful due to policy differences. \u201cWe tried to build a relationship with the NPP to compete together, but it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, attributing the breakdown to the NPP\u2019s policy of accepting individuals rather than parties into its fold.",
    "Nevertheless, Nanayakkara affirmed his party\u2019s commitment to supporting the NPP, despite not receiving a formal response from them. \u201cWe will still do what is right,\u201d he said, stressing that the DLF does not intend to contest merely to be in the opposition, unlike the MJP, which he claimed has taken an oppositional stance."
