    "Trump said the new department will realize long-held Republican dreams and \u201cprovide advice and guidance from outside of government,\u201d signaling the Musk and Ramaswamy roles would be informal, without requiring Senate approval and allowing Musk to remain the head of electric car company Tesla social media platform X and rocket company SpaceX.",
    "The new department would work with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to \u201cdrive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach\u201d to government never seen before, Trump said.",
    "The work would conclude by July 4, 2026 - the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
    "Musk, ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world, already stood to benefit from Trump\u2019s victory, with the billionaire entrepreneur expected to wield extraordinary influence to help his companies and secure favorable government treatment.",
    "With many links to Washington, opens new tab, Musk gave millions of dollars to support Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and made public appearances with him. Trump had said he would offer Musk a role in his administration promoting government efficiency.",
    "Adding a government portfolio to Musk\u2019s plate could benefit the market value of his companies and favored businesses such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Musk will have a massive role in the Trump White House with his increasing reach clearly across many federal agencies,\u201d equities analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a research note.",
    "\u201cWe believe the major benefits for Musk and Tesla far outweigh any negatives as this continues to be a \u2018poker move for the ages\u2019 by Musk betting on Trump,\u201d Ives said.",
    "Trump likened the efficiency effort to the Manhattan Project, the U.S. undertaking to build the atomic bomb that helped end World War Two, while Musk promised transparency.",
    "\u201cAll actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency,\u201d Musk said on X, inviting the public to provide tips.",
    "\u201cWe will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,\u201d Musk said.",
    "Musk said at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in October that the federal budget could be reduced by \u201cat least\u201d $2 trillion. Discretionary spending, including defense spending, is estimated to total $1.9 trillion out of $6.75 trillion in total federal outlays for fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
    "\u201cYour money is being wasted and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that. We\u2019re going to get the government off you back and out of your pocketbook,\u201d Musk said at the rally.",

    "Ramaswamy is the founder of a pharmaceutical company who ran for the Republican presidential nomination against Trump and then threw his support behind the former president after dropping out.",
    "Ramaswamy said the appointment means he is withdrawing from consideration for the pending U.S. Senate appointment in Ohio, where Governor Mike DeWine will appoint a replacement for JD Vance, who will become Trump\u2019s vice president when they are inaugurated on Jan. 20."
