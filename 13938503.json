    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Acting General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has issued a circular cancelling all leave for CEB workers until further notice. This comes as electricity workers across the country prepare to launch a three-day protest campaign against the proposed Sri Lanka Electricity Bill.",
    "The circular cites an extraordinary gazette notification that designates the supply of electricity as an essential service. To ensure \"uninterrupted service,\" it states that all leave for CEB workers is cancelled, effective January 2nd, 2024. However, the circular allows for exceptions in cases of emergency, as approved by the relevant Executive Officer.",
    "This development follows the announcement of a planned protest by the Ceylon Electricity Boards Joint Trade Union Alliance, starting today outside the CEB headquarters. The union, led by Ranjan Jayalal, vehemently opposes the proposed bill, fearing it will \"split the CEB into 12 parts and sell them,\" jeopardizing the future of the sector and national security.",
    "The government, however, maintains the bill aims to improve efficiency and attract foreign investment to the struggling power industry.",
