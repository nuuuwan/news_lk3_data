### Sri Lanka allows people to import rice till Jan 10

*2024-12-24 11:03:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-allows-people-to-import-rice-till-jan-10-196056/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers have decided to extend the deadline to import rice till January 10, to allow more rice to be brought into the country, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa.

Sri Lanka initially gave permission to import rice only till December 20.

State-run companies were also not able to import sufficient stocks due delays by suppliers, Minister Jayatissa said.

Already about 70,000 metric tonnes have been brought but the government decided to give time considering the supply situation, he said.

Sri Lanka has a 65 rupee tax on rice (about 200 US dollars0 to give higher profits to farmers.

Sri Lanka has unusual controls on the foods of the people which were worsened particularly in the last 15 years which has pushed up prices far above the rest of the world.

Due to food controls, rice prices tend to move up in December and January ahead of the main (Maha) rice harvest which starts coming from late January to early February. (Colombo/Dec24/2024)

the inquiry into the corrupt practices of the Secretary. Yet, he remains without any shame using a majority within the Committee who have benefited from his largesse using NOC funding and perks.

Many news reports were published about the corrupt practices within the NOC, which was directed towards the longest-standing Secretary Maxwell de Silva. Quite like the Rajapaksa regime, it was a free-for-all as long as the Secretary had a stranglehold of his position.
