### New UK leader Starmer declares Rwanda deportation plan ‘dead and buried’

Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday he would scrap a controversial plan to fly thousands of asylum seekers from Britain to Rwanda in his first major policy announcement since winning a landslide election victory.

The previous Conservative government first announced the plan in 2022 to send migrants who arrived in Britain without permission to the East African nation, saying it would put an end to asylum seekers arriving on small boats.

But no one was sent to Rwanda under the plan because of years of legal challenges.

At his first press conference since becoming prime minister, Starmer said that the Rwanda policy would be scrapped because only about 1% of asylum seekers would have been removed and it would have failed to act as a deterrent.

“The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started. It’s never been a deterrent,” Starmer said. “I’m not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don’t act as a deterrent.”

Justice Sotomayor on SC Ruling on Presidential Immunity: With fear for our democracy, I dissent

President Biden had a dismal debate night on Thursday, June 28. There is absolutely no gainsaying that fact. However rose-tinted the glasses we may wear, Biden did no favors to his chances of re-election in November. Highly respected journals like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, joined with this lowly columnist, an ardent supporter of the Democratic cause and a virulent Never Trumper, in sending a message, immediately after the debate, to the 81-year-old incumbent president to drop out of the fray, for the greater good of the nation.

In fact, polls after the debate found that 72% of all voters did not want Biden running in November. Also, many of the mega donors of the Democratic Party are insisting that the party replaces Biden with a younger, more electable candidate – or else.

### Navigating ourselves out

*2024-07-07 01:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/navigating-ourselves-out/) · `en`

This may be cynical posturing on my part, but recent announcements about Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process reeks of a somewhat widespread tendency to credit everything to the political leadership at the cost of the suffering many. Legitimate concerns have been raised about whether Sri Lanka could have negotiated better; the debt haircut Ghana settled for, to give one example, is miles away from Sri Lanka’s figure. The extent of our haircut leaves us with very little breathing space. To stick to it, we need to engage in savage austerity, or more of what we have been inflicting on ourselves for the last two years.

### Lanka’s defense cooperation with India: Strengthening ties or strategic dependence?

*2024-07-07 01:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lankas-defense-cooperation-with-india-strengthening-ties-or-strategic-dependence/) · `en`

Exposing a large segment of your military officers to the thinking and training of a foreign power, especially one so near, can have significant consequences.

Defense cooperation between Sri Lanka and India is growing. This is significant as India’s defense engagements with other countries in the region, such as the Maldives, for example, are reducing. This is a strategic move on India’s part to strengthen its influence in the Indian Ocean island at a time when the Chinese presence in the region has grown manifold.

By providing specialized training and military aid, India aims to foster a closer relationship with Sri Lanka, akin to the historical precedent set by the United States through its military aid programs with developing countries since 1880.
