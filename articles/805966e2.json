    "Colombo, Feb 07 (Daily Mirror) - In response to the ongoing investigations pertaining to the substandard Immunoglobulin scandal, the medical fraternity questions the sluggish move by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to look into the role of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) in the procurement process of the said drug.",
    "Speaking to Daily Mirror, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said with respect to the import of Immunoglobulin injections, the NMRA played a critical role as it had been actively involved in the entire process of procurement.",
    "\u201cAs such, we urge the law enforcement authorities to pay key attention on the role played by the NMRA in the procurement process as it could further shed light on the Immunoglobulin scandal,\u201d he added.",
    "Besides, the medical fraternity has also voiced concerns regarding the CID for not recording a statement from former NMRA Chairperson Prof. S.D. Jayaratne, who initially addressed the media about the contentious human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) deal.",
    "The spotlight on this issue follows the suspension of a batch of IVIG recently, after revelations surfaced that the local supplier, Isolez BiotechPharma AG (Private) Limited, had imported it using forged documents for Customs clearance.",
    "Senior specialists highlighted to Daily Mirror that Prof. Jayaratne was the first to speak out to the media regarding the matter.",
    "Nevertheless, the CID has yet to record a statement from him.",
    "The controversy dates back to October 2023 when the NMRA announced the suspension of a batch of IVIG imported from India to Sri Lanka, allegedly bypassing due procedures. In a media release dated October 3, 2023, Prof. Jayaratne revealed that forged documents had been utilized for Customs clearance during the importation process, leading to the subsequent failure of quality tests for the drug."
