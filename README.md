Sarvajana Balaya Colombo district candidate and former MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday announced his plans to launch a campaign to collect signatures for a public petition, to inform the President of the people’s displeasure over the misuse of the law.

Addressing the media, he criticised the Government for retaining Public Security Ministry Secretary former Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne and Criminal Intelligence Analysis and Prevention Division in the Sri Lanka Police Director Shani Abeysekara.

Gammanpila claims the two officers were named as main accused in an investigative committee report on the Easter Sunday attacks.

“Since the removal will not be done, we are hoping to sign a public petition to inform the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake about people’s displeasure related to the misuse of the law by this Government; during their first month in office,” he said, noting that this is the same politician (President) who earlier criticised former Presidents for misusing the law.

### ‘‘Sri Lanka’s ISB restructure: Debt trap backed by IMF and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce’’

Sri Lanka’s debt crisis is a stark example of the destructive power of predatory lending

The current NPP administration has agreed to implement a new variant of the same corrupt deal which merely reduces the weighted coupon rate of interest of bonds from 8.1% to 6.5% from 2028 onwards reducing total payments by $ 1 billion. The new Government must reject this destructive path and prioritise people’s interests. It is evident that the Sri Lankan Government’s actions have been influenced by corrupt interests. The cosy relationship between the Government and international creditors raises serious questions about transparency and accountability. The new administration must break free from this destructive path and prioritise the well-being of the Sri Lankan people

### Irrational behaviour of RW and MR vs. rational behaviour of President AKD

As a well-educated veteran politician who has served in parliament for nearly 50 years and has been the leader of UNP for a long time, the public expects that Ex-President RW will behave and respond rationally. The above can also be well applied to Ex-President MR. However, this article shows that their irrational behaviour can be compared with the rational behaviour of President AKD. Along with 50 years in politics, RW and MR failed to achieve political maturity in the right direction that the President/AKD achieved within 20 years of politics; the young politicians who follow AKD can learn all. But those who follow RW and MR are lost

Given the parliamentary election on 14 November 2024, the public can hear unique and surprising things about politics, particularly from political rallies. This article aims to discuss a few of the above so that voters can better understand whom to cast their votes for.

### Examining Elpitiya, Israeli-Zionist beachheads, Anura’s inaction and Prabhakaran’s profile

*2024-10-31 01:50:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Examining-Elpitiya-Israeli-Zionist-beachheads-Anura-s-inaction-and-Prabhakaran-s-profile/4-768630) · `en`

On the campaign trail, President AKD followed-up his memorable line “I hear talk in certain places about an Opposition. An Opposition? No. What we need now is a powerful Government!” with a no less memorable and ominous one: “They think this government will be short-lived but I’m telling you this Government will step down only after having rebuilt the entire country!”

He should have said “this government will step down only if you decide it should at a national election”.

Meanwhile senior JVP member and NPP candidate Samantha Waidyaratna reassured his audience and the nation on TV news that “the incoming Government will last an aeon (‘kalpayak’)”.

Elpitiya was a legendary JVP stronghold during the April 1971 insurrection and thereafter. Therefore, last week’s Elpitiya PS election weeks after Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s presidential victory, illuminates greatly.

The JVP-NPP has shrunk slightly (47%) in comparison with its Elpitiya vote in September (49%).

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has generally seen anti-Indian sentiment rise close to its elections, but this has been notably absent in the run up to the general election on November 14.

The most recent case when anti-Indian sentiment was whipped up was when India’s Adani group was to be awarded a Mannar wind power plant which came without a tender, ahead of the presidential election.

In June, three environmentalists and a Catholic Bishop filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition in Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court over Adani Green Energy’s Mannar wind power plant citing lack of transparency, secrecy of public information, biased environmental impact assessement (EIA), and the pricing.

The Indian company has complained of a possible “vicious campaign” against its 250 MW wind-powered energy project in Mannar and has said it has followed all the procedures.
