    "Karl Marx was right, Socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species\u2013 Edward Osborne Wilson",
    "The argument put forwarded by Edward O. Wilson, the father was Socio-biology, was that altruism which is the very foundation of socialism, does not come naturally to human beings. Commenting on this subject in his book, \u201cThe Ants\u201d, Wilson maintained that while altruism works for species like ants and bees, humans who are naturally selfish are unable to completely adjust to Socialism.",
    "The above quote of Wilson was recited last Saturday to a packed audience at the Hyde Park in Colombo by Sugeeshwara Bandara who made his political debut that day.",
    "Attributing the fall of the former USSR regime of Russia to the same theory, Bandara said forcing people to accept Socialist ways makes people frustrated and kills the spirit of innovation.",
    "The leader of the newly formed New People\u2019s Front (NPF), Bandara along with his party joined the new political alliance led by Anura Yapa. He has been appointed as its Colombo District Organizer. Bandara surely has a score to settle with the so called radical Socialists of Sri Lanka \u2013 the JVP.\u00a0 Kicking off his speech with his own life story, the leader of NPF shared the gruesome facts of his childhood with the audience.",
    "On April 24th, 1989 four year old Sugeeshwara Bandara had been with his father in the garden of their home in the Southern hamlet of Weeraketiya. Sugeeshwara\u2019s father who had been a Lawyer was a Magistrate. He had also been a prominent figure in the Sri Lanka Communist Party, in the south.",
    "After giving a body shower to little Sugeeshwara, senior Bandara had walked towards the grave of his father in their garden. Four year old Sugeeshwara who followed his father stood close. A JVP gunman had walked into the garden from nowhere, and all of a sudden had shot the Magistrate with a T-56 gun right in front of the four year old son. The young mother of Sugeeshwara became a widow with five young children to fend for, with Sugeeshwara being",
    "\u201cThe JVP wanted to be the only leftist party in Sri Lanka. It was out to destroy the Communist Party and the Lanka Samasamaja Party. Months before murdering my father, a politburo member of the Communist Party, L. W. Panditha was hacked to death at Dematagoda,\u201d Sugeeshwara Bandara informed the gathering.",
    "\u201cThere are nearly 60,000 children who became fatherless \u2018thanks to\u2019 JVP killers during the insurgency in the late 1980s. Our fathers were brutally killed for no fault of theirs\u201d",
    "Bandara feels that most of the seniors of the JVP who gave the orders to kill people are still at large. He argues that the JVP politburo still comprises seniors who were responsible for the party\u2019s past crimes. Insisting that it\u2019s these who run the JVP today, he emphasized that Anura Kumara Dissanayake is just the mask that the JVP seniors wear to give a more human look to",
    "\u201cHere is a party which killed more Buddhist monks than the LTTE. In 1989 alone it killed twenty-four senior monks including Venerable Kotikawatte Saddhatissa Thera. I have the lists of monks with me. This is a party which massacred the security guards of the Sri Dalada Maligawa in an attempt to cause mayhem inside the Maligawa, and bombed Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament killing and injuring Parliamentarians and even Ministers\u201d he reminded the audience.",
    "Everyone talks about \u201cwaves\u201d these days.\u00a0 It looks there are \u201ccounter waves\u201d too."
