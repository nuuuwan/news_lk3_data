### Sri Lanka Provides Hope for Democracy in the West

Here, Sri Lanka can provide hope.

### An Appeal To The Tamil Diaspora For Constructive Engagement

*2024-09-29 09:52:08* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/an-appeal-to-the-tamil-diaspora-for-constructive-engagement/) · `en`

It is time for us to face the reality that the dream of Tamil Eelam is over, and clinging to this idea will only hinder the progress and well-being of our people. Revisiting the painful final days of the war, debating who was involved, and speculating on alternative outcomes are not productive. They only serve to deepen wounds and create further division within our community and the nation as a whole. Instead, we must focus on the future—one that promotes healing, unity, and cooperation.

Reliving these events in endless debates may feel like a way to process our loss, but in truth, it is a distraction. Our homeland’s future depends on finding ways to move forward. The current political leadership (NPP), which itself has experienced defeat and decimation not once but twice, has managed to reconcile and secure the trust of the majority. They have shown that it is possible to rise above the bitterness of the past, and we must take a page from their book.
