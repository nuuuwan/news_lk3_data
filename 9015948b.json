    "Pastor Jerome Fernando arrived in Sri Lanka yesterday, a spokesperson from the Department of Immigration and Emigration said.",
    "Upon arrival he was scheduled to give a statement to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) within 48 hours as per a court order.",
    "On 17 November, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned the self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019 should record a statement with the CID\u2019s Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival.",
    "This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",
    "The self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019 found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures."
