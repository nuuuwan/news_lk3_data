    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is in the process of finalizing 10 mining companies which have been looking to invest in the island nation\u2019s mining for a long time amid change in the mining regulation, State Investment Minister Dilum Amunugama said.",
    "The Cabinet in August 2023 approved several proposals by President Ranil Wickremesinghe aimed at promoting foreign and local investment in the country\u2019s mineral industry to boost revenues in a sector which has been long dragged by corruption.",
    "The cabinet proposal has changed the earlier mandatory requirement of value addition from the first day of the business.",
    "Instead, the government considers separation of minerals from the deposits as the initial value addition and the licensee could export the minerals either for 24 months or a maximum 30 percent of the grids. The licensee then could put up a value addition plant.",
    "\u201cRight now there are 10 projects in the finalizing stage including one heavy mineral plant as well,\u201d Amunugama told reporters at a media briefing to announce the performance of the Investment Ministry in the last two years.",
    "\u201cThese projects have been hanging there for years. These projects are trying to engage for 10 years, 12 years, 15 years. All of these are stuck due to this unfeasible regulation. That is why we have changed the regulation,\u201d he said referring to value addition from the first day.",
    "According to the Board of Investment (BOI) data, Sri Lanka has 7.5 million metric tons (MT) of Ilmenite/Rutile/Zircon deposits in both Eastern coastal town of Pulmudai in Trincomalee district and Northwestern coastal town of Puttalam), 45,000 MT of graphite, and 60 million MT of Apatite.",
    "Both India and Pakistan are given market access to the deposits with duty concession under Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) and Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSLFTA) with 100 percent duty free for any machinery related to the business.",
    "However, the rule on value addition from the first day restricted the investment into the industry.",
    "Minister said the value addition will be centralized after a certain period.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t do value addition from the first day. So, we studied the whole mining procedure and now we have come up with the solution where they can ship pure minerals in non-value added form of 30 percent of the grid or for two years,\u201d Amunugama said.",
    "\u201cThe next level is where each and everyone will not have to do value addition in their own plant. You can have a central value addition part where everyone can take their minerals there and add value.\u201d (Colombo/August 21/2024)"
