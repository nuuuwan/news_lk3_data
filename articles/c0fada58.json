  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israel is making headlines with its attacks within West Asian countries not limited to Palestine, and it will be interesting to see how the present government manages it and how Sri Lankan leaders in the past from Prime Minister D.S Senanayake to President Ranil Wickremasinghe handled the issue during their tenure.",
    "D.S Senanayake \u2013 first South Asian leader to recognise Israel",
    "Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) and Israel both gained independence from the British in the same year in 1948 and we became the first South Asian country to recognise the state of Israel on September 16, 1950 [Jewish Virtual Library, AICE Project], just a day before India recognised it. This was when D S Senanayake was the prime minister.",
    "Before becoming the prime minister, D S Senanayake was the minister of agriculture in the first state council of Ceylon and had been very keen in developing agriculture in the country with the vision of making the country self-sufficient in food. One day he was approached by Sir Arthur Ranasinghe, who was the Secretary to the Committee on Agriculture and Land who suggested that DS writes about his visionary ideas on agriculture to the press. This was an idea born after Sir Arthur read about the Zionist Movement and its contribution to agriculture by cultivating arid lands in Palestine.",
    "DS\u2019s biographer H.A.J Hulugalla visited Palestine and its Jewish settlements, brought back an English book titled \u2018Fellah\u2019s Farm\u2019 written by a Jewish agricultural expert, which he handed over to Senanayake. This inspired DS to write a series of articles about his policy on agriculture, which was later collected and published in a book titled \u2018Agriculture and Patriotism\u2019 [pg.122, D. S. Senanayake, H A J Hulugalle].",
    "Sri Lanka decided to formally initiate diplomatic relations with Israel on June 1, 1956, when power shifted from the United National Party to the newly formed Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by S.W.R.D Bandaranaike.",
    "Bandaranaike seemed to sympathise with the Palestinian cause, but he didn\u2019t want to sever ties with Israel while Israel was keen in maintaining diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka during this period.",
    "During a question raised in the parliament on August 14,1958, he stated that he was getting pressure from Israel to send a representative, to which he agreed, but he stated that he \u2018just laid it by for further consideration\u2019.",
    "Up until his tragic death, Sri Lanka did not accredit a representative to Israel. It was during the tenure of the caretaker Prime Minister W. Dahanayake that our ambassador in Rome was also accredited to Israel.",
    "The foreign policy of Sirimavo Bandaranaike had been very firm and steady. According to V L B Mendis, a former member of the Sri Lanka Overseas Service, Sir John had push, Mr. Bandaranaike had eloquence and ideas while Mrs Bandaranaike had charisma and appeal [Foreign Relations of Sri Lanka, pg.374], this was clearly displayed in several bold decisions she took related to the foreign relations of the country.",
    "In 1970 Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2019s government decided to sever ties with the Israel and closed the Israeli embassy for the first time and in 1975 the first Palestine (then known as the PLO) embassy was opened in Sri Lanka and in 1976.",
    "The cause for Palestine in Sri Lanka was so strong that the Sri Lankan cricket team headed by Anura Tennakoon refrained from playing a scheduled match with the Israel cricket team during 1979 ICC Trophy.",
    "J R Jayewardene had to face the wrath of terrorism and several western countries including the US and UK refused to intervene. In addition to that he was keen in opening up the country for international trade which had been constrained by the SLFP government of Sirmavo Bandaranaike. So he turned to Israel who was willing to help [Delegitimizing Israel, Shlomi Yass, Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, Vol 10:1].",
    "As a result of a meeting with the Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzak Shamir and the Sri Lankan counterpart A C S Hameed in New York, an Israel Interest section was opened at the US embassy in Colombo, and the Israel Sri Lanka relationship blossomed again [Jerusalem Post, October 19, 1986]",
    "The Israel Embassy in Sri Lanka was opened for the second time in 1984, and in 1986 the President Chain Herzog visited Sri Lanka, making him the first Israel leader to visit Sri Lanka.",
    "In 1990 President Premadasa ordered the closure of the Israeli interest section and the Israel embassy that was started during the tenure of his party leader and predecessor.",
    "Despite knowing the seriousness of his decision, he went ahead as he was very sensitive to the concerns raised by Arab countries reflected through the Muslim community in Sri Lanka. In addition to that in 1991 Sri Lanka voted against the UN Resolution 46/86, which was brought to revoke the UN resolution 3379 that equated Zionism with Racism [pg.295, Rendering unto Caesar, Bradman Weerakoon].",
    "Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar were keen on restarting a diplomatic relationship with Israel and went on to purchase the SLAF\u2019s first Kfir jets from Israel in 1996 to form the No 10 Squadron in the same year.",
    "In an interview, Minister Kadirgamar justified the decision by stating that the whole world was recognising Israel little by little and there was no reason for Sri Lanka not to have diplomatic relations with Israel [pg.7, Tamil Times, Vol 19.9], As a result in the year 2000 the Sri Lankan Government renewed its diplomatic ties with Israel.",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa, best friend of Palestine but first leader to visit Israel",
    "If there was a leader who was featured prominently in the Palestinian cause, it was none other than Mahinda Rajapaksa. His work was valued so much by the Palestinians that there is a road named after him in the city of Ramallah in Palestine.",
    "The first high profile delegate led by his Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake visited Israel in 2008 while President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited in 2014, making him the first head of state or government of Sri Lanka to make an official visit to Israel.",
    "One of the illustrations President Ranil Wickremesinghe uses often is a scene in Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Caucasian Chalk Circle where he equates his effort of running the bankrupt country to the Grusha\u2019s hazardous journey across a treacherous suspension bridge.",
    "It is interesting to note here that Wickremesinghe balanced Israel and Palestine as he was one of the first world leaders to criticize the attack by Hamas, that started the current crisis. He reiterated support for the establishment of a Palestinian state [Daily Mirror, February 17, 2024], while opening an honorary consulate in Haifa, Israel [Daily Mirror, March 9. 2024].",
