### India gives NDA third term, Modi a message

India, June 5 (Indian Express) - The people have spoken and the NDA which claimed 294 Lok Sabha seats is set to return for a third term but the mandate is not exactly what Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spearheaded the BJP campaign, may have hoped for.

Contrary to exit polls that predicted a landslide for the ruling alliance, the BJP Tuesday fell short of a majority on its own – with 272 as the halfway in the House of 543, it won 240 seats – and appeared heavily dependent on alliance partners especially the TDP and JD(U), ending a decade of single-party dominance and heralding the return of a coalition government at the Centre.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing party workers at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi in the evening, hailed the mandate for the NDA and a successive third term: “For the first time since 1962, a government has returned for the third time after completing its two terms.”

### ‘Prosecutorial’ vs. ‘victim based’ approaches to accountability

Why is all the attention to address accountability only fixated on the Sri Lankan State and none on the LTTE?

Although violations by the Government forces and LTTE would be judged by Common Article 3, the fact remains that the leadership of the LTTE who ordered the taking of 300,000 plus civilians, hostage is not among the living or has disappeared, and cannot be subjected to a trial despite the fact that the act of taking civilians hostage amount to a war crime and a crime against humanity. Thus, the exercise of gathering evidence against Government perpetrators pales in significance compared with endangering the security of 300,000 plus civilians that were taken hostage. Despite this, a prosecutorial process would mean a skewed outcome of any trial because of the strong possibility that violations perpetrated by the Sri Lankan Government would dominate the trial

The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements

The concept of a legislated economic plan that incorporates economic parameters (or targets) is an opportunity to end 76 years of insanity. The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements. Opposing the concept is insanity and a disservice to future generations.

The Economic Transformation Bill is expected to provide for the National Policy on Economic Transformation and for the establishment of the Economic Commission of Sri Lanka, Investment Zones, Office for International Trade, National Productivity Commission, and Sri Lanka Institute of Economics and International Trade, and for the repeal of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No.4 of 1978 and other matters connected.

### Interventions of a freelance intellectual: A review of Dayan Jayatilleka’s selected writings

British philosopher and historian Perry Anderson defines Western Marxism as the product of defeat. Unlike in the Soviet Union and China, there were no successful Marxist revolutions in the West. The Western Marxist is then a vanquished and disenchanted figure. Never having known the taste and trials of success, the Western Marxist reduces socialism to an abstract ideal and an impotent exercise in scholasticism.

The theologian and Marxist scholar Roland Boer identifies the “freelance intellectual” as the chief proponent of Western Marxism. In short, the freelance intellectual is the academic, journalist, cultural critic, etc. who purveys a form of Marxist analysis but is, for the most part, independent of the discipline and accountability enforced by membership in a Communist Party or trade union. In China, to be a Communist means to be a Community Party member. In the West, one is free to adopt any label one pleases.

### Are we ready to accept our migrants again?

It is necessary to identify the silver lining of the current migration wave and harness the maximum benefit from Sri Lankan migrants for the country’s future prosperity

While accepting migration trends and waves, Sri Lanka must implement policies that encourage migrants to contribute back to the country. This could strengthen Sri Lankan society in two ways: demotivating unnecessary migration while embracing those who have migrated with the same fraternity. Given the global and historical trends, it is high time to establish state migration and diasporic policies to address these issues and turn brain drain into an opportunity

“Migration” is a prevalent topic in Sri Lanka today, affecting all social and age groups. It brings both positive and negative consequences for individuals who could be felt both short-term and long-term. While migration has recently come under the spotlight in Sri Lankan society, it is an age-old phenomenon with a vast global history.
