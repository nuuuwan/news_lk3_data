    "The central bank (CBSL) governor says Sri Lanka will have to go through another Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) strategy if the targets of the current plan are not achieved.",
    "Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe also noted that the DDO strategy announced by the government is strong enough to restore the country\u2019s debt sustainability.",
    "He made these remarks during the CEO Forum 2023 organized by the Chartered Financial Analysts of Sri Lanka on Friday (July 21) in Colombo.",
    "Addressing concerns about a second DDO strategy, the central bank governor said if the country deviates from the current path, there could be another domestic debt optimization as well as another default and bankruptcy.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t need another DDO because this DDO is quite strong enough and consistent with the targets to restore debt sustainability,\u201d he said adding that the fiscal policy, structural reforms and the growth path should move in conjunction with the domestic debt optimization plan.",
    "Dr. Weerasinghe said the Sri Lankan economy has the potential to overperform with growth levels of 4% - 5%, adding that it would will help restore country\u2019s debt sustainability in five\u00a0 years without waiting until 2032.",
    "The central bank governor is also confident that Sri Lanka will see single-digit inflation by the end of this month."
