### Republicans win majority of US House seats, giving Donald Trump and party control of Govt.

*2024-11-15 04:24:26* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Republicans-win-majority-of-US-House-seats-giving-Donald-Trump-and-party-control-of-Govt/56-769267) ┬╖ `en`

Republicans have won enough seats to control the US House, completing the partyтАЩs sweep into power and securing their hold on US Government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.

A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.

With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the Federal Government and swiftly implement TrumpтАЩs vision for the country.

The incoming President has promised to carry out the countryтАЩs largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the Federal GovernmentтАЩs most powerful tools and reshape the US economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.
