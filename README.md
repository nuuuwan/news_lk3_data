### Does the bashil take the hand on the hand?

*2024-05-12 17:55:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183322) · `ta`

Basil Rajapaksa, a key political figure, is known for his strategic maneuvers in Sri Lankan politics. Despite facing criticism and legal issues, he has demonstrated a knack for turning enemies into allies and vice versa, showcasing his ability to navigate the complex world of politics. His role in the unexpected appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in 2018, despite opposition, highlights his skill in political maneuvering. Basil is currently working to rebuild the PA party and aims to return the Rajapaksa family to power, employing various strategies to influence political outcomes. His approach to politics, characterized by efficiency and tact, serves as a lesson for other politicians.

🟩

Rajapaksa is one of the politicians who think of the finger of the sand and the rope.

This claim may not have agreement to many. It must be acknowledged that he has the ability to exceed any other politician in his politics and life or not.

This is not a praise for Bashil. Lesson that other politicians should learn in politics. In the 2015 presidential election, the defeat of the Rajapakse family is attributed to the autocraticity of the family. Such criticisms were openly presented.

Rajapaksa also had a significant share in Bashil. He is the one who left the hospital bed, not going to jail, although there are many corruption and fraud.

After the defeat of Mahinda, he created the PA and developed it in the next few years.

If the PA is strong in Sinhala politics today, Mahinda's leadership is not the only reason, but also Basil's efficient and tactfulness.

He is the one who can do anything for politics and power to make enemies a friend and an enemy of friends.

London, (AFP) - James Anderson will bow out as one of cricket's all-time greats when England face West Indies in July after becoming the first pace bowler to take 700 Test wickets.

The 41-year-old will bring down the curtain on a glorious Test career at Lord's, 21 years after his debut, as England head coach Brendon McCullum looks to build for the future with one eye on the 2025-26 Ashes.

"I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said on Saturday.

"But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."

Only two spinners, Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800 Test wickets) and the late Australia great Shane Warne (708), are ahead of Anderson on the all-time list of the five-day game's most successful bowlers.

Anderson joined the exclusive '700 club' in his 187th Test during England's tour of India earlier this year.

The Sri Lanka Tamil State Party has not yet issued any technical reports on the International Monetary Fund Agreements. District Parliamentarian President Attorney MA Sumanthiran said.

On behalf of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), I was invited to discuss with representatives of political parties regarding the Treaty with the International Monetary Fund.. Neither the main opposition nor the other parties have contributed to this meeting.

At this meeting, President Ranil Wickremesinghe promised to hand over a full technical report on the agreement with the IMF.

But until now he has not sent any such documents. Talks on the issue of debt renovation are currently coming out.

Therefore, the contents of the technical report are very important in domestic debt restructuring and foreign debt restructuring issues. I reiterate to reveal the technical report on that way.
