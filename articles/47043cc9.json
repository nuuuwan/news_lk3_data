    "As he celebrates his 80th birthday, it is only fitting to honour not just the decades of dedicated medical service Dr. Sarath has rendered, but the warmth, humility, and quiet heroism he embodies. His life stands as a testament to the noblest ideals of medicine, a healing hand extended with love, a listening ear, and a heart overflowing with compassion",
    "In one lifetime, we encounter innumerable people. They touch us in many ways. We remember them and are grateful, of course, but then there are individuals who leave a profound and indelible mark on us. They transform us. Such an individual is Dr. Sarath de Silva.",
    "Our paths first crossed thanks to a mutual friend in the media. From that initial meeting emerged a relationship grounded in trust and deep admiration, mostly mine for him. Literally tens of thousands have been attended to by Dr. Sarath. They too, no doubt, remember him as an extraordinarily compassionate paediatrician. In my case, he was with my children from the moment they took their first breath. How could he not be special, then?",
    "It didn\u2019t stop there. Today, although my family resides overseas and it is easy to seek and obtain medical care close to home, I still turn to Dr. Sarath frequently. Nothing puts my mind to rest and clears my doubts like his wise counsel. Obviously, his expertise as a physician counts. There is also the warmth of his friendship and the ways in which he makes one feel that he is a close family member. It seems to come naturally to him. Perhaps this is why he is loved so much by those whom he treats and, of course, their parents.",
    "Born amidst the tranquil beauty of Mirissa, Galle, Dr. Sarath\u2019s early years were filled with simplicity. His schooling began there before the family relocated to Veyangoda, where he continued his studies at Veyangoda Central College. From these modest beginnings, he would eventually embark on an illustrious journey into the world of medicine, characterised by unwavering excellence and heartfelt service. After graduating from Medical College in 1971, he chose to specialise in paediatrics, dedicating his life to safeguarding the health and well-being of children.",
    "Dr. Sarath\u2019s professional journey took him from the hallways of the Base Hospital in Chilaw to the wards of Karapitiya Hospital in Galle, where he served with tireless devotion for eight years, and thereafter to Ragama Hospital and, ultimately, the Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Colombo, the nation\u2019s premier paediatric institution.",
    "He is far more than a physician to our family; he is a steadfast beacon of reassurance, a pillar of strength in moments fraught with distress. His compassion is boundless, his commitment to medicine nothing short of extraordinary. In a world often propelled by personal gain, Dr. Sarath stands apart as a selfless healer, dedicated not to material rewards but to the sacred trust placed in him by his young patients and their families.",
    "Dr. Sarath probably considers me as one of the most anxious, difficult, and demanding of parents. And yet, on such occasions, Dr. Sarath inevitably met me with patience, kindness, and a calm clarity that soothed my fears. I have called him many times at the most unlikely hours, burdened by worries every parent knows too well, and unfailingly, his voice would calm my restless mind with gentle assurance.",
    "\u201cKrishantha, please don\u2019t worry. If you have any concerns, call me anytime. She is going to be fine.\u201d",
    "To me, it\u2019s almost like a holy benediction. The promise and the tone constitute one of the most precious gifts I have received. It has been a source of strength that has always helped me recover sanity in moments of mindless anxiety.",
    "I vividly recall the numerous times my children and children of my friends and relatives fell ill, when Dr. Sarath navigated those moments with unwavering composure and empathetic care. In such times of uncertainty, he has been, without question, the calmest and most comforting paediatrician one could hope to find.",
    "As he celebrates his 80th birthday, it is only fitting to honour not just the decades of dedicated medical service Dr. Sarath has rendered, but the warmth, humility, and quiet heroism he embodies. His life stands as a testament to the noblest ideals of medicine, a healing hand extended with love, a listening ear, and a heart overflowing with compassion.",
    "Some people stay in our hearts and minds, and we think of them in times of joy, sorrow, and gratitude. For us, Dr. Sarath and his wife, Dr. Lakshmi, are always at the very top of that list. It is noteworthy that both their children have also followed the noble path of medicine, a testament to a family tradition devoted to healing.",
    "On behalf of all whose lives he has touched, I extend my deepest gratitude and warmest wishes. May Dr. Sarath de Silva continue to inspire generations of doctors and alleviate the fears and anxieties of parents, and may he remain a shining example of service rendered with boundless love."
