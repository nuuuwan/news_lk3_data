The requests were sent to the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United Nations.

“In the absence of any criminal accountability to date, it is vital to document past and current crimes, analyse evidence, and use every available channel to assert the truth. We hope the UK will impose sanctions on Human Rights Day this year for alleged war crimes committed during the country’s conflict,” ITJP Executive Director Yasmin Sooka said.

They may still feel trapped in the same plight, and unless that perception is acknowledged, addressed, and their aspirations realised, the resurgence of dissent is not merely possible but inevitable

It is now 15 years since the end of a brutal 30-year conflict. Yet, we remain trapped in a cycle of grief, division, and mistrust. This cannot continue. If we do, we will head down a path to ruin.

A rare and golden opportunity stands before us now. The recently concluded general elections have sent a powerful message: our communities are ready to rise above the shackles of communal politics and chart a new course toward unity and hope.

Addressing the matter now has profound significance in view of the ‘Maaveerar Naal’ (Great Heroes Day) that fell on 27 November, and comments made by a newly appointed independent MP representing the Jaffna District. Both are related.

Things seem to be moving well in our beloved country and this is a great change from how things were before September and in the past years.  We could only wring our hands in consternation and cry out “When will our lives improve? When will Sri Lanka rise to be the country, we older ones knew?” We witnessed wanton extravagance in government spending; corruption all across the political and bureaucratic boards, and the poor getting poorer and more destitute.

Of course there is still criticism, which is as it should be. The NPP is far from a magic wand. Time is needed to show improvement in the general well-being of the people. What we need to have now is patience and faith in the new set of leaders we have elected to power.

(Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron met allies and parliament leaders on Thursday as he sought to swiftly appoint a new prime minister to replace Michel Barnier, who officially resigned a day after opposition lawmakers voted to topple his government.

The Elysee Palace said Macron had asked Barnier and his government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.

Three sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Macron aimed to appoint a replacement swiftly, with one saying he wanted to do so before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral - renovated after a devastating fire. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among world leaders expected to attend.
