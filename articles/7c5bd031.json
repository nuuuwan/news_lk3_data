  "original_body_lines": [
    "Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba yesterday announced he was stepping down after less than a year in the role, following two major election losses, the BBC reported.",
    "The move comes a day before his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was expected to vote on whether to hold an internal leadership vote that could have forced him out.",
    "The LDP has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades, but under Ishiba, it lost its majority in the lower house for the first time in 15 years and then lost its majority in the upper house in July.",
    "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth largest economy and a key US ally, now faces a period of political uncertainty as tensions rise with China and regional insecurity mounts.",
    "\u201cNow that a conclusion has been reached in the negotiations concerning the US tariff measures, I believe this is precisely the appropriate time,\u201d Ishiba said, referring to a deal signed last week to ease tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese cars and other exports.",
    "Until yesterday, he had resisted calls to resign, saying it was his responsibility to settle the dispute with Washington before stepping down.",
    "\u201cI have strongly believed that negotiations concerning the US tariff measures, which could be described as a national crisis, must be brought to a conclusion under our administration\u2019s responsibility,\u201d he said.",
    "The 68-year-old said he would continue his responsibilities \u201cto the people\u201d until a successor was selected.",
    "The LDP will now choose a new leader, who will become Prime Minister following a vote in Parliament.",
    "Ishiba, who took office in October 2024 promising to tackle rising prices, struggled to inspire confidence as the country faced economic headwinds, a cost-of-living crisis, and fractious politics with the US.",
    "Inflation, particularly the doubling of rice prices in the past year, was politically damaging.",
    "Public support further slid after a series of controversies, including criticism of his decision to appoint only two women to his Cabinet and handing out expensive gifts to party members, the BBC reported."
