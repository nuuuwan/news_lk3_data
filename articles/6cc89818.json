    "A cargo ship lost power and rammed into a major bridge in Baltimore, USA early Tuesday, destroying the span in a matter of seconds and plunging it into the river in a terrifying collapse that could disrupt a vital shipping port for months. Six people were missing and presumed dead, and the search for them was suspended until Wednesday morning.",
    "The ship\u2019s crew issued a mayday call moments before the crash took down the Francis Scott Key Bridge, enabling authorities to limit vehicle traffic on the span, Maryland\u2019s governor said.",
    "As the vessel neared the bridge, puffs of black smoke could be seen as the lights flickered on and off. It struck one of the bridge\u2019s supports, causing the structure to collapse like a toy, and a section of the span came to rest on the bow.",
    "With the ship barreling toward the bridge at \u201ca very, very rapid speed,\u201d authorities had just enough time to stop cars from coming over the bridge, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said.",
    "\u201cThese people are heroes,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThey saved lives last night.\u201d",
    "In the evening, Col. Roland L. Butler Jr., superintendent for Maryland State Police, announced that the search and rescue mission was transitioning to one of search and recovery. He also said the search was being put on pause and divers would return to the site at 6 a.m. Wednesday, when challenging overnight conditions were expected to improve. No bodies have been recovered, Butler said.",
    "The crash happened in the middle of the night, long before the busy morning commute on the bridge that stretches 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) and was used by 12 million vehicles last year.",
    "The six missing people were part of a construction crew filling potholes on the bridge, said Paul Wiedefeld, the state\u2019s transportation secretary.",

    "And the Washington Consulate of Mexico said via the social media platform X that citizens of that nation were also among the missing. It did not say how many.",
    "A senior executive at the company that employed the workers also said, in the afternoon, that the workers were presumed dead given the water\u2019s depth and how much time had passed.",
    "Jeffrey Pritzker, executive vice president of Brawner Builders, said the crew was working in the middle of the bridge when it came down.",
    "\u201cThis was so completely unforeseen,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what else to say. We take such great pride in safety, and we have cones and signs and lights and barriers and flaggers.\u201d",
    "Jesus Campos, who has worked on the bridge for Brawner Builders and knows members of the crew, said he was told they were on a break and some were sitting in their trucks.",
    "\u201cI know that a month ago, I was there, and I know what it feels like when the trailers pass,\u201d Campos said. \u201cImagine knowing that is falling. It is so hard. One would not know what to do.\u201d",
    "Father Ako Walker, a Roman Catholic priest at Sacred Heart of Jesus, said he spent time with the families of the missing workers as they waited for news of their loved ones.",
    "Rescuers pulled two people out of the water, one of whom was treated at a hospital and discharged hours later. Multiple vehicles also went into the river, although authorities did not believe anyone was inside.",

    "A police dispatcher put out a call just before the collapse saying a ship had lost its steering and asked officers to stop all traffic on the bridge, according to Maryland Transportation Authority first responder radio traffic obtained from the Broadcastify.com archive.",
    "One officer who stopped traffic radioed that he was going to drive onto the bridge to alert the construction crew. But seconds later, a frantic officer said: \u201cThe whole bridge just fell down. Start, start whoever, everybody ... the whole bridge just collapsed.\u201d",
    "On a separate radio channel for maintenance and construction workers, someone said officers were stopping traffic because a ship had lost steering. There was no follow-up order to evacuate, and 30 seconds later the bridge fell and the channel went silent.",
    "From 1960 to 2015, there were 35 major bridge collapses worldwide due to ship or barge collisions, according to the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure.",
    "Tuesday\u2019s collapse is sure to create a logistical nightmare along the East Coast for months, if not years, shutting down ship traffic at the Port of Baltimore, a major hub. The loss of the bridge will also snarl cargo and commuter traffic.",
    "\u201cLosing this bridge will devastate the entire area, as well as the entire East Coast,\u201d state Sen. Johnny Ray Salling said.",
    "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a news conference that it was too soon to estimate how long it will take to clear the channel, which is about 50 feet (15 meters) deep.",

    "Synergy said all crew members and the two pilots on board were accounted for, and there were no reports of any injuries.",
    "The ship was moving at 8 knots, roughly 9 mph (14.8 kph), the governor said.",
    "Inspectors found a problem with the Dali\u2019s machinery in June, but a more recent examination did not identify any deficiencies, according to the shipping information system Equasis.",
    "Danish shipping giant Maersk said it had chartered the vessel.",
    "Jagged remnants of the bridge could be seen jutting up from the water in the aftermath of the collapse. The on-ramp ended abruptly where the span once began.",
    "Donald Heinbuch, a retired chief with Baltimore\u2019s fire department, said he was startled awake by a deep rumbling that shook his house for several seconds and \u201cfelt like an earthquake.\u201d He drove to the river\u2019s edge and couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.",
    "\u201cThe ship was there, and the bridge was in the water, like it was blown up,\u201d he said.",
    "The bridge spans the Patapsco River at the entrance to the busy harbor, which leads to the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean. Opened in 1977, the bridge is named for the writer of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d",

    "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the port of Baltimore that\u2019s going to be impacted,\u201d said Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport.",
    "The collapse, though, is not likely to hurt worldwide trade because Baltimore is not a major port for container vessels. its its facilities are more important when it comes to goods such as farm equipment and autos, said Judah Levine, head of research for global freight booking platform Freightos."
