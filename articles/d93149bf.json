    "In recent years, Sri Lanka has taken significant strides in its battle against corruption, marked by the transformation of the once exclusively Government-focused Bribery Act into the more comprehensive Anti-Corruption Act. This legislative evolution now extends the arm of accountability to encompass private sector entities, marking a pivotal shift in the nation\u2019s anti-corruption landscape.",
    "Under the amended Anti-Corruption Act, private sector individuals, such as purchasing managers, are now subject to scrutiny and potential legal ramifications for engaging in bribery. The Sri Lankan Anti-Corruption Authority wields authority to investigate and prosecute such offenses, signalling a newfound commitment to root out corruption across all sectors.",
    "However, the impact of these measures transcends individual accountability, exerting significant pressure on the companies employing implicated individuals.

    "Several leading companies in Sri Lanka have already embraced these principles, integrating ant-corruption initiatives into their corporate ethos. However, in the absence of specific local regulations, adopting international best practices becomes imperative. Drawing from global standards, companies can enhance their anti-corruption measures by implementing rigorous compliance protocols and whistleblower protection mechanisms.",
    "In essence, as Sri Lanka navigates its anti-corruption journey, the private sector\u2019s proactive engagement in combating bribery is not only a legal obligation but also a strategic imperative for sustaining trust, integrity, and competitiveness in the global marketplace. By adhering to robust anti-corruption measures, companies can safeguard their reputation while contributing to a culture of transparency and accountability essential for long-term economic prosperity.",
