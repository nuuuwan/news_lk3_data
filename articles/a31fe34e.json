    "Presidential Candidate of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance and leader of the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera proposes the establishment of an authority on national strategic framework planning under the strategic framework proposed by his alliance.",
    "Addressing a gathering attended by intellectuals and entrepreneurs, at the MJP Headquarters in Colombo, Jayaweera expressed confidence that that his proposal is capable of achieving national priorities and objectives within a specific period of time.",
    "Speaking further, Dilith Jayaweera said: \u201cThe presidential election has been announced. Sajith Premadasa, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Namal Rajapaksa are contesting. All of those candidates held cabinet portfolios in the past\u201d",
    "\u201cOnce, Anura Kumara was a powerful cabinet minister. He held massive power through his portfolio of Agriculture Minister compared to other agriculture ministers in the past. The situation with Namal Rajapaksa is also the same. He held five ministerial portfolios.\u201d",
    "\u201cThose very same people propose changes to be made in this country. Anura Kumara is the biggest fraudster. Indirectly, he has supported each and every government. He has directly served in two governments\u201d, Jayaweera added.",
    "\u201cThe proportionate representation system was one of the factors behind the spread of corruption in this country. Other than objecting to the proposals introduced, have they introduced at least one proposal to change this corrupt political system? That is because they are part of this corrupt political system.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, the MJP leader also said that Ranil Wickremesinghe, under the guise of the symbol of a gas cylinder, is trying to secure votes by instilling fear in the people while highlighting the possibility of gas queues forming in the future.",
    "\u201cHe is supported by those who created gas queues\u201d, he expressed.",
    "\u201cSajith Premadasa mentioned a list of proposals to change the education system. However, he did not have a proper agenda to that end. Anura Kumara said fuel prices will be reduced under their government. He said the VAT imposed on stationery items will be reduced. Do we need a President to do that? Is this what a President should tell his people?\u201d, Jayaweera questioned.",
    "Furthermore, the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 presidential candidate stated that the most important concept of their framework is the establishment of an authority on national strategic framework planning.",
    "\u201cWhat we propose is a central authority that facilitates the achievement of national priorities and objectives within a specific period of time\u201d, he said, adding that the country requires this authority to ensure that the ministers do not act the way they want.",
    "\u201cWe expect strategic frameworks of this nature from the presidential candidates. We do not expect them to deceive people through their traditional methods\u201d, he emphasised."
