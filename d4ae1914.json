    "Minneapolis ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, convicted in the murder of George Floyd, is reported to be in a stable condition after he was stabbed at an Arizona prison.",
    "The city\u2019s police chief and Minnesota\u2019s attorney general confirmed the news.",
    "Chauvin, who is white, is serving multiple sentences for the black man\u2019s death, which triggered huge protests against police brutality and racism.",
    "A source told AP the 47-year-old was seriously injured by another inmate.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons confirmed in a statement that an inmate at a federal prison in the city of Tucson was stabbed at 12:30 local time (19:30 GMT) on Friday.",
    "The agency said employees contained the incident and \u201clife-saving measures\u201d were performed on the inmate, who was then taken to hospital. The name of the prisoner was not given.",
    "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, quoted by CNN, confirmed that Chauvin had been stabbed and said he was in a stable condition.",
    "\u201cI am sad to hear that Derek Chauvin was the target of violence,\u201d Mr Ellison told CNN, in a statement from his office. \u201cHe was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence.\u201d",
    "The state attorney general\u2019s office had prosecuted Chauvin in the George Floyd case.",
    "News of Chauvin\u2019s condition was confirmed by Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara, who told local TV station KSTP-TV that he received the update from \u201cfederal law enforcement partners\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re thankful that he\u2019s in a stable condition,\u201d he said, adding \u201canyone who\u2019s assaulted like this, regardless of what they\u2019ve been accused of, deserve to be safe and that\u2019s certainly not cause for any celebration.\u201d",
    "The news comes days after the Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Chauvin, in which it was argued that he had not received a fair trial for the killing of Mr Floyd - who died after the former officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes in 2020.",
    "The killing in Minneapolis - captured on a bystander\u2019s phone camera - sparked global outrage and a wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police use of force.",
    "Chauvin was later found guilty of Mr Floyd\u2019s murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. He was given a further 20-year sentence in July 2022 for violating Mr Floyd\u2019s civil rights."
