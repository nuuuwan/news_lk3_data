  "original_body_lines": [
    "Removing or killing animals to control their population is not correct and it directly affects the balance of nature, advisor to the Association of Veterinarians for Humane Management of Animal Population, Dr. Chamith Nanayakkara said.",
    "When controlling the animal population, we should consider the balance of nature, he emphasised.",
    "\"If we try to control a certain animal population without planning and unintentionally, the result will be very dangerous.",
    "\"Taking or killing animals is applicable if there is a population that cannot be controlled, or else it is not practical.",
    "\"As an association, we oppose removing animals from the country as the first solution without doing a proper research or analysis. The country never tried to get any analytical reports; instead, the animals were shot dead,\" he said.",
    "\"As far as I know, solutions were presented by the Wild Life Department before sending monkeys to China.\"",
    "However, the doctor advised the relevant persons not to take these animals' lives to fulfill their political agendas. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
