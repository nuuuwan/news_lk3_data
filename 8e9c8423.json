    "\u201cThe world has flattened,\u201d he told a forum in Colombo. \u201cOur clients are comfortable with the model of having smart, intelligent talent pools, not from their home locations in New York, London, Hong Kong or the Middle East, but to use locations like, Sri Lanka, India or Costa Rica.\u201d",
    "Compared to December 2019 the Colombo head count had doubled now to around 500. In the next two to three years the firm wants to grow to a 1000-person organization in Colombo.",
    "\u201cSo, we need another 500 resources to add to this pool,\u201d Jeyaretnam said. \u201cWith the current situation in the country, we are seeing a lot of people leave so we have a significant attrition rate.",
    "\u201cWe roughly need about 200 people to join the firm every year for the next three to four years to meet this number.\u201d",

    "Acuity has moved further from the original investment research analysis, is now supporting commercial banks and engaging in compliance work.",
    "The firm has also built a technology platform and grown IT support teams.",
    "Commercial banking, called the lending services, is a fast growing area with 800 people. The sector will also drive growth in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe career prospects are much wider than what we always thought the firm was offering,\u201d Jeyaretnam said.",
    "\u201cWe are now offering careers to people with solid marketing skills, solid creativity skills, who can do web designing and who have an understanding about finance to come and work with our financial marketing services division.\u201d",
    "Emerging areas where skills are in demand include sustainability linked bonds, like Green bonds.",
    "Acuity alumni have also joined some of the global corporations that the firm supports.",
    "Globally 37 percent of the staff was female, but it was 50 percent in Colombo. The average age was 30.",
    "\u201cI think it will come down again with the next hiring wave we are planning.\u201d",
    "Acuity has built partnerships with universities in Sri Lanka and other professional organizations like CFA Sri Lanka and CIMA.",
    "Acuity is looking for individuals with the \u201cright qualification, right skills and the right attitude,\u201d Nuwan Jayawardana, who is driving university outreach at the company says.",
