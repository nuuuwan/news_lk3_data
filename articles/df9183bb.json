    "Nowadays, our artistes give the impression that projecting themselves on social media with music videos that primarily highlight their dancing ability is mandatory for their popularity.",
    "However, the question being asked is are they singers or dancers? Their new venture is not going to give them international success and, by international success, I mean making their presence felt where it matters most \u2013 the international charts \u2026 and global recognition.",
    "Take for instance K-pop \u2026 yes, our music scene has been around long before K-pop cropped up but K-pop is now streets ahead of us, dominating the international scene, and the charts, as well.",
    "K-pop\u2019s global success can be attributed to several key factors where their agencies have effectively utilised platforms, like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, to reach international audiences, releasing high-quality music videos, behind-the-scenes content, and interactive fan experiences.",
    "Collaborations with Western artistes, like Halsey, Dua Lipa, and Travis Scott, have also introduced K-pop to new audiences, blending K-pop\u2019s signature sounds with global pop, hip-hop, and EDM elements.",
    "What\u2019s more, K-pop\u2019s focus on polished production quality, intricate choreography, and visually stunning music videos, has set new standards for the music industry, influencing artistes and producers worldwide.",
    "K-pop groups regularly embark on world tours, performing in major cities across North America, Europe, and Latin America, solidifying their international fanbase.",
    "With groups like BTS, BLACKPINK, and Stray Kids dominating international charts and breaking records, K-pop\u2019s influence on the global music industry is undeniable.",
    "Alston Koch, now residing in Australia, and Bill Forbes, who migrated to England, are both notable Sri Lankan singers who have made significant contributions to the music industry.",
    "Known as \u2018Asia\u2019s King of Pop\u2019 due to his international success in the late 1970s, Alston Koch achieved success in countries like Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Sri Lanka",
    "According to reports, he has released 21 singles and four albums through record labels like RCA, BMG, EMI, and Sony.",
    "He has also received many international awards and served as Ambassador for Tourism for Sri Lanka and Ambassador for Climate Change",
    "Bill Forbes, considered one of the first Sri Lankan solo artistes to secure a recording contract and achieve a hit recording outside of Sri Lanka, released 16 singles, with his main hit being \u2018Too Young\u2019.",
    "Perhaps our music does blend traditional and modern elements, which can be unique, but it will not appeal to a broader global audience without adaptation or fusion with international styles.",
    "To bridge this gap, our folks need to work with artistes from other countries, or genres, to create fusion music that appeals to a broader audience.",
    "If we don\u2019t do it differently, like K-pop, our artistes will remain unknown in the scene that matters \u2026 only catering to Sri Lankans, even when they embark on overseas tours,",
