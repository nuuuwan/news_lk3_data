ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì In the Asia Pacific, including Sri Lanka, women are more likely to be in care employment compared to men, a UN Women‚Äôs latest report finds.

‚ÄúFor some this is a choice; for others it is not,‚Äù UN Women said.

Ageing populations are likely to put pressure on fiscal systems with rising demands for costly care services, such as long-term care, the report found.

‚ÄúPopulation projections for the Asia-Pacific region anticipate an important demographic shift with significant implications for societies and economies in the region,‚Äù the report states.

‚ÄúThe low fertility rates observed in several countries coupled with low mortality rates have raised questions ‚Äì especially in fast-ageing societies, such as in Eastern Asia ‚Äì about who will provide long-term care for older

people, a traditional role of women and girls within families.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, candidate of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and National Peoples Power (NPP) front, has been elected as President of Sri Lanka in the election held on September 24. His election is a proof that the Aragalaya, the spontaneous mass protests in May 2022 was no flash in the pan. Anura‚Äôs campaign focused on the youth, who had rallied together during Aragalaya protests and successfully converted them into votes. However, Anura does not seem to have understood the younger generations‚Äô discontent against the existing political class and systems that generated Aragalaya protests. His speeches in the run up to the election focused on providing corruption free administration. His detailed election manifesto titled ‚ÄúA Prosperous Nation, A Beautiful Life‚Äù gives a summary of plans for the development of various sectors, including engineering, IT, the economy, social issues, education, and health. But speaks of no systemic changes.
