    "Based on the Central Bank data, Verit\u00e9 Research yesterday pointed out that Sri Lanka\u2019s interest payments had reached their highest levels in 2022.",
    "This increase in interest payments suggests a significant debt burden on the government. The ratio of interest payments to total government revenue has surged from 35 percent in 2015 to a striking 78 percent in 2022.",
    "Notably, there was a substantial rise in interest payments between 2019 and 2020, with payments escalating from 47 percent to 71 percent, mainly due to a substantial fall in government revenue, as a result of the tax cuts in late 2019 and early 2020.",
