    "At the completion of 2 successful years in service as President, Clive de Silva Jr stepped down from his post to hand over the reins to Sanjiv Alles. The CCCC has navigated through some challenging times during Clive de Silva Jr\u2019s tenure and has continued to grow both in stature and reach. He will continue to serve the club in his capacity as Immediate Past President.",
    "Sanjiv Alles is the eighth President in the club\u2019s three decade-long history, and has been a part of the CCCC from a young age. Sanjiv has served in the club\u2019s committee as Assistant Treasurer, Treasurer, and Vice President to date and has played an integral part in organizing some of the club\u2019s flagship events, and with this new position looks forward to taking the club forward from strength to strength.",

They will continue to support and advise the club as consultants. The CCCC thanks them for their invaluable contribution to the club.
