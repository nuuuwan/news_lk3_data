    "Colombo, Jan. 17 (Daily Mirror)- The Supreme Court decision on Duminda Silva has further proved that former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa had failed in all what he had done during his two year tenure, where he even failed to exercise powers vested in him to grant Presidential pardon, former MP Hirunika Premachandra said today.",
    "She told a news conference that Gotabaya Rajapaksa was so ignorant even being unable to adopt the due procedures in granting a Presidential pardon.",
    "Ms. Premachandra said Gotabaya Rajapaksa had given in to the pressure by Duminda Silva's faction and had signed the document to grant Duminda a Presidential pardon and ultimately had ended up being humiliated.",
    "She said the Supreme Court decision also proved that truth will prevail someday, overpowering any financial, political or media power.",
    "When asked what if a next President elect gives him a Presidential pardon again, she said she never thinks a next President would do something to get humiliated again."
