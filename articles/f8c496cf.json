  "original_body_lines": [
    "The traditional way of teaching religion in sanctimonious isolation has much room for improvement if we are to produce a sober citizen who can rise above petty religious identity.",
    "Critical thinking is the buzz word in education, which is a primary determinant of social progress. Moving towards a better society may not be possible if we resist change and continue to follow the hoary conventions. To be in the same rut is easy but we cannot afford that luxury and expect any positive change in anything we wish to see progress. With respect to education, any meaningful change in learning outcomes can come only if much valued critical thinking prevails from the first stages of curriculum planning.",
    "Teaching religion in schools in the traditional way \u2013 that is, teaching the religion to the students who have already acquired the same religion through socially authorised programming of children from their early years \u2013 has been the practice from time immemorial. If one of the expected learning outcomes of this was to make the students memorise more material about their respective religion, many would concede that it has served the purpose. However, it has done little to boost their critical thinking, urge them to take an interest in other religions in the country or increase their empathy with those who have acquired those others because of chance. If students today are becoming more and more tolerant of other faiths, it is not because of teaching religion in the traditional way, but despite it \u2013 meaning, despite the conventional methods of religious programming and teaching religion later in segregation in schools. As a result of this inescapable programming in childhood, we grow up to believe that those who have other religions are simply less fortunate than us; they should have chosen their parents wisely.",
    "If teaching religion in schools is to transcend its narrow scope of making students more aware of their acquired religions and contribute towards promoting religious harmony, the conventional teaching method of religious isolationism practised thus far may have to change. Those who are truly sensitised by their religions would not be able to dismiss this proposal out of hand if they were to hope for a more united society where religions could be used for inculcating more empathy and heal wounds.",
    "Religious faith is synonymous with its inflexible and sanctified method of initiating children into their parents\u2019 religion. The removal of this method means the end of the spread of faith along the family line. The suspension of this archaic indoctrination, whose pros and cons have not been critically examined thus far due to obvious reasons, will allow children to study a few major religions more objectively with their continually maturing brains, as and when they are suitably introduced in school as part of their curriculum. The introduction of \u2018religions\u2019 instead of the \u2018truest\u2019 religion, which has already been drilled into children before they start school, becomes important because the weening away of our toddlers from socially entrenched indoctrination is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. As matters stand, the parents of any faith would try to prevent their children from learning other religions. Moreover, asking students, who are already programmed in one religion, to learn other religions in school would not be very different from telling them to move freely after making them wear a permanent straitjacket. Religion, whatever it has taught, has not broadened people\u2019s outlook to see other faiths without bias.",
    "Let\u2019s look at language acquisition which happens parallel to the acquisition of religion during infancy. As linguists tell us, being exposed to only one language, as a child, is a deprivation rather than an advantage. Children who are exposed to more than one language are better equipped to move in a multicultural society and stand to gain other benefits, including the ability to learn more languages with more ease later. However, exposure to more than one religion is almost impossible because all parents guard their children against such \u2018depravity\u2019, whatever we choose to say in public about respecting other religions. Such a negative attitude towards other religions is not surprising, given the influence of early indoctrination.",
    "A religion is sure to be distilled to philosophy if you remove the faith factor from it. And faith is the necessary outcome of programming in infancy. If we agree that religion should continue to play its traditional role of keeping us tied to a specific set of beliefs and rituals, then we can go on without expecting societies to do any better. If we are convinced that all the major religions of the world can do little to stop what\u2019s happening in Gaza right now and that all that instilling of faith in our youngest citizens has nothing to do with human cruelty, well, then, we can try a new approach to teaching religion.",
    "If we aim at making a more empathetic society through religion, some changes are necessary sooner than later. The very opposition that may be unavoidable at the mere mention of any suggestion to change the traditional approach to religion would imply that there may be better ways of making it serve humanity.",
    "Religion is often regarded as the purveyor of ethics. However, it is obvious that our codified ethics occupy a secluded space in our minds and that people generally have a more nuanced understanding of when and where to use ethics and how much of it is expedient at any given moment. This is why ethics should be taken out of its calcified and codified state and discussed in relation to evolving human relationships. As such it would be better to discuss ethics as a separate subject in class rather than getting students to memorise them and repeat them piously under different religions.",
    "And, as for teaching religion in schools, perhaps, the more religions the young learners learn using their critical thinking skills and other cognitive tools available to them, the more sober they are likely to be as they grow up. The traditional way of teaching religion in sanctimonious isolation has much room for improvement if we are to produce a sober citizen who can rise above petty religious identity.",
