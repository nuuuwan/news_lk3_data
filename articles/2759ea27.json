    "Environment Minister Dr. Dhammika Patabendi has underlined Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to forging a strong and effective global plastic treaty, while stressing that only decisive international cooperation can address the scale of the crisis.",
    "Speaking in Geneva at the ministerial-level roundtable of the second part of the Fifth Session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC-5.2), the minister said Sri Lanka is already implementing ambitious national strategies, but faces constraints that make global solidarity indispensable.",
    "The INC-5.2 session, taking place from August 5 to 14, 2025, brings together environment ministers, negotiators, and experts from around the world to craft a legally binding international instrument aimed at ending plastic pollution. Sri Lanka\u2019s delegation, led by Dr. Patabendi and Ministry Secretary Rohitha Uduwawala, includes two representatives from the Central Environmental Authority.",
    "Dr. Patabendi said Sri Lanka\u2019s National Plastic Waste Management Action Plan 2021\u20132030 represents a clear, structured pathway to tackle plastic waste at the national level. \u201cThe launch of this plan is strategically important for the conservation of our ecosystems, he noted, adding that it outlines steps ranging from strengthening waste segregation at source to expanding recycling capacity, while encouraging innovation in biodegradable materials.",
    "Central to this approach, he stressed, is the mobilisation of communities. \u201cWith the support of various stakeholders, awareness programmes are being implemented across Sri Lanka to encourage behavioural changes and community participation, the minister said. \u201cIt is only when people understand their role in preventing plastic pollution that real progress can be made.\u201d",
    "However, Dr. Patabendi also highlighted the persistent challenges that hinder progress. He pointed to gaps in financial resources, technological expertise, and waste management infrastructure, as well as the lack of formal recognition for the informal recycling sector, which plays a critical role in collecting and processing plastics. \u201cAddressing these gaps will require targeted investment and international partnerships, he said.",
