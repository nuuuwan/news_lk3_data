    "In stock exchange filing claims no bribery charges against Gautam Adani, nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain as per DoJ indictment",
    "Trio not charged with violation(s) of US FCPA, excluded from FCPA charges by US DoJ",
    "Only Azure and CDPQ officials charged with bribery in US DoJ indictment",
    "All news reports claiming Adani officials charged of bribery or corruption \u2018Incorrect\u2019, insists Adani Green Energy",
    "Gautam Adani, nephew Sagar Adani, and Senior Executive Vneet Jaain are clear of any bribery charges as per the US Department of Justice (DoJ), according to the latest filing with stock exchanges by a Group company \u2013 Adani Green Energy Ltd. (AGEL).",
    "In its filing, AGEL has cited news reports by various media houses on the bribery and corruption charges against Adani officials \u2018Incorrect\u2019.",
    "\u201cMedia articles which state that certain of our directors, namely Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain, have been charged with violation(s) of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the indictment are incorrect,\u201d said the statement filed by AGEL. \u201cGautam Adani, Sagar Adani and, Vneet Jaain have not been charged with any violation of the FCPA in the counts set forth in the indictment of the US DoJ or civil complaint of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),\u201d it added.",
    "In a legal indictment, count refers to individual charges against a defendant.",
    "The DoJ indictment, which has five counts, does not have any mention of and has excluded Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, or Vneet Jaain in Count One: \u2018Conspiracy to violate the FCPA\u2019; neither does it have mention of these three names in Count Five: \u2018Conspiracy to obstruct justice\u2019 (p. 41).",
    "Count One of the indictment, which refers to the corruption and bribery charges, only involves Ranjit Gupta, Cyril Cabanes, Saurabh Agarwal, Deepak Malhotra, and Rupesh Agarwal of Azure Power and CDPQ (Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec \u2013 a Canadian institutional investor and Azure\u2019s largest shareholder). No Adani official has been named by the DoJ under this.",
    "However, flawed understanding of the DoJ indictment by various media \u2013 foreign as well as Indian \u2013 has led to incorrect and reckless reporting of Adani Directors being charged with corruption and bribery under one or of all five counts by the US DoJ and SEC.",
    "Adani officials are only charged with Count Two: \u2018Alleged securities fraud conspiracy\u2019, Count Three: \u2018Alleged wire fraud conspiracy\u2019, and Count Four: \u2018Alleged securities fraud.\u2019",
    "The DoJ indictment offers no evidence that bribes were paid by Adani Executives to Indian Government officials; the indictment and the complaint solely rest on claims that bribes were promised or discussed.",
    "\u201cAll of this is based on likelihoods and hearsay from former employees of Azure Power and CDPQ \u2013 places the US DoJ\u2019s and US SEC\u2019s action against Adani are on dangerously shaky ground \u2013 both morally and legally.\u201d",
    "The ill-founded US action and reckless false reporting have led to significant repercussions for the Indian conglomerate, such as international project cancellations, financial market impact, and sudden examination from strategic partners, investors, and the public.",
    "Adani \u2013 In direct competition with the US and Chinese majors",
    "Adani Group is India\u2019s largest infrastructure player with sizeable operations in the global energy and logistics space. Over the past few years, the Indian conglomerate has been expanding its operations in international markets and directly competes with several US and Chinese entities in Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Israel, Australia, etc.",
    "Since the intimation of the US DoJ indictment, the Group has suffered a loss of nearly $ 55 billion in its market capitalisation across its 11 listed companies."
