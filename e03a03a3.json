  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Bank account ownership among Sri Lanka\u2019s poor would rise to 71 percent if the Samurdhi welfare scheme was brought under the formal banking system, research by LIRNEasia found.",
    "At present, 60 percent of adults living in poverty own an account with a bank, according to LIRNEasia, a regional policy research organisation. Adults who own either a formal bank account or a Samurdhi bank account make up 71 percent of the poor.",
    "The research showed that Samurdhi beneficiaries spend an average of four hours a month collecting their benefits. The 2023 budget speech indicated that welfare payments would be made through banks, going forward.",
    "\u201cAt present we encourage an increase in the number of payment points. This does not only apply to state banks but to private banks as well,\u201d Welfare Benefits Board Chairman B Wijayarathne said.",
    "There are currently 1,050 Samurdhi \u201cbanks\u201d in Sri Lanka though they are not formally recognised as banks as they do not fall under the preview of the Central Bank. In May 2023, the government announced that it was attempting to impose regulations on Samurdhi banks and give beneficiaries the option to either collect their benefits from Central Bank approved Samurdhi Banks or existing banks.
