*2024-12-19 02:47:41* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Childhood-bullying-and-economic-impact/14-770709) · `en`

Scars from bullying in schools are permanent, some are on medications, and it has led to a very poor quality of life

Bullying is when someone repeatedly and on purpose hurts someone else who is usually weaker than them. As a society we have repeatedly pointed fingers at the political class for their poor behaviour. Recent election results suggest we decided to do something about it. Few have had the courage to look at a more sinister problem staring them straight in the face. Most people either have first-hand experience or witnessed bullying during their time in school and have chosen to ignore or supress those memories.

Child protection has become a national crisis in our paradise island

Stop Child Cruelty Trust (SCCT) and Child Protection Alliance (CPA) comprising 13 credible organisations committed to protect and promote the rights of children have appealed to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to elevate child welfare to the heart of national governance ushering a new dawn firmly focusing on the true beneficiaries of the future, our children first.

The ‘Summary proposal for the protection and promotion of child rights – A dawn of a new era’ highlights that citizens under the age of 18 years constitute 25% of Sri Lanka’s population. Although Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1991, child protection has become a national crisis in our paradise island. The proposal defines the objectives that GOSL should focus on as short-term (0-6 months), medium-term (6 months-2 years) and long-term (2-4 years).

### Sharing empathy with children this festive season

The Christmas season is a special time filled with joy, excitement, and giving. However, this year, the festive season occurs during a period of global complexity, including the cost-of-living crisis and the absence of peace in many regions. Parents might use this time to teach children about empathy and kindness as an alternative approach to the joy of giving. It is meaningful to remind younger individuals that giving takes many forms—kindness, listening, perspective, and joy. While many children eagerly await gifts from the North Pole, it is important for them to recognise that the season encompasses much more than wrapped presents.

### Lessons from Bangladesh’s foreign power purchases

Why are these countries scrambling for dollars to pay for essential electricity?

The core question all energy-importing countries face is dependence. Modern societies cannot function without electricity. The cost of not having electricity is almost always higher than even the cost of buying emergency power. How can a government allow such matters to be controlled by foreign companies or governments?

“Did you hear that Adani is refusing to supply Bangladesh with electricity?” a friend asked me recently. I knew it was a loaded question, my friend being a nationalist. “You recall we had no power because we couldn’t pay for shiploads of fuel and coal just a few years back?” I asked back.

### 90 Days Of AKD’s Presidency

*2024-12-18 17:04:59* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/90-days-of-akds-presidency/) · `en`

The first 90 days of the President’s tenure serves as a prelude to the leadership expected over the next five years. While initial steps like limiting expenses and curbing waste were commendable, the government has failed to deliver clear solutions to key issues impacting the people. This period highlights the administration’s shortcomings, particularly in planning, risk assessment, and crisis management when addressing critical matters.

One of the most pressing failures of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s government is the inability to recognise and confront the deep-rooted control of state machinery by Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe loyalists. For the last three decades—since 1994 under Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Ranil Wickremesinghe—government offices, public institutions, military, police, and the foreign service have been systematically filled with political appointees, loyalists, and close confidantes of these regimes.
