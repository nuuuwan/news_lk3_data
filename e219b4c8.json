    "Yes, 31st night celebrations turned out to be quite a big scene for Sri Lankans, both here and abroad.",
    "In Sri Lanka, there was something happening here, there and everywhere, but not all came up to expectation.",
    "There were complains that there was an overdose of baila, at some venues, while others lamented that the build up to the dawning of the New Year lacked gaiety and excitement\u2026at certain places.",
    "\u201cThe music wasn\u2019t quite right for us to waltz into 2024,\u201d said one of the 31st night revellers.",
    "However, the 31st night bash, at the Mount Lavinia Hotel, turned out to be amazing.",
    "The hotel was transformed into a carnival atmosphere for their New Year\u2019s gala, aptly titled \u2018A Night in Copacabana.\u2019",
    "From the moment guests stepped onto the Terrace, they were enveloped in a world of colour and celebration. The energy was infectious, as everyone moved into top gear and immersed themselves in the festivities.",
    "Suzi Suzi Fl\u00fcckiger (Croner): Rebooked for New Year\u2019s Eve 2024",
    "The band FREEZE provided the music, while Copacabana girls, a samba band, fire-eaters, and stilt men, graced the Terrace with their lively performances.",
    "It was, indeed, a night of non-stop entertainment, and the guests loved every minute of it.",
    "In Switzerland, singer Suzi Fl\u00fcckiger (Croner) had a surprise coming her way after entertaining the crowd at a 31st night gig in Silo Einsiedeln.",
    "The manager, at that stage, had shouted into the microphone and asked the people, \u201cWhat do you think about this little power house singer?\u201d and they all had shouted and said they will be coming for sure for New Year\u2019s Eve 2024.",
    "And\u2026yes, Suzi has already been booked for this year\u2019s 31st night event in Silo Einsiedeln.",
    "Naturally, Suzi was so shocked, but one must remember that Suzi, of ex-Friends fame, is a very popular figure in her town of Spreitenbach, in Switzerland, and she has work coming her way, almost on a daily basis.",
    "Another 31st night event that turned out to be a crowd-puller was the New Year\u2019s Eve dance held in Melbourne, Australia.",
    "According to Trevine Rodrigo, fun and revelry reigned at the Grand on Princes, in Mulgrave, as Corrine Almeida, Sohan Weerasinghe, Clifford Richards and Ebony ushered in the New Year with scintillating performances.",
    "And, adding to the already highly talented musical line-up was the surprise entry of Esric Jackson, alongside Stex.",
    "Esric was billed to perform at the Walawwa, in Melbourne, with Replay 6, but decided to surprise his fans at the Grand by showing up for a whistle stop performance that was much loved.",
