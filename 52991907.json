    "B. Wijayaratne, the Chairman of the Welfare Benefit Board was quoted by the PMD saying that the selection of \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 beneficiaries is carried out through a centralized data base, ensuring that political affiliations do not influence the assistance provided.",

    "Protests are staged by people who previously enjoyed the Samurdhi Benefit Program, but have been struck off the Aswesuma Welfare Benefit Program.",
    "The protesting groups claim that those who are eligible to receive assistance from the state have been eliminated from the beneficiaries lists, and those who do not qualify for the program have been added as the new beneficiaries.",
