    "The global market for pet products is growing very rapidly with changing lifestyles worldwide. Whether it is good or bad, it is a fact beyond doubt that the doggy boom is much bigger than the baby boom in many parts of the developed world.",
    "Even in Sri Lanka, the demand for high quality doggy products is on the rise. Dog lovers are spending good and big resources, much more than they have done in the past for their dogs. They care more for their dogs and are looking for high quality products like what the human beings who are also looking for herbal natural products for skin care at present",
    "CIC Vetcare Director/CEO Ajith Weerasinghe said: \u201cCIC as a very responsible corporate, we are delighted to support quality products from SMEs and take them to the next level to the needs of the rapidly changing doggy market.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith the international month and day of the dog every August, we are launching a high quality natural herbal doggy soap and a shampoo product with Neem, Athora and goat milk for the Sri Lankan doggies. The two herbal products will clean, disinfect, protect and condition their skins from fleas, ticks and other infections and help to prevent fungal development without chemicals. Our own clinical trials have proved the soap and the shampoo to be of good quality. We are confident that it will do well in terms of the needs of the market,\u201d Weerasinghe added.",
    "SAJ Associates Founder Jayampathy Arambepola said: \u201cWe are thrilled to work with a big corporate like CIC. For an MSME like me, it is a big boost as we are forward linked with the marketing strengths of CIC Vetcare. Otherwise, we have no strength or capacity to compete with them. Now we have joined hands with them and helping the needs of the local market.\u201d",
    "Speaking further he said, \u201cAs a very responsible processor, we have developed an extremely high-quality product exclusively for CIC Vetcare pet market and I am more than confident that we can work long term with them.\u201d",
    "He further said, \u201cI also take this opportunity to very warmly thank CIC Vetcare most sincerely for their initiative to work with us. Today many organisations only talk of supporting MSMEs and entrepreneurship. It is a buzzword, but CIC is walking the talk which is most appreciated. Once all goes well, we can dream of the global market with their huge strengths globally with our high-quality herbal and natural products for the much-wanted USD which SL needs. In addition, this important link will help the 750 farmers who grow the herbal ingredients for the product in the NCP with improved incomes which too is a key factor.\u201d"
