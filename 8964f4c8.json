  "original_body_lines": [
    "World Rugby yesterday (July 26) said it would allow Sri Lanka to field rugby sevens teams for the Asian Games later this year, despite standing suspended by WR.",
    "Sri Lanka would be allowed to participate under the NOC/OCA flag, with the teams coming under the jurisdiction and control of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka not Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR).",
    "\"We are aware that the deadline for the submission of an Asian Games team from Sri Lanka has arrived and that the governance issues remain unresolved. As you will be aware we have been in correspondence with SLR relating to these issues and regrettably they remain unresolved,\" David Carrigy, Chief International Relations and Participation Officer of World Rugby, wrote in a letter to the NOCSL President Suresh Subramaniam.",
    "\"However, given the positive discussions with stakeholders including the National Olympic Committee, Government of Sri Lanka and many rugby stakeholders we have agreed an alteration to the suspension of Sri Lanka Rugby to permit a team to be entered in the Asian Games subject to the kind agreement of the NOC/OCA to allow the team to participate under the NOC/OCA Flag. The team will enter under the jurisdiction and control of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka and not the SLR. For the avoidance of doubt the SLR remain suspended as a member of World Rugby.\"",
    "\"All stakeholders were concerned that Athletes should not be penalised for governance issues,\" the letter also reiterated."
