As part of the US 7th Fleet\u2014the Navy\u2019s largest forward-deployed fleet\u2014this visit reflects our shared commitment to maritime security, regional stability, and a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung was quoted as saying.",

    "These developments have raised alarm in New Delhi and Washington, both of which view Sri Lanka as a key node in the Indian Ocean\u2019s maritime security architecture.",
