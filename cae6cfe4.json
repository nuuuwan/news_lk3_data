    "Sri Lanka United National Businesses Alliance (SLUNBA) Chairperson Tania Abeysundara yesterday expressed her disappointment at the Government\u2019s failure to provide debt relief to local businesses struggling due to the ongoing economic crisis.",
    "\u201cWe requested our debt to be restructured. We asked to be given a grace period for repayments,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cWe simply requested the Government to consider our challenges with compassion and to establish a supportive environment that allows us to rebuild our businesses,\u201d she further added.",
    "However, Abeysundara said unfortunately only about 10% of the MPs in Parliament heeded their pleas for support.",
    "Expressing her disappointment and disillusionment, she noted that the Government\u2019s inconsistent treatment of various groups is causing further concern.",
    "\u201cThey enforce one law for the privileged while imposing a separate law on the less privileged. The Government follows yet another set of rules. Meanwhile, we, who form the backbone of this country, are subjected to a different set of regulations,\u201d she pointed out."
