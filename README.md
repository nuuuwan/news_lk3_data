The major film awards – the 96th Oscars or Academy Awards – were awarded at a glittering event last weekend. Christopher Nolan directed Oppenheimer won eight Oscars, being nominated for 13. In all it has won 30 trophies. Record for most Oscars is jointly held by Ben Hur, Titanic and Lord of the Rings, each winning 11 Oscars. This global interest in films gave me the reason to write about an impression that has grown in me after seeing Netflix films. The selection offered in different areas of the world appears to be different. We in this geographical area seem to be having more eastern films, Hindi and Tamil mostly. My son in the US advises me to watch this or that film – not available in my Netflix streaming.

Much is being spoken and written about the scarcity of drinking water and water for other purposes as well as it is a global problem caused by rapid population increases. It is made worse by the resulting needs of the people in the production of industrial and agricultural goods which in turn require water for production. This is the second most pressing problem the world is faced with the rising population being the first.

The average person does not give sufficient, or worse still, any thought to the need for conservation of water in the home, in agriculture, in industry or in its other uses. Conservationists say that a dangerous situation is looming ahead of us, individuals, nations and the world itself as the demand is increasing at an alarming rate while water supplies remain near constant.

### My time at Hindu Ladies College

*2024-03-16 23:46:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-time-at-hindu-ladies-college/) · `en`

(This chapter on Goolbai Gunasekera’s Jaffna experience is excerpted from her book on her mother, Clara Motwani, Chosen Ground. The first chapter published last week was a response to ACB Pethiyagoda’s memoir of his time at Jaffna College.)

Mrs. Visaladhy Sivagurunathan, a philanthropic Hindu lady, had gifted the property of Hindu Ladies’ College to the school in 1943. Mother was the school’s fifth Principal. Under her, the first Past Pupils’ Association was formed, with Mrs. Jeevaratnam Rasiah as its first President. Miss Thambu (Mother’s long suffering Tamil tutor) was its Secretary. Just recently, I was invited to speak to the Colombo branch of the HLC alumni.

I met a former HLC teacher there — Mrs Navaratna, formerly Leela Ponniah — along with many old friends. The reverence in which Mother was held was very heart- warming, and it was a moving experience to hear the stories they related of instances in which Mother had touched — and sometimes directed — their lives.

My friend Herman Gunaratne has devoted an entire book — ‘God’s Secret Agent’ — to his association with Nissanka and the many extraordinary incidents involving him.

At first I did not believe this, but having prayed with him and personally experiencing the results of such prayer, I finally became convinced that Nissanka was indeed a man with a special gift or spiritual power.

President Biden gave the final State of the Union speech of the first term of his presidency on Thursday, March 7, 2024.
