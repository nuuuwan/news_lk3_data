    "Ranasinghe, an exceptional HR professional and dynamic business leader, continues at the helm of CIPM with an unwavering commitment to advancing the standards of human resource management in the country. A seasoned HR professional veteran with over 28 years of multi-sectoral experience, he has held senior HR leadership positions in hospitality, banking and finance, plantations, and food and beverage sectors. His expertise spans not only Sri Lanka but also extends to regional markets such as Indonesia, India, and Malaysia.",
    "Currently serving as the Chief People Officer at INSEE Cement, Ranasinghe previously served as the HR Director at Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Limited for an impressive 11 years, where he championed people-focused strategies aligned with global best practices.",
    "Reflecting on the past year, Ranasinghe highlighted CIPM\u2019s efforts to develop staff capabilities through structured training, competency-building initiatives, and digital skill enhancement, which have empowered the Institute\u2019s team to meet evolving industry demands. He also emphasized CIPM\u2019s heightened involvement in national-level HR initiatives, including collaborations with policymakers and government agencies to shape frameworks for sustainable people management and talent development in Sri Lanka.",
    "Speaking on his vision for the new term, Ranasinghe noted: \u201cOur focus will remain on achieving more international accreditations for our flagship CQHRM program, enhancing membership value through targeted development initiatives, and elevating the quality of our services. We will continue to ensure that our staff possesses the competencies required to support CIPM\u2019s dynamic strategic direction while contributing meaningfully to national HR priorities.\u201d",
    "His re-election reflects the deep confidence of CIPM\u2019s membership in his strategic foresight and inclusive leadership style. During his previous term, Ranasinghe was pivotal in strengthening CIPM\u2019s regional and international presence, driving innovation in educational offerings, and fostering a high-performance culture among staff and members. The upcoming term is expected to build on these milestones with a renewed emphasis on digital transformation, policy advocacy for national HR development, and expanding CIPM\u2019s influence across global HR networks.",
    "Under his guidance, the newly elected council of CIPM is poised to raise the bar for Sri Lanka\u2019s HR community by adopting international best practices and strengthening collaboration with global and regional HR bodies, including the World Federation of People Management Associations (WFPMA) and the Asia Pacific Federation of Human Resource Management (APFHRM), where CIPM Sri Lanka continues to play a key role.",
    "Priyantha Ranasinghe\u2019s continued leadership marks an inspiring chapter for CIPM Sri Lanka as it continues its journey to shape the future of the HR profession, both within the country and beyond."
