    "Parliament, May 09 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa must take full responsibility over the issues faced by the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that if Premadasa had taken up the premiership on April 10, there would have been no issues.",
    "The President said this when Sajith Premadasa requested some clarifications from the President over his special statement in Parliament today.",
    "\"I think we better have a debate in Parliament over these matters. There are various opinions. I must tell the Opposition Leader, he should take the full responsibility for all these issues. If he had taken up the premiership on April 10, none of these issues would have cropped up. I performed to my capacity,\" the President said."
