### Poverty of CBSLтАЩs monetary policies: Part II

*2024-11-27 06:09:04* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Poverty-of-CBSL-s-monetary-policies-Part-II/4-769738) ┬╖ `en`

High domestic interest rates on Government debt, combined with the absence of Central Bank intervention to purchase newly issued debt, will escalate the domestic debt servicing burden

The present article expands on the loss of control by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) of interest rates that we developed in Part I. In Part I the focus was money market or short-term interest rates. In the present article the focus is long-term interest rates, particularly interest rates on long-term Government debt.

The article makes two key points in this regard. Firstly, the CBSL has not only lost control over money market or short-term interest rates, as argued in Part I, but also over long-term interest rates, specifically those on long-term Government debt i.e., on Government debt exceeding one year. Secondly, this loss of control stems partly from the CBSLтАЩs inability to regulate short-term money market rates and partly from the provisions of the new Central Bank Act (CBA) passed in 2023.

### Blunder by new Government: No fertiliser to paddy farmers

The current GovernmentтАЩs biggest blunder is the neglect of fertiliser to paddy farmers

Over the past few weeks, TV channel тАШDeranaтАЩ reported on a number of occasions, the plight of the paddy farmers in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Amparai districts due to non-availability of fertiliser for their paddy cultivation. But the Government TV channels were silent over the issue.

Maha rainy season started in early October as usual and will continue until early January. Rains start in early October during the evenings and intensity will increase reaching a maximum in December and rains will end in early January, allowing the farmers to harvest from late January onwards.

The paddy farmers prepare fields after first rains having softened the grounds, mostly with tractors. With increase in rains, fields become muddy and are prepared for sowing of seed paddy generally in early November.

Therefore, as stipulated in sub-section 23(1) of the Public Finance Management Act No 44 of 2024, an interim Budget should be submitted to Parliament to allocate provisions for the continuation of currently implemented projects and public services for the first 4 months of 2025.
