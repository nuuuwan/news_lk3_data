Courts reversed the privatization of Sri Lanka Insurance after a public interest petition alleged a flaw in the process.

“We were very conscious of that, and because of this we have put several controls and procedures in place to ensure the transparency, and credibility of the whole process. As a result, it has taken time.”

“You are taking these companies that are not necessarily the most efficient, not the most competitive and giving it to a new investor.”

### The right to self -determination has the right to the Tamil people living in the North and East;The United Socialist Party does not stumble like other parties on this issue -

The 13th Amendment is used as a tool to get votes from minorities during elections.

However, we belong to the United Socialist Party.

We firmly believe that the Tamil community in the North East has the right to self -determination.

Our position may not be supported in some parts of the country, but we think this is fair.

We do not think that the people of the North East are more interested in implementing the current 13 -year -old.

We do not think that giving the Tamils ​​the right to self -determination will divide the country.

For example, the JVP once strongly opposed the 13th Amendment and used violence against it.

But they have changed their position.
