    "CEAT\u2019s top 10 dealers countrywide received handsome awards for their contributions to the Company\u2019s performance while the top 45 dealers received awards of excellence, and the top performers in each of tyre categories manufactured by the company were recognised separately at the dealer convention. A noteworthy feature was the presence of representatives of two of CEAT\u2019s top customers in two key export markets \u2013 Singapore and Egypt.",
