It is estimated that approximately 150 beggars at Galle Face Green are inconveniencing the visitors throughout the week, making it a pressing social concern as highlighted in reports,\" he said.",

These funds are intended to provide essential accommodation, food and other necessary facilities to beggars who are to be transferred to the Ridiyagama Center. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
