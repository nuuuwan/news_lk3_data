  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Appeals Court yesterday issued notices to the Minister of Lands, the Minister of Environment, the Director General of Wildlife, and several others, directing them to file their responses on 28 November to a petition seeking the creation of a National Land Management Policy.",
    "The petition was filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice and was taken up before Justices Dhammika Ganepola and Adithya Patabendi.",
    "The petitioners\u2019 attorney told court that the absence of a comprehensive land management plan has caused serious issues, and that agricultural land, forests, wetlands, and human settlements remain poorly identified and demarcated, leading to environmental challenges and other problems. The Court was also told that as an island with limited land, Sri Lanka urgently needs a framework to maximise land use, stressing that the lack of a national plan undermines both productivity and sustainability targets.",
    "Following submissions, the Appeals Court fixed the matter for further consideration on 28 November."
