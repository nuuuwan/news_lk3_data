Such an agreement can be signed only with the concurrence of the two countries. Sri Lanka has signed such agreements with numerous other countries.

According to police sources, Jayamaha, who had been serving a prison sentence for the Royal Park murder case, left Sri Lanka on November 15, 2019, just days before an interim order was issued prohibiting him from leaving the country.

It was revealed that Jayamaha had obtained a passport on November 13, 2019 immediately after receiving the presidential pardon.

Sloppy for large parts of the game, Pakistan fell apart in the tie-breaker. Mohammad Amir bowled three wides, one of which the co-hosts also pinched two extra runs from.

The US scrambled to 18-1, leaving Pakistan to chase 19 off left-arm seamer Saurabh Netravalkar. When 14 were needed off four balls, Kumar made another crucial intervention, this time holding a magnificent catch at long-off to dismiss Iftikhar Ahmed.

With seven required from the last ball, Shadab Khan could only take a single, sparking joyous celebrations among the American players and supporters.

All this at the end of a riveting contest, one which fluctuated in the burning Texas sunshine.

Indian media are quoting sources as saying Modi plans to push back his inauguration for a third term as PM until Sunday while the talks continue.

The Janata Dal (United) has reportedly asked the BJP to modify its controversial Agniveer scheme – a flagship military recruitment reform passed in 2022 that created short-term, US-style “tours of duty” for new soldiers.

Several people on social media now comment negatively about how the current President handled the 2022 political and economic crisis. None of them can deny that we were in a dire economic and political crisis, and we desperately looked to the world for relief to meet even our basic needs. Without India’s and others help, Sri Lanka would have certainly become another Lebanon.

*2024-06-07 02:27:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/CFOs-Stay-nimble-and-informed-to-steer-your-organisation-forward/4-762757) · `en`

Knowledge is power, and staying informed of trends will help you make relevant decisions to steer your team and organisation forward

Technology-led disruptions over the last four years have brought the future directly to us. Whether we are working in the private or public sector, we are now navigating rapid changes — sometimes daily.

As finance leaders, we are managing diverse, hybrid teams that span time zones and continents, keeping a pulse on record-high inflation that affects business costs, and ensuring that our finance teams remain relevant in this complex and rapidly changing business environment.

Adaption and being nimble have become second nature to us, but we cannot be complacent. During ongoing transformations, our work is not done. Staying proactive and informed are two strategies to be successful in the face of change; but, more importantly, they prepare us for leading diverse teams in a competitive global market.

### Indian Lok Sabha election - a view

*2024-06-07 01:24:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185482) · `ta`

In the recently concluded Indian Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, did not secure the expected 400 seats but still achieved a significant majority. This result limits the BJP's ability to unilaterally implement reforms. Despite this, Modi was re-elected for a third term. The election saw several surprises, including independent candidates winning against major parties. For instance, Amrit Pal Singh, despite being imprisoned, won in the Katur Sahib constituency, and Mohammed Haneefa triumphed in Ladakh over both Congress and BJP candidates. These outcomes highlight the dynamic nature of Indian politics and the potential for independent voices to impact electoral results positively.

🟩

The completed Indian Lok Sabha election has many interesting features. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been ruling in India for the past ten years, and the Prime Minister of the party, Narendra Modi, have not received 400 seats in the NDA's campaign.. Instead, only a large -scale majority to rule is to the people.

This has created an environment where the BJP is no longer able to decide for reforms in the country.. Although Indian voters have been given the opportunity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third time.This time the BJP and the party's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made the position that Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, the leader of the United Janata Party, can be operated only after consultation.. Political observers have said that this is healthy for democracy.

### Why people shouldn’t fear  ‘Mr. Talent’ - EDITORIAL

These are days when people are working hard to make ends meet; even when the spouse is employed too. With regard to those frequenting the corridors of power, they too are working immensely hard to be in power when the next government is formed.

There was a recent meme (an image, video or piece of text) on Facebook which portrayed two candidates who are likely to bid for the presidency at the next big election. The one with a love for nature photography was saying ‘It would be my way only and there is no asking questions’. The other was saying the total opposite. He states in the meme, “Ask any question and I’ll give the answer again and again till you understand”. Great talent is needed to remain as a politician who wields power in the future because this is an era of discourse; not one of orders.

Wild elephants in Sri Lanka are causing significant issues, behaving aggressively and leading to loss of human life. They target homes, disrupting daily life and education.

🟩

Former Wildlife Defense Minister and State MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said that wild elephants were acting like the LTTE and could not sleep at night.

Wildlife Minister Pavithra Wanniyarachchi interrupted a question raised in the query in Parliament on Thursday (06) in Parliament.

Wild elephants have problems in all parts of the country.. Many of the human lives are lost when they take steps to address elephant problems.

Elephants do not attack the houses of the sides who are in favor of the elephants. Elephants do not attack the houses. Elephants are attacking the homes of the people.

Wild elephants behave like the Liberation Tigers, so that the residents leave their villages.. Students could not even go to school. Elephants kill the public

Elephant problems should be solved if they want to improve agriculture. Those who refer to as environmental experts have no better plan.

Even after the end of the war in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the land use issue to maintain the livelihood of the people living in those areas is still an unresolved issue..

### Slaughter of the Gaza lamb: Israeli Pharaoh’s crimes against children

Palestinian children carry water containers in the Jabalia refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip.

On Tuesday, June 4, the day the world was supposed to mark the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression, the silence of the pro-Israeli world powers was deafening. In Gaza, the day had little meaning as there was no let-up in the slaughter of Palestinian children.

The day is marked as a poignant reminder to all nations that they should not cause physical, mental, or emotional harm to children. The day calls on UN member states to recommit themselves to ending all forms of violence against children.

There was little or no attempt by most Israeli-friendly nations to make use of the day to issue a powerful statement calling the Zionist aggressor to stop its slaughter of the lambs in Gaza. They probably feared that if they did so, they would only expose Israel as the post-World War II world’s most gruesome child killer.

The Electricity Board (CEB) has made various allegations regarding the bill. The Electricity Board Trade Unions and Engineers say they have not been given enough time to investigate this. They also say that they did not discuss with them properly.

It has been brought to the Parliamentary Supervisory Committee two days ago. The court has also announced this. In this case, it is improper to bring the bill in a hurry.

Meanwhile, in August 2020, the electricity tariff was increased by 66 per cent. Then increased by 88 percent in October 2023. This was followed by an increase of cost by 18 percent. So that 5 lakhs of low incomes were cut off. This is what happened.

The 1,700 rupee salary hike for plantation workers is suspected of getting workers on the 10th of this month.

The Secretary of the Ministry of Labor issued a gazette notification on May 21 to pay a daily salary of Rs 1,700 for plantation workers.

The Plantation Employers Federation was opposed to the fact that it could not afford the workers. The 21 plantation companies have filed a case in the Court of Appeal, challenging the salary increase gazette.

The Court of Appeal, which was heard by the case on the 03rd, ruled that an interim injunction was not issued against the Gazette.

In the meantime, workers are hoping that the monthly salary will be made at Rs 1,700.

However, the final account of this month's salary was completed by the plantation administrations on Wednesday 05th. Therefore, plantation union leaders say the old salary will be available.

Plantation administrations have told union leaders and union leaders that they have not been able to get any round of salary increases.

### Says Sri Lanka is an unsinkable aircraft carrier “The country manufactures  poverty  as politics is more profitable  than its industries”  - Major Gen. Dr. Boniface Perera

A tearful goodbye to Major Gen. Perera as he was leaving Wanni region

If political business is earning more profit than country’s industries, that country will never prosper but will manufacture menace

After the war when I was appointed as the Competent Authority in Wanni, I treated all the communities equally. In fact I gave preference to Tamil community

Military intelligence should not be there to find out the details of politicians, opponent parties, but to hunt for economic opportunities even outside the country

Our defence policy or national security policy should be ‘Active Defence’

Poverty is the worst enemy and it is a breeding ground for terrorism

National Security is very wide spectrum. Before we go further we must understand national survival

If there is no national economy there cannot be national security

### Once bitten, twice shy; but it takes two to tango

Once again, this community finds itself entangled in domestic and regional political intrigue

The age-old adage “Once Bitten, Twice Shy” is a well-known and frequently used phrase of admonition that many Sri Lankans, especially those from the middle and upper strata of society, have grown up hearing during their school years. This often-repeated saying typically forms the lower rungs of a ”disciplinary ladder” that, for many of us, ended with corporal punishment in the principal’s or headmaster’s office, depending on the title of the chief administrative officer at our respective schools.

The rise of NPP from the ashes of Aragalaya and led by a new generation of JVP leadership, which has distanced itself from that party’s insurrectionary past, and NPP’s tireless campaign to convince the voting public that Sri Lanka’s economic malaise is not an isolated phenomenon, but part of an overall systemic paralysis that had been sapping for decades the vitality of a once peaceful and prosperous nation, and that it cannot be rectified unless there is a radical transformation of its political culture, economic management and socio-cultural ethnonationalism has created an atmosphere of political paranoia amongst the old guards who are now driven to a state of panic looking for a way out to avoid confronting the NPP at the ballot box.

It is that paranoia and panic which has provoked the General Secretary of UNP to call for the postponement of elections for two years. Although that call has drawn criticisms from several corners it did not come out of a vacuum.

### Sri Lanka’s Hatton National Bank ‘A(lka)’ rating confirmed, ISB assets 10-pct

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka-based Hatton National Bank PLC’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘A(lka)’ with a stable outlook, saying the economy was stabilizing but it also had the highest exposure to defaulted sovereign bonds.

HNB’s high risk profile, similar to peers, stems from its large exposure to sovereign risk, via the defaulted foreign-currency denominated sovereign bonds which at 10 percent of assets by end 2023, was the highest among local banks.

Another 33 percent of assets iwere rupee-denominated treasury securities, all of which make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign’s repayment capacity and liquidity position.

“Fitch expects HNB’s impaired (stage 3) loans to decrease in the near to medium term, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity alongside the economic recovery and Fitch’s anticipated expansion in the bank’s loan book,” Fitch said.

“This is despite the parate suspension that is in effect until 15 December 2024.”

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed an ‘A(lka)’ rating of Sri Lanka’s Commercial Bank of Ceylon saying the operating environment is stabilizing, but it also had the second highest exposure to defaulted sovereign bonds.

“Our assessment of COMB’s risk profile factors in its exposure to defaulted foreign-currency government securities, to which COMB has the second-highest exposure among domestic banks, at 7 percent of total assets at end-2023,” Fitch said.

“A further 30 percent exposure stems from its local-currency denominated treasury securities, making the bank vulnerable to the sovereign’s repayment capacity and liquidity position.”

The bank had provided 52 percent on its sovereign bond exposure by end 2023, where negotiations are still ongoing.

“We expect COMB’s impaired (stage 3) loan ratio to fall as the repayment capacity of borrowers gradually improves,” Fitch said.

“This follows the notable decline in interest rates, but a slow pick-up in economic activity and loan growth.

### Cricket, rugby…and modelling

*2024-06-06 18:58:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/cricket-rugbyand-modelling/) · `en`

I’m currently working as a Management Accountant at an IT company. I’ve been involved in modelling since 2016. In 2018 I won the Face of Asia (International pageant) competing with 27 Asian countries. I have a passion for playing cricket; I’m currently participating in the Colombo District Division III tournament. In my spare time, I enjoy going on road trips, with my brother, to explore the beautiful places in our wonderful country.

It happened accidentally. There was a modelling competition at our university, called Stylish Marketer. I hadn’t planned on participating, but I went to see what the event was like since I’d never attended one before. To my surprise, I ended up winning the competition!

I would say my height. I’m so grateful to my parents for gifting me that!

I enjoy modelling a wide variety of clothing styles and am open to any type of attire – from casual to formal, active wear, and everything in between. I’m flexible and always ready to adapt to the designer’s vision.

### Sri Lanka Bank of Ceylon ‘A(lka)’ rating confirmed

*2024-06-06 18:01:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-bank-of-ceylon-alka-rating-confirmed-166696/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Fitch Ratings has confirmed an ‘A(lka)’ rating of Bank of Ceylon saying the operating environment was improving but the exposure to state was high.

“BOC’s asset-quality metrics remain highly influenced by the sovereign’s credit profile due to the bank’s large sovereign exposure via its loans, off-balance-sheet liabilities and securities holdings,” Fitch said.

About 60 percent of bank assets were exposed to the sovereign risk profile.

The bank had provided 55 percent for defaulted sovereign bonds which were 2 percent of its assets.

The bank’s core asset-quality metric – impaired (stage 3) loan ratio – increased to 13.5 percent by end-1Q24 (end-2023: 12.6 percent, 2021: 10.2 percent) primarily due to a contraction in gross loans.

“We estimate this ratio to be significantly higher if BOC’s foreign-currency loan exposure to the state and state-owned entities is included,” Fitch said.
