### Russia is the fourth economic force in the world

*2024-07-22 12:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189023) · `ta`

In early June, the World Bank ranked Russia as the fourth-largest economy globally based on PPP, surpassing Germany due to cheaper gas and political instability. Russia's economic growth, initially lagging, surged post-Ukraine invasion, aiming for global dominance. Despite challenges, including sanctions and a shift towards militarization, Russia's economy boomed, with the World Bank tripling its growth forecast to 3.2%. However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

🟩

According to the World Bank's data, published in early June, the Russian economy has become the fourth developed country in the world based on Purchase- Power and Balance (PPP).

According to PNE report last August, Russia has already behind Germany to become the fifth largest economy. The cheapest Russian gas was cut off, and German has now been stagnant and suffered from recent political events and fell to sixth place in the World Bank rankings.

Purchase-Power-Balance (PPP) and Gross National Production Measurement is preferred by many economists. This is because it takes into account the difference between local prices and nominal prices.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.

### 41 Years To Black July – Our Voices Towards Meaningful Reconciliation

*2024-07-22 10:15:55* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/41-years-to-black-july-our-voices-towards-meaningful-reconciliation/) · `en`

In Sri Lanka, fear is pervasive. Suppression of media and fundamental rights of people and repression of human rights defenders foster a climate of fear, silencing victims, and inhibiting reconciliation. Political and criminal interests threaten the justice system, putting lives at risk for exposing the truth.

For decades, regimes have perpetuated impunity, showing no signs of change. There have been no credible, independent investigations into major violent events like insurrections, the Black July pogrom, the proscription of the JVP, or the Easter bombings. Investigations are often obstructed, cases against perpetrators dismissed, and genuine investigators silenced or exiled. Allegations against intelligence and security agencies underscore the need for transparent and independent investigations with international involvement.

### Sri Lanka net foreign debt falls in 2023, despite borrowing US$1.5bn for budget

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central government’s net foreign debt fell to 36.3 billion US dollars in 2023, from 37.5 billion dollars in 2022, despite the government borrowing 1.57 billion US dollars to finance the budget deficit, official data shows.

When a reserve collecting central bank does not print money to enforce its policy rate or the average weighted call money rates or the 7 day rate or any other rate targeted by term reverse repo auctions, there are no forex shortages, allowing foreign debt to be repaid with rupee revenues.

In 2023, the government borrowed 1.52 billion US dollars to finance its deficit, mostly supported by loans from the International Monetary Fund and budget support loans from the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.
