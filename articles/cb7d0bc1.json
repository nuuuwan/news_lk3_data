    "The broad-based support for the Government, spanning all regions of the country\u2014including areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic and religious minorities\u2014demonstrates a significant step towards national unity",
    "The National Peace Council (NPC) extends its congratulations to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) on their election victory, which secured a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This overwhelming mandate reflects the trust placed in the President and his party to lead the country towards economic development, justice, and reconciliation.",
    "The broad-based support for the Government, spanning all regions of the country\u2014including areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic and religious minorities\u2014demonstrates a significant step towards national unity. The NPC recognises this as an indication that the trust in the President\u2019s leadership has bridged ethnic and religious divides. In light of this unprecedented goodwill, the NPC calls on the Government to prioritise resolving the country\u2019s longstanding ethnic conflict.",
    "We believe that a true national perspective has been reached by the NPP and it is essential that this aspect is strengthened by resolving outstanding issues as early as possible. These include issues pertaining to return of land to the people who owned it, the sharing and devolution of powers, demilitarisation of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and missing and imprisoned persons, among",
    "others. As the Government embarks on a new chapter in the country\u2019s history, the NPC wishes it success in addressing the country\u2019s economic challenges and fostering justice, reconciliation, and peace for all its citizens. A sustainable political solution will require the participation of civil society, the consent of all communities and collaboration with Opposition parties. Such a solution, with broad-based support, will ensure lasting peace and reconciliation for generations to come."
