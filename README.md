### Trump and AKD: the vital differences

*2024-11-18 14:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/trump-and-akd-the-vital-differences/) · `en`

The people of the United States of America elected that country’s 47th president on November 5, 2024. Donald Trump, who had served as the 45th president and was defeated by Joe Biden, made an unprecedented comeback, securing 312 votes of the electoral college. It left those who backed his main opponent, Democratic Party candidate and serving Vice President, Kamala Harris, in shock. After all, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York and is currently facing charges of fraud, election subversion, and obstruction.

How on earth did he even get on the ballot? How on earth did he win? Are those who voted for him ignorant of his criminal record? Have they forgotten how he covered himself in ignominy in the aftermath of losing the 2020 election? These are the questions that his detractors ask.

### A brief electoral review of the new and improved United States of Amnesia

Trump’s proposed cabinet appointments short on quality, long on slavish loyalty

Last week, in the despair I felt in the aftermath of the election to the US presidency of the most evil man in the United States, I wrote that I will take a break to lick my wounds and get over my distress at the apparent catastrophe that has befallen my second home. Then I realized that this is not the end of the world, though it sure felt like it on the morning after the election.

I learned that I was not alone in these feelings of despair. Trump’s win had sparked off an unprecedented increase in Google searches reflecting a growing interest among Americans in relocating to foreign countries, New Zealand heading the list with an astonishing 7,600% increase! The next most popular Google search was “the least painful way to kill yourself”.

### After the funeral: A post-mortem on the US election

*2024-11-18 14:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/after-the-funeral-a-post-mortem-on-the-us-election/) · `en`

Last week’s presidential election was doubtless one of the most consequential in US history. Though the outcome was not predictable – most polls showed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump – with the benefit of hindsight one can say that the Democrats should have seen it coming. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be a slew of analyses and diagnoses claiming to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. Yet as Sri Lankan political analyst Rajni Gamage rightly put it in a recent tweet, such diagnoses are themselves problematic, and point to the biases of those making them.
