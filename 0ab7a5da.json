    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has posted a primary surplus (deficit before interest costs) of 53 billion rupees up to May 2023, compared to a deficit required under an International Monetary Fund program, supported by revenue measures and strict expenditure controls, officials said.",
    "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said revenues and grants grew by 38.1 percent up to May.",
    "Sri Lanka had earned tax revenues of 1,029 billion rupees and non-tax revenues of 91 billion rupees, Director of Fiscal Policy Kapila Senanayake said.",
    "Current spending was up 52 percent to 1938, mostly due an increase in interest costs.",
    "The current account deficit with interest costs, was 817 billion rupees.",
    "Capital spending was 204 billion rupees, up from 174.2 billion rupees.",
    "The overall deficit after grants 1,019 billion rupees, along with interest costs.",
    "When a soft-pegged/flexible inflation targeting central bank triggers a currency crisis by printing money to cut policy rates, in the stabilization year that follows and interest costs soars.",
    "The overall deficit also tends to go up, despite tax rates being hiked, as economies and imports contract.",
    "Macro-economist who cut policy rates with open market operations or other tools, however usually blame \u2018budget deficits\u2019 for inflation and currency depreciation.",
    "In this crisis interest rates soared more than in earlier currency crises, due to domestic debt restructuring and the lack of an early cut-off date.",
    "The primary balance of the budget was a surplus of 38 billion rupees.",
    "Under an IMF program, Sri Lanka is expected to only record a primary deficit of 113 billion rupees.",
    "Tax revenue for June is still not finalized but may be around 1,200 billion rupees. Under an IMF program, tax revenues have to reach around 1,300 billion rupees, an indicative target.",
    "Sri Lanka however has kept strict expenditure controls. The IMF under revenue based fiscal consolidation encouraged Sri Lanka to abandon cost cutting (spending-based consolidation) under a cookie-cutter policy advocated to all countries, leading to an increase in spending to GDP under a previous program, critics have said.",
    "High nominal interest rates are also a consequence of monetary instability and unworkable monetary regimes involving anchor conflicts of targeting a policy rate and trying to collect forex reserves, analysts have warned.",
    "Mist-targeting rates coming from conflicts between a net international reserve target and a monetary policy consultation clause (inflation target) may also lead to currency depreciation as the economy recovers in the second year of an IMF program, public dis-enchantment of reform and the ouster of reformist politicians by the electorate, critics say.",
    "Sri Lanka is set to legalize output gap targeting (ISLM) despite operating a reserve collecting central bank under an IMF backed monetary law which is supposed to target inflation without floating exchange rate."
