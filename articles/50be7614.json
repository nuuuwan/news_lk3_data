    "Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - \"People in our country have a very short memory. I don't blame history. If we bear the present responsibility, we will fulfill that responsibility to the best of our ability,\" Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.",
    "While marking the beginning of the 2024 school meal programme held today (25) at the Sujatha Girls\u2019 College in Narahenpita, the Minister said the majority of the people in the country blame the past. They always claim that nothing had happened during the past 70 years.",
    "\"We benefited from the results of the activities in the past 70 years. If we did not implement the Mahaweli Development Programme, the whole country will be in the dark now. From the Mahaweli Development Programme 1,100 MW of electricity is generated. If we had not constructed the expressways, we will not be able to reach Galle, Matara and Kataragama in one, two or two-and-a-half hours. If the war was still being waged, then no one will be able to gather like this and will not even have a chance to walk freely. No one came to Colombo like this,\" he said.",
    "\"However, people have a very short memory of the past. I do not blame the past. If we bear the present responsibility, then we will fulfill that responsibility to the best of our ability,\" Minister Premajayantha said.",
    "\"Before 20 months, when I assumed duties as the Minister, I never believed that I will be able to develop the education system to this stage. I did not know how to provide textbooks due to the lack of printing paper. No proper mechanism existed to provide school uniform materials. The teachers were even unable to come for paper marking activities as they had to wait in queues for fuel. The students did not have power for their studies due to 4-hour power disruptions. Now we have a 24-hour power supply, even during this hot weather.",
    "\"However, in the past 20 months, I have managed to overcome all issues, but most people have forgotten the past and what we have done.",
    "\"I brought this education system to this stage in 20 months. These days, people visit schools and deliver political speeches. But I speak only about my subject,\" the Minister added."
