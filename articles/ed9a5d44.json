    "The Opposition and some civil society organisations are demanding that the long-delayed Provincial Council (PC) polls be held in 2025 itself. Their representatives met at a conference held by the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) in Colombo, the other day, to discuss the issue at length and pressure the government to hold the PC elections without further delay.",
    "Among those who attended the NMSJ event were former Chairman of the Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, former President Maithripala Sirisena, Executive Director of PAFFREL (People\u2019s Action for Free and Fair Elections) Rohana Hettiarachchi, SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam, and NMSJ Chairman and former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. They put forth compelling arguments in support of their campaign to have the PC polls held soon. But nothing could prevent them from sounding hypocritical. These self-righteous politicians owe an apology to the public for having contributed to the postponement of the PC polls.",
    "Hettiarcchchi said the general consensus was that the NPP government was delaying the PC polls for political reasons. Successive governments had either advanced or postponed local government and PC polls to further their own political interests, he said. Kariyawasam shed copious tears for democracy and the people\u2019s franchise. He said the President was running the unelected PCs through the Provincial Governors appointed by him and handling colossal amounts of state funds allocated to the provinces. Madduma Bandara accused the President of controlling the PCs in an authoritarian manner without holding elections to them.",
    "The PCs have been without elected representatives under three governments and four Presidents since 2017. There have been six elections during that period, as we pointed out in a previous comment. Curiously, Kariyawasam remained silent while President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe were controlling the PCs. Worse, they had the LG institutions also under their thumb by postponing mini polls twice. The SLPP initially had a two-thirds parliamentary majority, which its leaders could have used to amend or make laws to hold the PC polls. Kariyawasam should have asked them to do so. The NPP deserves praise for at least holding the LG elections a few months after forming a government.",
    "The politicians who have expressed grave concern about the indefinite postponement of the PC polls are also responsible for the current situation. They facilitated the passage of a deplorable amendment to the PC Elections Act. Jayasuriya was the Speaker at the time, and the Yahapalana government consisting of the SLFP-led UPFA and the UNP postponed the PC polls by way of deception. The amendment Bill was stuffed with a host of committee-stage changes to the extent of distorting its original text and ratified. The SLFP/UPFA, the JVP and the SJB members who were in the UNP at that time and the Joint Opposition, which consisted of the SLFP dissidents, mainly the Rajapaksas, who subsequently formed the SLPP, raised no objections, and the bad bill was passed.",
    "Why the NPP is wary of facing an electoral contest any time soon is clear. Its national vote share declined in the 06 May local government elections, and its approval rating has also dropped significantly. Had it been able to score another stunning electoral win in May, it would definitely have gone on to hold the PC polls soon afterwards.",
    "The NPP has a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and therefore it can amend the existing laws or bring in new ones to resolve the issues that have stood in the way of conducting the PC polls. If it is not possible to conduct them under the new mixed proportional system, the proportional representation system can be used for that purpose as an ad hoc measure.",
    "Having promised to hold elections in a proper manner without leaving any room for delays, the NPP cannot justify postponing the PC polls on any grounds. No government can avoid electoral setbacks by postponing elections. It may be recalled that all governments that delayed elections for fear of losing them faced humiliating defeats. What befell the SLFP-led United Front government, the Yahapalana administration, and the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government may serve as an example. The J. R. Jayewardene government made a general election disappear in 1982 with the help of a heavily rigged referendum, thereby plunging the country into chaos. It will be a mistake for the NPP to go on postponing PC polls.",
