    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is assessing nuclear power plant offers from Russia, the United States, India, and some European countries to choose the appropriate technology that suits the country, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.",
    "The Minister rejected the claims and speculations over the government signing a deal with Russian nuclear giant Rosatom to build a nuclear power plant in the island nation.",
    "\u201cThere are a number of proposals on nuclear power\u2026. But we need to know the appropriate technology for us. We need to pre plan on a number of factors,\u201d the Minister told a media briefing on Tuesday.",
    "\u201cNot only Rosatom, there are some other companies and countries like India, European nations, The United States, have offered us nuclear power plants under different technologies which are appropriate for this country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cUnder the 2023-2042 generation plan, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has not included nuclear power. So we need to decide when we require nuclear power generation. We expect to take a decision on this after assessing the suitable technology for us. There was some wrong interpretation that we are going to have the first nuclear power plant by 2032. We have not agreed with any company or country on a deal.\u201d",
    "Russia has repeatedly said it is prepared to enter into an agreement to build a nuclear power plant in Sri Lanka if the Sri Lankan government grants permission. However, concerns have been raised over such power plants locally and internationally.",
    "\u201cWe need to make a very thoughtful decision. We need not have to be scared, because a number of countries in the world have gone for nuclear power plants. Even our neighbours like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have gone for that option,\u201d Wijesekera said.\u00a0 (Colombo/July 04/2023)"
