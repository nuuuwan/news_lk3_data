    "After serious irregularities related to the tender procedure of the global tourism promotional campaign were uncovered, necessitating the initiation of a fresh round of tenders, a press conference with the participation of the Minister of Tourism and Lands, Harin Fernando, which had been scheduled for tomorrow (9th), has been canceled.",
    "Earlier today, the media unit of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau (SLTPB) had extended an invitation to the media for a press conference with Fernando, scheduled for 10:30 a.m. at Mihikatha Medura, Land Secretariat, No: 1200/6, Rajamalwatta Road, Battaramulla.",
    "Later in the day, the media were informed of changes to the time and venue of the press conference.",
    "The new location was the main auditorium of SLITHM, and the rescheduled time was 5:30 p.m.",
    "However, this evening, media received notification that the press conference had been canceled due to \"unavoidable circumstances,\" and that the \"new date and venue will be communicated in due course.\"",
    "The issue revolves around SLTPB's attempt to engage Public Relations and Digital Marketing agencies with the aim of enhancing international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka.",
    "The preliminary investigation has exposed a deliberate attempt by certain SLTPB officials to manipulate a bid by replacing documents to favour one party over another during the tender process.",
    "In light of these revelations, eight senior SLTPB officials have been reassigned to the Tourism Ministry."
