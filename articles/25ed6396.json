    "Presenting the global economic outlook, the Standard Chartered research team noted that in 2024, global growth is expected to face persistent challenges from elevated rates, sub-par global trade volumes, and geopolitical tensions. The year is anticipated to be defined by a shift from monetary tightening to a more neutral monetary stance for global central banks. As divergence under the surface continues and the USD and US rates stabilise, emerging markets may experience pockets of improved performance. However, the new challenge for economies and markets in the year ahead may be election risk.",
