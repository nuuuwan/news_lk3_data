  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Center for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) announced that it will submit a report today (09) to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, proposing measures to address wildlife populations that damage crops in Sri Lanka.",
    "National Coordinator of CENS, Environmentalist Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, emphasized the significance of the issue and outlined the report\u2019s recommendations.",
    "\u201cThe population of toque macaque has increased in Sri Lanka. This is due to the decline of natural predators and reduced food availability in forests, which has driven these animals to seek food in agricultural areas. We propose establishing a unified mechanism by merging 15 institutions to manage toque macaque populations effectively. Today, we are presenting these proposals to the Minister of Environment,\u201d said Dr. Kariyawasam.",
    "Dr. Kariyawasam also discussed the need for innovative and research-driven approaches, citing India\u2019s experience in managing monkey populations in the states of Jammu and Kashmir.",
    "\u201cIn India, sterilization efforts go beyond surgeries. Techniques include mixing sterilization drugs with food or using hormones. Some countries have even explored using viruses. In Sri Lanka, we need to introduce hormones through food in controlled quantities. However, this requires careful research to avoid risks, particularly to endemic species like the \u2018Macaca sinica\u2019 monkeys,\u201d he explained.",
    "The report, which includes both short-term and long-term strategies, aims to address the growing wildlife challenge sustainably while minimizing potential ecological risks, Dr. Kariyawasam noted."
