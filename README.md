### In today's political climate, minority communities should adopt

*2024-10-15 14:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/196344) · `ta`

Thank you for providing such a detailed analysis of the political situation in Sri Lanka. I'll summarize the key points and offer some insights based on the information you've shared:



1. Different voting patterns between Sinhalese and Tamil communities:

   - Tamils tend to vote based on ethnic and cultural issues, while Sinhalese often prioritize corruption and family politics.

   - Corruption and fraud are less of a concern for Tamils compared to Sinhalese voters.



2. Recent election trends:

   - People voted for change in 2015, supporting candidates like Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe.

   - Gotabhaya Rajapaksa won in 2019 due to his promise of change, though he didn't take action against corrupt colleagues.

   - Anura Kumara Dissanayake won recently, partly due to opposition to the 13th Amendment and the merger of North and East provinces.



3. Challenges faced by minority communities:

   - Tamil politicians often use nationalism as a political tool rather than addressing daily issues.

   - Minority communities have become pawns in larger political games.



4. Economic challenges:

   - Corruption isn't the primary cause of Sri Lanka's economic crisis.

   - President Dissanayake faces significant challenges in leading the country through economic recovery.



5. Upcoming parliamentary election:

   - National People's Power faces challenges in gaining a normal majority.

   - Other parties are working together to ensure their political future.



6. Future prospects:

   - The National People's Power aims to eradicate corruption and improve governance.

   - Economic management and recovery efforts will be crucial for the party's success.



7. Recommendations for minority communities:

   - Change political tactics and guarantee parliamentary commitment to the National People's Power Government.

   - Find trusted partners from minority groups.

   - Prioritize unity and cultural differences among minority groups.



8. Broader implications:

   - Ethnic and religious identities play significant roles in Sri Lanka's politics.

   - New political strategies and leaders are needed to create a new political culture.



Your analysis provides valuable insights into the complex political landscape of Sri Lanka, highlighting both historical patterns and current challenges. It emphasizes the need for unity and cooperation between different ethnic and religious groups to address the country's pressing issues.

🟩

Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not won 50% + 1 votes in the recent presidential election, but has won the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka.. This time the Tamil people's votes went to the candidate who did not win, as did the previous presidential elections.

Dissanayake has not succeeded in any of the districts where the Tamils ​​live in the majority. There are many comments and criticisms on social media, especially on this issue. These blacksmiths often express their opinion of this emotional issue without deep understanding of politics.
