    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Russian Federation has delivered 117 tonnes of sunflower oil to Sri Lanka as humanitarian assistance. The donation, handed over by Russian Ambassador Levan S. Dzhagaryan, was received with gratitude by Sri Lankan officials.",
    "\"This is the second batch of vegetable oil we have provided to Sri Lanka since September last year,\" Ambassador Dzhagaryan said during the handover ceremony. \"We hope to continue our support, not only to the friendly people of Sri Lanka, but also to other countries in need across Africa and Asia.\"",
    "The Ambassador acknowledged the ongoing challenges facing Russia, including international sanctions. He emphasized, however, that \"thanks to the government's policies and President Putin's leadership, the Russian Federation has overcome many difficulties and emerged as Europe's top economy and the world's fifth, behind China, the United States, India, and Japan.\" He added, somewhat surprisingly, \"It sounds a bit ironic, but thanks to the sanctions, we have boosted our domestic production and are moving forward under my president's guidance.\"",
    "The sunflower oil donation comes amid a difficult period for Sri Lanka, with the country grappling with an economic crisis. The aid is aimed at supporting Sri Lankan households facing food shortages and rising prices.",
