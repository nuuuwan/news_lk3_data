  "original_body_lines": [
    "US President Donald Trump on Saturday (Sep 20) threatened Afghanistan with unspecified punishment if the Taliban-controlled country did not \u201cgive Bagram Airbase back\u201d.",
    "\u201cIf Afghanistan doesn\u2019t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!\u201d the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
    "The vague threat comes just days after he raised the idea of the United States retaking control of the base while on a state visit to the United Kingdom.",
    "Bagram, the largest air base in Afghanistan, was a linchpin of the US-led war effort against the Taliban, whose government Washington toppled following the Sep 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.",
    "A massive, sprawling facility, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others have repeatedly raised allegations of systematic human rights abuses by US forces at Bagram, especially pertaining to detainees in Washington\u2019s murky \u201cWar on Terror\u201d.",
    "Trump has often lamented the loss of access to Bagram, noting its proximity to China, but Thursday was the first time he had made public that he was working on the matter.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We\u2019re trying to get it back because they need things from us,\u201d Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
    "US and NATO troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021 as part of a Trump-brokered peace deal, as the resurgent Taliban took over swaths of Afghanistan before finally taking control of the entire country.",
    "Trump has repeatedly criticised the loss of the base since returning to power, linking it to his attacks on his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the US pullout from Afghanistan.",
    "Trump has also complained about China\u2019s growing influence in Afghanistan."
