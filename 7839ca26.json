  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Chief Prelates (Mahanayaka Theros) of all three Buddhist Chapters in Sri Lanka have called on President Ranil Wickremesinghe to implement the law against the organized groups of people who they claim are spreading false ideologies regarding Buddhism and are harming the Buddhist philosophy and its cultural values.",
    "In a joint letter addressed to the Head of State, the chief prelates highlight that it has become evident that the behaviour of such individuals who are trying to destroy Buddhism can no longer be considered as mere incidents.",
    "Thereby, the Mahanayaka Theros have pointed out that instead of trying to isolate and find solutions to such events, which are carried out in order to corrupt the noble interpretation of the religion, it is time to prepare the necessary legal provisions to prevent such \u2018Dharma distortions\u2019 and \u2018Sasana distortions\u2019 from repeatedly occurring in the society.",
    "Furthermore, the Mahanayaka Theros have emphasized the urgent need to prepare necessary legal provisions to implement the law against such individuals who are trying to create social disturbances by misleading the Buddhist community by promoting such statements on social media and to regulate the promotion of such statements.",
    "Accordingly, the Mahanayaka Theros have sought prompt attention of the President who is \u2018committed to promoting and fostering the safety of Buddhasasana\u2019 regarding the matter.",
