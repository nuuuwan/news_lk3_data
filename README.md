“My reasons for stepping down are both personal and political,” Varadkar, 45, told a hastily arranged news conference at government buildings in Dublin, sounding emotional as he spoke.

### Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban: Sri Lanka cricket denies use of any loopholes

Sri Lanka Cricket has denied that they exploited any loopholes after the Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban fiasco has grabbed the headlines in recent times.

Hasaranga, who had retired from the longest format of the game in August last year, performed a U-turn and was subsequently selected for the Test series against Bangladesh. However, in a major turn of events, the ICC would slap him with a ban on Tuesday, March 19.

This meant that he would be unable to play the series against Bangladesh, but meant that he would be available for the T20 World Cup 2024 and the upcoming season of the IPL with his new franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad.

While there has been speculation among fans and pundits that the Sri Lanka cricket board has exploited a loophole in the ICC rules, the governing body has strongly rejected this claim. The SLC claimed that Hasaranga had informed them via e-mail on March 16 about his desire to play Test matches and said that his fitness levels had improved.

### Parents in Sri Lanka in a major crisis;Drug shortages;Increase in prices multi -fold

*2024-03-21 15:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179333) · `ta`

Sri Lanka faces a health crisis due to drug shortages and rising prices. The government's health budget is insufficient, impacting patients like Nuwan, who travels for cancer treatment. The National Cancer Hospital is crucial for those without private access. The economic downturn exacerbates the crisis, with drug shortages and price increases. The pharmaceutical industry is affected, with international corporations contributing to the shortage. The Sri Lankan currency's fall in 2022-3 increases drug prices, and some fraudsters sell medicines at inflated prices. Health Minister Ramespatra acknowledges these issues, noting increased budget funds to address drug prices but also highlighting outdated drugs in government hospitals.

🟩

Nuwan, a native of Medimalai, travels 230 kilometers every time he is suffering from cancer.

It was revealed last year that his 18 -year -old son was suffering from a bloodbath, and the two parents came to Makarahamavi every time they were treated from their homes.

The government has allocated four percent of its budget for health services to provide free medical mission to all Sri Lankan people.

However, due to the consequences of the economic downturn, the health sector, which has previously been acclaimed, has been in the crisis of drugs.

National Cancer Hospital, such as Puspakumara's family, is very important for many who cannot be treated in private hospitals.

Patients such as Nuwan should be given free of charge but have not recently seen such a situation.

Treatment is excellent but there is a shortage of drugs.

I am buying medicines from my family and friends, but the number of drugs has increased many times, he said.

The MP said Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his book which was released recently clearly said that former Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage had supported him in the implementation of the organic farming policy.

He said the Viyathmaga members who were appointed as Secretaries to the Ministries were against the decisions taken by the President and as a result, four of them were removed.

The MP said this in response to a claim made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who said that the Viyathmaga was behind the faulty decisions taken by Gotabaya Rajapaksa resulting in the expulsion of the then President and the government.

SYDNEY, March 21 (Reuters) - Australia will begin enforcing tougher visa rules for foreign students this week as official data showed migration hit another record high, which is likely to further exacerbate an already tight rental market.

From Saturday, English language requirements for student and graduate visas will be increased, while the government will get the power to suspend education providers from recruiting international students if they repeatedly break rules.

"The actions this weekend will continue to drive migration levels down while delivering on our commitments in the migration strategy to fix the broken system we inherited," Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said in a statement.

A new "genuine student test" will be introduced to further crack down on international students who look to come to Australia primarily to work, while the imposition of "no further stay" conditions will be used on more visitor visas.
