    "Hi! I\u2019m really excited to be involved with my favourite newspaper, The Island, in an active way, and I hope everyone would benefit with my beauty tips.",
    "I will endeavour to make my beauty tips as simple as possible; so let\u2019s start the ball rolling\u2026",
    "You will need one small ripe papaya, cut into pieces, two-three orange slices, and one tablespoon fresh aloe vera gel.",
    "Mix the papaya pieces and the aloe vera gel, in a bowl, and squeeze the juice from the orange slices.",
    "Smear an even layer of this paste on to the face and neck after cleansing.",
    "Let it stay for 10 minutes, then rinse off with cold water and pat dry with a soft towel.",
    "Papaya works wonders in brightening dull, lifeless skin and diminishing dark spots, suntans, acne scars. Orange clears pores of impurities, germs, dirt, grime, pollutants and also helps in controlling excess sebum secretions, decrease oiliness and tighten skin, while aloe vera gel soothes dryness, sunburns and acne",
    "You will need one medium papaya (chopped), three tablespoons coconut oil, and one tablespoon honey.",
    "In a vessel, mash the chopped papaya portions and add the coconut oil and honey.",
    "Blend it into a fine paste, and then apply it uniformly onto scalp and hair, massaging thoroughly, from root to tip.",
    "Leave it on for 30 minutes, and then wash hair with a gentle shampoo.",
    "Papaya promotes the growth of strong, silky hair and combat scalp issues of dandruff, and flaking, while arresting hair fall. Coconut oil penetrates deep into hair shafts, scalp, infusing hydration, locking in moisture, to reduce split ends, frizz, and augment thickness of tresses. Honey not only conditions hair and prevents breakage but also cures scalp irritation and itching.",
    "Mix potato extract with tomato juice and dab on the acne marks to clear acne scars.",
    "Blend potato juice with cucumber juice and apply under the eyes. Leave it overnight to lighten dark circles.",
