### Sri Lankans must improve to render system change successful

*2024-12-02 13:46:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lankans-must-improve-to-render-system-change-successful/) · `en`

“It is not possible to develop a country without the moral development of man. Let us develop the country along with moral development (of man)” So pronounced Most Ven Madihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Thero. This translation from Sinhala is by Ven Vajiraramaya Nanaseeha Thera – previously Deshabandhu Olcott Gunasekera – who was one who assisted the venerable bhikkhu to establish the Dharmavijaya Foundation in 1977. The Foundation later adopted this truth as its mission statement. Moral development connotes character building.

The thought about the quirks and misdemeanours of most Sri Lankans which ultimately tarnish the wellbeing and image of the country has long been in mind and discussed frequently when we older generations meet and grow nostalgic of how things were back then. We most definitely had a much better life, though sans TV and all these advances, since peace and general goodness prevailed.

“The Prime Minister felt betrayed. She was embarrassed, bitter and angry. She was sensitive to Mrs. Gandhi’s feelings”

Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

Mrs. Bandaranaike had an excellent grasp of foreign affairs. Foreign office veterans like Ambassadors Vernon Mendis, Arthur Basnayake and others would vouch for this. But Prime Ministers are extremely busy people, particularly when they also handled heavy Ministries such as Defence and Foreign Affairs, and Planning. When they sit down to three to four hours of concentrated work, in which time they deal with scores of files and hundreds of issues, they cannot be expected to be sensitive to every nuance.

### Fine sportsman, great debater, big appetite but weak stomach

Dudley Senanayake in the short Parliament of March to July 1960

Family and background had been central in Dudley Senanayake’s case too. Greatness had literally been thrust on him when he had been appointed prime minister on the death of his father D S, in 1952. That had been a time of intrigue and maneuvering which had soured the relations between Sir John, his close relative and him.

Sir John had struck back with the Premier Stakes which he later denied having any connection with. So Dudley had been anxious to win his spurs for himself through the hustings as early as possible. And he had proved his legitimacy by winning the 1952 elections handsomely, helped by the sympathy vote created by the death of his father. But his first stint as prime minister did not last long. Plagued by illness, chronic gastritis and the hartal of August 1953 which resulted in police firing and some civilian deaths, Dudley resigned.

### New chapter for Sri Lanka: We cannot give something out of nothing

*2024-12-02 01:59:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-chapter-for-Sri-Lanka-We-cannot-give-something-out-of-nothing/4-769957) · `en`

The railways, historically designed for goods transport, must be reimagined to meet modern needs economically

The nation spoke and a new Government was elected. Now it’s time to unite and work collectively to pull ourselves out of the economic crisis we face. But in doing this, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. While rooting out corruption is critical, it is not the sole solution to achieving prosperity. To truly transform the country, we must prioritise efficiency and overhaul the sluggish State mechanism, reorganising the way in which it runs.

Let’s take Sri Lanka Railways for example. Each year, the State pumps approximately Rs. 57 billion into the railway system in 2024, while its annual revenue from ticket sales is only a mere Rs. 12 billion. A staggering Rs. 45 billion was lost to the State due to inefficiency.

The Central Bank forecasts the headline inflation to remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, but expects it to turn positive thereafter and gradually align with the targeted level of 5% over the medium term, aided by appropriate policy measures.

Attributing larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices to the current negative headline inflation, the Central Bank, however, is keeping its eye on upside and downside risks to inflation projections in the near to medium term.

The Bank says possible upward pressures on the headline inflation could stem from six factors; namely:

Possible upward pressures on global food and energy prices amidst geopolitical uncertainty

Possible sticky global inflation due to the policy changes in the USA And in relation to downside risks to inflation projections, the Bank cites two key reasons among others, namely.

### Sri Lanka’s economic revival: Traditional 8-hour workday or 6-hour workday?

Sri Lanka’s path to economic recovery owes much to the commendable leadership of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) and his dedicated team. Their focus on structural reforms and anti-corruption measures is laying the foundation for a more resilient and equitable economy.

Amid these transformative efforts, a thought-provoking question emerged on social media recently: Should Sri Lanka retain the traditional eight-hour workday or explore a shorter six-hour workday? This debate touches on broader concerns about labour productivity and its critical role in driving economic growth.

Labour productivity is a fundamental driver of economic progress, directly influencing GDP growth and national prosperity. According to the Solow Growth Model of Economics, long-term economic growth is fuelled by labour growth, capital accumulation, and technological advancements.
