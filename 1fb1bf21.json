    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s move to petition the Supreme Court on Sri Lanka\u2019s power tariffs despite an anticipated tariff reduction was a mere media stunt, Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara claimed.",
    "Responding to a question in parliament on Tuesday January 09, Wijesekara suggested that the objective of Premadasa\u2019s petition was to decide a race between the latter and National People Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake for leadership of the opposition.",
    "In his petition, filed on Monday January 08, Premadasa had sought determinations from the country\u2019s apex court that one or several of the respondents named had infringed on the rights of the petitioner or of the citizens of Sri Lanka, among other orders. An interim order to reduce electricity costs or tariffs was also being sought. The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Minister of Power & Energy, the Secretary to the Minister of Power & Energy, and the Attorney General were named as respondents.",
    "Minister Wijesekara said that the cabinet of ministers had decided to reduce electricity tariffs weeks before Premadasa\u2019s petition.",
    "\u201cThe cabinet decision to reduce tariffs was taken on December 05. On December 12, the secretary to the cabinet informed me, as the minister, of this decision. The cabinet decided on December 31 to consider the balance sheet and take decisions pertaining to the reduction. On December 12, the opposition leader and representatives of the opposition were invited to a meeting, an invitation he rejected,\u201d said Wijesekara.",
    "\u201cWhat was filed in the Supreme Court yesterday was just a media stunt,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cToday, the CEB is forwarding that proposal to its board of directors. After the board of directors have approved the proposal, it will be forwarded to the PUCSL. The PUCSL is correct when they say they have not yet received the proposal. The PUCSL will receive it upon approval by the board in the coming days. Then the PUCSL has 21 days to publicise it for public consultations. The decision on the tariff will be made after public consultation,\u201d the minister said.",
    "\u201cWe believe it is possible to reduce tariffs. We have communicated this,\u201d said Wijesekara.",
    "\u201cI think [Premadasa[ is trying to create a race inside the opposition, to decide between himself and [MP Dissanayake] for leadership of the opposition,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Jan09/2024)"
