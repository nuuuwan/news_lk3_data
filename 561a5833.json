    "It is more dangerous for Putin than for me, honestly because it\u2019s only in Russia that they want to kill me, whereas the entire world wants to kill him, said\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky",
    "Zelensky said this when\u00a0asked by a reporter if he was in danger and feared for his life.",
    "At least 21,000 Wagner mercenaries have been killed fighting in Ukraine, according to Zelensky.",
    "The Ukrainian leader said the private military company had suffered \u201cenormous losses,\u201d particularly in eastern Ukraine where its \u201cmost powerful group\u201d was fighting.",
    "\u201cOur troops killed 21,000 Wagnerites in eastern Ukraine alone,\u201d Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday, adding that another 80,000 Wagner fighters had been wounded.",
    "\u201cThese were enormous losses for the Wagner PMC,\u201d said Zelensky, who characterized its fighters as a \u201cmotivated staff of the Russian army\u201d and mostly convicts who \u201chad nothing to lose.\u201d",
    "CNN could not independently verify the claim by Zelensky, made during a press conference with Spanish media to coincide with a visit to Kyiv by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.",
    "The trip by Sanchez is his third visit to Ukraine. It comes as Spain takes over the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union and follows news that CIA Director William Burns also recently traveled to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky and Ukrainian intelligence officials.",
    "Ukrainian Zelensky\u2019s claims about Wagner\u2019s losses comes just a week after the private military company\u2019s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin led his men in an abortive rebellion against Moscow.",
    "Wagner troops had marched toward the Russian capital, taking control of military facilities in two Russian cities in what Prigozhin said was a response to a Russian military attack on a Wagner camp, before a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko defused the crisis.",
    "The future of the Wagner Group is now unclear, with the deal brokered by Lukashenko requiring Prigozhin to move to Belarus and his fighters given the option of either signing up to the Russian military or enforcement agencies, returning to their families and friends, or also going to Belarus.",
    "In his speech Saturday, Zelensky said Prigozhin\u2019s rebellion had \u201cgreatly affected Russian power on the battlefield\u201d and could be beneficial to Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.",
    "\u201cWe need to take advantage of this situation to push the enemy out of our land,\u201d Zelensky said.",
    "\u201cThey are losing the war. They have no more victories on the battlefield in Ukraine, and so they are starting to look for someone to blame,\u201d he said."
