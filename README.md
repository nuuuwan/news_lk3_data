The report of the three-member panel, headed by retired High Court judge Aadambaragay Nilanthi Jayaki de Alwis, disagreed with a five-judge panel of the Supreme Court that fined Sirisena 100 million rupees for failing to prevent the bombing on April 21, 2019.

The main reason for the Supreme Court finding Sirisena responsible was the assertion that he had been made aware of a prior intelligence warning of the attack, which killed 280 and wounded 500.

An Indian intelligence agency had provided details of the impending attack.

*2024-10-23 06:11:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Cabinet-nod-to-limit-scrap-metal-tenders-to-local-bidders-to-boost-industries/34-768296) · `en`

The Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting on Monday decided restricting tenders for the disposal of scrap metal by State-owned transport companies to local bidders only, to support domestic industries.

Earlier, in June 2024 the Government approved a proposal to call for international tenders to sell the large volumes of scrap metal accumulated by the Sri Lanka Railway Department and the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

“The new decision restricts the bidding process to local companies; a shift intended to address the raw material needs of manufacturers. The move is aimed at boosting local industries that rely on scrap metal for production,” Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

He said the market has faced shortages of raw materials and the Government hopes that by keeping these resources within the country, local businesses will benefit from more affordable and accessible scrap metal.

Peruvian former President Alejandro Toledo was convicted of taking bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht and sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison on Monday.

The verdict marks Peru’s first high-profile conviction related to Brazil’s continent-spanning Lava Jato corruption scandal.

Toledo, a 78-year-old economist who holds a doctorate from Stanford University, governed the Andean nation between 2001 and 2006.

He was convicted of taking $35 million in bribes from the company formerly known as Odebrecht, according to prosecutors, in exchange for letting it win a contract to build the road that now connects Peru’s southern coast with an Amazonian area in western Brazil.

During the year-long trial, Toledo denied the money-laundering and collusion charges.

Odebrecht, now known as Novonor, was at the center of Latin America’s largest graft scandal, after admitting in 2016 that it bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts.
