### The president who handles another important challenge

*2024-11-02 11:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/197697) · `ta`

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Sri Lankan government faces challenges in economy, travel advisories, and reconciliation. National People's Power wins local election, increasing support. New government maintains economic committee, gaining IMF confidence. Travel restrictions implemented due to terror threats. Government addresses concerns about foreign tourists' illegal activities. President announces provincial council elections to promote diversity and decentralization. Critics argue high costs, but decentralization crucial for addressing ethnic and regional disparities.

🟩

The government is very intelligent in its actions, if it is a matter of dealing with the economy, travel instructions or reconciliation process.

Experiences its resulting benefit. The victory of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha in the South is a sign that the popular population continues to increase after a month of power.

The increase in the currency expands to the national people's power, not limited to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The difference in the success of the national people's power is much greater than the last time it faced such a local election.

Earlier in 2019, the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha had two seats.

Now it has captured 15 designs. The national people's power, which received only six percent of the vote, now received 48 percent of the votes.

The increase in the victory of the National People's Power in the Local Government election is the result of the polls of voters that they will benefit after the victory of the national People's Power in the presidential election.

The sheer volume of new candidates across the north-east is indicative of a highly politicised population and new blood will emerge from this

Tamils are fed up with the status quo. The prevailing anti-establishment sentiment is reflected in the fact that the 12 seats open in the Jaffna and Vanni electoral districts are contested by over 800 contestants, the vast majority of whom are independent candidates. Addressing the mere basics, such as day-to-day economic grievances, means a lot in a country like Sri Lanka, which has been wracked by instability for decades. The splintering of Tamil parties, all vying for votes with roughly the same nationalist (or pseudo-nationalist) platforms, may also lower each party’s vote share

As the nation gears down for the second election in the short space of two months, it is incontrovertible that the winds of change continue to whistle through the corridors of power and influence.

A quick survey of the contenders in the parliamentary polls set for 14 November shows that a slew of newcomers to the fore focus on ‘national’, ‘developmental’ and ‘progressive’ fronts.

The decks are cleared for showdown between the old guard representing a rump in the house that until recently looked like it could not be ever moved, and that the people’s aspirations as reflected in the ultimately abortive Aragalaya of 2022 would not be reflected in the legislature of 2024-9.

*2024-11-02 04:06:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-a-Trump-or-Harris-presidency-means-to-the-world/4-768721) · `en`

The 5 November election, for all its drama, jabs, and entertainment, many feel very frustrated or uninspired. Neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris has inspired serious confidence, and the choices may seem lacklustre to voters. Yet, make no mistake: the 2024 election is significant. Whether or not it ushers in an era of “tub-thumping ideology,” it has the potential to reshape the global landscape, given what is happening outside the USA. A Trump or Harris presidency would present contrasting impacts and consequences for the rest of the world, especially given their divergent views on international relations, climate policy, trade, investment, and alliances. Here are five key areas with the potential for global impact:

### Live Not By Lies – History Of The Gender Ideology

*2024-11-02 01:01:48* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/live-not-by-lies-history-of-the-gender-ideology/) · `en`

Wikipedia states that ‘gender identity’ is an individual self-conception of perceiving oneself as man or woman, as fluctuating between man and woman or being something outside of man and woman. Gender identity, despite political, social and lexical prominence, given to it, especially it in the last years; is an imagined state of selfhood. It is not science. It is an ideology.

Empirically, there exists ONLY two biological sexes. Yet, gender ideology’s Denial of Reality is not only being pressed upon children, but been taught and proselytized through western institutions in our country. Since our economic crisis, this ideology has begun to inundate our vocabulary, the corporate climate and even our political leadership.

During this campaign year, there are various discourses by political parties and alliances about how to develop the country or bring development in order to address the current problems faced by the people, institutions and the government? Central bank has its own formulae to address the debt problem. National People Power (NPP) which is headed by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has suggested improvement of local production along with support for export-oriented manufacturing. Local participation in such efforts is also to be encouraged. One of its aims is to support those who are struggling to maintain a descent quality of life with social welfare. In this article, I wish to explore the types of development suitable for a country like Sri Lanka that has pursued neoliberal economics policies since late 70s. Not many talks about whether the current predicament is due to the following of such policies?

### Ceasefire hopes fade as Israel bombards Gaza, Lebanon

Prospects of a ceasefire between Israel and its foes Hamas and Hezbollah ran aground on Friday as Israeli airstrikes killed at least 64 people in the Gaza Strip, according to medics in the Palestinian enclave, and battered Beirut’s southern suburbs.

U.S. envoys had been working to secure ceasefires on both fronts ahead of the U.S. presidential election next Tuesday.

But Hamas did not favour a temporary truce, its Al-Aqsa Hamas television reported on Friday. The ceasefire proposals failed to meet its conditions that any deal must end the year-long war in Gaza and include a withdrawal of Israeli forces from there, it said.

Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his priority was to enforce security “despite any pressure or constraints”.

His office said he relayed this message to U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk in Israel on Thursday. Israel meanwhile pressed on with its military offensives against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon on Friday.

### SWRD, JR et al. – Tradition Or Mythology?

“Oh little monk, it is an arduous path you are taking…” on Martin Luther’s decision to challenge the papacy.

“The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like an incubus upon the brain of the living” ~ Karl Marx

As the common saying goes ‘Success has many fathers but failure is an orphan. And, in recent times, no other political career has been as successful as that of President Anura Kumar Dissanayake.

Hailing from rural Thambuttegama, with no pretension to so called Sri Lankan elite status, member of a putatively Marxist political party (an ideology seemingly out of step with the modern world in many aspects) and having received only about 3% of the general vote at the Presidential elections in 2019, Dissanayake yet won an emphatic approval from the voter in September 2024. His closest rival was more than a million votes behind. Prominent politicians, heralded for decades, would have turned green with envy contemplating the Dissanayake success.

🟩

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said that the economic policy of former President Ranil Wickremesinghe continues to change without any change.

ஆட்சிமாற்றத்தை ஏற்படுத்திய மக்கள் ஏமாற்றமடைந்துள்ளார்கள் என ஸ்ரீ லங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் தேசிய அமைப்பாளர் நாமல் ராஜபக்ஷ தெரிவித்தார்.

Speaking at a meeting of the Sri Lanka Peoples Freedom Alliance (PA) organizer in Colombo on Friday (01).

அரசியல் ரீதியில் பல சவால்களை எதிர்கொண்டுள்ளோம். Those who were with us during the presidential election left us for narrow political needs. அவ்வாறு சென்றவர்கள் இன்று அரசியலில் பாரிய நெருக்கடிகளை எதிர்கொண்டுள்ளார்கள்.

ஆகவே பாராளுமன்றத்தில் பிரதான எதிர்க்கட்சி பதவியை பொதுஜன பெரமுனவுக்கு வழங்குவார்கள் என்ற நம்பிக்கை உள்ளது.

ஜனாதிபதி அநுரகுமார திசாநாயக்க 1994 ஆம் ஆண்டுக்கு பின்னர் ஆட்சியில் இருந்த அனைத்து அரசாங்கங்களையும் விமர்சித்தார். ஆகவே இம்முறை அவர் அரசாங்கத்தை நிர்வகிக்கட்டும். He knows that it is difficult to say then.
