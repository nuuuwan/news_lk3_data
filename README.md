ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed a ‘BBB(lka)’ insurer rating of Sri Lanka’s National Insurance Trust Fund, with a stable outlook but warned on its inability to get re-insurance cover on time.

The NITF’s major source of revenue is riots, civil commotion and terrorism (SRCCT) premium it gets from other insurers, where claims were not high.

“NITF’s risk-management practices continue to be weak, as evident from its inability to renew reinsurance contracts on time,…” Fitch said.

“We believe facing unforeseen losses without reinsurance cover could result in heightened volatility for NITF’s capital position and earnings.”

NITF’s retrocession cover had expired in January 2023 and reinsurance cover for SRCCT in July 2023, but firm has not been able to renew them, Fitch said.

Fitch said NITF’s gross premiums would surge in 2024 following a after directive requiring primary insurers to remit 100 percent of motor SRCCT premiums to NITF, up from the previous 12 percent.

Former State Minister Diana Gamage has officially withdrawn her petition challenging the Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s (SJB) decision to revoke her party membership. During yesterday’s proceedings, Gamage’s legal team informed the Supreme Court that she did not intend to pursue the case further.

During the Court proceedings, Gamage’s attorneys requested permission to withdraw the petition, stating there was no need to continue with the legal challenge. The Supreme Court subsequently granted their request, allowing the petition to be withdrawn without further action.

The Government has decided to provide additional funding for the Nanu Oya Railway Station modernisation project, which aims to enhance the station’s facilities to boost tourism and improve passenger experiences.

The move follows a previous Cabinet decision made on 3 April 2023. Initially, the project was set to be implemented with a budget of Rs. 74.63 million, funded by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTDA).

However, the contract value has now increased to Rs. 101.81 million due to rising costs and expanded project scope.

The proposal for the increased funding was presented by the Tourism and Land Minister Harin Fernando on Monday allowing the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) to complete the modernisation activities.

The additional amount required will be sourced from the SLTDA and the SLTPB based on recommendations from the Department of Railway.

### Why can’t that great idea get funded?

Ultimately, the success of any startup hinges on a strong idea, a capable and resilient team, and the relentless pursuit of excellence

The startup world is founded on daring dreams, fuelled by relentless passion and the fearless pursuit of innovation. Yet, for most, the path to success is obstructed by a crucial obstacle – securingg adequate funding. While headlines celebrate lucrative funding rounds, many would-be founders have quit steady jobs, invested their lifetime savings, and work night and day for a venture that was teetering over before it had a chance to get started, all thanks to lack of funding.

When promising ventures fall short of an investor’s expectations, bridging the funding gap seems near impossible. Here, are some of the major culprits behind fundraising failures.

Sanjiva Weerawarana, whose software company WSO2 was recently acquired for $ 600 million, was asked by an interviewer what he wanted of Government. Keep the lights on, he said.

It’s a succinct answer that embodies much. It can be interpreted as a statement that the State should focus on providing what we cannot provide for ourselves: law and order, most infrastructure services, and even things like identity and authentication services. But for the moment, let’s take just the literal meaning: uninterrupted electricity.

Transmission and distribution losses are relevant when comparing electricity supply from a far-off plant against distributed generation where electricity production is closer to the consumer

News media reports that the Power and Energy Ministry is to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Government relating to the planned Indo-Lanka cross-strait power grid connectivity within a few months. According to Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, GOSL has made it a priority to complete the grid connection by 2030.

This milestone (electricity import via SL-India grid intertie) along with other 2030 milestones of thermal plant fuel switching (diesel to LNG) and meeting 70% of electricity demand via use of renewable energy (RE) resources leads towards a complex outcome.

This article highlights the commercial challenge faced when determining the optimal mix of; a) electricity received from India, b) electricity from LNG generation, and c) RE based electricity.

Doing things differently and doing different things are two primary mechanisms we must embrace to come out of this economic mess that we are in. Well, the answer to why change is because repeating the past that led us to this present predicament is not at all a sound idea. I am not yet sure that we have understood this. Even with our backs against all the walls in and around us we still plan, and discuss doing more of the same that we were doing before.

### False Terrorism Cases Enable Repression; Politically Motivated Detentions, Surveillance, Threats

*2024-07-18 02:42:25* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/false-terrorism-cases-enable-repression-politically-motivated-detentions-surveillance-threats/) · `en`

Sri Lankan authorities continue to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to target perceived opponents and minority communities without credible evidence to support the allegations despite repeated pledges to end the practice, Human Rights Watch said today. While some victims have suffered years of arbitrary detention and torture, others are persecuted even after the case against them is dropped.

The law, widely known as the PTA, has provisions allowing for extended administrative detention, limited judicial oversight, and inadequate protections against torture. In a 2022 speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the then foreign minister pledged a moratorium on its use, but under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, detentions under the PTA have continued. Such is the chilling effect of the law that in September 2023 the International Monetary Fund found that “broad application of counter-terrorism rules” restricts civil society scrutiny of official corruption.

Early in his presidency or rather, the balance of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidential term, to complete which he was selected by the Rajapaksas and elected by the vote of the discredited ruling SLPP, Ranil Wickremesinghe chaired a conference at the Presidential Secretariat. He said “we can talk about holding elections after fulfilling the agreement with the IMF, completing the debt restructuring efforts and placing the economy firmly on a high-growth path”. This wasn’t at a secret conclave of plotters planning to subvert the Constitution. It was on TV news.

Just recently, in Mahiyangana, Ranil contributed to political theory by proclaiming outrageously: “I have said earlier that judicial power doesn’t rest with the judiciary; judicial power rests with the legislature…so that ends there.”
