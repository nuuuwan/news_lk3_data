    "A top level seminar on the new anti-corruption laws and their impact on the private sector will be held on 21 March at 2.00 p.m. at the Movenpick Hotel, Colombo.",
    "Distinguished speakers at the seminar include former Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) of Sri Lanka Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC, with extensive criminal legal experience as a Senior Additional Solicitor General in the Attorney General\u2019s department.",
    "Joining him is newly appointed commissioner to the CIABOC Chethiya Gunasekera, who is also a President\u2019s Counsel and a former Additional Solicitor General at the Attorney General\u2019s department.",
    "The seminar will feature insights from other prominent officials such as CIABOC Assistant Director General D.I. Rajapakse, Assistant Director Legal U. Kumarihamy, former Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Director General and Ministry of Finance Senior Advisor Malik Cader will chair the sessions.",
    "Organised by Corporate Management Consultants the discussion will centre on the significant changes brought about by the new Anti-Corruption Act of 2023, one of the conditions of the IMF which will help eradicate corruption. This Act expands the scope of the previous bribery laws to encompass not only public servants and government officials but also the corporate sector.",
    "Under this new legislation, the CIABOC or Bribery Commission as we know will have jurisdiction over not just Government entities but also corporations, emphasising the need for corporate entities to carefully consider the impact on their reputation and their employees.",
    "This timely seminar is tailored for Corporate Directors, senior officials, and HR professionals in the private sector.",
    "Attendees will gain valuable insights on the necessity of developing an anti-corruption code within their organisations, with every staff member expected to endorse this code. The seminar will also shed light on how matters related to gifts, sponsorships, and other forms of hospitality will be scrutinised by the anti-corruption authority.",
    "For those operating in the corporate landscape, this seminar will be pivotal in understanding the evolving regulatory landscape and proactively addressing compliance and integrity within their organisations.",
