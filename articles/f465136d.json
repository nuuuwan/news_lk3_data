    "There seems to be no end in sight to debates on the Easter Sunday carnage (2019), the latest being the one Parliament is scheduled to commence today. Chances are that the House will be thrown into turmoil, with the sittings descending into a three-day slanging match. If experience is anything to go by, nothing is likely to come of the debate.",
    "It may be recalled that on 23 Oct., 2019, a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC), which looked into the Easter Sunday terror attacks submitted its report to Parliament. The SJB MPs, who claim to have pressured the government to hold the debate to kick off today, were members of the  Yahapalana government, which appointed the aforesaid PSC. One can only hope that parliamentary time will be utilised productively in the next few days.",
    "As for the Easter Sunday attacks, there are several schools of thought, the prominent being that they were engineered by the SLPP to win the 2019 presidential election; ISIS had them carried out; Moulavi Mohamad Ibrahim Mohamad Nauffer, who is in custody, masterminded them, and they were part of an external conspiracy to destabilise Sri Lanka. The general consensus is that there was a conspiracy, as former Attorney General Dappula de Livera is reported to have said.",
    "The claim that ISIS was responsible for the Easter Sunday terror attacks is widely considered far-fetched. Nobody seems to have taken it seriously.",
    "A possible connection between the terror strikes and the SLPP was hinted at by the aforesaid PSC, which said in its report that a probe had to be conducted to find out whether they had been aimed at creating conditions for a regime change in the latter part of 2019.",
    "The story that Nauffer is the terror mastermind is floated by the SLPP. In 2021, the then Minister of Public Security Sarath Weerasekera told Parliament that the FBI (of the US) had confirmed that Nauffer was the mastermind. But National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) leader Zahran Hashim\u2019s wife, Fathima Haidya, told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCOI), which probed the Easter Sunday carnage that Zahran and Nauffer had been in contact with a person called Abu Hind in India. Hind has been identified by an international expert of terrorism as a character created by a section of a provincial Indian intelligence apparatus. Zahran believed that Hind was an ISIS representative, according to the PCOI report. Pulasthi Mahendran aka Sara Jasmine, the widow of Muhammadu Hasthun, who blew himself at St. Sebastian\u2019s Church, Katuwapitiya, in 2019, is believed to be privy to the NTJ\u2019s secrets. Initially, it was claimed that she had died in a blast in a house in the East during a raid conducted by the army and the police, but it is now believed that she fled the country with the help of a foreign intelligence outfit. If she is still alive and can be arrested, it may be possible to ascertain information about the terror mastermind and the NTJ\u2019s foreign links.",
    "Politicians, religious leaders, high-ranking military and police officers, terrorism experts and Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith himself have categorically stated in their testimonies before the PCOI that there was an external hand in the terrorist attacks.",
    "Those who claim to have identified the Easter Sunday terror mastermind/s or ascertained vital information to prove who masterminded the carnage are heaving like the proverbial blind men who tried to figure out what an elephant was like by touching different parts of the animal\u2019s anatomy, came to different conclusions and quarrelled. The Easter Sunday attacks, we believe, have not been investigated properly from all angles. Above all, former President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s claim that he knows who masterminded the carnage must be probed, and action should be taken against him if he has sought to mislead investigators.",
    "Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has renewed his offer to have the leaders of the Catholic Church briefed on the status of the ongoing police investigations into the Easter Sunday tragedy. Claiming that the Catholic prelates have not responded to his offer, he has said he is willing to take on board their views and even make adjustments to the probe, if necessary. Why his offer has not been accepted is the question.",
    "There is no need for the Easter Sunday terror attacks to be debated in Parliament. What is needed is a thorough, credible investigation thereinto. The PCOI report has some flaws, as we have argued in a previous comment, but it is based on an extensive probe painstakingly conducted for a long time and contains valuable information. It can be the basis for a future probe besides the one being conducted by the police.",
