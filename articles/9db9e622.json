    "During the trial, the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) stated before the court that the suspect had downloaded and reposted a picture which was initially posted by a French woman on Facebook that contained the proscribed symbols of the LTTE organization.",
    "Stating that this had disrupted public order and ethnic harmony, the officers also stated that no such event had been held in the North. Since the investigation has not been completed, the officers of the CID requested that the suspect be further remanded in custody.",

In response, the officers of the CID stated that no such statements had been recorded and submitted to the court.",
