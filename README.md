ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s budget deficit has collapsed to 361 billion rupees up to April 2024 from 824.2 helped by higher tax revenues and a falling interest bill, official data show.

Revenues surged 48 percent to 1,216 billion rupees to April 2024, ahead of the 35 percent annual growth projected in a budget, with higher value added and income tax rates as well as economic activity recovering close to previous levels.

Sri Lanka is emerging from the worst case of ‘policy support’ deployed by macroeconomists since the central bank was set up in 1950 where the usual inflationary rate cuts which trigger currency crises and IMF programs, was also backed up tax cuts.

Giving policy support and denying monetary stability has become mainstream in the age of inflation and ‘age of external defaults without a war’ due to so-called Saltwater-Cambridge doctrine, critics say.

But now suddenly the conversation is different as all three likely Presidential Candidates –  Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajit Pemadasa – are bidding for our Tamil votes, even promising the 13th Amendment and more.

There are chronic adherents to the habit who however consider work as the curse of the drinking classes! Whichever way it is looked at, continued, indiscriminate and habitual intake of alcohol finally leads to alcoholism.

### Do the Tamil Critics of the 13th Constitutional Amendment have the Political Strength to Force a Future Govt to Introduce a Devolution Scheme  better than what is Available in the Provincial Councils?

*2024-06-30 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84298) · `en`

Sri Lankan Tamil politics has become more complicated due to contradictions among Tamil political parties regarding what position northern and eastern Tamils should take in the upcoming Presidential Election.

It makes no sense to expect Tamil parties to be inclined to act unitedly or to come to a unified position to find a solution to the national ethnic problem.

The idea of fielding a Tamil common candidate at the Presidential Election has occupied Tamil politics in recent times.

Though the Democratic Tamil National Alliance (DTNA), consisting of a few Tamil parties whose leaders formerly were prominent members of armed militant groups, have decided to support the attempts to field a common Tamil candidate, the initial enthusiasm among some Tamil parties is now absent in this regard.

There are conflicting views not only between parties but also within each party regarding the common candidate.

### Two aged US presidents square off in debate for the ages

*2024-06-30 00:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/two-aged-us-presidents-square-off-in-debate-for-the-ages/) · `en`

The Biden-Trump debate, touted as the political face-off that would change the course of history, was held Thursday night at the CNN studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The rather unusual ground rules for the debate had been agreed upon by the candidates weeks ago. It was the earliest presidential debate in history, held as it was more than four months before election day in November.

These ground rules were considered to be essential to avoid a repetition of the debate between these two when they were candidates for the presidency in 2020. During that first debate nearly four years ago, the general consensus was that Trump was “unhinged, bullied, bulldozed and obfuscated” (CNN), talked “incoherently and rattled off unfounded and baseless attacks” (NBC) spewed “misleading claims and outright lies” (New York Times) and showed he had “nothing but contempt for the values and norms that are essential to democracy” (Washington Post). No one wanted to see that kind of confrontational fiasco again.

### The Idea of the Global South

*2024-06-30 00:42:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-idea-of-the-global-south/) · `en`

It is easy to celebrate the return of Asia, the rise of the Global South, the resurgence of the Non-Aligned nations of the world. It is harder to chart a course for these countries and regions, to strategise the way forward for them.

The Global South, to be sure, has never been stronger before. The present moment is rife with many possibilities. The US and its allies have effectively lost the moral high ground, though some would argue and not incorrectly that it never held that high ground in the first place. South Africa’s intervention in the ongoing genocide in Gaza is an example of the immense potential of Global Southernism: the trial was launched at the behest, not of China or Russia or any of those countries that have a major issue with the US-led Western alliance, but of a state that had no rivalry or issue with that alliance.

### Sri Lanka government repays foreign debt on a net basis in 1Q 2024

*2024-06-29 18:52:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-government-repays-foreign-debt-on-a-net-basis-in-1q-2024-170244/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT  – Sri Lanka’s budget foreign financing was negative in the first quarter of 2024, as the government repaid debt on a net basis, official data show.

Sri Lanka has a debt moratorium and unless new budget support loans come from agencies like the World Bank or Asian Development Bank, or some earlier projects disburse funds, the government has to keep servicing multilateral debt.

Foreign financing was a net repayment of 14.9 billion rupees in the first three months of the year, the central bank said which was lower than the negative 41.4 billion in 2024.

While interest payments will have to be serviced with the restructuring agreements of the bilaterals, new principle disbursements will take place as soon as projects are resumed.

Domestic financing was also lower at 296.1 billion rupees, down from 666.1 billion last year. (Colombo/June29/2024)
