    "No decision has been taken to withdraw any police officers deployed for the security of Mihintale sacred premises, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said.",
    "Furthermore, SSP Thalduwa assured that Sri Lanka Police would continue to engage in duties at the premises accordingly.",
    "Meanwhile, State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon stated in Parliament today (10) that all 225 members of the security forces deployed for the security of the Mihintale sacred premises would be withdrawn with immediate effect. The State Minister mentioned this citing the Chief Prelate of Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya who recently alleged that his life was at risk due to the security personnel entering the temple premises, clad in civilian clothes.",
    "Commenting regarding the matter, Tennakoon said: \u201cWe learned only recently that an army officer cannot enter a temple in civilian clothes. Now we have decided that if he [Mihintale Chief Prelate] deems the military presence at the temple a threat to his life, we will remove all 252 officers from the temple premises today itself.\u201d",
    "However, Sri Lanka Police, issuing a statement assured that although army personnel would be removed from the temple premises, all police officers will continue to remain on duty at the Mihintale sacred area."
