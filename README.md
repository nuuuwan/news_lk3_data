### Trade Ministry to issue price range to curb middlemen profits

*2024-04-09 09:21:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Trade-Ministry-to-issue-price-range-to-curb-middlemen-profits/108-280445) · `en`

Colombo, April 9 (daily Mirror) - The Trade, Commerce, and Food Security Ministry is to issue price ranges on essential items to curb excessive profits by middlemen in the retail market.

After a meeting held at the ministry, Minister Nalin Fernando said that the increase in commodity prices was a result of the economic crisis and inflation.

In 2022, Sri Lanka faced the challenge of being one of the countries with the highest commodity prices globally, primarily due to soaring inflation.

"In 2019, a kilogram of wheat flour was priced at Rs. 85. By 2022, this price had escalated to Rs. 485, leading to a loaf of bread being sold for approximately Rs. 195 to Rs. 200.

Similarly, in 2019, a kilogram of dhal was sold for around Rs. 120. By 2022, this price had surged to Rs. 585 but has since dropped to Rs. 295," the minister said.

The depreciation of the dollar exchange rate, which initially contributed to the rise in commodity prices, has now stabilized.

### UK travel advice tweaks for Sri Lanka ‘still unfair’

*2024-04-09 09:18:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98528/uk-travel-advice-tweaks-for-sri-lanka-still-unfair) · `en`

The UK government has tweaked its travel advice for Sri Lanka, but campaigners believe further changes are still required.

An open letter published in January called for the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to update its advice, describing sections as “overly harsh”, “outdated” and “synthetic”.

The advice has now been changed slightly, with a reference to roadblocks amended.

Sam Clark, chief executive of Sri Lanka specialist Experience Travel Group, said the advice is now “much better and more contextualised, but still not reflective of the current situation on the ground”.

In February, the advice stated: “Protests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and security authorities may use tear gas and water cannons against protesters. The authorities may impose restrictions, including curfews, with little or no notice. Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings.”

### Sri Lanka to publish ‘indicative prices’ for 15 essential goods as rupee strengthens

Meanwhile the US money printing also pushed up global commodity prices including wheat, until the Federal Reserve hike rates starting from March 2022, and commodity prices started to ease about 4 to 5 months later.

### National Education Policy

*2024-04-09 02:49:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180772) · `ta`

The Jaffna University Teachers Union opposes the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), arguing it threatens Sri Lanka's long-term free education tradition by prioritizing profit over education quality and welfare. NEPF aims to transform education into a profit-making business, abolishing state education and the University Grants Commission (UGC), and introducing university fees. It also focuses on economics and digital education, ignoring broader educational goals like literacy and critical thinking. The union calls for the withdrawal of these reforms and prioritizes the interests of the people over market forces.

🟩

The Jaffna University Teachers Union alleges that the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF) is a significant threat to the tradition of long -term free education in Sri Lanka.

As a Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA), we strongly oppose the proposed National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), which is a significant threat to our country's long-term free education heritage.

The NEPF program transforms the education system into a profit -making business by highlighting the government's responsibility in education, the abolition of state education, and the abolition of the University Grants Commission (UGC).

These reforms prior the profit rather than the quality of education and the welfare of students and educators. By introducing tariffs at the university level and withdrawing state funds for higher education, the NEPF undermines the equal access policy for education centered on Sri Lanka's social structure after independence.

### Role of Buddhism in fight against caste oppression in Tamil Nadu

*2024-04-09 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Role-of-Buddhism-in-fight-against-caste-oppression-in-Tamil-Nadu/172-280411) · `en`

Buddhism flourished in ancient India, including Tamil Nadu from the early years of the Christian era till about the 14th century. At its height, it enjoyed royal patronage and was the religion of the elite which at that time comprised the urban and mercantile classes.

Buddhism ceased to exist in India in the medieval period for a variety of reasons, and saw a revival of sorts only in the closing years of the 19th century.

The discoveries of British archaeologists and anti-colonial and religious revivalist movements in Ceylon and India spurred by Europeans interested in Eastern thought, were factors responsible for increasing interest in Buddhism at the end of the 19th century.

In Ceylon, the Buddhist revival was a part of a nationalistic upsurge, the search for a national identity. But in India, its revival was part of the movement to liberate the traditionally oppressed “untouchable” castes, now called Dalits.
