Gaining professional qualifications in the field will make midwifery a viable career path for us in Sri Lanka and abroad. We had only studied midwifery at diploma level. But now, we can study up to the degree level. The programmes at IIHS give us the opportunity to gain international-level knowledge, which in turn allows us to provide superior service to our community.\u201d",
