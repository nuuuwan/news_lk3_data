### Canada to cut immigration numbers, government source says

*2024-10-24 12:34:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102901/-canada-to-cut-immigration-numbers-government-source-says) ¬∑ `en`

Canada will sharply lower the number of immigrants it allows into the country for the first time in years, marking a notable shift in policy for the government as it tries to remain in power.

Canada will bring in 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027, down from 485,000 in 2024, according to a government source.

The number of temporary residents, meanwhile, will decrease by about 30,000 to around 300,000 in 2025, the source said.

Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers, but in recent years, the national debate around immigrants has shifted in part due to rising housing prices.

Many Canadians have been priced out of the housing market since interest rates started rising two years ago. At the same time, a huge influx of immigrants has pushed Canada‚Äôs population to record levels, further boosting housing demand and prices.

In a swift move, Airlineratings.com last week downgraded SriLankan Airlines‚Äô safety rating from 7 to 6 stars following a disturbing incident aboard flight UL 607. On September 21, 2024, the captain of the flight locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit. The incident was deemed serious enough to warrant an immediate reassessment of the airline‚Äôs safety credentials.

However, after a thorough review and prompt response from the airline, the rating has been restored to 7 out of 7 stars, acknowledging SriLankan Airlines‚Äô commitment to addressing the incident with transparency and urgency.

On September 21, a flight from Colombo to Melbourne took an alarming turn when the captain of flight UL 607 locked the co-pilot out of the cockpit. This violation of standard operating procedures raised immediate safety concerns for the airline and SriLankan Airlines wasted no time in taking corrective action and has shared this exclusively with AIrlineRatings.com

The United States said for the first time on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that could mark a significant escalation in Russia‚Äôs war against its neighbor.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in Rome, said it would be ‚Äúvery, very serious‚Äù if the North Koreans were preparing to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, as Kyiv has alleged. But he said it remained to be seen what they would be doing there.

‚ÄúThere is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,‚Äù Austin told reporters, using North Korea‚Äôs formal name, the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea.

Speaking to reporters later on Wednesday White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States believes at least 3,000 North Korean troops are undergoing training at three military bases in eastern Russia.

### Sri Lanka SOE container terminal to get tax exemptions as ‚Äòspecial project‚Äô

ECONOMNYNEXT ‚Äì A container terminal built by Sri Lanka Ports Authority has been named a ‚Äòspecial project‚Äô by the cabinet to give tax benefits Minister Vijitha Herath said.

Private terminals in the port are given tax benefits under a Strategic Development Project law.

The excessive length of tax breaks as well as exempting senior official‚Äôs companies from personal income tax under the SDP when people earning above 100,000 rupees are taxed has become a contentious issue.

‚ÄúThe International Monetary Fund has objected to benefits under the Strategic Development Act law,‚Äù Minister Herath said.

‚ÄúThis is not going under that process. It is going as a special project.‚Äù

The SDP had come under fire also for negotiated tax breaks, which allegedly leads to corruption as there are no fixed rules.

The East Terminal is now partially built and contracts for cranes have been awarded, a post-cabinet statement said.

‚ÄúThe other two jetties have been given some tax exemptions,‚Äù Minister Herath explained.

### AKD‚Äôs call for a ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô government: Implications for political system

In his stump speech on the General Election campaign trail, President AKD has called for the voters to produce a ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù (‚Äúbalavath‚Äù, ‚Äúprabala‚Äù) government.

Interestingly, he did not call for a ‚Äústrong‚Äù (shakthimath‚Äù) government which is conventionally the opposite of a ‚Äúweak‚Äù one. Given where he‚Äôs coming from, that distinction and his choice of words should give us pause.

Sri Lanka, Ceylon at the time, was not only the first in Afro-Asia to have universal franchise but it was also the first in South Asia to evolve a two-party system. India which was independent a year before Ceylon, maintained what was defined in the political science literature as a ‚Äòone-party dominant‚Äô system until 1977. That was the party of Independence, the Congress party. The term ‚Äòone-party dominant‚Äô was minted to differentiate such countries from those which had a ‚Äòone-party system‚Äô be it Fascist (e.g., Spain‚Äôs Falange) or Communist.

As Conservation International‚Äôs Chief Strategy Officer remarked ahead of the summit in Cali, Colombia, ‚Äú...negotiators cannot leave Cali without deciding where some of that funding will originate, when it will be delivered, and what groups will receive it‚Äù.

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Endless passport queues persist despite promises. Economic crisis fuels demand. New system struggles to cope. Minister vows improvements but delays continue. Applicants frustrated with lengthy waits and lack of clear guidance. Online system proposed but faces challenges.

üü©

It is centuries since a few years now, there is a heavy traffic to obtain foreign passports issued by the Department of Immigration and Emigration.

With the economic crisis, many led to a foreign passport to leave the country.

With that, a methodology was introduced to set up an instance of March methodology and the one-day service had to reserve the previous day.

However, E-Passport could not be given to the company that tenders were obtained on the deadline and approved the company before the return of the previous passport.

Previously, the foreign passport printing was issued to the court, who was challenging the decision of the government before.

The old company has agreed to print overseas printing on an agreement in court.

The foreign passports printed by the already limited foreign passports were also limited to a per day.
