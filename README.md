நோயாளிகளின் பாதுகாப்பை காரணம் காட்டி மருத்துவர்கள் மருந்துச் சீட்டுகளை கிறுக்கள் அல்லாமல் பெரிய எழுத்துக்களில் தெளிவாக எழுத வேண்டும் அல்லது டிஜிட்டல் வடிவங்களுக்கு மாற வேண்டும் என்று இந்திய நீதிமன்றம் உத்தரவிட்டுள்ளது.

ஒரு நீதிபதி மருத்துவ சட்ட அறிக்கையை “புரிந்துகொள்ள முடியாதது” என்று கண்டறிந்ததை அடுத்து, பஞ்சாப் மற்றும் ஹரியானா உயர் நீதிமன்றம் இந்த உத்தரவை பிறப்பித்தது.

மருத்துவ பாடசாலை பாடத்திட்டத்தில் கையெழுத்துப் பயிற்சி சேர்க்கப்பட வேண்டும் என்று நீதிமன்றம் பரிந்துரைத்தது, மேலும் இரண்டு ஆண்டுகளுக்குள் டிஜிட்டல் மருந்துச் சீட்டுகளை கட்டாயமாக்க வேண்டும் என்று அரசாங்கத்தை வலியுறுத்தியது. R
