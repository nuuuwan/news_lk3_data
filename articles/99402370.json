    "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe assured that Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves remain robust.",
    "He made this remark during his appearance on Ada Derana\u2019s current affairs programme \u2018360\u00b0\u2019 last night (06).",
    "Speaking during the programme, the CBSL chief said: \u201cThe target was around Rs.5.6 billion, but we increased it to Rs.6.5 billion. By the end of 2024, after settling old debts, reserves stood at Rs.6.1 billion. Our aim is to raise this to Rs.7 billion by the end of this year, which is achievable.\u201d",
    "\u201cAfter debt restructuring, payments of Rs.3\u20134 billion annually over the next 10 years will be manageable. If we maintain Rs.8 billion in reserves, we will have a strong buffer to meet foreign debt obligations. The current reserve levels are stable to handle these challenges,\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe elaborated."
