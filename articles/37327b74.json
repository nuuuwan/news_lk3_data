And they say Sri Lankans visiting these two countries can expect to make proactive business connections with top-end natives at their two well-patronized restaurants.",
    "\u201cWhichever of the two countries you go seeking to meet people of good business repute to do business with, the chances are high that you could link up with the right people you are searching for at our seafood restaurant in Brisbane, Australia and our Italian restaurant in Hanoi, Vietnam, \u201cthey said.",

Coco Gabba is a well-patronized seafood restaurant today and on the back of its success, we are now preparing to start a Thai restaurant in the same place,\u201d they said.",

Top-end individuals patronize this restaurant and so is our seafood restaurant in Brisbane. Literally speaking, we have built bridges in these two countries for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to benefit from; particularly for those who don\u2019t have a base in these two countries to foster their business ties. Our restaurants in these countries will prove to be very useful for you if you are looking to do business in these markets,\u201d they said.",
