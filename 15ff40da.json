  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe states that the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sri Lanka, can only be removed by continuing along the same path and strengthening the country\u2019s economy.",
    "Delivering a special statement in Parliament on the IMF Executive Board\u2019s completion of the first review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka this morning (13), Wickremesinghe expressed optimism that the IMF now admits that Sri Lanka has taken decisive steps to overcome the state of bankruptcy.",
    "\u201cNow they [IMF] admit that we have taken decisive steps to save ourselves from the label of a \u2018bankrupt state\u2019. I am humbled to be able to lead this proud journey\u201d, the President mentioned.",
    "\u201cI took over a bankrupt country last year. No leader came forward to take over that bankrupt country. Everyone was afraid to accept this challenge. None of the heroes who are now addressing the Parliament had the courage to come forward. I accepted that challenge...\u201d",
    "\u201cAll I had was determination and dedication. Not a single MP representing my party was in the Parliament. But the majority of MPs supported me although they were also insulted and mocked. The people of the country also supported me. They faced various hardships for the country and supported this journey\u201d, he added.",
    "Speaking further, the Head of the State highlighted that the country\u2019s inflation prevailed at 70% at the time he took over the country, but it has now been brought down to 1.5%.",
    "\u201cAt the time the depreciation of the rupee had risen to 80%. The value of the rupee increased to Rs. 360 per dollar. Now it has stabilized at the level of Rs. 325 - Rs. 330 per dollar.\u201d",
    "Moreover, Wickremesinghe expressed, \u201cWe have no other path but this path. There are two main factors in this path - having access to IMF assistance and debt restructuring. We handled both those factors properly. So we have been able to obtain good results.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, he emphasized that with the approval of the second tranche from the IMF, the country will receive multiple advantages including USD 150 million from the World Bank for deposit insurance, which will make the financial sector tremendously strong.",
    "\u201cThis makes the banking and financial sector 100% secure\u201d, Wickremesinghe added.",
    "\u201cForeign investors can invest in Sri Lanka without any doubt then. Our Letters of Credit are now accepted at the international level again.\u201d",
    "The President also expressed that the government is aware that a certain group of the society has faced hardships as a result of imposing taxes including VAT, adding that the government had no other choice.",
    "\u201cSome parties question what the purpose of a government to govern the country if it has to be subjected to the conditions of the IMF. They claim that they will impose conditions on the IMF once they come to power. These are just childish stories. Only the people who have \u2018Montessori-level knowledge\u2019 about the economy can tell such stories\u201d, he added.",
    "\u201cRemember, we can get out of the IMF conditions only if we continue on this path and build a strong economy under these conditions\u201d, the President assured."
