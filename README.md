Moody’s Ratings on Monday affirmed the Government of India’s long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings and the local-currency senior unsecured rating at Baa3. The ratings agency also affirmed India’s other short-term local-currency rating at P-3. The outlook remains stable.

“The rating affirmation and stable outlook reflect our view that India’s prevailing credit strengths, including its large, fast-growing economy, sound external position and stable domestic financing base for ongoing fiscal deficits, will be sustained,” it said.

These strengths lend resilience to adverse external trends, in particular as high US (Aa1 stable) tariffs and other international policy measures hinder India’s capacity to attract manufacturing investment, it added. India’s credit strengths are balanced by long-standing weaknesses on the fiscal side, which will remain.

COLOMBO (News 1st); His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, delivered a scathing critique of Sri Lanka’s past leadership and societal decline, stating that the country’s collapse was not accidental — but the result of a systemic failure of ethics, accountability, and justice.

Leading with moral skepticism, the Cardinal warned that a society without principles is destined to fall, and that Sri Lanka’s current crisis stems from a long-standing erosion of values across all levels of leadership.

“From the highest ranks to the grassroots,” he said, “a culture of corruption, theft, and selective justice has dragged the nation into ruin.”

He pointed to the absence of policy direction, integrity, and respect for law, noting that despite Sri Lanka’s natural beauty and potential, the country has become one of the most indebted in the world.
