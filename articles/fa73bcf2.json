    "Colombo, March 24 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that former President Maithripala Sirisena is now contradicting his recent statement that he was well aware of the true perpetrators of the Easter Sunday bombings, NPP MP Vijitha Herath today urged the government to launch an immediate probe over the remark as it is a serious statement to have been made by the then Head of State and Minister of Defence.",
    "He told a news conference that the true story behind the Easter Sunday attacks should not be a secret and that the whole country should know it.",
    "\"We urge Sirisena to reveal what he knows to the country. The government must also launch an immediate probe into his statement. It is already too late. The statement was made last Friday. They should have acted swiftly and recorded a statement,\" he said.",
    "The MP said the former President is now contradicting his remark where he is claiming two days later that someone provided him information on the incident only three weeks ago, whereas he claimed on Friday that he knew the true perpetrators.",
    "MP Herath said it was a serious matter for Sirisena to keep it a secret as he was the Head of State and Defence Minister when the attacks had been carried out.",
    "\"This is an irresponsible statement made by him as a former President. He should not have given a voice cut to the media but could have provided a statement to court through lawyers. As a former President, he should know what action he should have taken. He should have sought legal advice and taken necessary action. It is absurd for him to make such a statement,\" Vijitha Yapa said."
