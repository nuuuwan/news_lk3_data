    "Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said today that there is an increase in the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) among schoolchildren these days.",
    "He said this disease spreads every year, especially between March and April.",
    "If children have symptoms like small, oval, red or white blisters on the palms and soles of the feet, as well as in the mouth, if there is a red skin rash with a brown scale on it, or if the rash appears on the outer arms, then parents should keep in mind not to send their children to schools, daycare centres or public places.",
    "HFMD is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie virus. The main way HFMD spreads is through contact with the fluid from inside the blisters or with the droplets spread from sneezing and coughing.",
    "The virus can also be present in bowel movements (excrement) for up to several weeks after the person has recovered.",
    "\u201cThe trunk is usually relatively clear. Sometimes there are blisters present, but they are not usually in the mouth, and your child can eat and drink as usual,\u201d Dr. Perera said.",
    "The blisters should not be itchy, like chickenpox blisters. If your child has eczema, the HFMD can cause it to worsen and potentially make them infected with bacteria. Also, he requested that parents provide face masks to children to prevent any spreading and infection.",
    "This disease lasts for three to four days, and rarely the nails may fall off, but there is no need for fear because the nails will grow again.",
    "He also said that there is a noticeable uptick in asthma cases among children as they gear up for sports meets, where children engage in numerous outdoor activities amidst the scorching weather.",
    "Therefore, Dr. Perera warned parents to remain vigilant about their children\u2019s health.",
    "Furthermore, Dr. Perera emphasized the importance of keeping children away from smoking areas, as exposure to smoke can exacerbate respiratory complications, particularly in those with asthma.",
    "\u201cCommon symptoms of childhood asthma include shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing and persistent coughing,\u201d he cautioned."
