  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe since assumed presidency, has over a period of time been promising us all, that by the year 2048, this country would have become a developed or first world country. Well and good, everyone of us is certain and back the president in his efforts to take this country out of the bankruptcy which we have been reduced to.",
    "Our president has also mentioned Singapore as a model of development. Unfortunately, corruption, the antithesis of development is rife in our country.",
    "Ordinary people face situations of corruption whenever they visit a government or semi-government body. Our department of motor traffic is one of them. Our law enforcement department works much faster when palms are oiled. News reports on daily basis lay bare the extent of corruption in the country.",
    "In like manner, ranking bureaucrats and politicians at the highest levels have been accused of demanding and receiving kickbacks. Many a potential investor has left our shores without investing, because of kickbacks demanded by top political leaders and bureaucrats.",
    "On two occasions, governments changed as a result of charges of corruption being brought against political leaders. The Central Bank scam of yesteryear is alleged to be the biggest scam perpetrated in the history of this country. One of the most popular presidents of this country has been accused of corruption on a mega scale, as has the president who had to flee office.",
    "Even today, at the backdrop of our country\u2019s indebtedness, high ranking politicians and bureaucrats continue milking the resources of this country with their corrupt practices through scams such as the \u2018garlic scam\u2019, the \u2018sugar scam\u2019 etc., continue to rob the country and its people blind.",
    "Sadly, no action has been taken to bring these culprits before justice. Just days ago, a Member of Parliament was caught attempting to smuggle a large quantity of gold and mobile phones into the country. He walked free after paying fine imposed by customs officials. This individual still remains as an \u2018Honourable\u2019 Member of Parliament!",
    "Yet, people with no political connections are locked up for simple mistakes.",
    "Corruption, according to Kautiliya (the famous Indian polymath who was active as a teacher, author, strategist, philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor) \u201cjust as it is impossible not to taste the honey or the poison that finds itself at the tip of the tongue, so also it is impossible for a minister or a government servant not to eat up at least a bit of government\u2019s revenue.\u201d",
    "Many developing countries have met their Waterloo as a result of corruption. In the face of massive corruption, can our president\u2019s aim of turning Lanka into a developed nation succeed? Or will the country stumble in the face of rampant corruption?",
    "Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew has shown how this problem can be tackled. He did not go for the minor fry who were following corrupt practices. Rather he went for the big guns.",
    "A Deputy Singaporean Minister who went on a holiday with a businessman friend was arrested on his return. When questioning his arrest, he was told \u2018you went on holiday with a businessman and the latter paid all your expenses. That is corruption. You will go to jail\u2019",
    "A similar incident took place in 2015, as reported in our sister paper \u2018Sunday Times\u2019. The Minister of National Development committed suicide as he was being investigated in a bribery case. The message: there is no way a minister could avoid investigations.",
    "Singapore in 2021 was said to have a per capita income of US$ 72,700. It is reportedly the richest country in the Asia Pacific region, ahead of Australia and Japan.",
    "As long as corruption is not brought to a full stop, our country will flounder. Our president needs to take a leaf from premier Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s actions, and crack down hard on corrupt individuals.",
    "Else, his achievements and diplomatic acumen which helped ease the shortage of foreign currency, enabled our country purchase desperately needed basics into the country, will be a lost cause.",
    "His aim to turn Lanka a first world economy may also flounder in the abyss of corruption",
    "For all our sakes, its time to bring the corruption to an end."
