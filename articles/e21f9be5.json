  "original_body_lines": [
    "You have been blessed with an abundance of talent in your recently elected legislative chamber \u2013 a true microcosm of the nation. Every ethnicity, religion, educational, competency, discipline and age demographic is represented. For the first time in the history of Sri Lankan politics a humble estate worker has been afforded an opportunity to participate in political decisions. Even a 26-year-old has been accommodated in the chamber. You are already walking the talk much to the chagrin of your opponents",
    "Your victories have been stunning, to say the least. Winning the top job was good enough. Your virtual clean sweep of the legislative chamber is more than impressive. However, unprecedented is your victory in the north where for the first time in modern political history a Sinhalese Buddhist has been given a mandate by the Tamil Hindu populace. Let this be the last time that Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans have to be referred to by race or religion. You have ensured that our great country is but one nation of people who can achieve greatness.",
    "The last time that our island nation was under one ruler \u2013 except when a British Monarch held sway during colonisation \u2013 was is 1153 AD when the Great King Parakramabahu I reigned over the entire country after a long civil war and beating his opponents just as you have beaten your detractors. I need not remind you of his achievements in the areas of nation building and people welfare. Not only did he build massive assets to boost agricultural production but also built hospitals and social welfare units for his subjects; a true king of the people. He beautified the City of Polonnaruwa with parks and lakes and even came up with the concept of public toilets \u2013 a replica of which can be seen in the Colombo museum.",
    "He boosted trade with China, Angkor and the Middle East recognising that Sri Lanka was the junction of major maritime trade routes. When his engineers and architects were sceptical about his wish to build massive assets, he is reckoned to have said, \u201cWhat is there in the world that cannot be carried out by people of energy?\u201d Mr. President, you have certainly energised the nation of Sri Lanka. Harness this energy to lift our nation to greatness again.",
    "Just as President Barack Obama modelled his leadership on Abraham Lincoln, you may well be advised to take the lessons of perhaps the greatest Sri Lankan King to have ruled \u2013 you may well come from the same blood line!",
    "But greatness begins with small but relevant steps. In your short tenure in the top job you have demonstrated glimpses of what lies ahead. You have now been given an overwhelming second mandate by your subjects. You can virtually do anything you wish. But with unfettered power comes huge responsibility. Use your power wisely and always remember \u2013 you are but a servant of the people.",
    "You have been blessed with an abundance of talent in your recently elected legislative chamber \u2013 a true microcosm of the nation. Every ethnicity, religion, educational, competency, discipline and age demographic is represented. For the first time in the history of Sri Lankan politics a humble estate worker has been afforded an opportunity to participate in political decisions. Even a 26-year-old has been accommodated in the chamber. You are already walking the talk much to the chagrin of your opponents.",
    "Your party has presented a commendable manifesto, a prospectus that the electorate have bought into and as stakeholders they will be expecting the returns you promised. As the country\u2019s CEO you must carefully appoint your senior executives who will implement your strategies and deliver results. There is no doubt that the IQ of Parliament has arisen several notches. You yourself have demonstrated an uncanny ability to grasp situations, understand the numbers and demonstrated a willingness to learn fast. You will no doubt appoint to your sleek 25-person Cabinet of Ministers the brightest and best. Heed their counsel and work as a team. Remember the adage \u2013 the captain may not be the best player on the field but one who can lead effectively and motivate the team to perform at its best. Lead by example. Ensure you set key performance indicators for delivering your promised outcomes. Produce for us a regular scorecard of achievements.",
    "Among the early indications of a national renaissance is the vast change that has been seen in the psyche of the masses. Quiet and peaceful elections, no over-exuberance of celebratory behaviour and a genuine sense of calm expectations. You yourself are leading from the front \u2013 even opening your car door yourself. You have done away with the pomp and pageantry that your predecessors revelled in. All good signs of a man of the people.",
    "One of the traits you have demonstrated is your abhorrence of corruption \u2013 the plague that beset the nation for far too long bringing the country down to the lowest point. Ensure that you make anti-corruption a prime focus of your Government. Do not tolerate anyone within your team who succumbs to this vile behaviour. Let this precept also change the behaviour of the people of Sri Lanka. If you achieve this mindset change, you will be revered forever.",
    "Remember too that the success of a country and its recognition on the global stage is its level of governance and adherence to the rule of law \u2013 facets that sadly previous regimes failed to recognise. Your people expect this. You now have the legislative powers to enact laws to bring to book the miscreants. The people are watching and waiting.",
    "Finally, Mr. President, let me remind you that King Parakramabahu I ruled Sri Lanka for a long 33 years. His achievements are written on stone and can never be erased. You Mr. President, have the opportunity to emulate or better the feats of Parakramabahu 800 years on and have your achievements written in the digital space.",
    "Do not squander the opportunity to re-write the history of Sri Lanka, you have already made a start! May you long rule this land.",
    "(The writer, former Global President of CIMA, is an Australian citizen of Sri Lankan descent and is not a dual citizen but closely follows the happenings in his motherland.)"
