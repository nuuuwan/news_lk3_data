### Govt. to present Vote-on-Account amid election constraints

Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Vijitha Herath yesterday confirmed that the Government will present a three-month Vote-on-Account, citing time constraints due to the upcoming General elections on 14 November.

Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, he said the Vote-on-Account will serve as a temporary financial measure to cover Government expenses till a comprehensive Budget can be presented in early 2025.

“As Parliament scheduled to reconvene on 21 November, there is no sufficient time to prepare and present a Budget for 2025 in December itself. The idea now is to present a Vote-on-Account,” he explained.

Herath pointed out that Sri Lanka, which usually presents its annual Budget in November is taking this step to ensure smooth Government operations during the transition following the elections.

### This election is about the “Opposition”

This election is therefore about having a politically serious and a critically sharp, effectively “national” people’s Opposition – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Nominations for the 2024 November 14 parliamentary elections were closed island wide, on 11 October. Altogether, around 690 nomination papers have been accepted for the 52 electoral districts. Phenomenal rise to power of the JVP/NPP at the September Presidential elections has sealed the fate of over two dozen politicians, some of whom would not have wanted to leave politics yet. Not very surprisingly, since the 1936 State Council elections when D.M won the Hambantota seat, Rajapaksas are wholly absent in Hambantota for the first time, this election. On the wild side of it, there are numerous amoebic groups that have come out as “new” political parties and independent groups contesting most districts.

### Turning the right to food into reality: Collective path to a food-secure future

This World Food Day, we come together to emphasise the crucial need for collective action to realise the “Right to Foods”—not just as an aspiration but as a tangible reality for every Sri Lankan and every citizen of the world. Under the theme “Right to Foods for a Better Life and a Better Future,” we are reminded that while global agricultural production may yield enough calories, millions still struggle with hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity. Approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide cannot afford a healthy diet, contributing to all forms of malnutrition, from undernourishment to rising rates of overweight and obesity.

Here in Sri Lanka, the challenges are multifaceted. Natural disasters, economic downturns, and global shocks have intensified food insecurity, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations—especially women, children, rural communities and persons with disabilities. We can choose to ignore this only at our own peril.

### What should we expect of our MPs?

What many who run for office forget is that they are seeking to become members of a legislature

Several years ago, I was at what was perhaps the inaugural meeting that launched the rankings of MPs by Manthri.lk. I recall a panel comprising the parliamentarians who had the highest rankings. A leading question from the moderator about research support confused a young MP on the panel. He had achieved his high rank by asking lots of parliamentary questions about the various problems faced by his constituents. He could not understand what research support had to do with constituency service which was his understanding of the job.

நாடு பொருளாதார சிக்கல்களுக்கு முகம் கொடுத்து ஊழல்வாதிகளால் சூறையாடப்பட்டுள்ளது. அந்தவகையில் நாட்டில் ஒரு புதிய யுகத்தினை ஏற்படுத்துவதற்காகச் சிங்கள மக்கள் ஒன்றிணைந்துள்ளனர். அதனை நாம் வரவேற்கின்றோம். அதற்கான பங்களிப்புக்களை வழங்குவதற்கு நாங்களும் தயாராக இருக்கிறோம்.

### අලුතින් පත්වන ආණ්ඩුවට ඇති  අභියෝග සහ විසඳුම් සෙවීමට ඇති ගැටලු මොනවාද?

අලුතින් පත්වන ආණ්ඩුවට ඇති  අභියෝග සහ විසඳුම් සෙවීමට ඇති ගැටලු මොනවාද?

2024 මහ මැතිවරණය ශ්‍රී ලංකා ඉතිහාසයේ විශේෂිත වූ මැතිවරණයකි. ඡන්ද විමසීම පැවැත්වීමටත් පෙර නවක මුහුණු රැසක් මෙවර පාර්ලිමේන්තුව නියෝජනය කරනු ඇතැයි යන්න අවිවාදිත කාරණයක් බවට පත්ව තිබේ.

මීට හේතුව සාම්ප්‍රදායික සහ පවුල් බලය පැවති ජ්‍යෙෂ්ඨ දේශපාලනඥයින් රැසක් මැතිවරණයට පෙර ස්වයං විශ්‍රාම ගැනීමට තීරණය කිරීම ය. පසුගිය පාර්ලිමේන්තුව නියෝජනය කළ මන්ත්‍රීවරුන් 50කට අධික පිරිසක් මෙවර මහ මැතිවරණයට තරග නොකිරීමට තීරණය කර තිබේ.

යුද්ධය, ත්‍රස්තවාදය පරාජය කිරීම, අන්තවාදය පරජය කිරීම, ජාතික ආරක්ෂාව,  ආර්ථිකය හා සංවර්ධනය සහ සහනාධාර යන මාතෘක කලක පටන්  මෙරට මැතිවරණ වේදිකාවල ප්‍රධාන තේමා බවට පත්විය.

නමුත් 2024 මහ මැතිවරණයේදී එම මාතෘකාවලට කිසිදු වටිනාකමක් ඇති අයුරු දක්නට නොලැබේ.

ඒ වෙනුවට ආර්ථික අර්බුදයට විසඳුම් සෙවීම, අල්ලස හා දුෂණය පිටුදැකීම, දුෂිත ක්‍රියාවන්ට එරෙහිව විමර්ශන නිසි අයුරින් ක්‍රියාත්මක කිරීම සහ දුෂිත සහ වයස්ගත දේශපාලනඥයින් ගෙදර යැවීමට ජනතාවගේ වැඩි උනන්දුවක් පවතින බව පෙනීයන කරුණකි.

Sri Lanka’s strategic location in the Indian Ocean among major air routes connecting Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, offers a unique opportunity to transform the island into a thriving aviation hub. With the right investments and policy changes, Sri Lanka can leverage its geographical advantage to bolster tourism, facilitate international cargo & passenger transportation, and serve as a key transit point for passengers and goods. This vision not only promises to boost the nation’s economy but also has the potential to redefine its position on the global aviation map. Perfect example is the growth of 4 prominent airlines; Emirates, Fly Dubai, Air Arabia and Etihad and their importance to the economy of UAE, which was a desert in the mid-1990s.

Canada expelled six Indian diplomats including the high commissioner on Monday, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in Canada.

The diplomatic row represents a major deterioration of relations between the two Commonwealth countries. Ties have been frayed since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last year he had evidence linking Indian agents to the assassination of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian territory.

The government now has “clear and compelling evidence that agents of the government of India have engaged in and continue to engage in activities that pose a significant threat to public safety,” Trudeau said at a news conference.
