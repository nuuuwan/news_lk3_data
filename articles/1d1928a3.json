    "Indian Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday voiced concern over the arrest of former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, describing the charges against him as \u201ctrivial\u201d and urging Colombo to refrain from the\u201dpolitics of vengeance.\u201d",
    "\u201cConcerned about the detention of former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on what, on the face of it, seem trivial charges. His health issues have already seen him taken to the prison hospital,\u201d Tharoor, a former diplomat, wrote on X while sharing an old photograph with the Sri Lankan leader.",
    "\u201cI call on the government of Sri Lanka \u2014 while fully respecting that this is their internal matter \u2014 to abjure the politics of vengeance and treat their former President with the respect and dignity that he deserves, after his decades of service to the nation,\u201d he added."
