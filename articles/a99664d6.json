    "Colombo, Jan 22 (Daily Mirror) - The Yukthiya operation should not be a drama but should be aimed at apprehending main drug dealers in the country, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday.",
    "Speaking to journalists Field Marshal Fonseka said there is no point in arresting hundreds of ordinary people without arresting main drug traffickers in Sri Lanka.",
    "\"If major drug traffickers are not arrested under the Yukthiya Operation it will become another drama. Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennekoon will not be able to travel along the streets if he continues to make Yukthiya operation a drama,\" he added.",
    "He also stressed that Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB) should go along the right track if it wants to win the hearts of the people.",
    "\" SJB should scrutinize those whom it wants to accept to its fold rather than inviting those from other parties to join hands,\" he added."
