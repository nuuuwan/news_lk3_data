    "The continuous practice of reusing single-use plastic bottles for drinking water will bring people to their own deaths, Secretary of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Dr. Sarath Edirisinghe said.",
    "Meanwhile, addressing the media, the Director of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children Dr. G. Wijesuriya said a trend has been again created among the people over the re-use of single-use plastic bottles made from plastic #1 (polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET or PETE).",
    "The water in these bottles is not suitable to be exposed to direct sunlight after its seal is broken, as there are possibilities of the chemicals in the bottle mixing with the water.",
    "With the reuse of these one-time-use plastic bottles, there is a possibility of people getting infected with various diseases, such as cancer.",
    "Therefore, the doctor requested the people to use only the recommended bottles for drinking water. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
