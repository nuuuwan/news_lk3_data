    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Will it be Scotland or the Netherlands in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India this October?",
    "It has come down to the final match for Scotland and the Netherlands in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023 in Zimbabwe, and fittingly the two exciting in-form teams will battle it out for the second of two qualifying places on Thursday (6th) at Bulawayo, with Sri Lanka having taken the first one.",
    "Right now, Scotland is second in the points table at six points with the Netherlands fourth with four points. If Scotland wins, they qualify with eight points. If they lose, they end up on equal points to the Dutch, but the Scots could still qualify if their run rate stays above that of the Netherlands.",
    "It's a little tougher for the Netherlands to qualify. Simply beating Scotland won't do, as three teams would then end up on six points \u2013 Scotland, Zimbabwe, and the Netherlands \u2013 in which case it would come down to run rate. The Dutch would need to beat Scotland by at least 30 runs or with more than six overs to spare, to overtake the Scots' run rate. That would have the Dutch leapfrogging both third-placed\u00a0Zimbabwe\u00a0and Scotland to end in second place, while Scotland would drop to fourth.",
    "Zimbabwe have completed all of their matches in the tournament and there is no way for them to qualify since any result that would drop the Scots below the Zimbabweans in the table would also elevate the Dutch past Zimbabwe into second place."
