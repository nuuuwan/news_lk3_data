    "In an unprecedent move, for the first time in our political history, a former head of state was remanded for an offence which would be considered relatively minor from an international perspective. His extended stay in a magistrate\u2019s court led to medical problems which resulted in Ranil ending up in the intensive care unit of the National Hospital in Colombo. His entire medical history became public knowledge due to social media posts as well as unrestrained reporting in the press.",
    "Even his wife\u2019s medical history was not spared. Surely, they deserve some privacy. I can well understand the unsympathetic comments of the new breed of social media idiots but what shocked me were the actions of some members of my profession who should know better. One of them forwarded a link to a Viridu recital pleading with Mara not to take Ranil till he was punished for the Batalanda atrocities. While someone is fighting for his life in an ICU, to send such an offensive post demonstrates a total lack of professionalism of a medical man. To add insult to injury, he followed up with a post derogating the doctors treating Ranil which was deleted a short while later. Perhaps, he realised the idiocy of his comments!",
    "When I first heard about accusations against Ranil, I got the impression that he had travelled at government expense solely for an academic function for his wife and wondered why he had been so foolish! The way the announcements were made in the parliament, a few months ago, was to convey this impression. However, on inquiry I found out that what he did was breaking journey in London, on his way back from USA after attending an official function. In instances like these how other countries act is well explained in the page 2 article by the special correspondent, S Venkat Narayan \u201cWhen Presidents fly: What the world does about personal trips on official aircraft\u201d (The Island, 26 August) where he emphasises that this would not be treated as a criminal matter in any other country. Rather than trying to recover costs for the private part of the trip, perhaps with a penalty for not settling it voluntarily, who made the decision to haul Ranil before courts that ended in a fiasco needs investigation. Perhaps, the government made some gains by diverting attention away from a multitude of problems it is facing but, overall, it has not gained much as it must bear the responsibility. After all, it was the Secretary to the President who made the initial complaint and it transpired later that his wife was using the official car for private purposes, when it met with an accident!",
    "The complaint was investigated by the CID and who heads the CID? Shani Abeysekera of Ranjan Ramanayake tape repute! He was brought back from retirement, as a reward for supporting the NPP during the elections, and was made Director CID despite a Presidential Committee of Inquiry finding that he neglected duty by not acting on the intelligence received regarding the Easter Sunday attacks. The RR tapes clearly showed that he is a fixer and it was cringeworthy listening to him offering to wash RR\u2019s pots and pans for six months! Did NPP bring him from retirement and elevate him to the post of Director of CID because he is a fixer? Is he trying to show that he is a smart cookie by fixing Ranil?",
    "Unfortunately, the Attorney General\u2019s department which should be an independent entity giving proper legal advice to the government, in addition to other functions, has been made an appendage of the ruling party by successive governments, the NPP government which got elected on the slogan of \u2018system change\u2019 being no exception. Even if the CID applied pressure, it was incumbent on the AG\u2019s department to make a careful study as to what happens in instances like this in other countries. Maybe the AG\u2019s department advice was disregarded by the government!",
    "Even if charges could be brought under the penal code, was there a necessity to demand remand? Charges could have been filed and the decision should have been left to the appropriate court. DSG\u2019s insistence of continuing remand, in spite of Ranil\u2019s worsening medical problems seems to demonstrate overzealousness for whatever reason!",
    "The actions of the YouTuber, closely associated with the government, points to a collusion, surely! He had predicted Ranil being produced before the magistrate and being remanded and had stated that he would stop broadcasting his channel if that did not happen. Though Minister Nalinda Jayatissa gave the spurious excuse that anyone can make predictions, anyone with even an iota of common sense would interpret otherwise.",
    "Unfortunately, the resultant fiasco only helps to tarnish the international image of Sri Lanka. Further, this may well turn out to be a blessing in disguise for Ranil though the government achieved its objective, if it meant to insult Ranil. Perhaps, he deserves to be insulted for being in truck with the JVP for a long time! Or, is it that the JVP is attempting to extract revenge from Ranil for ruining their attempted takeover of parliament following the Aragalaya?",
    "Ranil does not deserve to go to jail for this but a case could be made that he deserves a jail sentence for other reasons. It is true that he stepped in when the country faced an economic disaster and the stern unpopular actions he took, on the diktats of the IMF, saved us for the time being, at least. However, in addition to those in power who were responsible for the vast destructions of our infrastructure in the past, it was Ranil\u2019s government which laid the foundations for the economic disaster by the two bond-scams!",
