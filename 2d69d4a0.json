    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Trade unions and professional associations in Sri Lanka have asked President Ranil Wickremesinghe to reveal a proposed amendment to the government\u2019s progressive income taxation policy before the end of a June deadline.",
    "Representatives of the self-styled Professionals\u2019 Trade Union Alliance (PTUA) collective handed over a note to President Wickremesinghe on Wednesday June 07 reminding him of a promise he is claimed to have made to the group regarding an amendment to the tax regime by June.",
    "Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA) secretary Dr Haritha Alutghe told reporters outside the presidential secretariat in Colombo upon handing over the note to a representative from the president\u2019s office that Wickremesinghe must keep his word in order to avoid further trade union action.",
    "\u201cUnions agreed to wait patiently till June for this to be amended. It is now June, and we ask the president to keep his word,\u201d said Herath.",
    "In the note, the PTUA had demanded that the government elaborate on the amendments proposed and how it plans to take it up with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One of the conditions the IMF put forward when granting the crisis-hit Sri Lanka a 2.9 billion dollar extended fund facility (EFF) was that the government implement strong fiscal consolidation measures that include a progressive tax hike. The move was met with tough resistance from high income-earning professionals who held weeks of protests and strikes against the government decision to collect from anyone earning over 100,000 rupees a month.",
    "\u201cWe ask the president and other officials not to break their promise and test the professionals\u2019 patience anymore,\u201d said Herath.",
    "Ceylon Banking Employees Union (CBEU) chairman Channa Dissanayake who was also outside the presidential secretariat said the unions will be compelled to take to the streets once again if a solution that\u2019s fair by professionals were not provided by the government.",
    "\u201cWe all know that we cannot continue to pay this tax,\u201d he said.",
    "Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) media spokesman Charudaththa Illangasinghe said the government must tax the wealthy instead.",
    "\u201cTaxes must be charged not from the small guys but from the wealthy. Otherwise this cannot continue. We have proposed solutions. If this is not resolved and the govt only favours its friends, this will explode very soon,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jun08/2023)"
