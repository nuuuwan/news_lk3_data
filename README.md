### My dear Vijay

*2025-09-11 06:03:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/My-dear-Vijay/14-781505) · `en`

I write to you not as a politician or an academic, but as a Sri Lankan who has lived through years of pain, and as someone who has witnessed firsthand the devastation of war. I also write as someone who has admired you as an actor, as a man loved by millions for your humility, your charisma, and the way you connect with ordinary people. Now, as you prepare to step into politics, I feel compelled to share a few words with you, not out of anger, but out of deep concern and hope.

### Time and space to eclipse  the sad face of Sri Lanka

*2025-09-11 06:00:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Time-and-space-to-eclipse-the-sad-face-of-Sri-Lanka/4-781504) · `en`

Of course, no lover of a land like no other in their right mind would gainsay what Vijitha Herath told the watching world in the aftermath of the blood moon

The blood moon of the night of 7 September brought with it a panoply of portents for Sri Lanka. A lunar eclipse lasting almost one and a half hours, its visibility was marred to some degree by intermittent scudding clouds. Very few islanders however, usually superstitious to the nth, paid heed to prophecies of doom and gloom; opting instead to interpret the celestial show as favourable for once.

In the wake of the night-time heavenly spectacle came Sri Lanka’s showing at the 60th United Nations Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva. Led by the redoubtable Vijitha Herath fronting the island’s case as its foreign minister, the once embattled nation state had many eyes squinting at the fine print of the text.

### Eurasia rising, Anura’s SCO absence, strategic-security blindness, and NPP-Israel axis

*2025-09-11 05:55:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Eurasia-rising-Anura-s-SCO-absence-strategic-security-blindness-and-NPP-Israel-axis/4-781503) · `en`

Sri Lankans are trapped in a triangular matrix of three Big Lies:

(I) ‘The Aragalaya was mainly for system-change’. If true, almost a million people who flooded Colombo on July 9th 2022 morning couldn’t have shrunk to about 15,000 by nightfall after they’d successfully evicted Gotabaya. The numbers never reassembled but returned only to explore and picnic outside occupied/liberated buildings. The Aragalaya was specific and concrete, mainly about limited and legitimate ‘regime-change’, not ‘system-change’: sending Gota home, just as in the Philippines in 1986 it was about deposing Marcos.

### Mass graves in Sri Lanka

*2025-09-11 05:46:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Mass-graves-in-Sri-Lanka/4-781502) · `en`

Families of the disappeared have called for international oversight of the investigations, fearing that the truth will be buried with the victims

There are credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law committed by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). The Chemmani mass graves, uncovered in 1998 near Jaffna, are an unresolved case of alleged State-sponsored atrocities during the Sri Lankan civil war, which include summary executions and systematic efforts to cover up the crimes. Killings in Chemmani and other crimes must be resolved for Sri Lanka to have closure of its tragic civil war.

### Banking on trust: Shaping responsible  AI agenda for Sri Lanka

*2025-09-11 05:40:35* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Banking-on-trust-Shaping-responsible-AI-agenda-for-Sri-Lanka/14-781499) · `en`

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to reshape every sector it touches. Yet history reminds us that new technologies are often met with caution and fear as to how they will alter the ways we live, work, and communicate, and by extension, how they impact livelihoods, relationships, quality of life and even our sense of purpose.

And with AI, this sense of caution is certainly warranted. The implications for economies and societies are profound, yet unpredictable. Will it widen the gap between nations, or help close it? What we know from past revolutions is that first movers that are able to effectively navigate emerging risks associated with new technologies gain disproportionate advantages—potentially compressing decades of progress into just a few years.

The Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Ltd., (EFL) yesterday filed a Writ application in the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka, asking the court to urgently stop illegal activities inside Wilpattu National Park, especially around the Pallekandal Church in Block V of the park.

A small jungle shrine in Block V of Wilpattu National Park, used in the past for a modest annual feast by local fishing communities, fell into disuse during the civil conflict. After the park reopened in 2010, the site grew into a large church complex through illegal construction, clearing of forests, and increased human activity.

### Ranil condemns Nepal violence, urges return to peace

*2025-09-11 05:33:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Ranil-condemns-Nepal-violence-urges-return-to-peace/56-781495) · `en`

### Nepal protests ‘hijacked’, Gen Z claims, as army patrols streets

*2025-09-11 05:31:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Nepal-protests-hijacked-Gen-Z-claims-as-army-patrols-streets/56-781493) · `en`

Nepal’s army has deployed patrols on the streets of the capital Kathmandu, as the Himalayan nation reels from its worst unrest in decades.

Protests against corruption spiralled into arson and violence on Tuesday. The prime minister quit as politicians’ homes were vandalised, and Government buildings and parliament torched. 30 people died and more than 1,000 were injured over two days of violence.

“Gen Z” groups spearheading the protests distanced themselves from the destruction, saying they had been “hijacked” by “opportunists”.

On Wednesday, Kathmandu’s airport reopened and the capital was relatively quiet as most residents obeyed a curfew, but smoke still rose from burning buildings.

The military, which is trying to control a spiralling situation, has invited the Gen Z protesters to engage in peace talks. Student leaders are consolidating a fresh list of demands, one of their representatives told the BBC.

### Beauty benefits of honey …

*2025-09-10 23:39:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/beauty-benefits-of-honey/) · `en`

Since honey plays an important role where beauty is concerned, this week I’ve decided to highlight some beauty benefits of honey … how you can use it to get glowing skin and lustrous hair.

To use honey as a face scrub, mix 02 tablespoons of honey with 01 tablespoon of baking soda and then gently apply this mixture on your face and neck. Rub it into the skin in a circular motion. Rinse and pat dry to get a radiant complexion.
