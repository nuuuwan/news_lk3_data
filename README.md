*2025-09-29 15:01:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/226410) · `ta`

இந்திய பாகிஸ்தான் அணிகளுக்கிடையில் டுபாயில் ஞாயிற்றுக்கிழமை இடம்பெற்ற ஆசிய கிண்ண இருபதுக்கு இருபது இறுதிப்போட்டியில் இந்திய அணி வெற்றி பெற்று ஒன்பதாவது முறையாக ஆசிய கிண்ணத்தை கைப்பற்றியது. எனினும் பரிசளிப்பு நிகழ்வின் போது இரு அணித்தலைவர்களும் நடந்து கொண்டமை  கிரிக்கெட் போட்டி ஆர்வலர்களிடையே கடும் விசனத்தையும் கோபத்தையும் ஏற்படுத்தியுள்ளது.

இரண்டாம் இடத்தைப் பெற்ற பாகிஸ்தான் அணிக்கு அவ்வணித்தலைவருக்குரிய பணப்பரிசு தொகை காசோலை அட்டையாக  வழங்கப்பட்ட போது அவர் அதை வாங்கி மைதானத்தில் எறிந்து விட்டுச்சென்றார். அதே வேளை வெற்றிக்கிண்ணம் இல்லாது இந்திய அணியினர் தமது வெற்றியை கொண்டாடினர்.

கிரிக்கெட் தொடர் ஒன்றிலோ அல்லது போட்டியிலோ இது வரை இடம்பெறாத பல மனதை வெறுக்க வைக்கும் சம்பவங்கள் ஆசிய கிண்ணத் தொடரில் இந்திய பாகிஸ்தான் அணிகளுக்கிடையில் மாத்திரமே இடம்பெற்றன. ஆரம்பத்திலேயே இவ்விரு அணிகளும் மோதிய முதல் போட்டியில் நாணயச்சுழற்சியின் பின்னர் இரு அணித்தலைவர்களும் கைகுலுக்கவில்லை. போட்டியில் இந்திய அணி வெற்றி பெற்றாலும் அணி வீரர்கள் பாகிஸ்தான் அணியுடன் கைகுலுக்காமல் மைதானத்தை விட்டு அகன்றனர்.

COLOMBO (News 1st); His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, delivered a scathing critique of Sri Lanka’s past leadership and societal decline, stating that the country’s collapse was not accidental — but the result of a systemic failure of ethics, accountability, and justice.

Leading with moral skepticism, the Cardinal warned that a society without principles is destined to fall, and that Sri Lanka’s current crisis stems from a long-standing erosion of values across all levels of leadership.

“From the highest ranks to the grassroots,” he said, “a culture of corruption, theft, and selective justice has dragged the nation into ruin.”

He pointed to the absence of policy direction, integrity, and respect for law, noting that despite Sri Lanka’s natural beauty and potential, the country has become one of the most indebted in the world.
