    "Freedom of navigation, respect for international law, responding to piracy, trafficking, and illegal migration, as well as the exchange of information as such all depend on coordination and confidence-building between navies and coast guards.",

Sri Lanka calls upon all stakeholders to contribute to a cooperative maritime security framework founded on transparency and respect for international law.",
    "Through cooperation, the Indian Ocean can be built as a region of peace, prosperity, and opportunity. No nation can face these challenges alone. Multilateralism, inter-state partnerships, engagement of navies, maritime industries, and civil society are all essential in this cause."
