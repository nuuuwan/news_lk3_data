  "original_title": "JVP, NPP and the Astounding  Political Ascent  of  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "There is magic in the air! The country is in a festive mood. The  toast of the town is a man called Anura Kumara Dissanayake who is the leader of two political parties namely the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) and National People\u2019s Power(NPP). AKD as he is popularly known  was the victor in a Presidential election held two months ago. He followed it up last week  by spearheading his party to victory in a Parliamentary election.",
    "Dissanayake   won the presidential election  of September 21st 2024 in a  gigantic  leap. From 418,553(3.16%) votes  in  the 2019 presidential election, AKD increased his vote tally to 5,634,915 (42.31%) in the 2024 Presidential poll. After becoming the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka, Anura Kumara Dissanayake has led  the NPP to a glorious triumph  at the Parliamentary elections. From 445,958(3.28%) at the 2020 Parliamentary poll, the NPP increased its vote tally  to 6,863,86 (61.6%) . This was  more impressive than even AKD\u2019s presidential poll success.",
    "Speaking at his swearing in event, Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that  he was neither a magician nor miracle worker. Yet his  remarkable rise in politics as well as the twin successes recorded in two successive elections  exude the aura of a fairy tale fantasy.",
    "The man and his political mission have naturally evoked great interest among a wide section of people. It is against this backdrop therefore that this column focuses on  Sri Lankan President and leader of the JVP and NPP -Anura Kumara Dissanayake.",
    "Dissanayake Mudiyanselage  Anura Kumara Dissanayake was born on 24 November 1968. His birthplace was Galewala in the Matale district of the Central Province.  Both his father Ran Banda  Dissanayake and mother Seelawathi were of Kandyan Govigama  Buddhist stock. The family relocated to the Anuradhapura district in the North Central Province when Anura and his elder sister Sriyalatha  were children. The family moved to Thambuthegama  situated in an agrarian region  in the Kalwewa electoral division of the province.",
    "Anura completed his primary education at  Gamini Maha Vidyalaya and secondary education at Thambuthegama Central College. He was the first student to enter University from the Thambuthegama Central college..",
    "Anura\u2019s father was  essentially  an agricultural worker. After several years,he  obtained permanent employment in the Surveyors department as an office aide. Anura\u2019s mother was a housewife  who obtained periodic employment during paddy planting and harvesting seasons.",
    "When Anura was six months old,his mother went to an astrologer to cast his horoscope.The astrologer made some calculations based on planetary movements that prevailed at the time of the boy\u2019s birth and told the mother \u201cyour son has a \u201cRajayoga\u201d in his destiny. He is born to rule. One day he will rule this country\u201d.The mother Seelawathi was pleased but puzzled. How could my son be a ruler? She wondered.",
    "When Anura  celebrated his 12th birthday, the chief incumbent of a Buddhist temple or Viharadhipthy wanted him  to be a novice monk and be ordained a member of the Buddhist clergy. The elderly monk had been impressed by the boy\u2019s demeanor, intelligence and good conduct. After much thought the parents respectfully declined to do so.",
    "The family was  financially challenged  in the early years after moving to Thambuthegama. Their  wattle and daub cottage  had no electricity.  Young Anura would study at nights with the aid of a kerosene lamp. In order to augment the family income, Anura\u2019s mother would make sweetmeats. The son would take them to the nearby Thambuthegama railway station  and main bus stand  and sell them to passengers..During school holidays, Anura would be employed part -time as a ditch digger for 20 rupees a day.",
    "Despite the economic hardship, Anura  shone brightly as a student. He  had great powers of comprehension and would grasp the finer points in the texts easily. He also had a good memory. Anura brought great credit to his Alma Mater when he made history as the first student of Thambuthegama Central College to  gain admission to the Peradeniya university science faculty.",
    "Anura was  an avid reader during his student and undergraduate days. (he still is).  In his boyhood Anura would  perch himself  on a branch of an\u201cAraliya\u201d tree (Temple Tree)I and read. According to his mother, Anura would be reading a book or a newspaper even while eating. He  enjoyed reading biographies and auto-biographies of great thinkers and political leaders. In an interview given some years ago Anura said \u201cThere are many books that changed my life. \u201c",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who  learnt to swim in the Nallaachiya lake near his home is a very good swimmer combining speed and stamina. In his student days, Anura would swim in the  historic tanks of Anuradhapura . Later  as a political activist, Anura travelled throughout Sri Lanka. He would swim in tanks,lakes, rivers and the sea, wherever and whenever possible. \u201cI love to swim. On average, I swim about two kilometers.\u201d he told an interviewer once.",
    "Anura Kumara came of age politically in the last year of his teens -1987. The India-Sri Lanka Accord was signed by former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and ex-Sri Lanka president Junius Richard (JR) Jayewardene on 29 July 1987 in Colombo. A ceasefire was declared and Indian army personnel described as the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) were stationed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the island to maintain peace.",
    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) led by Rohana Wijeweera opposed the Indo-Lanka Accord and engaged in armed resistance in the predominantly Sinhala areas. The JVP had in 1971 launched an armed insurrection when the United Front Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was in power. It was cruelly and brutally crushed.This is commonly referred to as the first JVP insurgency.",
    "When the Indo -Lanka accord was signed and the IPKF was stationed in the North and East, the JVP  revived atavistic fears of the various invasions by Indian kings in the past and commenced an anti \u2013 Indian struggle in the Sinhala majority provinces. This was termed as the second JVP insurgency.",
    "It was in this situation  that 19 year old Anura Kumara Disanayake joined the JVP in 1987 along with his first cousin Sunil Dissanayake. \u201cSunil Aiya\u201d as Anura called him ,had a great influence on Anura\u2019s life.It was Sunil who was instrumental in convincing Anura that they should join the JVP for the motherland\u2019s sake..",
    "When Anura joined the JVP, he was a GCE(AL) .student .Some months later , Anura gained admission to the University of Peradeniya. Anura moved to Kandy and commenced his varsity education. But he devoted most of his time to clandestine political activity.Anura adopted the nom de guerre \u201cAravinda\u201d and engaged in pro-JVP activities.",
    "The terror unleashed by the JVP was matched by the counter terror of the state. Anura\u2019s cousin Sunil was among the thousands of youths killed through state terror.Anura known as Aravinda fled from Peradeniya and went into hiding. He became a wanted man. Anura\u2019s non -political family was then living in a modest brick house. Agents of the state reportedly burnt the house down as a warning to \u201cAravinda\u201d.",
    "Anura dropped out of Varsity  and went underground. According to JVP circles Anura maintained a low profile and moved from place to place. This period was arguably the most dangerous phase in his life.",
    "Anura kept away from home during this time. When Anura\u2019s father Ran Banda Dissanayake died the security officials expected the son to attend the funeral and were lying in wait in the vicinity. Anticipating such a trap, Anura kept away and was not able to attend his own father\u2019s funeral.",
    "The JVP\u2019s second insurgency was ruthlessly suppressed by the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime. The JVP\u2019s founder leader Rohana Wijeweera, the second leader Saman Piyasiri Fernando and rhe third leader Lalith Wijerathne were among the top 14 JVP leaders killed by the state in 1989-90.",
    "The only senior top leader and Pollitburo member to survive was Somawansa Amerasinghe alias Siri Aiyaa. He became the fourth JVP leader. Somawansa escaped to India in 1990 and from there went to Thailand. He later travelled to Italy and from there sought political asylum in France.",
    "After Premdasa\u2019s death in May 1993, the political climate changed for the better as far as the JVP was concerned. Somawansa Amerasinghe returned to Sri Lanka in 1994 and began re-organizing the JVP quietly.",
    "Meanwhile Anura had resumed his tertiary studies again . He was  an undergraduate at the Kelaniya University in 1992. Anura  adopted a low profile during his undergraduate days but participated in student union activity. He also conducted classes at a tutorial institution. AKD completed his studies and obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree (BSc) in Physical Science in 1995.Instead of seeking full time employment AKD turned to full time politics.",
    "As mentioned earlier, Somawansa had returned to Sri Lanka and was engaged in reviving the JVP. Anura was  in contact with Somawansa and used to convey confidential messages from him to other JVP members. Somawansa liked Anura and was impressed by the young man\u2019s intellect, ability and convictions. He took Anura under his wing.",
    "The JVP backed Socialist Students Union was re-organized in 1995 after the national convention at Tangalle. AKD was appointed National Organizer.Thereafter his rise was rapid within JVP ranks. In 1996 he became a member of the JVP central committee. AKD was elevated to the all-powerful JVP Politburo (Political Bureau) in 1998.",
    "Anura was by now a key member of the JVP. Under Anura\u2019s direction, the pro-JVP students union had expanded considerably and established itself in most universities and institutions of higher studies.So when the JVP contested polls, AKD was placed on the national list so that he could engage in propaganda all over instead of being tied down to the district as a candidate. He had blossomed into an able speaker.Anura was a direct, straight to the point kind of speaker who appealed to reason. Sometimes he was emotional too.",
    "Thus in 2000 AKD was appointed as national list MP and entered Parliament for the first time. In 2001 Anura was re-appointed as national list MP for the second time. Soon AKD made his mark as a powerful orator and skilful debater in Parliament.",
    "The JVP contested as part of the SLFP led United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in the 2004 elections. The JVP fielded three candidates in each district as part of the UPFA list. JVP cadres worked hard to get the maximum number of preference votes for their candidates. Due to this, the JVP obtained 39 MP seats in the 2004 election.",
    "Anura  contested in the Kurunegala district on the UPFA ticket. He was elected with 153,868 preference votes. When President Kumaratunga formed the cabinet, four portfolios were allocated to the JVP. Anura  was appointed as the cabinet minister of Agriculture,Livestock,Land and Irrigation.",
    "Unfortunately matters took a different turn. Anura\u2019s ministerial duties came to an abrupt end. Dissanayake along with other JVP colleagues in the UPFA Govt resigned their posts. All 39 MP\u2019s of the JVP quit the Govt.",
    "As years progressed,the JVP began losing its vigour and vitality.It was becoming increasingly clear that the JVP required a new sense of direction under a fresh leader if it were to survive as a political force.The veteran leader Somawansa Amersinghe realized that he needed to step down and began dropping hints that he would retire soon. The question was who would succeed him.",
    "The JVP\u2019s 17th national convention was held on 2 February 2014. Somawansa stepped down as leader and proposed that Anura Kumara Dissanayake replace him. It was approved unanimously. Somawansa had appreciated the potential in Anura years ago and had groomed him as his successor.A. K. Dissanayake became the JVP\u2019s fifth leader ten years ago in  February 2014.",
    "The August 2015 election was the first Parliamentary election faced by the JVP after  Anura donned the mantle of  leadership. The JVP contested in all electoral districts and polled 543,944 (4.87) votes. This entitled the JVP to six MPs ,four elected and two on the national list. Anura himself contested from the Colombo district and won with 65,966 preference votes.The JVP remained in the opposition along with the Tamil National Alliance(TNA). TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan became leader of the opposition while  JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake became the chief whip of the opposition.",
    "When local authority polls were held in February 2018, the JVP  contested. The party polled 693,875(6.27%) votes with 431 members being elected to various local bodies. The JVP failed to capture power in a single local authority.",
    "The relatively poor performances of the JVP in the 2015 Parliamentary elections and the 2018 local authority polls led to much introspection within the party. The JVP\u2019s public meetings and mass rallies were well attended. The crowds appeared to be supportive. Yet at voting time, the JVP finished a poor third. It was as if the JVP was doomed to be a fringe party eternally with the consolation prize of being described as the third force in Sri Lankan politics by the media.",
    "After protracted consultations with external elements and prolonged internal discussions the JVP resolved to form a broad alliance or front. The JVP would remain the pivotal power in that alliance and maintain it\u2019s position of pre-eminence. Overtly the JVP would be the first among equals (Primus Inter Pares)in the new set up. Covertly the JVP would be in control. In a sense it would be old wine in a new bottle",
    "And so the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) or National People\u2019s Power (NPP)was born. On 13 July 2019 , hundreds of political activists  converged at the BMICH in Colombo. The National Peoples Power (NPP) known in Tamil as the Thesiya Makkal Sakthi(TMS) was formally launched  following a motion proposed by Anura Dissanayake and seconded by Tilvin Silva.",
    "JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was elected as leader of the NPP also.The NPP general secretary was Dr.Nihal Abeysinghe. Dr.Harini Amarasuriya and Lal Wijenayake were the deputy secretaries. The treasurer was Eranga Gunasekara.",
    "The JVP led NPP had its electoral baptism in the presidential election of November 2019. Anura Kumara Dissanayake contested the presidential elections for the first time. The NPP symbol was the compass. Anura came third polling only 418,563 (3.15%) votes.",
    "Ten months later came the 2020 Parliamentary elections. The NPP led by AK Dissanayake contested in all the electoral districts. Again it was a big blow for the JVP led NPP. The compass was able to garner only 445,958 (3.84%)votes.  The NPP got only three seats  with two elected MPs and one on the national list. AK Dissanayake won in Colombo with 49,814 preferences.",
    "The JVP experiment of contesting as the NPP had not yielded the expected results. An  influential group of stalwarts within the JVP felt the NPP stratagem was a failure. They wanted the JVP to revert to its former status and not be tied down to the NPP. Anura however disagreed.He pointed out that the NPP was only a year old and some more time was necessary to pass judgement on whether the strategic change was a success or failure. He urged that they continue for some more time with the NPP. Anura also said that they had to promote the NPP concept in a bigger way in the future. AKD won the day. The JVP resolved to continue as the NPP.",
    "Meanwhile the country underwent the unprecedented experience of the \u201cAragalaya\u201d(struggle). The NPP too tapped into the popular anger against the ruling regime in general and the Rajapaksas in particular.  Ultimately the Rajapaksas were ousted from power.",
    "Anura  made an incisive analysis of the changed situation with the aid of pro-JVP academics,analysts and opinion makers. He recognized that the people in general and youths in particular were yearning for a change. Some called it a system change. None seemed sure or clear about what this change was likely to be. The JVP/NPP led by AKD defined this change as a change of those in power from the presidency to Parliament.",
    "The JVP-NPP felt the situation was ideal for political advancement by aiming for the presidency in a big way. Once again Anura was determined that the NPP should go it alone.. It was a foregone conclusion that AKD would be the NPP presidential candidate.",
    "Thereafter the NPP geared itself up for the 2024 presidential election. The JVP led NPP began to assiduously promote Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s presidential candidacy .Anura  refurbished his image and re-invented the political approach of his party.",
    "This enabled Anura to spearhead a commendable political renaissance of the JVP led NPP. As is well known , Anura Kumara Dissanayake finished first in the presidential election held on 24 September 2024. AKD polled 5,634,915(42.31%) votes on the first count and 5,740,179(55.89%) on the second count. It was truly a famous victory!",
    "The Presidential election victory has now been followed by the Parliamentary Triumph. With a two-thirds majority backing him  in Parliament, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has the strength and power to deliver on his election promises and pledges. The  Sri Lankan nation salutes Anura  and wishes him all success.",
