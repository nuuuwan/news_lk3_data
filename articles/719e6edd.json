    "SINGAPORE (S&P Global Ratings) Sept. 24, 2025 \u2014 Asia-Pacific\u2019s credit conditions are keeping steady, after strong first-half growth and supportive financing conditions. However, the road ahead looks bumpy. That\u2019s according to a report S&P Global Ratings published today, titled \u201cCredit Conditions Asia-Pacific Q4 2025: On A Jagged Course.\u201d",
    "The \u201cfrontloading\u201d of exports and resilient domestic consumption have supported the region\u2019s growth in 2025. However, slower trade will start materializing in fourth-quarter 2025 as effects of tariffs start to unfold. Consequently, we expect Asia-Pacific\u2019s growth to slow to 4.4% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026.",
    "This combined with other risks could lead to reversals in market sanguinity and easy financing conditions.",
    "\u201cAbundant liquidity, narrowing spreads, and steady yields have desensitized markets to tail risks. Should shock events occur, a significant correction may occur in asset prices such as bonds, equity, and real estate,\u201d said Eunice Tan, head of Asia-Pacific credit research at S&P Global Ratings.",
    "China\u2019s growth is squeezed on both sides. Externally, high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will limit export competitiveness. At home, the sticky property crisis is weighing on households while \u201cinvolution\u201d\u2013cut-throat price competition\u2013is squeezing corporate margins in some consumer-facing niches. More policy stimulus may be needed to restore confidence and support economic growth.",
    "Meanwhile, the weak U.S. dollar is giving central banks in Asia-Pacific more wiggle room on monetary policy.",
    "\u201cFinancing conditions will likely benefit from the Federal Reserve\u2019s more dovish stance around interest rates,\u201d said Ms. Tan. \u201cThe reduction in interest burdens will alleviate cash flow strains, and cheaper mortgages should free up disposable income for consumption. This provides relief for heavily indebted borrowers.\u201d",
    "Still, we view trade-related risks as very high, given the region\u2019s large export-focused manufacturing bases. While a few deals with the U.S. have been struck, providing a bit more visibility, details remain vague. Furthermore, new tariffs could be imposed on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor sectors. Limited clarity around trade policy will prompt manufacturers to slow capital expenditure, constraining growth.",
    "\u201cMarkets and credit conditions could turn if trade or other macro risks worsen,\u201d said Ms. Tan.",
    "Please join S&P Global Ratings\u2019 analysts and economists to explore our latest research on global credit conditions at our live interactive webinar on Thursday, Oct. 9, where they will cover our updated macroeconomic forecasts, key risks to credit conditions, and credit trends at the industry level for Asia-Pacific.",
