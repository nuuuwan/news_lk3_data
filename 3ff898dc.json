    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A number of middle-income countries which are under debt stress should be helped to overcome the situation before they default, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.",
    "\u2026[W]e should deal with the issues of middle-income countries because most are under stress,\u201d President Wickremesinghe told a global f",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s better to deal with them under stress than when they are bankrupt. So that process has to evolve.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka and several the countries in Asian and Africa also loaded up on international sovereign bonds over the past decade as ultra-low US interest rates triggered yield chase and China also shifted some of its low yielding reserves to a Mercantilist belt and road project.",
    "A so-called common framework for low income countries also had not progressed fast enough, partly due to China, a new entrant to bilateral lending, not working in tandem with the seasoned Paris Club which has a ready-made debt workout framework.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that a binding framework like the common framework would have rendered the process quicker or more efficient,\u201d  The approach for a middle-income country would be to move. If you have a common framework, what happens is we move as fast as the slowest creditor.",
    "\u201cSo we get tied down. So that\u2019s why we are not in favor of a common framework.",
    "\u201cWe were able to create traction with the most committed creditors, raising the general quality and efficiency of the process. Because we are still frustrated by the lack of process.\u201d",
    "The tensions between the US and China also had be resolved to speed up debt restructuring.",
    "\u201cThe mistrust between the US and China and the growing tension, has to be addressed by all, not merely by Sri Lanka or the country concerned,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIf you do not resolve it, I think we will still, in Asia and Africa, we will get caught into another situation, not of our making.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka which had survived a 30-year, defaulted in 2022 after 10 years dual anchor conflicting monetary regime (flexible inflation targeting/flexible exchange rate) where money is printed to target a domestic inflation target with rate cuts triggering forex shortages.",
    "To this conflicting money and exchange policy framework a toxic output gap targeting exercise (stimulus) was added.",
    "In South Asia itself Pakistan is also under stress, though there are no near term bonds maturing and Bangladesh is also in the midst of external trouble after cutting rates as the economy recovered from a Coronavirus pandemic."
