    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Andrea Marr, who now resides in Australia, and an accomplished Blues singer, is in the States, at the moment\u2026preparing to be a part of the Women in Blues showcase, scheduled for 9th January, in Memphis.",
    "Says Andrea: \u201cI\u2019m in Memphis now, home of the Blues and the place that truly holds my musical heart. 2025 is certainly starting off with excitement and adventure.",
    "\u201cYep, very nervous to come and do the Women in Blues showcase without my band and with no rehearsal, but the house band is filled with monster female musicians and I think we can present something pretty great! Exciting times, indeed!\u201d",
    "Before her departure from Melbourne to Memphis, Andrea had this to say:",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s almost Memphis time! I can\u2019t wait to walk those streets again, hear those beautiful southern voices, immerse myself in the home of Blues and Soul and marvel at the fact that I get to sing my own songs in Memphis again.",
    "\u201cWhen I was seven, I fell in love with Elvis and Memphis and to me the pinnacle of success was to sing my songs there and be welcomed by them and that happened, for the first time, in 2006, when I first sang at BB Kings on Beale. Since then I\u2019ve sung at about eight venues on Beale Street.",
    "\u201cDreams really do come true. Wish me luck! 9th January I\u2019ll be at Alfred\u2019s on Beale.\u201d",
